1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,160
Ding, ding, ding, it's the sound of the dinner bell

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
here at Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,960
That voice I believe is Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, I was just responding to the ding ding

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
of the dinner bell as I usually do.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm like Pavlov's dog when it comes to that bell.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,680
Well sure, when Mrs. Knott's is ringing that dinner bell,

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,640
all the lonely traveling salesmen

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,160
are coming in for a hot meal.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,740
Scott Garner here as well.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,200
Oh, I'm salivating from miles away.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
Ding ding.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,720
Quarantine would be very difficult for, you know,

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,480
the traveling salesman of the type that was probably happy

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,040
for the old Knott's chicken roadside stop, you know?

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,080
Right, a Willy Loman type would be really,

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,120
it'd be tough for him during quarantine.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
I mean, he was depressed already.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Yeah.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
But at least he was well-liked.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
He wasn't just liked, he was well-liked.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,160
Right.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,300
A traveling salesman might have no idea

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,400
that some such thing had broken out.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,440
Because he was on the road so often.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
That's true.

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,600
Unless he's checking the radio a lot,

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,760
but if he'd rather hear Glenn Miller instead,

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
who could blame him?

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Jason, was there ever a time in your life

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,960
when you thought maybe traveling salesman

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,000
is the career for me?

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
I don't, is there much in the way of traveling salesman?

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,640
I'll say this, I feel like half the people

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
I went to high school with now

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,880
list their occupation as medical device salesman.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,720
Yes.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,360
And I have no idea what that entails.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
I believe here.

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,680
I know a little tiny bit about this.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,360
I believe, and somebody correct me if I'm wrong,

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,160
I believe they find a nice, personable, attractive person

45
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
that goes around to doctor's offices

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,320
and sells medical equipment.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,380
Or I think a similar job is drug spokesman.

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,700
So they get them to get a notepad

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,560
with a type of drug on it,

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
and then the doctor is more apt to prescribe

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,060
that type of drug to their patients.

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,260
I believe that's what this is sort of like.

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,460
So I guess maybe that's more the modern equivalent

54
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,220
of what a traveling salesman would do,

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,720
but it's only a local.

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
You only visit doctor's offices locally.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,300
But they have to be kind of a charmer,

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,380
a looker, like a prices right model?

59
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,620
I believe yes.

60
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,740
That's a good way to put it.

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,620
I think that's sort of the idea.

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,820
I think you can, human beings aren't that sophisticated

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,980
even as much as we'd like to think we are.

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,580
This could all be yours.

65
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,900
Yeah, I think it's, yes, you wear like a red dress

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,440
and you put the different drugs

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
and medical equipment behind curtains.

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,420
And it'd be nice if it was sparkly too,

69
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,980
because the doctor's offices have those fluorescent lights.

70
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,660
So really get those sparkling against that gown.

71
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,900
And then I think they're just sort of mesmerized

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,540
by the whole presentation.

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
But yeah.

74
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,540
Blind them with elegance.

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,020
That's the way to a doctor's heart.

76
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,560
Blind them with elegance.

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,460
It's a famous phrase, yes.

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,300
In the medical community.

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,740
When I'm asking Jason about traveling,

80
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,860
I'm expecting, I'm more thinking like,

81
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,500
vacuum cleaner salesman door to door.

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,780
That's the type of thing I was thinking.

83
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,900
Because it seems like an old timey profession.

84
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,260
And one that you would feel like kind of puts you back

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,240
in sort of a classic time period.

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,180
That's the only reason I ask.

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,980
I don't mind.

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm sure it gets lonely on the road sometimes.

89
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,300
And I do like hotels, but here in LA,

90
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,940
we have a lot of decrepit looking stores

91
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,020
that say vacuum cleaner repairs.

92
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,700
Have you guys ever come across these places,

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,120
like vacuum cleaner repair shops

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,220
that look like they've been there for decades?

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,620
I've seen one or two.

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,140
The first thing that comes to mind, of course,

97
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,500
is the front for Robert Forrester's disappearing business

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,980
in the Breaking Bad universe.

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,900
That's true.

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah.

101
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,580
We have to assume all of them now are disappearing businesses.

102
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,780
So yeah, that's sort of what I think of now

103
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
when I see those places.

104
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,820
But I don't feel like I see them that frequently.

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,080
But there's one or two I can imagine.

106
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah.

107
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Anyway, I guess we should mention,

108
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,260
so we're talking about the Knott's,

109
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,780
how do, what are the words?

110
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,380
The Knott's Chicken Dinner curbside pickup today.

111
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,940
We're reviving, finally.

112
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
Which we did.

113
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
Finally.

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,460
Finally.

115
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,780
Yeah, why are we talking about you

116
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,820
being a traveling salesman?

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,900
Your job is cub reporter.

118
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,740
That's right.

119
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,180
You went out, hit the streets

120
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,620
for one of the biggest stories

121
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,340
in the theme park world right now.

122
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,740
Specifically, I did it.

123
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,980
I went to Knott's and got the chicken.

124
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,900
I was the sole one to do it.

125
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
In a very funny fashion.

126
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,740
That's correct.

127
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,740
So I think a few weeks ago they announced

128
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,020
that Knott's was gonna start doing takeaway

129
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,740
chicken and biscuits and boysenberry pies.

130
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
And I think it was my-

131
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,260
From their famous chicken dinner restaurant

132
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,020
outside the park that predated the theme park

133
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,500
that's been there since the 1930s.

134
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,700
And the whole history of Knott's is that

135
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,740
so many people were lining up to get the chicken dinners.

136
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,980
We better give them something to do.

137
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,540
What if we put up this old wagon or this horse cart?

138
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,860
And then it became a ghost town.

139
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,660
And then they put in rides and all of Knott's Berry Farm

140
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,860
grew out of this chicken dinner restaurant.

141
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,580
Yes.

142
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,100
And a few weeks ago they announced

143
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
they were gonna do this.

144
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,140
Mike joked we should do an episode about this.

145
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,420
I think we kind of laughed.

146
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,660
And then a couple, one week ago,

147
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,220
or 10 days ago or so, Scott said,

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,300
you know, that would be funny if we did that.

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,540
And I specifically remember where I was

150
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,860
when you said that, Scott,

151
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,460
because I was in the middle of the line

152
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,220
for a male functioning automatic car wash.

153
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,860
And-

154
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
Oh no.

155
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,980
What was wrong?

156
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,900
I was like,

157
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,220
like, what, we gotta go,

158
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,700
I gotta drive for chicken?

159
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,540
What?

160
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,340
And the car, is the car wash, what is going on?

161
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,500
I was literally panicking of like, oh no,

162
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,860
am I going to be stuck in this car wash line for an hour?

163
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Just because the whole thing was,

164
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,620
my car was just covered in pollen and bird shit

165
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,660
from not moving it for a while.

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,340
So I was like, well, I don't have to interact

167
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,380
with anyone at this car wash.

168
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,340
And then it all went downhill.

169
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,180
So like people getting out of their cars,

170
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,020
workers coming out of the building,

171
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,700
and eventually it was fine.

172
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
And you were in the middle of it?

173
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,220
I was in the middle of it as the episode planning started.

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,540
And I was like, oh my God, okay.

175
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,660
Be normal, be normal in the text message chain.

176
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,500
Don't stress out.

177
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,260
Wow, yeah, you showed no sign of this.

178
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,860
You didn't let the stress of this assignment show at all.

179
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,700
Wow, yeah.

180
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,180
I didn't want to be,

181
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,620
I did not want to come off as a maniac.

182
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
I didn't want to try to explain it.

183
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,940
I was like, no, I'll save this for the air.

184
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,420
How long were you in there?

185
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,820
I think I was there probably like half an hour

186
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,500
because eventually it started to go.

187
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And then like the person in front of me,

188
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,300
like whatever they ordered,

189
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,580
like the guy had to come out again

190
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,820
and like manually turn stuff on and on and wave.

191
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,100
And it was just a drive-in car wash

192
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,740
where you don't get out of the car.

193
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,980
Like, and then like the people behind me are like,

194
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,180
well, do you know what's going on?

195
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,780
And I'm like, no, I don't.

196
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,300
So you weren't in the actual washing thing.

197
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,020
You were just in a line.

198
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,620
No, I, yes, I was just in the line,

199
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,220
but it was like a walled off like queue,

200
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,420
like car, so there was no way I could get out of the line

201
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,260
unless people started moving.

202
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,100
So. Right.

203
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,780
Can I ask what, which of the,

204
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,460
usually there's three options at these car washes.

205
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,660
Which are the three, the lowest one,

206
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,420
the medium one or the top one?

207
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,660
Oh, the lowest.

208
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,180
Okay.

209
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,820
It's like six. I'm with you there.

210
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,620
I don't understand the,

211
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,700
as much as I'd like to make a Jason is cheap joke,

212
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,900
I think that lowest one is,

213
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,780
what are you getting for those extra polishes?

214
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, that is a good question.

215
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,780
I don't really know the answer to it,

216
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,220
but I just, I, last time I did one of these things,

217
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,820
I was like, well, let me see what happens

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,540
when you do $8 instead of $6.

219
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,380
And I. Did you tell anything?

220
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,220
I couldn't.

221
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm not sure.

222
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,460
Somebody, maybe somebody can explain to us.

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
So one of the listeners can explain to us

224
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,740
what the difference is, but it's like,

225
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,060
they spray like an extra thing on the car,

226
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,420
but then like it doesn't,

227
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,820
the car doesn't get dried off usually by those fans they have.

228
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,740
So the whole thing is a little like

229
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,780
water spotted afterward anyway.

230
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
Yeah.

231
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,700
I've told you guys, right.

232
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,780
That my, about when my dad was in a news report

233
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,100
about this subject.

234
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,420
No, I don't think so.

235
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
No.

236
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,100
Am I not?

237
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,540
I gotta, boy, I'll try to find this and put this online

238
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,380
if I can.

239
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,620
There's a tape of it somewhere.

240
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,060
He, my dad came home from work so proud one day,

241
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,460
just beaming.

242
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,100
And we're like, what's going on?

243
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
And he's like, you'll see at six.

244
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
And then we put on the news and watched the whole news.

245
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,460
And it was deep into the news and we didn't know why.

246
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,180
And then it was a story about how they, you know,

247
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,940
they pay, they charge you a certain amount for the car wash,

248
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,540
but they don't dry the car.

249
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,460
What you just said, it's an upgrade

250
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,700
that they don't really tell you to get the cars dry.

251
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,300
And so there's a whole news story that's shots of cars

252
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,660
and like cars soaking wet as far as the ice can sit.

253
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,460
Like this real like local business buster episode.

254
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,740
And then it cuts to my dad for two seconds.

255
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,900
And he says, I think I'm getting ripped off.

256
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,540
And then he was just, just beaming,

257
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,020
just like heaven's light was on him.

258
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,380
He was so happy.

259
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,060
He was on the news.

260
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,700
And then he, but what was funny about it

261
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,860
was that it was the car wash, the gas station,

262
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,820
he always goes to, and then he, and he knows the owner

263
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,260
and he's friendly with the owner.

264
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,860
And then when it was over, he went up and just like,

265
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,460
Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sell you out, man.

266
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,180
I just wanted to be on the news.

267
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,500
The guy's like, I understand.

268
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340
I get it.

269
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,700
Did he really think he was being ripped off

270
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,020
or he just did it for the cameras?

271
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,940
I don't think he really cared.

272
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,860
I mean, well, he was as annoyed as you were just now

273
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,140
where you're like, it costs extra to dry it off.

274
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,060
But you could never be more angry than that for real.

275
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,500
It's not like $50.

276
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,220
This is one of the greatest moments of my childhood.

277
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,500
Wow, you got to find this.

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,340
Yeah, yeah, I'll try it.

279
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,820
I think there's a tape somewhere.

280
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,540
Dad on the news.

281
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,740
It must be hand labeled.

282
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,300
I think, my mom was on the news once

283
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,380
and it was like thrilling.

284
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,660
I think I was like, she was holding one of us or something

285
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,980
and there's a tape of it somewhere.

286
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Whoa.

287
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,900
I can't remember what it's about though.

288
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,180
I think it's, she's like, yeah,

289
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,100
it's some public affairs situation.

290
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,500
Yeah.

291
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,060
Can I point out one thing?

292
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh, go ahead, Jason.

293
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,980
Oh, I was going to say the, like,

294
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,740
the you're being ripped off, like investigative team

295
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,020
are pretty aggressive at the LA affiliate.

296
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,740
So I can't even imagine what they were like in the 90s.

297
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,580
Oh yeah, yeah.

298
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,380
That's as sensational as it gets.

299
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,220
Yeah.

300
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,460
Yeah, that's a big ratings magnet.

301
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,580
I was going to say, it's funny.

302
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,700
What have we talked about so far in this episode?

303
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,380
A vacuum repair shop, a car wash

304
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,260
and a fried chicken restaurant.

305
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,900
Everything we're talking about in this episode

306
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,780
is a Breaking Bad drug crime.

307
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
Oh yeah, you're right.

308
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,340
This is very odd.

309
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,940
The only thing left is fumigation business.

310
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,060
Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,340
Tinting of house.

312
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,420
And most of the way, at least I'm sure for you guys,

313
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,020
this is true and certainly for me,

314
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,820
most of the way I've interacted with commerce recently

315
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,740
has been I drive up somewhere

316
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,140
and someone tosses something in my trunk

317
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,980
or a box is dropped on my doorstep.

318
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,020
And I say thank you and wave to the person from a distance.

319
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,460
And anything beyond that would require a hazmat suit.

320
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes, which look, I am, if I can get the break,

321
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,620
I've said this before, if I can get the Breaking Bad

322
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,300
hazmat suit or something better,

323
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,740
I will go to the opening of a Six Flags.

324
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,180
I am on record.

325
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,700
Jason is going to Disneyland

326
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,500
with no hazmat suit,

327
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,940
but I need a hazmat suit of some kind to go to a Six Flags.

328
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,660
Well, this was an experience.

329
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,740
I mean, I'll say this.

330
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,420
It all went very smooth.

331
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,100
I'll ruin that.

332
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,900
This all went very smooth, but going anywhere,

333
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
like going any kind of pickup,

334
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,380
driving anywhere more than like five minutes

335
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,460
is stressful during this time, I feel like.

336
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,900
Because this is like a, what, a 45 minute drive for you?

337
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,820
Yeah, I mean, the traffic wasn't bad either way.

338
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,220
So it was about 40, 45 minutes.

339
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,060
So that was good.

340
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,740
There's less cars on the road.

341
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,020
Did you find the driving stressful?

342
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,420
Because I find actually when I have an excuse,

343
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,380
because I, a couple of weeks prior to this,

344
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,180
did not know we were doing this episode,

345
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,180
did drive down to Buena Park to go to Portillo's.

346
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,060
Oh, you did this.

347
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,380
I thought maybe this was a future.

348
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,820
No, I did.

349
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,100
Well, it might still be a future plan.

350
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,140
Oh yes, always.

351
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,660
And I did find driving down on the five,

352
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,260
a drive to Anaheim, which I've done a couple hundred times,

353
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,700
I think at this point.

354
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,500
I did find it a little calming.

355
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,100
I found it nice,

356
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,380
because it felt a little bit more like my normal life.

357
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,500
Yeah, I was going to say,

358
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,940
living vicariously through Jason with this experience,

359
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,140
I really miss driving down Beach Boulevard

360
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,180
and doing that Veer Rite

361
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,220
that takes you into the Knott's Berry Farm property.

362
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,900
Because the way they bring you onto that property,

363
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,500
you pass by all the folksy businesses,

364
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,780
the little marketplace on the outside.

365
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,740
And I know if I'm veering right on beach and parking at Knott's,

366
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm going to have a nice day.

367
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm either going to go have a good beer

368
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,020
at that chicken dinner restaurant bar,

369
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,900
or I'm going to go on some rides.

370
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,420
Something fun is going to happen.

371
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
And I really miss doing it.

372
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,620
So I hope it felt nice for you to do it.

373
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,940
Well, let me burst your bubble immediately.

374
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,460
All of that entrance is barricaded off.

375
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh, well that takes it all away then.

376
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,940
Yeah, who needs it?

377
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,980
Which way do you come in then?

378
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,180
So what you do, okay.

379
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,900
So you, and I was trying to do that too.

380
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,820
I was trying to do that as close to that as I did too.

381
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,740
But the maps auto adjusted on the drive down

382
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,140
and put me out on Crescent.

383
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,060
And you have to get to Crescent Avenue,

384
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,740
which is the road that runs in front of the hotel.

385
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,580
Right.

386
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,780
So you go down Crescent and you turn,

387
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,260
there's driveways right before the hotel

388
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,300
that takes you into the marketplace parking lot.

389
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,500
So that was one of the pluses I'll say about this.

390
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,620
They're not charging you to park for any of this.

391
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,140
So what Knott has right now.

392
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,100
Yeah, that's good.

393
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
That'd be weird, yeah.

394
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,940
City Walk in Orlando I found out.

395
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,900
Like City Walk in Orlando of course open partially now.

396
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,260
They are not charging for parking either.

397
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,500
So small miracles I guess.

398
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
Oh, what?

399
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,900
This is a sea change in the industry.

400
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,980
Did you not know that?

401
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,820
I didn't know that.

402
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,260
I didn't, whoa, big news.

403
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,260
I mean, only like a fifth of the businesses are open.

404
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,260
So I feel like while trying to cut down on contact

405
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,540
but apparently a lot of the stores are taking cash.

406
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,900
So there's still.

407
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,260
Well, there's a lot to be desired

408
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,980
about how they're doing it down there

409
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,500
because we were all texting each other

410
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,380
photos of people in line for that okay pizza restaurant.

411
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,780
And many of the people are not wearing masks

412
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,340
and they certainly are not six feet apart.

413
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,180
So it was certainly a bummer

414
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,940
that I feel like the guy doing the story

415
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,580
that my dad was in.

416
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,980
Crowds of people, not a mask in sight.

417
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,420
Six feet apart, not here.

418
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,740
Can you do a parody of your, post your dad's video

419
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,620
then do a parody of that video with you

420
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,300
and post the photos of the City Walk Orlando.

421
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,860
People are, I'm trying to contextualize what he said

422
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,980
because I wanna put his clip in it.

423
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,580
I think I'm getting ripped off.

424
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,780
And by that he means because he might perish

425
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,860
due to the terrible illness.

426
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,980
He'll get less life due to being at City Walk.

427
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,380
You can re-contextualize that, yeah.

428
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,500
I think I segued it pretty smooth just now.

430
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,540
Yeah.

431
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,140
Anyway, yeah, a bit of a bummer.

432
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,500
Could you bring that up though?

433
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,260
Because as I, so when we were discussing this,

434
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,260
like I placed the order a few days later

435
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,180
and that weekend was when they reopened the,

436
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,580
like the marketplace, like general store kind of shop

437
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,740
and the bakery and the chicken restaurant.

438
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,340
So you could go in and order and do takeout.

439
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,860
And the first day they did that,

440
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,100
there were 300 people there.

441
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,380
And I was like, oh no, what have I signed up for?

442
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,460
I'm happy to say that was not the case

443
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
at 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon.

444
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,500
Pretty empty.

445
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,900
And my initial plan was to just pull up,

446
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,900
have them throw it in the trunk and drive away.

447
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,860
But because it was so empty

448
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,420
and the parking lot was so chill,

449
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,220
I was like, well, I'll get out and walk around.

450
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,020
So we had driven down, I mean, we kind of made it like me

451
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,980
and my girlfriend, Jane and her dog Garfield got in the car

452
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,620
and went for the drive down to Buena Park.

453
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,260
And the dog came along.

454
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,540
The dog came, yes, I took a photo.

455
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,900
I'll post it on the, for the show art of me holding a dog

456
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,180
in front of a roller coaster, which was thrilling.

457
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,740
I was like, oh, I don't have a photo of a dog

458
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,900
next to our roller coaster.

459
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,060
This will be fun.

460
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,460
That's more interesting than anything anyone has done

461
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,500
in the last two months.

462
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,140
You have the most interesting life by virtue of that.

463
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,780
If anyone listening to this, including us.

464
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,540
And I walked around, like the pathways were all,

465
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,380
it was all empty.

466
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,860
It was pretty much not, there was me,

467
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,460
I maybe came across like 10 people, 12 people here and there.

468
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,020
People were wandering inside.

469
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,700
They had the social distancing markers.

470
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,300
The workers were all very nice, you know.

471
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,060
And so I just kind of walked around.

472
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
I didn't go any in any of those shops

473
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,020
because frankly the not shops are kind of close quarters

474
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,340
to begin with, let alone quarantine.

475
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,780
Like I'm fine, I have found that like,

476
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,180
that is my thing with quarantine.

477
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,060
Like I don't mind going in Ralph's or Target

478
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,060
every now and then, but like Trader Joe's is really tight.

479
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,300
Like those stores are very small.

480
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,180
Yeah, typically.

481
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,300
Is the sauna like green, the greenhouse room open?

482
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,100
By the bathrooms.

483
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,980
I couldn't, I don't think so.

484
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,460
And the only bathrooms that were open,

485
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,900
I went back and looked, I asked them,

486
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,300
are bathrooms open?

487
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,540
And they're like, oh, the ones behind the Build-A-Bear,

488
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,020
the unopened, incomplete Build-A-Bear.

489
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,340
You're practically in the park gates at that point.

490
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,780
But those bathrooms were open

491
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,860
and looked and seemed very clean.

492
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,420
Do you think, Scott, how would you describe

493
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,860
that room I'm talking about?

494
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,420
Yeah, there's this, yeah, if you go in the stores

495
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,820
outside of Knott's, there's this one bathroom,

496
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,660
here's women's, here's men's, and then right in the middle,

497
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,420
there's this big like viney plant structure.

498
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,460
And as soon as you open the door to this place,

499
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,180
it's the most humid room you've ever been in.

500
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,380
And the glare of the sun is so bright.

501
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
And with the big plant there,

502
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,220
it just feels like a greenhouse.

503
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,580
You're in a very humid greenhouse.

504
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,420
Yes.

505
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,460
Just for this like 20 square foot area, it's so bizarre.

506
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,860
And it's next to like a little old colonial,

507
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,900
like, facsimile room.

508
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,620
It's next to like a recreation

509
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,260
of George Washington's mantle or something.

510
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,420
Forgive me, I don't recall precisely what it is,

511
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,820
but it's something mundane like that.

512
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,500
But I was wondering, do you think that room

513
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,020
is like good to heal COVID or kill it,

514
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,380
or is it a COVID breeding ground?

515
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,340
God, I'm not sure.

516
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,180
I don't know.

517
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Have we looked into,

518
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,660
are we using the Knott's Greenhouse bathrooms?

519
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,900
Folks, this could inject some of the humidity.

520
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,340
Folks, we're looking into it.

521
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,740
We're gonna use Legionnaire's disease to fight the COVID,

522
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,540
to fight the novel coronavirus.

523
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,860
The two diseases they fight, they get in a little war,

524
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,860
and the Legionnaire's bashes the COVID's brains out.

525
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,780
And then you have Legionnaire's but it can't.

526
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,780
The Legionnaire's disease gets

527
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,580
the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

528
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,980
He would give that, I mean, honestly,

529
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,100
he would give Legionnaire's disease some sort of a medal

530
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,820
before any of this too, so.

531
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
Oh yeah.

532
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
He's a, he's.

533
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,300
My little micro warriors.

534
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,460
He's giving most of the diseases.

535
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
The Legion's.

536
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,380
Proud of the Legionnaires, proud of the little guys.

537
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,140
Legionnaires and their marvelous disease.

538
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,500
So this is Gallo's humor, folks.

539
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,500
This is it, folks.

540
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
We're having fun.

541
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,860
It's a good way to describe it.

542
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,540
We're trying to, we're having fun.

543
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,060
It's like the Capitol steps in here.

544
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,060
We are like the Capitol steps today.

545
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,980
So you're walking around a little,

546
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,780
but you don't wanna be in these close quarter restaurants,

547
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,460
or, or stores rather,

548
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,660
and there's a couple little pickup plates.

549
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,900
You could go buy like a pastry or a bear claw

550
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,460
if you wanted to, correct?

551
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,700
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,420
They had, yeah, they had options

553
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,220
and they had stuff to get takeout.

554
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,580
I had, so what, the thing we were like interested in

555
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,340
was the curbside takeaway.

556
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,380
So I already ordered it and prepaid it.

557
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,660
So I, all they had to do was get back in the car

558
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,980
and pull up.

559
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,940
They have a bunch of numbered parking spots,

560
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,900
which I think now is just like curbside

561
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,500
for the marketplace stuff for like dry goods.

562
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,580
And then I actually pulled,

563
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,220
it was a very tight spot.

564
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,500
Like they're like, there were people who wave you in

565
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,620
and tell you where to go.

566
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,060
And then there's more people who tell you where to go

567
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,780
if you were doing like the food pickup.

568
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,500
And so I pulled around behind the TGI Fridays

569
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,940
and the peanuts, like the peanuts store.

570
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,460
And there was just like tables and tents set up

571
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,620
with like bags of food orders.

572
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,820
So it's very thrilling to be-

573
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,660
Ready to go.

574
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,900
Yeah, everything ready to go.

575
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,260
And they like just scanned the barcode.

576
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,540
I mean, I put the window down and they just scanned

577
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,660
like QR codes on my phone for each like item.

578
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,340
So I was in it for like the actual food pickup.

579
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,900
Like you could be in and out in like a few minutes.

580
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,860
Again, it might be more busy on the weekends,

581
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,620
but everything was very smooth.

582
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,540
I mean, I always find the service very good

583
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,460
at nots to begin with, but like, yeah, everyone,

584
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,660
everyone seemed in good spirits and lots of masks

585
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,300
and gloves and yes, lots of that.

586
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,420
Great, great.

587
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,620
This is wonderful.

588
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,340
I'm glad it was an easy, smooth experience,

589
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,340
but you know, we've all been probably craving theme park

590
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,100
food and especially treats for a while.

591
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,020
So you got to tell us what that order is

592
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,220
and how it held up.

593
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,940
Okay, so here was the order.

594
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,620
So when we were first looking at the menu,

595
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,460
it was like, well, should we each just get a meal?

596
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,140
And that was like $11, $12.

597
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,900
And I was like, I think it just makes more sense

598
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,580
to get the family, like the, you know, the bulk.

599
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,180
When you order fried chicken and it just makes sense

600
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,020
to get the meal.

601
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,220
If it's more than one person,

602
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,300
it just makes sense to get the bucket.

603
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,300
So we got a nine piece chicken bucket meal, nine pieces,

604
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,660
which came with six biscuits and boysenberry preserves,

605
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,420
two things of mashed potatoes and a thing of corn.

606
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,140
I added on one boysenberry pie and one chocolate bundt cake.

607
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,980
Nice.

608
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,820
Nice.

609
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,660
Yeah.

610
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,660
So I mean, I'll talk through, I'll get to the dessert second.

611
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,660
All in all that came out to 5164.

612
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,660
Okay.

613
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,500
That's a lot of that's a lot.

614
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,260
It's kind of a feast for that 50 bucks.

615
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,460
It was kind of a feast.

616
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,620
So here's how it broke down.

617
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,020
I mean, I had only ever been to Mrs. Knott's once

618
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,340
for your birthday a few years ago, Scott.

619
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
Oh yes.

620
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,020
Yeah.

621
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,860
33rd.

622
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,700
Yes.

623
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,300
And I thought it was, it was pretty good.

624
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,620
I thought the food was pretty good.

625
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,300
We were there, we went on a Sunday.

626
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,940
So it was kind of like you're ordering platters.

627
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,700
Like you don't have a choice.

628
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,540
You can't order a la carte.

629
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,380
Oh yes.

630
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,740
They limit the choices.

631
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,580
Yeah.

632
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,300
This is a question I've had in general.

633
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm always so happy to be there when I'm there.

634
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,340
And that was wonderful.

635
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,940
So many great friends came and I was like,

636
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,340
my friends came and hung out.

637
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,260
So I was in a great mood.

638
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,140
But so now I'm like, it's like nostalgia

639
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,380
where it's too muddy for me.

640
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,500
I don't know if the food is good.

641
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
I couldn't give you an honest answer

642
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,660
because I'm just so happy always to be there.

643
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,340
So I don't know.

644
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,860
I honestly don't know.

645
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,700
Yeah.

646
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,660
I under percent understand that.

647
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,060
I certainly have places like that too.

648
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,660
I will say, so overall,

649
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,620
I thought the food, everything was good

650
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,260
with some real standouts

651
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,420
and some very confusing disappointments.

652
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
The biscuits were good.

653
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,580
I liked their biscuits.

654
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,260
They do a nice biscuit.

655
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,900
I ate one moments before we started recording

656
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,500
after I had my late breakfast slice of pie.

657
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
So the biscuits were good.

658
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,380
The preserves were good.

659
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,340
They were a little warm.

660
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,180
The chicken, I think-

661
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,020
Was that a wait?

662
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,860
Sorry, wait, wait, wait, hang on.

663
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,460
Was that all you had for breakfast was the slice of pie?

664
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,380
Coffee, coffee and water.

665
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,140
But no bananas.

666
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,980
No bananas.

667
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,820
No bananas.

668
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,820
No, just the delicious American made boysenberry

669
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,900
made in a lab of rent.

670
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,740
American made.

671
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,780
Grown, American made.

672
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,180
The president would be a fan of that.

673
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,020
Sure.

674
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,100
And we know the nots love the presidents.

675
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,820
Just the sheer concept.

676
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,660
That's true.

677
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,580
The biscuits were good.

678
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,180
There was a split second where I thought they forgot them.

679
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
And then I found them,

680
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,500
they were sitting on top of the chicken in the bucket.

681
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,100
And I was like, oh, thank God.

682
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,460
Cause I was not, not driving back to way to park for them.

683
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,620
Even I have my limits.

684
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,700
But would you have maybe driven back to get them?

685
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,420
I might've complained.

686
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,980
I might've complained to get like $5 back or something.

687
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,060
But yeah, the biscuits were good.

688
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,260
The chicken is pretty good.

689
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,380
I have to say just solely taking the chicken on its own.

690
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I think the chicken on Main Street at Disneyland is better.

691
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,300
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,460
I still have never done it.

693
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,420
It is never like, I don't end up in the mood for it.

694
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,460
When I met Disney and Erin's vegetarian.

695
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,140
So we're probably trying to find stuff for her.

696
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,620
I got, man, when someday when the park is open again,

697
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,420
I really got to do that fried chicken.

698
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,820
Yeah, I feel like I haven't done it in forever.

699
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,140
I feel like it's always good.

700
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,540
It's always reliable.

701
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,180
I mean, this chicken, I'll give it an extra few points

702
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,620
cause we did drive back from way to park and eat it.

703
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,340
So like, I wasn't expecting everything to be piping hot.

704
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,500
But fried chickens kind of-

705
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,780
Can I ask-

706
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
Yeah.

707
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
Oh, sorry.

708
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,460
I just, in general, fried chicken question.

709
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,660
I don't have it very often.

710
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Where am I getting good fried chicken,

711
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,860
especially in Los Angeles where we live?

712
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,780
I feel like it's few and far between.

713
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,940
I don't have it a lot.

714
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,980
But do you guys have a knee jerk

715
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,460
of if I want very good fried chicken,

716
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,300
where should I be going?

717
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,140
Oh, that's a question.

718
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,460
I mean, there's a place that's not too far from here

719
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,740
in Burbank that people like Gus's, which I think is okay.

720
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,860
But people really like it.

721
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,260
So maybe I don't know what I'm trying to taste.

722
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,660
People like Roscoe's.

723
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,140
Never done Roscoe's.

724
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,860
Which is pretty good.

725
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,380
I, of course, like Nashville hot chicken the best.

726
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,420
So the last few years, I am more steeped in where to get that.

727
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,060
And speaking of that, they,

728
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,100
Hall and Ray's just started offering Postmates yesterday.

729
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,300
And I had to drive somewhere to pick up a Postmate

730
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,140
when I got it yesterday.

731
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,020
Oh, you did do it.

732
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,260
Okay.

733
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,220
I did later in the, the thing was this place

734
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,860
in Los Angeles is so popular.

735
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,220
Normally you have to wait in line for an hour.

736
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,060
And the Postmates situation is just as popular.

737
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,220
So usually when you click on it,

738
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,300
it says they cannot fill any more orders.

739
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,140
But I woke up from a nap yesterday,

740
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,220
looked and it was available and placed an order

741
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,860
for my, one of my old apartments address in Hollywood,

742
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,220
which is the only radius they would deliver to

743
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,900
and drove down there to meet a Postmate

744
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,220
to get this chicken because it's so good.

745
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,940
And because, you know, you need a little pick me up

746
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,540
once in a while when you're stuck

747
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,700
in the apartment for months.

748
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
You sure do.

749
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,380
Hold on a second. Was it worth it?

750
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,220
Go ahead, Jason.

751
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,060
Wait a second.

752
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,820
You couldn't bring yourself to get to Waitapark to do this.

753
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,620
But you can bring yourself to do that very complicated

754
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,020
Postmates ordeal.

755
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,780
Well, it's not very complicated.

756
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,900
First of all, it's only a 10 minute drive.

757
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,540
The week, look, for reasons I won't explain on the air,

758
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,420
the week has been stressful.

759
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,460
It's been a stressful week.

760
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,300
Okay.

761
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,900
So, but so, so I figured, you know,

762
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I had not made an order for Waitapark.

763
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,780
I'll do this by the way, off air.

764
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,180
We don't even have to talk about it.

765
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,020
I want to drive back down to Waitapark.

766
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,100
Oh, that's fine.

767
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,180
But it was literally going to be like a 10 minute drive

768
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,100
to the pickup spot and then a 10 minute drive back,

769
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,580
which is what it basically was.

770
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,340
So I know we're hot.

771
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,740
I'm just teasing. I'm just teasing.

772
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,500
You could tease me. I'm not upset.

773
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,220
I could take it.

774
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,060
And me, I have a baby.

775
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,700
So I have an excuse out of everything forever.

776
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,540
That's true.

777
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,140
You have the best excuse.

778
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,940
So very jealous.

779
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,780
You never have to see.

780
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,620
It rules.

781
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,300
You would think that wouldn't get you out of a lot

782
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,780
these days, but you know,

783
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,740
people are still trying to put Zoom commitments

784
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,780
in front of you.

785
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,060
And I can avoid those left and right.

786
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
Yeah.

787
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
You got a baby.

788
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Thank you, son.

789
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,900
Do you think that-

790
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,740
What a gift you've given me already.

791
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,060
I thank the child every day for his, the excuse.

792
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,900
Just for that.

793
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,860
I mean, you're a beautiful, precious miracle as well.

794
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,060
But boy, the plans, get me out of the plans.

796
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,900
Thanks, buddy.

797
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,740
Yeah, we know.

798
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,260
So yeah, as far as hot chicken, I can tell you where to go,

799
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,500
but I'm not such a fried chicken expert.

800
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,260
Yeah, yeah.

801
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,780
I gotta get more versed.

802
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,300
I have to say, yeah, I have to agree.

803
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,580
The hot chicken craze is like,

804
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,300
even the like most okay hot chicken I've had,

805
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,220
the way it's cooked just keeps the chicken.

806
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,180
So moist and flavorful.

807
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,860
I just, I really do not like dry chicken.

808
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,980
So which was-

809
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,380
You guys are making me really hungry

810
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,740
for something that isn't in my freezer.

811
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,620
Yeah.

812
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,140
What a novelty that would be.

813
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,620
Yeah, I mean, look-

814
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,140
Something non-microwave.

815
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,100
There's a Dave's Hot Chicken just down the street from you.

816
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,420
But is that complicated?

817
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,260
Well, I've done it.

818
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,220
It's, there's a, they've, they've cut like basically

819
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,620
a window out of their like display on Lancashire.

820
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,020
So basically you place a pickup order online,

821
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,660
drive up there, park your car, hopefully sort of close by.

822
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,980
And then when there's no people around,

823
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,860
run up to the window and say your name

824
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,820
and they hand you the bag and you throw it in the car

825
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,420
and run away, drive away.

826
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,700
And really make sure you appeal out.

827
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,540
Yes.

828
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,360
Make sure you're really burning rubber.

829
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,860
Yes, really make a big show of it.

830
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
But yeah, you could get that, you can get that done,

831
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,700
an hour after we're off recording here.

832
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,220
Perhaps, perhaps so.

833
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,260
Let's, if you have more chicken thoughts, feel free.

834
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,660
But this, I mean, you're leaving the audience

835
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,900
hanging on over in Treat Town.

836
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,740
Yes.

837
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,340
Oh yeah, no, I know, it's common.

838
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,460
I do have more chicken thoughts.

839
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,060
One, the good stuff about the chicken was

840
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,780
it was supposed to be nine pieces and they gave us 12.

841
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,200
So I don't know what jackpot we hit there.

842
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,200
The mashed potatoes, they fucked up.

843
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
I don't know, they're dry.

844
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,480
They're weird, they're weirdly flaky.

845
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,040
But kind of redeemed by very good chicken gravy.

846
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,000
Now I am not a chicken gravy,

847
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,280
that is not one of my go-tos.

848
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,240
But it was very good.

849
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,620
So the chicken gravy redeemed the potatoes.

850
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,920
The chicken gravy definitely helped the potatoes.

851
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,680
And the corn is corn.

852
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,360
The corn was the only thing where I was like,

853
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
oh, you gotta be kidding me.

854
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,960
Because you can't select your sides,

855
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,400
it's kind of pre-allocated.

856
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,680
And I know the margins on,

857
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,640
I know that is probably a 25 cents worth of corn

858
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,280
that they're just tossing on.

859
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,120
Sure.

860
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,980
I saw something, I hate to get off on a tangent real quick.

861
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,600
I saw somebody post, maybe it was on our Facebook group,

862
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,000
that somebody's now doing hot dog in a corn.

863
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,280
Did you see this?

864
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,320
How do you mean?

865
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
Like basically a hollowed out corn on the cob

866
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,920
with a hot dog inside and corn on the outside.

867
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
Oh, that's interesting.

868
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,280
I don't. Yeah.

869
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,400
I don't know how that stays together.

870
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
I don't know. I don't either.

871
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,920
Cause you'd have to have that hard shell around

872
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,760
the corn to keep the shape of it.

873
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,340
So I don't think you can just bite through it.

874
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,400
But I don't know, I'm interested.

875
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,960
I don't think they're growing corn off of the hot dog.

876
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,020
That would be gross.

877
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,720
But who knows?

878
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Yeah. That seems like a very state fair kind of food.

879
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,100
Right.

880
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,360
They're genetically breeding them.

881
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,680
This field's full of these in Kansas somewhere.

882
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Highly possible.

883
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,160
Anyway, sorry. Peel the ears back.

884
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,480
Anyway, so that's the verdict.

885
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,320
The meal, again, pretty good.

886
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,000
Again, you don't get the ambiance of the chicken restaurant,

887
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,800
but it's solid.

888
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,640
It's solid.

889
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,000
And it was fun to walk around a theme parky area.

890
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,300
It was fun to walk through a roller coaster.

891
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Kind of one of the charms of Knott's is like the main.

892
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Oh yeah. If you park there,

893
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,840
you walk under the ride Ghost Rider,

894
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,960
which is always a thing.

895
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,400
Also, it makes me happy.

896
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,040
You drive under it and then walk through it.

897
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,480
So you get that little theme park taste,

898
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
even if you're not going in the park.

899
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,160
And they weren't running it, right, Jason?

900
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,320
They were not running it.

901
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,400
No.

902
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,840
They did have, I wrote down,

903
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,600
they had acousticky versions of songs playing

904
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,800
and those songs were Hollywood Nights

905
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,480
and California Dreaming.

906
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,680
That was fun.

907
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,960
Yeah, that's always the, we've noted that before.

908
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,200
It's always in a very original California venture way,

909
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,380
the instrumental versions of California related songs.

910
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,440
Yes. So that was fun.

911
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,760
Because it is Knott's California marketplace.

912
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,280
California marketplace.

913
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,440
So let's get to the sweets.

914
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,360
I'll start with the boysenberry pie.

915
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,040
The boysenberry pie is, I mean, it's good.

916
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,440
It's very sweet.

917
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,000
That boysenberry pie filling,

918
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,440
like I like the boysenberry preserves,

919
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,400
but as a pie filling, it's just so sweet.

920
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,840
Like, and I do not have vanilla.

921
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I really meant to get some whipped cream

922
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,560
or some vanilla ice cream just to cut it.

923
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,040
I did have a glass of milk with it.

924
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
I'm not gonna lie.

925
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Two percent, two percent?

926
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
It was two percent.

927
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,480
Yes, it was two percent.

928
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,080
It's good.

929
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,160
It's just so sweet.

930
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,680
I just need a little more tart.

931
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,920
I like a cherry pie or a blueberry pie.

932
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,720
I just think has a little more tartness to it.

933
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,240
We've talked pie preference.

934
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,400
What is your number one?

935
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,120
Is it pecan pie?

936
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,120
It's pecan if it's got a nice maple flavor

937
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,920
as opposed to more of just a sweet caro syrup or corn syrup.

938
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,960
I really like custard pies,

939
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,280
coconut custard or just egg custard pie.

940
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,840
So that would be you to say number one?

941
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,160
That's your number one, you think?

942
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,840
I think so, yeah.

943
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,720
Custard, I like a peach pie or apple pie.

944
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,280
I like an apple pie too.

945
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,200
Yeah, I think I like apple the best.

946
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,200
Yeah.

947
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,520
I've had the nuts pecan, I like it a lot.

948
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,760
I don't think they have coconut cream or banana cream

949
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,520
or key lime, I'm a fan of all of those.

950
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,360
Yeah.

951
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,320
I like pumpkin pie more as I get older too.

952
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,560
Not a fan as a child for some reason.

953
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,240
So yeah, the boysenberry pie was good,

954
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,560
but the chocolate bundt cake was the star of the show.

955
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,560
It is very good, very moist,

956
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
has chocolate, little bits of chocolate inside

957
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,200
and it came with a cup of fudge sauce.

958
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,040
And it's big, I thought it would be tiny,

959
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,440
but it's not a full-size bundt cake,

960
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,080
but it's not like a cupcake either.

961
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,880
And the sauce was just so good.

962
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,000
So that was five bucks, the pie was running you $13.

963
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
But the chocolate bundt cake,

964
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,200
we were shocked at how good the thing was.

965
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,160
Wow.

966
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,120
Wow, wow.

967
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,320
I've never had that there.

968
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,400
That's something they've had on the menu

969
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
probably for a while.

970
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,560
I'm guessing I don't know the history of nuts desserts

971
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,380
like I should.

972
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,160
I am a theme park podcaster,

973
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,600
so I should know the menus better over the last 100 years.

974
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,520
Well, I saw pictures online that they had bigger,

975
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,680
I mean, they had a toilet paper cake, that's fun.

976
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,960
There was a cake with Snoopy wearing a mask

977
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,920
and I was like, okay, they're having a nice time.

978
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
We're all having fun.

979
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
I like those.

980
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,080
That is cute.

981
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,920
Snoopy wearing a mask.

982
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,960
Did they have any of his other relatives wearing masks,

983
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,800
like Spike?

984
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
Spike or Olaf or...

985
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,440
Is Spike probably somebody who believes

986
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,680
the whole thing's a hoax?

987
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,040
Yeah, Spike, I mean, we'll get into it soon enough,

988
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,240
but Spike lives outside of Needles, California,

989
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,200
a desert town.

990
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,160
So yeah, Spike always seems a little squirrely.

991
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,000
Like who knows what he could do.

992
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,840
Who knows what his beliefs are?

993
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,040
Who knows what his...

994
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,600
How many Facebook conspiracy theories he's subscribing to?

995
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,960
Yeah.

996
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,320
I wonder if Needles, California literally is reopened.

997
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
I wonder what their deal is currently.

998
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,720
Well, as Jason alluded to,

999
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,280
maybe we should look into that for a future episode.

1000
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,120
Well, yes.

1001
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,080
Well, yeah.

1002
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
Here's a little tease, yes.

1003
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,960
There's gonna be a lot of a Spike soon.

1004
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
I think it's funny.

1005
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,480
So I think our thought was to frame this episode

1006
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,480
with pie in the title, but in a huge twist,

1007
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,680
the star of the show and the real MVP, the Buntcake.

1008
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,880
Wow, this is...

1009
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,760
People probably got knocked out of their chairs

1010
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,880
when they heard that the Buntcake is really the winner

1011
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,840
and the star of the episode.

1012
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,960
Because this is one of the biggest twists.

1013
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,800
I took some photos for the episode art

1014
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,240
and people would probably be able to see

1015
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
the Buntcake was torn into

1016
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,240
before we could get the photos taken.

1017
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,960
You're animal instinct.

1018
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,600
We started picking at it very quickly.

1019
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,960
So yeah, so I mean, all in all, this was fun.

1020
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,840
Here's the one thing I was not wild about.

1021
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,040
And this is not on the Knott's people.

1022
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,280
And that is, and I've seen this

1023
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,840
in a few different places now.

1024
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,000
That is the people who pull their car up,

1025
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
pull out camping chairs and tailgate and picnic.

1026
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,880
What?

1027
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,720
Oh, no.

1028
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,760
Yeah.

1029
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,680
There were people,

1030
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,600
I mean, the Knott's parking lot is pretty big.

1031
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,440
Again, it was pretty deserted when I was there.

1032
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,320
But this is not the first time I watched some vloggers

1033
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,600
on YouTube also get the Knott's food

1034
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,320
and then just go find a spot and lay down a blanket.

1035
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm like, you are out of your fucking minds.

1036
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,920
Like, no, stop this right now.

1037
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,000
Are we the only people who talk about theme parks

1038
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,040
on the regular who aren't just like psyched

1039
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,400
that everything's back open?

1040
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Let's go, I'm there, we're hanging out.

1041
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,040
Mask, who cares?

1042
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Why do I feel like this genre as a whole

1043
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,080
is salivating for everything to just be back open,

1044
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,200
come hell or high water?

1045
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,920
I mean, I think it is kind of a reflection

1046
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,120
of a certain type of people,

1047
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,760
because I've walked around some,

1048
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,600
around Burbank or Studio City,

1049
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,920
and there are people getting takeout

1050
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,240
and then just sitting on the benches to chow down.

1051
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,560
And I'm like, no, go home.

1052
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,640
I drove down to Blaine Park with my friend Luke,

1053
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,520
not in the same car.

1054
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,680
We drove in separate cars.

1055
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,560
He lives kind of far away from me anyway.

1056
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,600
He lives like 45 minutes west.

1057
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,640
And we both like sort of met down there,

1058
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,920
parked our cars, looking at each other

1059
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,560
in the Portillo's parking lot after we got the food,

1060
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,240
and then ate the food, talking to each other on the phone,

1061
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,760
looking at each other into the car.

1062
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,120
Like when cops, like when a cop meets up

1063
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,160
with an informant and pulls up next to them.

1064
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes.

1065
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,800
So we parked over by the bank, over by the Portillo's,

1066
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,400
because the Portillo's, by the way, was hopping.

1067
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,720
Oh my goodness, the line was crazy.

1068
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,880
That shopping center in general is still crazy

1069
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,100
with lines out of the Walmart there.

1070
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,040
So we did that, but we did not like sit in front

1071
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,760
of the Portillo's and eat.

1072
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,320
I understand the instinct.

1073
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm sympathetic to wanting to do it,

1074
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,680
but I am too cautious.

1075
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,360
Yeah.

1076
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,960
Well, so if there were fears that theme park media

1077
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,520
hasn't been worried enough,

1078
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,160
Mike Carlson is doing plenty of worrying forever.

1079
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,240
Oh my God. Yes.

1080
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,840
You folks have no idea.

1081
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,800
You don't know how I worry for you.

1082
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,440
Yeah, I mean, I get it.

1083
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
Like Mission Impossible, like Ethan Hunt,

1084
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,960
you carry the burden, I'm sure.

1085
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,440
I am worried for all of the mice chat.

1086
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,880
Anyone who works on mice chat, I'm worried.

1087
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,240
So everyone we can list off.

1088
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,360
I was going to list fake ones,

1089
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,680
and then I'm like, nah, it's whatever.

1090
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,040
I'm worried for all the real ones.

1091
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,640
Bumpergar boys snuck in.

1092
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,080
Before City Walk was even officially open,

1093
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,560
they were running around, putting their hands on everything.

1094
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,040
They were trying to like,

1095
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,120
like they were rubbing their fingers

1096
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,840
on the non-operational fountain.

1097
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,760
They wanted it flowing again so bad.

1098
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,440
And that's on them.

1099
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,040
I heard they snuck into the Secret Life of Pets

1100
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,080
and turned it on.

1101
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,320
They were riding it.

1102
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,080
That's not right germ-wise or morally.

1103
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,880
It's not ready, it's up to the universal

1104
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,200
to flip the switch, not you.

1105
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,680
And the cats, as we know,

1106
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,920
the cats on the Secret Life of Pets ride can spread COVID.

1107
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,000
Cats can spread COVID, that is not a lie.

1108
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,400
Oh, wow. Animatronic ones too.

1109
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
I don't know that you can get it from,

1110
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,080
I don't know that humans can get it from a cat,

1111
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,360
but they can carry it at least.

1112
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,600
So maybe they can't spread it, but still.

1113
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,520
You really are worrying enough for,

1114
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
you put that info in my head.

1115
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,680
Well, I think I take it back.

1116
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,960
I take it back that they can spread it.

1117
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,160
I believe they have for sure found it in cats.

1118
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,400
So. Right.

1119
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,800
But it doesn't mean cats are spreading it left and right.

1120
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,640
I take that back.

1121
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,480
I don't want to put out the fake news.

1122
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,320
I don't believe that's happening.

1123
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,560
Some large cats,

1124
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,040
some large cats at one of the New York City zoos,

1125
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,840
I believe they had found it at.

1126
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,720
Right.

1127
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,000
But I don't think you can get it as a human from a cat.

1128
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,840
So don't worry.

1129
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,840
But maybe.

1130
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,800
But just in case, douse your cat in chlorox.

1131
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,040
Yes, I think that's good.

1132
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,720
Do we know if you can get it from an animatronic cat?

1133
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,760
We don't know that.

1134
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,600
We don't know.

1135
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,000
The science is still out on that.

1136
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,840
So the Bumbergar boys should have been more cautious.

1137
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,120
They should have temperature checked,

1138
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,960
the hands-free temperature checked that animatronic cat

1139
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,600
before going on that unopened ride.

1140
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,440
And this is why we continue to be their enemies

1141
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,480
and fight them at every turn.

1142
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,040
I think I'm getting ripped off.

1143
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm just saying theme park media,

1144
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
if you're going to get like,

1145
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,760
I get wanting to go to these places.

1146
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,920
I get like, oh, I have to go cover this.

1147
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,760
Fine.

1148
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,920
Just keep the mask on and stand further apart.

1149
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,160
Like I saw some videos with people with masks off

1150
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,600
and sitting really close.

1151
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,040
And I'm like, get away.

1152
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,880
What are you doing?

1153
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,480
Are you out of your minds?

1154
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,120
Well, but as we've discussed,

1155
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,800
we've been asked to pair everything

1156
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,040
to be essential activities.

1157
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,240
And I would certainly, I think we could all agree

1158
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,400
that essential on the essential activities list

1159
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,400
is going to CityWalk Orlando,

1160
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,160
taking a photo on the plastic throne

1161
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,760
outside of Boodoo Donuts,

1162
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,760
which is sanitized and wiped down by an employee

1163
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,200
both before and after each person lands on it.

1164
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,080
So they're doing their due diligence.

1165
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,560
But this is how important it is

1166
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,360
that people sit in the voodoo throne,

1167
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,760
that it's someone's job now to wipe that seat down.

1168
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,280
Well, the governor of Florida said

1169
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,720
that was one of the top 10 things

1170
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,360
they wanted to get back open again.

1171
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,520
That was a priority to get the voodoo donuts thrown open.

1172
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,000
What is Florida without the voodoo donuts thrown?

1173
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,600
That's one of the biggest reasons tourists come to Florida

1174
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,640
is to sit in that throne, that donut throne.

1175
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,720
France is the Eiffel Tower.

1176
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
Florida is the donut throne.

1177
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,480
Look, I can't judge if the donut throne

1178
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,600
was open in Hollywood.

1179
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,200
I would probably walk over there.

1180
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,040
Tonight?

1181
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,920
Like today you would do it?

1182
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Maybe, I mean, CityWalk is pretty big and pretty spread out.

1183
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,400
I don't know why that's making me feel more calm.

1184
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,640
I think because I've been seeing news stories

1185
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,920
about like outside stuff is better.

1186
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,920
Yeah, I mean, I think in general, yes,

1187
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,720
outside stuff is probably,

1188
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,040
from what I understand at this point,

1189
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,200
could all be different in about two days.

1190
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,400
From what I understand, it's like the biggest risk

1191
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,080
is sitting in a room with somebody

1192
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,400
talking to them for two hours.

1193
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,240
Yes.

1194
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,200
Like being in enclosed space with some people who have it

1195
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,720
is not as opposed to open air.

1196
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,760
That being said, I don't know.

1197
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,760
I think some-

1198
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,480
It's whatever one.

1199
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,960
I think some counties are allowing picnicking,

1200
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,240
but there's still an expectation of like, all right,

1201
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,200
but keep, have a picnic, but everyone bring a blank.

1202
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,640
Like keep your distance, you know, talk from a distance.

1203
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,640
So yeah, it was just a little.

1204
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,240
I'm glad it wasn't packed when I went down there.

1205
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,600
Again, all the employees at Knott's,

1206
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,080
the pictures and videos I've seen

1207
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,560
of Universal employees in Florida,

1208
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,520
they seem to be on top of their game.

1209
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,080
They seem to be doing everything right within like

1210
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,040
health suggestions, regulations and that sort of thing.

1211
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,320
But yeah.

1212
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,160
That's great, that's great,

1213
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,560
because this is a little unprecedented

1214
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,960
starting to open these, you know,

1215
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,360
anything theme park adjacent.

1216
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,480
This isn't in the park, but you know,

1217
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,000
people are craving this kind of thing.

1218
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,760
And that restaurant, it's an Orange County tradition.

1219
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,600
So it's nice that they're trying to get it open safely

1220
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,880
and get people back to work.

1221
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,680
I think, you know, I feel that end of it,

1222
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,920
like wanting, you know,

1223
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,760
wanting businesses to be going in a safe way.

1224
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,640
So I don't know, good for them for doing it well and safely.

1225
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,080
I mean, I will go down there.

1226
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,680
I will probably go to Portillo's also again.

1227
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,440
So it's not, look, I like being,

1228
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,160
Buena Park, one of the top places in the world.

1229
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,640
One of the best places.

1230
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,360
Well, hey, wait a minute, I'm making a point here.

1231
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,760
Mike, you haven't been to Europe, correct?

1232
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,960
Hey, hey, hold on.

1233
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,160
Just make it, I know that was an unrelated fact.

1234
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,320
If you would fact been to Europe.

1235
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,680
Okay, one of the top cities in the world,

1236
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,680
Buena Park.

1237
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,840
I assume it goes New York,

1238
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,120
let's see, Venice.

1239
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,040
Milan. Milan.

1240
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,880
Buena Park. Venice.

1241
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,920
Buena Park.

1242
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,040
And then, hmm.

1243
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,960
Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

1244
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,840
Yes. That's correct.

1245
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,680
That's the fifth.

1246
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,800
Jay-Z and Alicia Keys had to be begged to make their song,

1247
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,480
Empire State of Mind, instead of Buena Park of Mind.

1248
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,560
Both have extreme fondness.

1249
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,760
There's a demo, I'm sure.

1250
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,600
Buena.

1251
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,680
Medieval times will inspire you.

1252
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,880
Teatro Martini will

1253
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,960
amuse you. Delight you.

1254
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,160
The demos for that.

1255
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,720
They try out a couple different things.

1256
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,720
The rock and bruise, they throw in there instead.

1257
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,440
Teatro Martini.

1258
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,960
The Movie Land Wax Museum,

1259
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,720
because this was done in 2001, keep in mind,

1260
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,680
or so, I could be wrong about the date of that song,

1261
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,520
I don't wanna get that fact wrong.

1262
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,680
Was the McDonald's still in its old glory in 2001?

1263
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,520
Yeah.

1264
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,560
We're going to McThriller, Flight Simulator.

1265
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,720
There was, there was a, if we haven't said this,

1266
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,360
I don't know, here I am countering Mike on Buena Park

1267
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,520
being one of the greatest cities in the world,

1268
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,440
but it did at one point have a McDonald's

1269
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,080
with a simulator ride in it,

1270
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,080
and the sign said, it said McThriller on the outside,

1271
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,680
and has said McThriller, despite the simulator

1272
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,720
not having been there for like 30 years.

1273
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,320
Should we just make this Jay-Z parody of Buena Park?

1274
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,760
Maybe.

1275
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,600
Probably.

1276
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah, we're gonna have to put pen to paper on it.

1277
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,080
There's a trampoline parked by the Walmart.

1278
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,560
There's John's Incredible Pizza Company.

1279
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,440
There's enough, there's enough landmarks there.

1280
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,560
There's a big rock and bruise.

1281
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,400
That's what he said.

1282
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,920
A really big rock and bruise.

1283
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,760
Oh yeah.

1284
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,720
There is a, in that mall,

1285
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,280
there's one of those like ultrasound photo studios.

1286
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,120
Oh wow.

1287
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,240
You can get like cute little photos of your fetus,

1288
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,080
3Dified and a little heart frame.

1289
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,400
Oh my God.

1290
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,240
I didn't do it, guys.

1291
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,040
That's crazy, you should have done that.

1292
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,360
I don't know why I didn't do it.

1293
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,640
That would have been good content.

1294
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,360
Yeah, yeah.

1295
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,200
You know, I, well first of all, yes,

1296
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
and speaking of good content,

1297
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,480
Leo, let's keep going on this song.

1298
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,480
I did, I have done some off air content

1299
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,200
related to the Nut's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.

1300
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,640
I think I sent this to you guys,

1301
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,680
but Erin had a birthday, my wife Erin had a birthday,

1302
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,480
pretty close into the pandemic and it was a bummer.

1303
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,040
And so I was trying to think of,

1304
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,800
is there anything that I could do?

1305
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,280
Could I simulate something that we would usually do

1306
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,520
for her birthday?

1307
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,560
And what I thought of was the Nut's Chicken Dinner

1308
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,840
Restaurant, it seemed very possible we might go down there

1309
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,760
and at least get a drink and a pie.

1310
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,760
So for her birthday, I recreated the restaurant

1311
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,680
in our apartment.

1312
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,200
I put a photo of Walter and Cordelia Nut up on the wall.

1313
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:56,200
I forget what all the aspects of it were,

1314
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,920
but the main thing is that I brought out a menu

1315
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,920
and keep in mind, well, so let me see.

1316
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,600
Let me see, there were a couple of areas

1317
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,080
that I have in front of me, Nut's Traditional Dinners

1318
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,440
and there was a choice of ham noodles, cabbage cutlets,

1319
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,880
scampi slaw and dumpling cracklins.

1320
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,800
This is my approximation of the kind of weird thing

1321
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,560
they have besides the fried chicken and warning,

1322
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,640
dumpling cracklins may contain pig feces.

1323
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,200
Because she was pregnant at the time of this,

1324
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,080
I said beverages may be limited due to pregnancy

1325
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,560
and pandemic and her choices were two sips of wine,

1326
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,560
a sniff of whiskey, grapefruit perrier or vitamin D milk,

1327
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,800
which is what was available from CVS at the time.

1328
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,720
And then I gave her a choice of apple pecan

1329
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,800
and blueberry peach pie, which I actually had the choices

1330
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,160
on hand because of, I believe the place is Republic of Pie

1331
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,800
in the valley and all the pies were wonderful.

1332
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,880
So thanks to them for making this all possible.

1333
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,760
But yeah, we had a little fun.

1334
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,680
Jason, not the only one craving this restaurant

1335
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,160
in these times, it was fun to reproduce it.

1336
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,520
I'll post this menu somewhere.

1337
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,880
That's great.

1338
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,880
Did you leave up the photo of Walter and Cordelia Nut?

1339
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,760
It was definitely up for a couple of days, yes.

1340
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,000
It'd take a while for it to go down.

1341
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,480
Is it above the crib now?

1342
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,000
Did you move it?

1343
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah.

1344
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,560
Dad, is that grandpa?

1345
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,840
Well, no, but he was a very important man.

1346
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,360
He had a lot of thoughts about free enterprise.

1347
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,200
Freedom.

1348
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,320
Due to this stupid pandemic,

1349
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,880
he might end up thinking that's grandma and grandpa.

1350
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,520
Getting out with them.

1351
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,120
Bunch of bullshit.

1352
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,080
Yeah, yeah.

1353
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,040
Well, I'll teach him all the important stuff,

1354
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,040
especially about liberty and, you know, not being tread on.

1355
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,920
That's the big thing in 2020

1356
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,720
and that I want my son to learn is,

1357
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,280
don't let anyone tread on you.

1358
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,200
And if some stupid governor says,

1359
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,600
don't go out in an American flag cape, holding a gun,

1360
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,080
yelling about wanting to get into a JCPenney,

1361
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,040
don't let that asshole tread on you.

1362
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah.

1363
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,920
Is there anything you need to say?

1364
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,480
You have like a TV next to the crib

1365
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,120
with Tucker Carlson playing on a loop, I hope.

1366
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,320
Just sort of reiterating.

1367
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,320
Well, he has sort of a,

1368
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,120
he has kind of a kids show host look with the bow tie.

1369
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,400
He's kind of a modern Captain Kangaroo.

1370
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,440
Right.

1371
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,280
Yes, so that.

1372
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,520
Yeah, so I think the boy might be endeared to him.

1373
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,880
He has a calming presence for children.

1374
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,960
That's definitely how I feel.

1375
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,040
If I leave Fox News on a lot,

1376
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,200
he'll look at Sean Hannity and say, Shrek?

1377
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,040
Yeah.

1378
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,880
Yeah.

1379
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,720
Yeah.

1380
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,560
Yeah.

1381
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,400
Yeah.

1382
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,240
Yeah.

1383
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,040
He's not green, but he's a big monster.

1384
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,880
Right, of course.

1385
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,120
The baby could get confused.

1386
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,240
Yes.

1387
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,080
But yeah, you don't want him.

1388
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,920
Oh, god.

1389
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,640
Sorry, Jason, go ahead.

1390
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,040
Oh, I was gonna say, guys,

1391
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,840
I don't want to open a can of worms,

1392
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,840
but I just saw they posted the requirements,

1393
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,720
the suggested by CDC requirements for entering Disney Springs,

1394
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,840
like entering big public spaces and stuff.

1395
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,160
Oh, I saw this in a kind of confusing video, yes.

1396
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,800
Yeah, and they posted this on the Disney Parks blog.

1397
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,960
I saw Carly tweeted this out,

1398
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,240
and it seems like everyone in the comments are having,

1399
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,040
everyone in there is having a normal one,

1400
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,280
having a real regular reaction to these suggestions

1401
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,680
of keep a mask on.

1402
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,560
If you feel sick, stay away.

1403
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,160
We're gonna take your temperature.

1404
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,560
People not.

1405
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,000
Is there a comment that sticks out to you right now

1406
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,840
in the comment?

1407
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,200
You could read on this podcast.

1408
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,600
Yeah, this one's really good.

1409
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,560
I won't be going to Disney Springs

1410
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,640
if wearing a mask is required.

1411
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,160
That's such an unhealthy proposition

1412
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,080
with breathing my CO2 and the germs

1413
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,160
that would accumulate in the mask at the Florida heat.

1414
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,320
So that guy is doing great.

1415
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,200
This is how much people want to be at Sanuk.

1416
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,000
People are crave, people that are zombified

1417
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,800
over their desire to get to Sanuk.

1418
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,200
But don't want to, is breathing your own CO2 bad?

1419
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,520
I don't think that's how it works.

1420
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,360
I don't think that's how science works.

1421
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,280
It's also not how it happens, right?

1422
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,120
It's not.

1423
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,720
I think that's a sarcastic, isn't that him going like,

1424
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,440
well, then this would be the problem then.

1425
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, my understanding is that the masks you're wearing

1426
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,840
aren't blocking your mouth completely.

1427
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,680
Yeah.

1428
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,040
Yeah, it's so funny these places opening up

1429
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,560
and people like making such a point,

1430
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,880
like, wait, let's get down there, we gotta be there.

1431
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,880
And I'm looking at what is open at City Walk and Auntie Anne's

1432
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,480
Cold Stone.

1433
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,240
Oh, certainly that's 30 times better than the ice cream

1434
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,760
I can get at the store.

1435
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,600
I gotta be there.

1436
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,120
Auntie Anne's has a crazy setup where they have

1437
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,200
these different boxes you get your stuff in.

1438
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,480
Somebody touches the money, somebody touches the pretzel,

1439
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,440
they put it in a box, pass it over.

1440
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,880
I saw this online, they have a complete elaborate

1441
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,040
no touch system going, which I give them

1442
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,120
a lot of credit for.

1443
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,880
Yeah.

1444
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,680
So kudos to Auntie Anne's, whatever the hell it's called.

1445
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,760
Why do we need the pretzels so bad of all the things?

1446
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,240
I don't, I'm not sure what the phases of City Walk opening,

1447
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,520
like why certain things open first.

1448
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,960
I mean, I think in a couple of weeks,

1449
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,120
everything will be open at City Walk in Florida.

1450
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,160
You know, the golf is open, the mini golf?

1451
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,080
Yes, I saw that.

1452
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,720
I did see that, yes.

1453
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,960
Well, just one side of the mini golf, I believe.

1454
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,800
Oh, is that right?

1455
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,720
What's the other side?

1456
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,360
Is there some difference between the two sides

1457
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,680
or they just decided to open up one first?

1458
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,720
I think one's haunted and one is aliens.

1459
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,560
Oh, okay.

1460
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,400
I don't know.

1461
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
I think they're just trying to space it out

1462
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,200
so there's less people on the course.

1463
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,080
I see, I see.

1464
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,960
Huh.

1465
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,160
Yeah, I don't know.

1466
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,280
Look, maybe we're gonna look, but here's what I truly,

1467
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,480
and I'm not saying this with any irony

1468
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,680
or I'm not saying this.

1469
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,920
Hopefully everyone in a few months

1470
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,600
listens to this podcast of us being scared

1471
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,120
and says, you know, you guys are a bunch of loser babies.

1472
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,760
Everything was fine.

1473
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,920
What's wrong with you?

1474
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,440
I sincerely hope as a historical document,

1475
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,880
we will be humiliated by all of this talk

1476
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,280
that we're doing on this episode.

1477
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,760
I truly do.

1478
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,720
That being said.

1479
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,720
You want, you can't even be mild disagreement.

1480
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
We need to be shamed.

1481
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,600
Well, I'm saying the best case scenario for the world

1482
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,160
is that we're totally wrong

1483
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,960
about being so worried about this.

1484
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,080
That is technically true.

1485
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,080
So I'm saying I'll take being goofed on for this episode

1486
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,840
in hindsight. Yeah.

1487
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,960
I hope that's what will happen.

1488
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,000
And I guess, yeah, I may be laying the tracks of,

1489
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,960
I will end up humiliated by saying

1490
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,520
that maybe the lure of Cinnabon

1491
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,760
shouldn't be enough to make people

1492
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,480
risk their lives and others.

1493
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,400
No, they're gonna be playing this clip of you saying

1494
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,520
Cinnabon is not essential

1495
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,600
and you are gonna never live it down.

1496
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,360
My credibility is blown forever, yes.

1497
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,640
Cinnabon, the founders came to America

1498
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,560
to get a giant sweet roll with icing on top.

1499
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,800
And you're saying now we can't have that?

1500
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,040
That giant ass cinnamon roll

1501
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,440
that's the size of a pillow?

1502
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,440
If I can't pay $8 for an item

1503
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,320
that costs eight cents to make,

1504
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,400
then am I really living?

1505
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,360
Yeah, exactly.

1506
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,440
And gentlemen, do you realize that once again,

1507
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,080
we've brought it back around,

1508
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,960
with Cinnabon, we've brought it back around

1509
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,280
to the Breaking Badiverse. I do, yes.

1510
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,120
Wow.

1511
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,320
It didn't even occur to me till I said it.

1512
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,080
Which maybe indicates that we've closed the loop

1513
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,560
and I should say you survived podcast the ride.

1514
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,600
Wow, Breaking Bad homages throughout.

1515
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
That was wonderful.

1516
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,400
Perfect podcast, honestly.

1517
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,920
Yeah, they don't usually tidy up so nicely.

1518
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,920
Yeah, the world may be full of germs,

1519
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,040
but this episode was nice and clean.

1520
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,920
Well, Jason, I'm glad you had a good time.

1521
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,000
Yes.

1522
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,600
And yeah, I'm glad the assignment was not for naught

1523
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,600
and that also that the car wash situation,

1524
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,040
I'm glad you're not still there.

1525
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,360
Yeah, I'm also glad.

1526
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,320
Did I get the stuff off my car

1527
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,160
that I wanted off my car?

1528
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,520
As much as any automated car wash does, so kind of.

1529
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,400
So probably still gonna go out with some Windex

1530
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,080
and paper towels and scrub, but.

1531
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,000
Yeah.

1532
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,280
Filthy cars and unruly hair,

1533
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,160
that will be the signs of this time.

1534
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,080
Sure.

1535
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,160
I'm going grayer, I'm going grayer.

1536
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,040
I think I am too is what I've been told.

1537
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,880
Oh really?

1538
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,680
From Aaron who could see an angle of me.

1539
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,800
Wait, are we both wearing, this is gonna go for so long

1540
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,360
by the time we record in person again.

1541
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,840
We both of you were haired.

1542
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:12,840
We've aged decades and Jason's just bright and chipper as ever.

1543
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,840
He's gone back in time somehow.

1544
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,200
He's like, he's like, he's like 17 when we see him next.

1545
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:27,240
I can finally sleep how much I would like to sleep

1546
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,760
cause everyone's doing it.

1547
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,280
14 hours, how much are you sleeping a day?

1548
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,000
No, I'd sleep like eight hours a day is fine.

1549
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,480
I just keep going back and forth between staying up

1550
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,960
very late and going to bed very early.

1551
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,400
And I was already terrible at keeping a daily routine.

1552
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,960
Keeping a regular routine, building habits sucks ass.

1553
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,200
They're great to have, but trying to set them

1554
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,280
is very difficult.

1555
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,800
So that I was already a thing I was working on

1556
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,520
before quarantine.

1557
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,600
So kind of has definitely fallen by the wayside

1558
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,760
after quarantine, but I've read a lot of books.

1559
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,400
I've gotten my attention span back for reading.

1560
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,280
So, you know, small miracles.

1561
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,640
Well, that's good.

1562
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,600
Are you going gray at all, Jason?

1563
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,680
I've been growing gray like a little bit for years now.

1564
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,040
But it hasn't accelerated or anything?

1565
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,240
It hasn't really accelerated.

1566
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,200
I'm more concerned about the thinning.

1567
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,240
Yes.

1568
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,680
The Murphy family men aren't known for

1569
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,720
the thickest of hairs as they age.

1570
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,640
Mine's pretty thick, I gotta say.

1571
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,720
And I'm watching this boy's hair grow in.

1572
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,080
Like keep it coming, come on.

1573
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,720
Hope you got your dads.

1574
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,560
Yeah, yeah.

1575
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,640
Right now, it's pretty thin, I have to say.

1576
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,240
Well, you know, you can't put pressure on them

1577
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,360
this early for...

1578
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,960
That'd be, I think I'd be far more disturbed

1579
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,480
by a thick, full head of hair that went one month in.

1580
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,080
He has like Prince Purple Rain hair at this point.

1581
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,440
I mean, you would be so proud if he had a full

1582
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,880
like purple rain mop of hair.

1583
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,800
That'd be kind of cool.

1584
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,360
I certainly sent you guys this, but I did a little thing.

1585
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,880
You know, babies like high contrast images.

1586
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,000
Just pure black and white, you know, like abstract symbols

1587
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,280
and circles and weird stuff.

1588
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,520
And I made some black and white abstract images

1589
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,240
for him to look at of things that are important

1590
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,520
to Aaron and I, and that includes a glass of wine,

1591
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,400
the Horizons logo and the Prince symbol.

1592
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,520
And I literally have done this,

1593
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,120
because he does like light up at these things

1594
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,680
and stares at them for a while.

1595
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,240
And I've watched him just stare at the Prince symbol.

1596
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,480
You're really getting...

1597
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,080
Now this is me as a dad.

1598
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,160
You are really just indoctrinating him early.

1599
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,640
Well, I think early Prince education is very important

1600
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,360
because you know, you've got like,

1601
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,160
you're learning about gender fluidity and racial tolerance.

1602
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,560
All the messages are in there.

1603
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,800
I think it's a great thing for a little child.

1604
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,560
You won't need to have a sex talk.

1605
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,720
Oh yeah.

1606
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,440
Prince will explain the whole thing.

1607
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,800
My sex talk?

1608
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,280
Sure.

1609
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,000
Just handing him a CD.

1610
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,240
Here's Dirty Mind.

1611
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,840
Here's your sex talk.

1612
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,720
Dirty Mind will give you all,

1613
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,000
everything you need to know is in this album,

1614
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,840
in these grooves.

1615
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,840
I'll do the mix.

1616
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,760
Yeah, let's pretend we're married and had...

1617
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,280
I'll compile a little.

1618
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,440
Not for a while though.

1619
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,520
He'll get past the infant stage.

1620
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,320
And take out the incest track.

1621
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,160
The incest track does not,

1622
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,200
I would not like him to.

1623
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,440
Yeah, yeah, take that out.

1624
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,160
I'd not like him to learn about it.

1625
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh.

1626
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,840
He doesn't have a brother or sister yet,

1627
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,000
but it's the case.

1628
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,880
Scott, I did forget to mention,

1629
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,880
we enjoyed a bottle of white wine while we were eating.

1630
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,720
The chicken, I've had it just sitting on my desk

1631
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,720
for years now.

1632
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,040
I bought it in Solvang when Mike and I went up to that.

1633
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,880
Yeah.

1634
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,440
A fellow podcaster, Zacharino,

1635
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,640
got married a few years ago,

1636
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,920
and I did a wine tasting the day before the wedding.

1637
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,760
We were not at Solvang.

1638
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,000
I went to Solvang.

1639
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,840
I went up, I was just saying it was a wedding

1640
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,080
we were both at.

1641
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,480
We were in Santa Barbara for the wedding.

1642
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,240
For the wedding, I went to Solvang.

1643
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,800
And so I finally cracked open that wine.

1644
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,960
Very nice, very nice with the Mrs. Knott's chicken.

1645
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,800
Wonderful.

1646
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,640
It was that trip, the last one,

1647
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,600
when we went to Solvang,

1648
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,000
that brought us to the Fes Parker winery,

1649
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,120
which we are members of,

1650
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,760
and there's a shipment coming very soon.

1651
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,600
It could be any day now.

1652
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,120
And Aaron can drink again.

1653
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,360
So there is Fes Chardonnay waiting for me.

1654
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,440
Maybe even right now.

1655
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,200
Actually, maybe that's a good motivator to end it.

1656
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,680
It actually may have, boy, what a miracle it would be

1657
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,720
if I walked out of this room

1658
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,440
and there's Fes Parker Chardonnay out there.

1659
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,280
Could be the case.

1660
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,200
That's just a photo of the head that's there.

1661
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,520
Ooh, boy, I'll let you know.

1662
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,560
I won't leave you hanging on that.

1663
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,160
All right, hey, well, this was fun stuff, folks.

1664
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,280
And as always, stay subscribed on Facebook,

1665
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,880
Twitter, and Instagram,

1666
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,520
where in this case, you can see photos of the pie,

1667
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,960
but perhaps not the Bundt cake.

1668
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,240
Right, but we could find a picture of the Bundt cake

1669
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,160
to let you know.

1670
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,840
Yeah, it's there.

1671
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,680
It's just picked apart.

1672
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,480
Yes, rightfully so.

1673
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,320
I'm proud.

1674
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,840
We're all proud.

1675
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,680
Wonderful.

1676
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,520
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1677
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,600
Talk to you soon.

1678
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,440
Bye.
