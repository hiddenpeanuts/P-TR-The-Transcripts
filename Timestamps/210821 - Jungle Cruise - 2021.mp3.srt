1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,160
the only Patreon podcast feed that can heal any illness

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,000
and also, and this is very important, can break any curse.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,640
Oh yeah, of course.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,220
And that phrase in mythology have been strong in my brain

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,200
since watching this film.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,400
I definitely remember that and a lot of other things.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,760
Sure, the tears of the moon,

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,320
the effects of the tears of the moon.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,160
Mike Carlson also here.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,000
The tree, the moon tree.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
Yeah, the tree, the tree.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay, so what you're saying does have something to do

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
with the movie is what you're,

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,600
I know the first part sounds familiar

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
and I watched the movie and I don't wanna be negative,

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,800
but so that second part also is part of it.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,560
Right, yes.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
So it's, the first part is

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,980
Emily Blunt's driving motivation.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm so sorry, my recording did not work.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Oh no.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Nothing went wrong.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Keep it rolling, keep just turning on

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,120
and I'll use your audio here on the Zoom.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,880
Oh, this is in?

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
I think it's in, right?

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
It's fun, it's a little peek behind the curtain.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,400
The audience loves that.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,560
Okay, now it's working.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
All right, great.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,960
Jason's having some water issues.

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,080
You really fell for that sip of water.

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,720
Jungle Cruise water that he was drinking.

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah, backside of water, huh?

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
Officially licensed Jungle Cruise water Jason was drinking.

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,080
The jungle heard we were gonna make fun of it

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,880
and it's getting its vengeance on me.

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Jason's being attacked by water preemptively.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
So yeah, here we are.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,240
We're talking about the Jungle Cruise movie.

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,360
Jungle Cruise 2021.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
I think it's important that we talk about it

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,360
because this is a movie that is based on the ride

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,880
for about seven minutes or so.

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes.

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,960
It is imperative that we cover the seven minutes

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,480
that are mildly related to a ride

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
that we often skip.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,440
Those seven minutes, we should cover those seven minutes

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,960
and then let's say the rest is not necessary

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,440
for us to talk about.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
That's one way to do it.

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,040
Just kind of analyze every joke

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
because that's what it is.

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,480
It's really like you get a pile of Jungle Cruise style jokes

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,960
at the top of the movie.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,480
Yes, and that's spoiler alert, obviously.

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
I apologize.

62
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,240
Yeah, so if you don't wanna know

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,760
when the jokes are coming, it is early.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
But we'll put a spoiler alert.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Obviously, if you're listening to this,

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,920
chances are you know that we're gonna say something

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
that's a spoiler.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,200
But also, I'd go pretty soft on that spoiler alert

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,560
because we're gonna be very confused about the,

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,760
this will not be a thorough retelling.

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
There'll be massive plot points

72
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
that are not even referred to.

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Yeah.

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
That's true.

75
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,560
Well, now, as I told you guys,

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,520
I revealed halfway through watching it

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,360
with you guys last night, I also watched it on Saturday

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
because I was the one who rented it on Disney Plus.

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,760
And I watched it with Jane,

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,480
and then I watched it again with you guys in Scott's Yard.

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
And it, yeah, I-

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,160
A baffling reveal to watch this film, what?

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
Twice in three days?

84
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,760
I mean, let me say at the top, I did not dislike this movie.

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
I had some fun watching it.

86
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,000
Is this a twice in three days situation?

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,680
I don't know.

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,400
Yeah, that's a lot.

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Yeah.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Well, I think my first thought was after I rented it,

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,720
let me make sure this worked, right?

92
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
Cause I hadn't used it yet.

93
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,960
And then, you know, I knew Jane wanted to watch it as well.

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
And I was going out of town soon and I was like,

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
well, let's just watch it tonight

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,360
and I can make some notes tonight.

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,200
So I, it's all glued in my mind.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
All of the big pile of things that happened in this movie

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
and so much happens.

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,960
So you could win a Jungle Cruise movie trivia night

101
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,800
is what you're saying.

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
You've got it all down.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,760
So you're saying you're not gonna miss a piece

104
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,520
of the mythology or the continuity or anything.

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
That's right.

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,640
I know all about Frank and McGregor

107
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,240
and the Tears of the Moon and the Conquistadors and Aguirre.

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
What else?

109
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,160
Trader Sam.

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Sir James Hobbs Cottington.

111
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
Nilo.

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Kind of implied character being Kaiser Wilhelm's son

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,320
very quickly.

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,600
The smart bees.

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,240
The smart bees who are punished for their intelligence.

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah. Right.

118
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,680
All of your favorite characters.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Got it.

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
And you're not thinking of like spinning off

121
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,560
into your own sort of movie based,

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Jason Sheridan movie review podcast persona or anything.

123
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,640
Is that, I use this cover of a backdoor pilot?

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,120
Um, I think that would probably be like a YouTube video

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,280
and I would have to do like a different version of myself

126
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
where I'm like, okay guys, I'm so excited.

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm here today.

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,280
And I'm gonna tell you all about Frank and Nilo

129
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,000
and all the crazy characters that occupy the Amazon

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,560
of the movie, The Jungle Cruise.

131
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,520
You could also go though the other way with it

132
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,760
and you could plan on all the problems in Jungle Cruise.

133
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,800
Like you could do a full video like that

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,040
where you were like, you know.

135
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,440
Jungle Cruise 2021 was honest.

136
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,840
For once.

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah.

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
If I have a number of wigs and personas

139
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,360
and I do like the, you know, the enthusiastic

140
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
doesn't say anything bad about it.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,400
And then like the reactionary, like, you know,

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,240
the sicko libs made a Jungle Cruise movie

143
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,800
and they're coming for your children, you know.

144
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
I'd like to see both honestly.

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Double dip. From you.

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Double dip, baby.

147
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,400
That would be really, that's a great scheme.

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
You could be the first guy that appeals

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
to both of the audiences.

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
Covers every. Maybe they wouldn't even know.

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,240
Oh yeah.

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,760
If one of them's just in the shadows

153
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
and you pitch your voice down.

154
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,560
Right. You just like film it all

155
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,640
from the same room.

156
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,800
All you do is flip the light switch on and off.

157
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,120
Now you got two mega YouTube movie channels.

158
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Right. Oh.

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
And then I make twice as much.

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
I sell two different kinds of like

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
multivitamin, nootropic powders.

162
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh yeah, it's like the same thing.

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
It's like how Gwyneth Paltrow was selling

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
the same like type of vitamins as Alex Jones,

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,120
but they were called something different.

166
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,440
Oh, I didn't know that.

167
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,760
I think that story is correct.

168
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Jason, then you could just do it.

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
You could literally just go line by line

170
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,360
and just change the inflection and the lighting

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
on the video so you could be like,

172
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Jungle Cruise is too woke.

173
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,000
And then you turn the lights on and you go,

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
Jungle Cruise is too woke.

175
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,440
And you give a big thumbs up.

176
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,920
And then it's like the same, just use the same pattern,

177
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
like the same copy.

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,400
You could just have everybody watching your videos.

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Yeah, watch it once and then just flip, you know,

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
just flip, you know. Wow.

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
This is a great scheme.

182
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,280
You're your own sugar and spice.

183
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,800
The two faces. Yes, from Batman Forever.

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Yeah, of course.

185
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,520
Yeah, so that's, yeah, Debbie Mazar and Drew Barrymore.

186
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
Of course, anyway, we will,

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,400
so we've hatched a good scheme of the top here.

188
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, but until the channels exist,

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
we'll get into our thoughts on this film.

190
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,520
What's the overall summation?

191
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,680
Because if people are not planning on seeing this movie,

192
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,600
but they listen to our podcasts,

193
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
they know about the parks,

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,600
they know that it is a Jungle Cruise movie,

195
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
there's still a number of ways you could have gone

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,320
with a Jungle Cruise movie,

197
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,760
including that I didn't know this fact

198
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,200
that the original attempt at making a movie of this

199
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
was supposed to be the live action,

200
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,760
the first live action summoning of both Tom Hanks

201
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,120
and Tim Allen. Yes.

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
They were going to pair up in a non-animated way.

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
That was a while, that's almost,

204
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,760
is that a decade ago at this point or more probably?

205
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
More potentially, yeah. Yeah.

206
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
So that did not get-

207
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,160
Well, I think Hanks is Skipper

208
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,160
and Allen is Upset Traveler, I think,

209
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,560
but that could have been switched.

210
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,680
You could see that going either way.

211
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
That could be like one of those, the thing, you know,

212
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,680
one of those plays where the actor

213
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
switch roles every night.

214
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,440
Right, Tim Allen, very versatile, he could do it all.

215
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,000
He could be upset or he could be not upset.

216
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,960
So yeah, I see it.

217
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,680
I still, I felt like there was a chance

218
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,960
that was happening up until whatever, four years ago,

219
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
but obviously they decided to go

220
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,480
with some current movie stars.

221
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
I mean, I guess Tom Hanks is still a movie star,

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
but Tim Allen is not.

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,560
Tim Allen's still a star, but not, yeah.

224
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
He's a star, of course.

225
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,600
He's a star of TV and a star of being interviewed

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
on Fox News, anyway.

227
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
But what did they do instead?

228
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,520
We get Dwayne Johnson, we get Emily Blunt,

229
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,640
and what are the cliff notes,

230
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,200
the broad strokes of what happened here?

231
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,360
Like where it's set, what they did with it?

232
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,240
Yeah, I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head

233
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,600
of like what you were saying earlier,

234
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,400
that they bang out a lot of the Jungle Cruise stuff

235
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,760
within the first 15, 20 minutes,

236
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
almost like it's a burden to reference

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,880
the theme park ride stuff.

238
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,000
And then it comes back around a little later

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,840
when Trader Sam, a character who never really

240
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
had much character to begin with,

241
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,240
shows up and doesn't really do a whole lot.

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,040
That's the other theme park element

243
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,680
that comes back around. The name is said.

244
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,240
The character's name is said.

245
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
The name is said.

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,240
I caught it the first time I watched it.

247
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
I had closed caption on, and it said,

248
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Trader Sam, colon, or Trader Sam hands the arrowhead back.

249
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,120
And I was like, oh, that's, oh.

250
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,320
It took me, I saw the character

251
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
when we were watching the movie,

252
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,920
and then scenes later, somebody said it,

253
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
and I went, oh, that's okay, got it.

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
So yeah, so maybe not the big reveal,

255
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
like it's Nick Fury or something, not a big, I don't know.

256
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,240
They didn't really underline it for me.

257
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,680
But also, your average film goer might not be excited

258
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,320
by the name of the Tiki Bar at the Disneyland Hotel.

259
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
Which is mainly why we have any fondness for Trader Sam.

260
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Like until there was this nice bar, did we care?

261
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,960
We probably didn't care.

262
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,960
The character is in several different guises anyway,

263
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,820
and then it's problematic and not there anymore.

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,120
So who is like, why not just invent Trader Sam?

265
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,480
Reinvent from Hull Cloth.

266
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah, it was not on my radar.

267
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,560
I mean, the pirate in the slop

268
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,040
certainly has been on my radar since I was little.

269
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,800
But yeah, Trader Sam, I really could not have told you

270
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,920
the name of that character until a few years ago, probably.

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,600
Maybe that's blasphemous, I apologize.

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,520
But so the primary way that the movie is,

273
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
or that the ride is represented in the movie

274
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,680
is that Dwayne Johnson is a skipper,

275
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
Frank Wolf, Frank Wolf the skipper,

276
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,280
and you see him do kind of his normal jungle cruise.

277
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,280
I think his company is called the same thing

278
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,280
as it's jungle river expeditions, I wanna say.

279
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
Does that say, that seems like something, right?

280
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,560
I don't think I got it right.

281
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
But maybe I did.

282
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
Jungle navigation company?

283
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, could be, yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,080
All right, don't come at me jungle cruise people.

285
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,480
It's whatever it is in the ride, is what he does.

286
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,560
And he pretty quickly, upon meeting him,

287
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,680
after he swings around on the roof of the boat and stuff,

288
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,520
he is telling you corny jokes.

289
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,640
And they are completely received by the people

290
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,800
he's taking through the jungle as corny jokes.

291
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Within the world of it, they are groaning.

292
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,080
They do not like that.

293
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,040
Somebody's daughter seems particularly repulsed.

294
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
People want this to be over.

295
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Which is funny.

296
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,800
It's funny that they took that tack with,

297
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I guess the attitude with the jokes since the 50s

298
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,080
or whenever they started doing the jokes

299
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,760
has always been a little groany.

300
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,200
But I don't know that it's ever been

301
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,720
how they're responded to in the film,

302
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,400
which is like, we hate you.

303
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
If you weren't strong, we would push you off of this boat.

304
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah, yeah, they're pretty disgusted with him in the boat.

305
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,760
Yeah, they react as if he's saying offensive.

306
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,320
They're just, oh, yeah.

307
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah, usually with a jungle cruise,

308
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,560
when I go on it once every year,

309
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,760
usually no one's paying attention to what the person's saying

310
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
and they're just sort of looking at the robots and stuff.

311
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,840
Yeah, but rarely are people going, oh.

312
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,920
So yes, it is an interesting take.

313
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Yeah, it's an interesting take for everyone.

314
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,640
But I guess it sort of lets you know a character

315
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,440
and it lets you know that he's not just swarthy

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,080
Dwayne Johnson.

317
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
Right.

318
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,920
These are his character Piccadillo's, is that correct?

319
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,280
You know that he's gonna be sort of annoying.

320
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,640
And that then when he, because when he meets

321
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,240
Emily Blunt, who is a doctor, a botanist,

322
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,640
they have this kind of standoffish relationship

323
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
where they're both calling each other, irritating a lot.

324
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,680
And that's, I guess, the core of his irritating,

325
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
that he's a skipper.

326
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,000
He likes this corny jokes.

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah.

328
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,720
And so it's joining on me now,

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,160
while he's getting booed in the Amazon over in London,

330
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,240
McGregor, Emily Blunt's brother,

331
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,880
is being booed by a group of like,

332
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,760
they seem to loosely imply a society

333
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
of some sort of explorers and adventurers,

334
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,480
but they just keep saying the society.

335
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
So he's getting booed.

336
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
Oh, I don't think I even put that together.

337
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,320
That's any fiction.

338
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,560
Oh, that was the society.

339
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Cause I asked you like 45 minutes or an hour in,

340
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,960
cause there was the talk of it having sea involved,

341
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
of course, the society of explorers and adventurers,

342
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,520
the very dense continuity that binds together,

343
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,920
mostly restaurants of the Disney parks, quick service.

344
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,160
Big water slides, that kind of thing.

345
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah, water slides, a room in a cruise ship.

346
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,320
But yeah, I was thinking there would be more

347
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,520
of that mythology, but they kept it very vague.

348
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
Yeah, and they kept it vague.

349
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,320
I mean, I think it's that they have a crate of artifacts

350
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,280
from Dr. Albert Falls' expedition to the Amazon.

351
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
And I guess that's more of the bigger sea nod,

352
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,800
because the rest of sea is kind of like these

353
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,600
faceless stuffy English blowhard,

354
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
like guys who are very regressive at the idea of,

355
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,640
whimsical mythology and women having agency.

356
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,480
Right.

357
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,240
So they didn't wanna sully the name of sea

358
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,280
with the full name of sea,

359
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,080
because if Ronald D. Moore is gonna do a version where

360
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,560
it's not just a bunch of old colonizers,

361
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,680
a bunch of old white colonizers,

362
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,800
then they want it to be a little more pure

363
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,560
so they can make it into a more progressive group.

364
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,760
I think that's accurate.

365
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,920
I was expecting what would happen is they would come back

366
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,280
from the Amazon and they would take over the society

367
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,960
and go like, we're doing it different now.

368
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
You know? I see.

369
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,560
This is fun and not stuffy.

370
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,040
This is about embracing adventure and excitement.

371
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,120
Yeah, that didn't really happen.

372
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,240
They come back and drive a car.

373
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,880
Spoiler alert, they drive a car.

374
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
They drive a car badly.

375
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
It's sort of like a little pat.

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
It feels very Paddington at the end.

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,280
That's a spoiler, but it feels like kind of a goofy,

378
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,080
like little, like brightly colored antics.

379
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
I guess is what I'm thinking.

380
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,320
What's the like, how do you distill

382
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
what Emily Blunt is doing?

383
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,160
She is trying to find medicine in the jar,

384
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,080
or like the elements of medicine in a magic tree

385
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,800
that will change the course of medicine.

386
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,720
And she is thrust into the rickety boat

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
of this joke prone skipper to do so

388
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,880
and gets more than she bargained for.

389
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,640
Looking for a magical MacGuffin that will cure all illness.

390
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,480
Pick up magic.

391
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,080
Did she get it? I don't remember.

392
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, she gets it.

393
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,120
Yeah, spoiler for the end of the movie.

394
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,600
She gets it and then she uses it not to cure illness

395
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,360
to break a curse.

396
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,880
And then I guess by her good deed, one more bloom happens.

397
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,240
So it seems to be implied at the end that she does get it

398
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,480
and she'll be able to.

399
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
Okay, I am confused about this as well.

400
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,440
So she gets a, she used up the thing

401
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,800
that could like cure any disease

402
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,120
to save spoiler alert The Rock?

403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,800
Yeah, The Rock who turns out to be a 400 year old,

404
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
Whoa, whoa.

405
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,320
You know, curse conquistador.

406
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,640
Now that's a spoiler alert.

407
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,880
The Rock is 400 years old.

408
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,160
Yeah, that's right.

409
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,920
It's definitely where I perked up again

410
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,080
because I just like broad strokes.

411
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,240
I was enjoying this for the first half and like,

412
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,280
wow, this is real adventure

413
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
and there's kind of some indie vibes

414
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
and it's not all CGI goop.

415
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
And then in the last half was a little more CGI goop

416
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,880
and got a little more confusing.

417
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,360
And I stopped paying attention as much

418
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,520
because I was very tired.

419
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,560
And then you hear him say,

420
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,080
so I'm approximately 400 years old

421
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,120
and then, oh, I'm listening again.

422
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,200
Okay, that's quite a number.

423
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, he gets stabbed at one point.

424
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
And I think at that point, I'm like, all right,

425
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,840
she's either gonna use the flower on him

426
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,880
or he's 400, he's cursed too.

427
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
And it ended up being both.

428
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
The answer was both.

429
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,120
The answer for a lot of the questions in this movie

430
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,400
is like, oh, both more, more, more.

431
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,520
Both or all, all of it.

432
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
All.

433
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,040
Like, what did you get from the buffet?

434
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Oh, everything.

435
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,040
I tried all items.

436
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,880
Yes, I agree.

437
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,720
There was a, they threw a lot out

438
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,760
because I think, yeah, the first hour is a simpler.

439
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,120
There's a lot of nonsense happening and a lot of it's fun.

440
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
But then they start throwing like this,

441
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
like there's a section where I feel like,

442
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,280
and I know this isn't right,

443
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,240
but it feels like The Rock is explaining stuff

444
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,120
to Emily Blunt for 15 minutes.

445
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
That's too long.

446
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,520
That's not right, but it felt to me like,

447
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
he's still explaining things.

448
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,360
And we're like 75% of the way through the movie.

449
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
Yeah, they didn't.

450
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,040
I mean, there's so much going on at a certain point.

451
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,000
And a lot of it is they're like,

452
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,080
they're cherry picking so many elements of like other movies.

453
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
Like them not getting along

454
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
and on a boat going down a river,

455
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,280
that is the African queen pretty much.

456
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,560
The Humphrey Bogart, a Catherine Hepburn movie.

457
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,520
There's a fight in a marketplace

458
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,240
that is Raiders of the Lost Ark.

459
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,560
There's a brother who is like kind of easily befuddled

460
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,720
and doesn't wanna be there.

461
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,680
That's in the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies.

462
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
What else?

463
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,960
There was like a handful more things where I was like-

464
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,120
Isn't Romancing the Stone

465
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,480
kinda like this a little bit too, like similar dynamic?

466
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,640
I saw, yeah, I saw some reviews mention Romancing the Stone.

467
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Zombie Conquistadors are kind of similar to zombie pirates

468
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,080
from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

469
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,640
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,480
Yeah.

471
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,960
But you gotta give it up for one plot element

472
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,960
that is pretty rare to find, which is a bee man.

473
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,920
There's a meat, there's a,

474
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,440
we got a man made entirely out of human bees.

475
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
There is a character just like swarm.

476
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,000
Marvel owns like, or yeah,

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,520
Marvel owns swarm technically,

478
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
but Sony can make a movie, I guess, of swarm.

479
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,440
But yes, finally swarm, a version of swarm from Spider-Man.

480
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
And of course, most importantly,

481
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,400
Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark,

482
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,520
the performance on David Letterman.

483
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes.

484
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
A freak like me needs company.

485
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
Yes. So finally we have a man made of bees.

486
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
On screen.

487
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,880
On screen, yes.

488
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
Right, yeah.

489
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,960
Represented in the movies.

490
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
It was pretty great.

491
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
Oh, there's another element I forgot about

492
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,960
from the African Queen that is so specific,

493
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,920
which that movie involves blowing up

494
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,920
a German warship during World War I.

495
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,960
And this one involves out maneuvering a German submarine

496
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,160
in the middle of World War I.

497
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,760
World War I is going on during this movie

498
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,120
on the other side of the world.

499
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,600
That's another big element.

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,440
Mm-hmm.

501
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes, there's a lot of, yeah,

502
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,720
that you had to explain to me what era we were in.

503
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,280
But yeah, there's just a lot.

504
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
Like you look at Indiana Jones,

505
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,520
and I know this is gonna sound like old man.

506
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm gonna sound like very old fashioned here,

507
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,000
but it's so, a lot of older movies,

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
it feels very much simpler.

509
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
They were trying to figure out how to make a movie very lean

510
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,720
and feel like it kind of just floated by.

511
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,880
And it does feel like most movies now are like,

512
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,240
we're literally going to pummel you with visual information

513
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,080
and just exposition as information.

514
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,600
And there's gonna be a ton of stuff going on

515
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
everywhere you look.

516
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
And that's not necessarily World War I

517
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
going out at the same time,

518
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
but I'm just saying in general,

519
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,720
this is how it was feeling.

520
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
It was simple, it was like,

521
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,000
you think about Indiana Jones,

522
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,640
it's, there's a guy, he's an adventurer.

523
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
He is at a nuclear testing site.

524
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,880
He hides in a refrigerator, some gophers pop up.

525
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,880
He has a greaser son who uses a knife, but it's a comb.

526
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,360
He, they need a big snake to pull him out of the pit

527
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
and he doesn't like snakes.

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,240
Yes, monkey, he swings in the trees as the monkeys do.

529
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,080
It's a simpler.

530
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,520
There's a crystal skull.

531
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,720
Yes, it's paired down.

532
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
And the aliens show up at the end

533
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,520
and their treasure was knowledge.

534
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
The knowledge was the treasure.

535
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,160
So if you think about that,

536
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,160
just why can't Jungle Cruise be as clean as Indiana Jones?

537
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,040
Yes, I completely agree.

538
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,240
It's my point exactly.

539
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,240
So yeah, so there's, so it's hard,

540
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,640
cause really when we start explaining the movie,

541
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,320
we sound like we're out of our minds.

542
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,800
You'd be like, that's in this movie too?

543
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,680
Yeah, as we jump around 400 years old and bees and

544
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,800
it sounds like we're making the movie up.

545
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah, a little bit.

546
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,480
That didn't like, I didn't get that sense from the trailer

547
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,480
that he was 400 years old or that there were mutant bees,

548
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
a mutant bee man in there.

549
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,120
But you need your surprises.

550
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,960
Let me say this.

551
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,800
I like the idea that the Jungle Cruise movie

552
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,520
is not beholden to any particular shape or events or

553
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,720
things that need to happen,

554
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
other than like a little bit of representation

555
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,360
of elements from the ride,

556
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,000
a little bit of the spirit of the ride,

557
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,560
which I think was in there.

558
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,760
I think they did embrace just like,

559
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,320
well, this can be any crazy movie we want it to be

560
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,440
as long as the title is that.

561
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
So I give them points for the creativity,

562
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,720
especially with the rock being eternal

563
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,440
and there being a bee man.

564
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,640
Yes.

565
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
It felt like they were trying,

566
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,760
this is trying to pick up the mantle

567
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,280
of the Pirates franchise as well.

568
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I, cause Pirates gets, Pirates is like a fantastical

569
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,760
by the end of the first movie,

570
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,440
but not like crazy in your face.

571
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,080
So, but then as Pirates goes on,

572
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,480
it's like, it gets really wild with like the Kraken and

573
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,720
like different sea monsters and whatever.

574
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,800
And that stuff, that stuff is fun.

575
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,480
I don't, I don't, I like that stuff in general.

576
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,600
So it definitely felt like they were like,

577
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
we need to build this thing out.

578
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,520
So there's a lot of like worlds for us to do six more

579
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Jungle Cruise movies.

580
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
There needs to be a lot going on in the world.

581
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,040
So we have some like threads for other, other installments.

582
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
But they kind of floor it.

583
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Like they get all a lot of stuff in the,

584
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,560
in this presumably first one.

585
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,200
Presumably. Yeah.

586
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,960
And including like a 2020s era,

587
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,120
like filmmaking indulgences like,

588
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
oh, everything is very crystal clear.

589
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,760
No one is dirty despite being in the Amazon

590
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,800
in the African queen,

591
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,240
Humphrey Bogart and Catherine Hepburn

592
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
within a few minutes are disgusting.

593
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,560
They're filthy.

594
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,520
And that was- Jason, you kept saying that.

595
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
You're like, I want them to be,

596
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,760
I want them to be messier.

597
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,720
You kept saying.

598
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah. Indiana Jones.

599
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
It should be dirty boys, messy boys.

600
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,920
And you were playing- Indiana Jones

601
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,720
and Marion are pretty beat up and like scuzzy

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
by the end of Raiders.

603
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,320
You were playing in the dirt too,

604
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,240
when you kept saying that,

605
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,480
cause we were in the backyard.

606
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,760
I was playing in the dirt.

607
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,840
I wanted them to get dirty too.

608
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,280
It only stuck out with me cause there's some very obvious

609
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,600
like 3D shots.

610
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,640
Yes. And then I started to notice how like,

611
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,560
wow, everything is very brightly lit.

612
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,280
It's that great. It's that weird part early on

613
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,200
where they're, you're heading straight for a tree branch.

614
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,040
And like, what's one of the only things in the movie

615
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,360
shot like this, where a branch is coming right at you.

616
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,880
That is very, like very weird to be watching not

617
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,480
in a 3D setting or in a theater for that matter.

618
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,320
Yeah.

619
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,280
That may as well have been the Muppets 3D,

620
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,480
where like the, no, what's his name?

621
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,320
Grant, what's, what's the character's name?

622
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
I apologize.

623
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
The 3D Muppet.

624
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
The Spear Waldo. Waldo C. Grafik.

625
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,560
Waldo C. Grafik. Thank you.

626
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,320
When he's got, he shoots his nose at you.

627
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Yeah, that may as well have been that.

628
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
And they really keep going back to it too.

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
It's not like a quick thing.

630
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,560
It's like, this is 3D.

631
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,080
They should, if they really wanted to show it off,

632
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,560
they should have had a big boa constrictor

633
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,840
that swallowed a yo-yo and it's tied to his tongue.

634
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,960
So every time his mouth opens.

635
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
Mm-hmm.

636
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Please Skippa, we're being whipped in the head

637
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,560
with the yo-yo again.

638
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,200
Yeah, that I was, I wondered like, did they put that in?

639
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,160
Cause like, were they planning on having like

640
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,480
a theme park preview and they would have played

641
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,440
this part in the theme park?

642
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,680
I don't know if that's really. Oh, interesting.

643
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
The way that they'll show just a little bit of,

644
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,600
yeah, yeah, that would have been a good zone.

645
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,520
Cause yeah, that would have been,

646
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,800
that would have been the scene to show.

647
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,360
It's got the most theme park jungle crew stuff in it.

648
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,960
And everybody gets 3D glasses before they would go in there,

649
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,520
whether it be the Muppets Theater before Mickey's

650
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,360
Filar Magic or the, whatever, the Captain Neo Theater.

651
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,960
So maybe it would make sense.

652
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,000
Cause it's the only thing that's so blatantly like 3D

653
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
like that.

654
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,320
Well, when he falls, I think there's someone jumps

655
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,400
or falls and throws an arrowhead.

656
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
There's an arrowhead that's very important

657
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
to the plot of this movie.

658
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
But it's not, it's kind of an arrowhead.

659
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
Yeah, I don't know.

660
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
There's other stuff.

661
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,880
There's like weird, like there's very cumbersome.

662
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,560
They try very hard to go like, and by the way,

663
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,760
people in the past were stupid and regressive,

664
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
but in the future where this movie was made,

665
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,960
we're on the right side of things.

666
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,640
But then they try to have it both ways.

667
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Like Emily Blunt's, the brother character McGregor is gay,

668
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,080
but he's a kind, and he comes out to the rock

669
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,920
and the rock accepts that and is fine with it.

670
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,960
But then he's kind of a caricature,

671
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,880
like the rest of the movie.

672
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,280
And so I don't quite know what they were trying to do there.

673
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Similarly, the indigenous tribe,

674
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,240
I don't know what you were supposed to take away.

675
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,520
The leader of them is Trader Sam.

676
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,000
She speaks perfect English.

677
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,560
The rest of them do not speak English.

678
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,960
And so they just took all of the like indigenous people

679
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,040
out of the ride, but in the movie,

680
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,640
they're like amazed by this British aristocrat

681
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,360
and his golf clubs.

682
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
And then they are also scam artists.

683
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,240
They are in on the scams that the rock runs

684
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,520
with his riverboat tourists.

685
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,960
So I'm like, what were you trying to do here?

686
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,280
What was the takeaway with this?

687
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,400
Well, I mean, I would first, I would say like,

688
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
at least unlike Loki, they didn't just like write down

689
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,800
on a piece of paper that the character was gay.

690
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,720
I was like, that was a good, that was a positive step

691
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,560
in the right direction.

692
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,640
It was a secret.

693
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
Like now we know it, but it's not right now.

694
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,280
It's not reflected in any scene or dialogue or

695
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,120
but in the script, but it's like Disney gets, you know,

696
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,120
you like, it's at this point, like you get such little

697
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,680
amounts of any of this stuff.

698
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
You're like, oh, wow.

699
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,520
Like, it feels like a huge step and you're like,

700
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,080
what year is it again?

701
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,920
Yeah. Why was the dialogue so cumbersome in that?

702
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,840
So like they were trying to say it, but also like hide it.

703
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,400
Well, I know this is like, we gotta make sure

704
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,920
that like it'll go over grandma's head

705
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,000
if she's upset about something like this.

706
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,960
But if you know, you know, it's still like, just,

707
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,040
I don't know, say it.

708
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,520
I don't know.

709
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,360
Is it really gonna, is the world gonna fall apart?

710
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,680
If the character says that like, I am gay, I don't know.

711
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,360
It's crazy at this point, but Disney's like so conservative.

712
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
You're right.

713
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,360
They got one more generation to get through

714
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,800
and then once they're not watching things anymore.

715
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,080
And then yeah, in 35 years,

716
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,000
in 35 years, they'll do like a Lucas style edit

717
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,960
where they edit in him saying, I am gay.

718
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,400
And then the rock will say, I accept that.

719
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
And then that'll be it.

720
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,320
And then people like retroactively,

721
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,640
you'll think they had done something

722
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,320
that was more progressive.

723
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,480
They, in the same, like with Emily Blunt's character is,

724
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,120
is, you know, has so many lines about like, yeah,

725
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,400
I am wearing pants and I am a doctor and scientists.

726
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,000
And it's like, okay, yeah, that's, that's cool.

727
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
I like her and she does a lot of fun stuff.

728
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,040
She gets to do fight scenes.

729
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,240
She gets to do pratfalls.

730
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,840
She gets to be the competent one.

731
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
And then I remember like, isn't this the same company

732
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,720
that blurred a butt from like a 30 year old movie?

733
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,360
Like what, what is the direction of this movie?

734
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,200
Splash?

735
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,040
Splash?

736
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,080
They blurred like.

737
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Right, right, right, right.

738
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,920
Yeah, Bo Derek walking away.

739
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Jason, if you're trying to look for like perfect cohesive

740
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,880
rules, I think you're, you're going to be really lost here.

741
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,080
Cause obviously some of this shit doesn't make any sense.

742
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,960
I, you, I, one of you said like,

743
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,280
I think we had all watched space jam separately.

744
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,760
And, and, or maybe it was set on blank check that you can

745
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,520
just feel the notes in that movie.

746
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,160
And I was like, oh, you can feel the notes in this movie.

747
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,280
You can see, feel the executive notes in this one.

748
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,120
Yeah. I mean, I, they're,

749
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,440
they're all over the place with certain things.

750
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,960
I mean, if as far as like there was Darryl Hannah's nude,

751
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,800
but is that right?

752
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
You can't see that on Disney plus.

753
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
Is that what the deal is?

754
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
I think she's wearing a bathing suit,

755
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,520
but it's just like slightly too revealing.

756
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,360
It's too much.

757
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,200
Plus standards.

758
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,240
It's too much, but for Disney standards.

759
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah. For the regular viewers of them,

760
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,960
the mysterious Benedict society,

761
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,400
you don't want the children scandalized.

762
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,520
I mean, the cut, look, it should be on Hulu. Okay.

763
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,680
That's where that should live.

764
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,280
Hulu is for that rowdier entertainment.

765
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,920
Now of course I'm pro censoring bathing suits.

766
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,760
People in bathing suits.

767
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,640
Well, I know who I'm talking to.

768
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,600
But no, you're, you're correct that all this stuff

769
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,480
is a little bit all over the place.

770
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,320
And I would imagine.

771
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,960
Ariel should be in a one piece.

772
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,280
I think that's what I said at the time.

773
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,640
I said that at the time I was a little,

774
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I said Ariel should be in a one piece.

775
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,160
What is she doing?

776
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,440
And then when I was, I was what?

777
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Multiple shells, shells down to the navel.

778
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,160
Bigger shells.

779
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,280
One big, she should be in one big shell mommy.

780
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,640
I said, I'm fine.

781
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,320
Isn't it what you don't see?

782
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,720
Doesn't that make it more intriguing?

783
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,360
Think about it.

784
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,160
Yeah. So, you know, I, you know what side I've been on

785
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,680
as far as, as bathing suits censoring,

786
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but yes, no, you're correct at all.

787
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,040
If you really want to track all this stuff,

788
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,920
it's not going to all be,

789
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,960
it's not going to all be on the exact same scale.

790
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,680
Can you not go on Disney Plus and see

791
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,680
when Roger Rabbit runs by a sign that says rigid tools?

792
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,120
That's my favorite of the things of that era

793
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,520
when they were, when there were the little hidden things,

794
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,640
because some of them are like, I don't know,

795
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,200
is the priest getting a boner and little mermaid or is,

796
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,560
are they really whispering all teenage,

797
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,800
all good teenagers have sex?

798
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,920
Is that what's being said?

799
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,640
And take off their clothes.

800
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
That's what it is. Yeah.

801
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
Yeah.

802
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,040
Some of them are like, I don't know, maybe, but for sure.

803
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,320
And I made, I made sure I Googled it.

804
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,360
Rigid tools Disney.

805
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,040
It's a very satisfying search to do.

806
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,360
And the thing is not the most offensive thing

807
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
you've ever seen.

808
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,280
It's just like a woman,

809
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,000
it's a woman in a bikini grinding on a saw.

810
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
It's so weird.

811
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Just that phrase is so insane that it's in.

812
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,960
I don't even remember which short it's in, but yeah.

813
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
They're letting me do it.

814
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,480
Rigid tools should be in the background of every movie.

815
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
Should have been in the lookers too.

816
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,320
Is that, is that, and you're asking if we can see that?

817
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,840
Cause I don't, is that on Disney plus?

818
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,240
I don't believe, I don't know if the short is,

819
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,760
I forget which one it's from.

820
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,200
I'm sure that's just a Google away.

821
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,640
Trail mix up is the name of the short.

822
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,760
Well, we'll look into it.

823
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,080
And if it is, I will write an email to Disney

824
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,240
telling them to take it down.

825
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,080
I'm sure it's, I think this was a,

826
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,120
I think the reason that anyone even knew about this

827
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,800
was laser discs.

828
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,440
Oh yeah, look at this, I've never read this.

829
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,240
They, they suddenly recalled all the laser discs

830
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,920
and people asked, hey Disney,

831
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,880
why'd you recall the one laser disc

832
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,040
that had that one cartoon?

833
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,520
And they said, inadequate gluing.

834
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,840
Oh.

835
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,280
Which then they're throwing the laser disc company

836
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,680
under the bus and they, they had to come out and say,

837
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,360
look, our gluing is perfectly,

838
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,040
we have never had issues with the gluing.

839
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,200
If Disney wants to recall a cartoon for any other reason,

840
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,440
that's their prerogative.

841
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,320
Inadequate, inadequate gluing also sounds disgusting.

842
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
That also sounds filthy.

843
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,960
That could also be on a poster behind.

844
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah, that's gross too.

845
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,400
But that's, you know, what's funny about this is,

846
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,360
you know, Disney of course just had this big

847
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,680
public argument or whatever with Scarlett Johansson

848
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
because she sued Disney because of the profits

849
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,440
for Black Widow because they put it on streaming.

850
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,000
So it wasn't technically what she negotiated in a contract.

851
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,280
And they were very petulant in the response,

852
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,240
basically saying, how can you do this to us

853
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,320
during a pandemic?

854
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,040
But they were just real shitty

855
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,000
and they were shitty to that laser disc company.

856
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,160
It seems like nothing's changed there at least.

857
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,680
They're on the same type of response

858
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,440
that they've had for 30 plus years.

859
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,280
Yeah.

860
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,680
Well, they've always been,

861
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,640
there's that story about them suing a preschool

862
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,960
that without permission painted the characters on the wall.

863
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,160
That's when they were real moths.

864
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,920
I think maybe they're better at hiding it now.

865
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,760
Like, let's see if we can do these things quietly.

866
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
But you'd think they'd be much better though.

867
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,640
And when they told the LA Times,

868
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,800
they weren't allowed to review movies earlier,

869
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,760
like anymore because they gave something,

870
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,960
or no, they printed that Disneyland article

871
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,080
that was criticizing the way they were paying people.

872
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,760
And they were like, well, you aren't gonna get

873
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,600
to watch our movies early then.

874
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,240
And then a bunch of movie reviewers were like,

875
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,440
all right, we gotta boycott you until you turn this back.

876
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Yeah. Yeah.

877
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,960
It seems like they really can't hide the petulance.

878
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,240
The Scarlet thing was like extremely old school.

879
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,080
That's crazy.

880
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,160
That's like what a studio would have done in the 30s.

881
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

882
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,280
That's like some-

883
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,720
This dumb broad.

884
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
She doesn't even know there's a disease out there.

885
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,680
Some guy with a big cigar,

886
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,960
some cartoonish executive.

887
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeah. Just like, take a note.

888
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,800
Take a note.

889
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
Print this verbatim.

890
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,960
Print whatever I say.

891
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,120
I don't even want a second guess from you.

892
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,240
And they did and they printed it.

893
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,960
And everyone was like, geez.

894
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,400
And I would encourage all of my screen actor comrades,

895
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,640
you sued, Disney should always be being sued all the time.

896
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,800
Like all comic book writers who created stuff

897
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
that's in the movies.

898
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Yeah. Yeah, sue them.

899
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,640
The only way they get paid is they come out

900
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,480
and go like, I have made,

901
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,480
like Ed Brubaker co-created The Winter Soldier was like,

902
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,240
I made more money doing a cameo in the movie

903
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,080
than any residuals from creating like this kind of

904
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,880
new spin of a character, you know?

905
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,600
And it's like, yeah, everyone should be suing

906
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,160
for the shares of these billions of dollars they reap.

907
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,080
ABS, always be suing.

908
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,920
That's right.

909
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
That's what we're saying here.

910
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,240
Start the suit and then think of a reason.

911
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,760
Just like get it moving and then you'll figure it out.

912
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,560
It'll like, you know, like having a deadline

913
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,120
will prompt you to figure it out.

914
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,240
Yeah, of course. It's California.

915
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,080
They're in California.

916
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,160
This is the most, one of the most litigious states

917
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,000
in the nation.

918
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,760
It's just second nature to just be in the courts.

919
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,920
Are we a litigious state?

920
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,760
Is that really?

921
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,680
I think it's a pretty litigious state, isn't it?

922
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,240
How do you determine that?

923
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,400
I don't know.

924
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,960
I gotta look into this.

925
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,560
Well, that says that on all the postcards.

926
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Yeah.

927
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,760
If you went down Hollywood Boulevard.

928
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,200
The most litigious state in the nation.

929
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,840
You know, just so we don't get too far

930
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,160
without talking about it,

931
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,360
there is a component of this movie

932
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,120
that I think we're all very fond of.

933
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,640
And that is, I'm so excited to say his name.

934
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,920
Nilo Nemolato.

935
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,400
It's Nemo Nemolato, everybody.

936
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
Paul Giamatti's character.

937
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,800
Did I know his full name while watching it?

938
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,640
I can't say I did.

939
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,520
I had to look it up.

940
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,640
I had to know.

941
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,280
I did not know Paul Giamatti was in the movie.

942
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
I guess I never saw a trailer.

943
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,520
What a delight and what an insane look.

944
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
What an insane voice.

945
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,600
I think sometimes I fail to add up

946
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,440
how much I love Paul Giamatti

947
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,040
and the many faces of Paul Giamatti

948
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,200
from dyed blue and big fat liar

949
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,360
to quite noble as John Adams

950
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,960
to looking very insane as Nilo Nemolato

951
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,960
who charges Skipper Frank to perk in his dock.

952
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,880
Love him, right?

953
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,440
Like he's, that was all great.

954
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,960
I was really hoping there was gonna be a lot more of him.

955
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,640
Him and I also, I love that they cast Jesse Plemons

956
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,760
in this movie, a great actor.

957
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,880
And they, I don't know if they encouraged him

958
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,080
or this was his choice.

959
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
They probably encouraged him,

960
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,320
but he's doing a like Colonel Clink German act,

961
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,640
like a cartoon German accent that I,

962
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
it's just a funny choice.

963
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
Yeah, he's in a submarine.

964
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,560
He's in a crazy military dress for a while.

965
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,760
There's a scene where he plays off a CGI beat.

966
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,480
Like he's having an interaction with a CGI B.

967
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,440
Oh yeah, that's nuts.

968
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,800
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, more of this.

969
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,480
And also you have these two great actors.

970
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,360
I think you have your antagonists.

971
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,000
I think you don't need.

972
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,120
Yeah, resurrected conquistadors

973
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,600
being cursed by the jungle itself.

974
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,080
That's sort of what I was sort of saying earlier

975
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,640
where there's all of a sudden this big exposition thing.

976
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,040
It's like all of a sudden there's like a new bad guy.

977
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,840
And I was like, I thought we had,

978
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,920
I thought the German guy was the bad guy.

979
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,560
He was shooting at them in a tank or not a tank,

980
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
excuse me, a submarine.

981
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,440
Submarine movie.

982
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,600
He's such a clear, fun, old school bad guy.

983
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,320
Like both Jesse Plummons and Paul Giamatti

984
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,600
felt to me like it was like 60s movie performances.

985
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,560
It was like, I don't really know what the movie Skadoo is,

986
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,320
but it's like a big nuts movie

987
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,160
with Groucho Marx and a zillion cameos.

988
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
And you could tell nobody's like thinking

989
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,640
about what the character is.

990
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,480
They're all just like, all right, what is it?

991
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
Yeah, I'll come have fun with you.

992
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,640
And that's how these guys, like, they just, I don't know,

993
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,440
there's a very, or like maybe like a mad,

994
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,640
mad world kind of quality to it.

995
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,040
Like they're just like having a blast.

996
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,080
You're not really supposed to buy

997
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,560
that there anybody but them.

998
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,640
You just go, Jesse Plummons is a crazy German guy

999
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,880
and Paul Giamatti is a crazy Italian guy, I think.

1000
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,080
I think.

1001
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
It's something.

1002
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,840
It's sort of, it almost feels like New Orleans-y too.

1003
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,520
It's a big accent collision that I really enjoyed.

1004
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,240
They both could have been Batman 66 villains.

1005
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah, absolutely.

1006
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,760
That's how it felt actually.

1007
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,640
Jesse Plummons driving the tank around.

1008
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,640
That felt exactly like the penguin shooting missiles.

1009
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,440
Find some actors that'd be like,

1010
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,720
look, there's no restrictions

1011
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,520
for how much scenery you can chew.

1012
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,840
You can do whatever you want, like just go nuts.

1013
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,920
Yeah.

1014
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,320
I think that's right.

1015
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,200
And I think the best parts of the movie have that vibe.

1016
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,960
Like I like the Emily Blunt is like in disguise

1017
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,520
in a library and there's a bunch of crazy ladder antics.

1018
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,240
And I was like, oh, I'm into that.

1019
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,840
I also want to say, I don't think this is a bad movie.

1020
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,680
I think it's just like a complicate,

1021
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,720
like unnecessarily complicated overburdened movie.

1022
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,560
Like-

1023
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,120
You're a money third act.

1024
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,240
Yeah.

1025
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,160
When we were watching it, everyone seemed to be like,

1026
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
oh, okay, yeah, that's all right.

1027
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,200
That's all right.

1028
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,520
And then one of you said, how long is left?

1029
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,080
And we pulled it up and it's at 36 minutes that we went,

1030
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,200
oh, no.

1031
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,320
Well, and more drinks were gotten and you know,

1032
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
maybe we're-

1033
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

1034
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Might be why we're fuzzier.

1035
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,800
You know, if you think we're moving on

1036
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,560
from Nilo Nemolaro, we're not.

1037
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,200
We're talking about Nilo Nemolaro today.

1038
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I sensed it.

1039
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,720
Jason went and moved fast and I go,

1040
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,320
Scott is not done with Nilo.

1041
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,080
No, I'm fine with that.

1042
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,160
I didn't mean to divert the flow of the river.

1043
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,480
No, I'm completely, yeah.

1044
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,040
The river's flowing back to Nilo as it always has and will.

1045
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,920
Cause I looked up about his making the choice

1046
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,920
and cause we were talking about it.

1047
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,480
It just seemed like, it almost felt like he said,

1048
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,800
I will do this movie if I can do a voice

1049
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
that I've never done in a movie before.

1050
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,560
And the reality of it was sort of, because he, okay,

1051
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,360
so he's in like kind of a seersucker suit

1052
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,840
and he's got a crazy mustache and he's got a cockatoo.

1053
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,840
And so his actual story on this, this is from Men's Health,

1054
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,440
was that he was asked to join the movie

1055
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,480
and there was not a lot of character there.

1056
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
And they just said, do something with it.

1057
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,600
Just make this more than is there.

1058
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,280
And then he started thinking about the accent

1059
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,600
and then he said, here's what I want.

1060
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,400
I want to have a monkey who lights my cigars.

1061
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,640
And that's, then I will do the movie.

1062
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,720
And they talked to him more and they said,

1063
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,680
well, this is Disney,

1064
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,840
so cigars are not really on the table for us.

1065
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,680
Oh man.

1066
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,280
And also just monkey logistics

1067
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,260
is gonna be a little crazy.

1068
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,480
And then he said, what about a cockatoo?

1069
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,580
And they said, yes.

1070
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,720
And then he was in and he,

1071
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,240
then he spoke very eloquently about loving birds

1072
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,520
and how he's worked with birds before

1073
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,120
and how you like form a special connection with them.

1074
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,000
And he thought about adopting the bird.

1075
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,400
He almost like, wow.

1076
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Like he would have become Nilo Nimalado in real life.

1077
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,680
Just always, Paul Giamatti always had a cockatoo.

1078
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,000
With him.

1079
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,360
That would be awesome.

1080
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, how else could you like him more?

1081
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,040
If he, oh, I know.

1082
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,920
If he always had a bird on talk shows

1083
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,920
and red carpets wherever he goes, the best.

1084
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,600
Oh, more co, and the cockatoo is written out pretty early.

1085
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,240
I would, if the cockatoo was like a wisecracking

1086
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,800
throughout it, I would be like, okay,

1087
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,320
yeah, fun summer movie.

1088
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,000
But like, no, get them out of here.

1089
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,040
The cockatoo does say something.

1090
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,080
I think something about like,

1091
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,960
Frank has my money or something.

1092
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,880
Frank owes me money.

1093
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,400
Frank owes me money.

1094
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,200
So then I was like, well, I like this cockatoo a lot.

1095
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,720
And is there more there?

1096
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,640
Is there, like, did the cockatoo have a name

1097
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,320
and was this cut or anything?

1098
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,920
And this is really why I'm bringing it back to this point.

1099
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,440
The cockatoo's name is Rosita.

1100
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,560
That's Rosita, you guys.

1101
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,280
We all missed it.

1102
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,760
That's the bird from the tropical hideaway,

1103
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,040
which thus ties Enchanted Tiki Room and all this.

1104
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,680
That's the bird that's missing from Enchanted Tiki Room,

1105
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,640
who's been the animatronic

1106
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,920
at the Jungle Cruise Adjacent Restaurant for a while.

1107
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,840
Yeah, that's Rosita.

1108
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Like, and that's a weird other, like,

1109
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
why didn't we know that?

1110
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,600
Why wasn't that broadcasted?

1111
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,000
Is that even said out loud?

1112
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,120
I don't know, did we miss it?

1113
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,320
I don't know.

1114
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,200
That's a wow, yeah.

1115
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
No, I don't even know if that was said out loud.

1116
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,000
That's just an extra little thing.

1117
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,960
That makes me love the movie suddenly more,

1118
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,720
knowing that, like, they tied, like,

1119
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,560
a pretty obscure animatronic into, it's in it.

1120
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,720
Pretty neat. Yeah.

1121
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,200
It is in it, wow.

1122
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,080
That is okay.

1123
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,920
Well, I like that.

1124
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,680
And it also makes me feel like bases are more covered

1125
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,840
in terms of putting in little Disney nerd Easter eggs.

1126
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,240
Like, that's a pretty big one.

1127
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,600
It wasn't in the way.

1128
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
I enjoyed the cockatoo,

1129
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
but they didn't hit you over the head with it either.

1130
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,920
Great.

1131
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,840
Love Rosita, love Nilo, and then Malato.

1132
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah, Malato.

1133
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,720
Wow, that's great.

1134
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,920
I brought up Scott, Giamatti, and Amazing Spider-Man 2.

1135
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,280
And Jason, you have not seen this either, correct?

1136
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah, correct.

1137
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,520
But I remember, like, the paparazzi pictures

1138
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,440
when they were shooting was very funny,

1139
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,080
and the rig was-

1140
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,520
I just want to show you guys, just,

1141
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,880
I know this indulged me for a second here.

1142
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm here live on Park Avenue and 56th Street,

1143
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,000
where it is complete chaos.

1144
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,520
A man in some sort of weaponized armored suit

1145
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,320
is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1146
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,280
He's so giddy in this giant suit.

1147
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,160
So he's, yeah, so he's a-

1148
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,840
he's like a Russian gangster guy.

1149
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,720
This is very insane.

1150
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,040
This is the end of the movie.

1151
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,000
Good boy.

1152
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,480
Huh?

1153
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,040
This is the performance you do in a Muppet movie.

1154
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes.

1155
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,600
So anyway, I mean, you get the-

1156
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Yeah, boy.

1157
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,040
I was this enthusiastic about him

1158
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,320
even before he was Dr. Eugene Landy.

1159
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,640
So imagine after, when I watch him, you know,

1160
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,320
smacking burgers out of poor Brian Wilson's mouth,

1161
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,920
now I'm like, this is one of the finest.

1162
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,120
What a gift.

1163
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,120
He's great.

1164
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,760
Yeah.

1165
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,600
And I think that's-

1166
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,920
I guess the disappointment for me

1167
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,400
is that there isn't more of him.

1168
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,600
Like, he's pretty much, like,

1169
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,080
it's sort of a 15-minute performance.

1170
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,880
And by the way, I got some of this info

1171
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,800
from an article in Decider by Anna Mento as the writer

1172
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,640
that was like, this character is a treasure.

1173
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,680
Like, there was a whole article about why this is great.

1174
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,480
And then went into the behind the scenes.

1175
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,760
So, you know, not the only Nilo head out there, Nilo.

1176
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
I might have said it wrong every time, I don't know.

1177
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,960
Put him on the ride of all the characters.

1178
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,280
Well, that's what I was gonna get at.

1179
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,520
I thought we could drive to that.

1180
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,400
Like, what, if they were gonna put anything

1181
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,560
from the movie into the ride.

1182
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,960
And yeah, for sure that.

1183
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,440
Where does he go though?

1184
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,240
One robot in every scene.

1185
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,920
Oh, man.

1186
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,440
Well, you know he's climbing the pole.

1187
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,840
That's a guy you want, like,

1188
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,280
yelling about being stuck on the pole.

1189
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,440
Maybe he's drowning in the water.

1190
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,400
Maybe piranhas are nipping at his heels.

1191
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,240
Perhaps, perhaps.

1192
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,920
Biting his stash.

1193
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
I don't hate that.

1194
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,760
I think, yeah, he could be.

1195
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,280
Writing a hippo.

1196
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,880
Oh, oh, he's in the hippo's mouth.

1197
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,520
Like, you just see like a hippo opens its mouth

1198
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,240
and like his head pokes out like, hey, help me.

1199
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,840
I'm being eaten alive.

1200
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes.

1201
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,560
Isn't this fun?

1202
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,040
Yes.

1203
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
None of us could attempt to do the voice.

1204
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,080
There's no, like, how would you even?

1205
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,920
I have to watch,

1206
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,560
I had to watch a movie a couple times.

1207
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,920
Yeah, I think, I was saying last night,

1208
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,720
I think it is supposed to be Italian

1209
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,480
because I believe there's a Italian expat population

1210
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,320
in Brazil or in South America.

1211
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,160
Okay, yeah.

1212
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,560
But it, yeah, it truly, it's very fun.

1213
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,800
You know, a thing I liked,

1214
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,480
I did like Proxima, the giant large cat,

1215
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,240
the rock's cat, as part of one of his scams.

1216
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,440
And there's a thing later in the movie

1217
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,920
that I thought very sweet,

1218
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,560
which was because the rock has lived for so long,

1219
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,040
he's had like every generation of this cat.

1220
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,840
Like he's adopted a new cat every time an old one dies

1221
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,200
and he names them all Proxima.

1222
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,880
And I was like, oh, that's nice.

1223
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,760
I like that.

1224
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,880
I'll accept the CG cat, the cute CG cat.

1225
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,080
So we put him in the CG cat hall of fame along with,

1226
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,520
what have, what, you know, father of the pride.

1227
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,680
Sarmati?

1228
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,920
Yeah, Sarmati.

1229
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,960
Yeah, does Proxima dethrone Sarmati?

1230
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,320
Don't we hate Sarmati?

1231
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah, we hated Sarmati.

1232
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,760
Yeah, Sarmati was extremely hateful.

1233
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,600
We really don't like it.

1234
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,720
Sarmati was most hateful.

1235
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah.

1236
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,360
You, I think Scott said early about Proxima,

1237
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,280
Proxima, is that what his name?

1238
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,120
Yeah.

1239
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,320
I think Scott said he looks so goofy,

1240
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,640
he may as well talk.

1241
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,280
Yeah, it's like close enough.

1242
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,920
Like, you know, it could be singing like,

1243
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,160
you know, John Favreau, Timon and Pumbaa.

1244
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,880
Yes, you know, and honestly,

1245
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,520
after they introduced all the fantastical stuff at the end,

1246
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,560
he may as well have started talking at the end.

1247
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,760
Like, oh, by the way, I can talk.

1248
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,240
Like just a quick one at the end.

1249
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,880
What a cruise.

1250
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,920
It's a livin'.

1251
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,200
Yeah.

1252
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,320
But I, yes, I agree.

1253
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,440
I like that, that he has all the cats.

1254
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,520
The rock is the rock.

1255
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,040
He does his rock thing.

1256
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,920
Yeah.

1257
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,760
He knows how to do it.

1258
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,520
He's very, the robotic nature of him, like,

1259
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,640
isn't there almost like a,

1260
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,640
you'd never think of this,

1261
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,760
cause he's like a big tough guy,

1262
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,760
but isn't there almost like a Shatner-esque,

1263
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,640
just that it's always exactly the same.

1264
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,080
Every single line is more the same than the last.

1265
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,040
Staccato gets louder than quieter.

1266
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,280
It's like, he sort of has one way he says stuff.

1267
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,640
And it's a very charming way.

1268
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,920
I really like him.

1269
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,760
Yeah, the Shat, it's, Shatner's interesting

1270
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,440
cause yeah, when you think of the Shatner delivery,

1271
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,120
it is very melodramatic and it's said in the same way.

1272
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,800
I'm trying to think of there's a good parallel to him.

1273
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,000
Cause yeah, he, it's like he's got one speed

1274
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,800
and he just does it and it works.

1275
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,000
And it's not like some of the other classic,

1276
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,800
like actors who are like, like Steven Seagal,

1277
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,080
who's like completely like emotionless and wooden,

1278
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,720
and you get no like warmth from the actor.

1279
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,560
Maybe that's wrong.

1280
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,520
Maybe this is Steven Seagal movie where he brings you

1281
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,360
to tears.

1282
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,600
I don't know, I apologize to the Seagal fans,

1283
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,600
but yeah, I, he's got, he knows how to do his thing.

1284
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,400
He's very good at it and he doesn't stray very far.

1285
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,160
Yeah, you can like set your watch to it.

1286
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,040
Yeah.

1287
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,560
It's very precise.

1288
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,120
He's very modern, obviously in the movie too.

1289
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,480
Like if the movie's old, like everybody else is sort of like

1290
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,440
playing a period piece and he's like not,

1291
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,960
he's doing his thing.

1292
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1293
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,960
I don't think people looked like that back then.

1294
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,080
I don't think that was achievable.

1295
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,800
How jacked were people a hundred years ago?

1296
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,360
That is a question and I'll turn it to the listeners

1297
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,240
to help us out here.

1298
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,640
Who was the most jacked a hundred years ago?

1299
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,520
The most jacked man of 1912.

1300
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,040
Maybe we can look it up too.

1301
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,880
I also want to confirm that Jason is-

1302
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,480
But you know how bodybuilders from back there had like,

1303
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,440
back then had like big bellies.

1304
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,640
Like- Yes.

1305
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,440
You know, the guys and they're like holding the big barbells

1306
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,600
like all like look crazy.

1307
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,440
Yeah.

1308
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,280
So Jason is correct.

1309
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,200
California is the most litigious state.

1310
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,920
So congratulations to us.

1311
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,960
Yeah.

1312
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,160
It's also very large.

1313
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,960
So just the sheer on average-

1314
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,800
There's a lot of people here as well.

1315
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,280
A lot of people, a lot of cases.

1316
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,400
Yeah.

1317
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,160
So, yeah, I like Emily Blunt too.

1318
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah.

1319
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,320
I think she's a good, I think both of them are charming.

1320
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,160
That they're both doing their thing that they're good at.

1321
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,160
I don't know that it exactly makes like chemistry,

1322
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,040
like playing off of each other.

1323
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,600
You're saying you don't believe them as lovers?

1324
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,440
Yeah.

1325
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,800
And that's the, yeah, the romance angle kind of came late

1326
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,640
and kind of just seemed like another,

1327
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,080
there's just so many things happening this week.

1328
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
There's so much going on.

1329
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,920
I agree.

1330
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,200
I would have preferred they stayed friends.

1331
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,960
They didn't need to smut up my movie with kissing.

1332
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,680
Yeah.

1333
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,680
I mean, that also felt a little like, yeah, toward the end.

1334
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,240
Like, oh, by the way, they can kiss now.

1335
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,560
Where it was like, oh, I didn't feel like

1336
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,920
that was going that way.

1337
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,760
And then it happens.

1338
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,600
I mean, that happens sometimes.

1339
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,560
Yeah, because they had zero chemistry

1340
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,720
and didn't get along,

1341
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,360
you might think that they wouldn't kiss.

1342
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,520
Yeah, and it's not like that like tense not getting along

1343
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,800
where the tension is just like,

1344
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,280
you're waiting to cut it with a knife

1345
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,400
and it's like obviously masking something.

1346
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,240
There's a-

1347
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,060
It's not like the-

1348
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,900
Oh, go ahead.

1349
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,240
I was just gonna say, no, you say your thing

1350
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,520
because mine is about to veer us into another track

1351
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,280
and it's big.

1352
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,440
Oh, mine was going through too, which is just,

1353
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,840
I'm just comparing it in terms of the great Disney kisses.

1354
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,680
I mean, you gotta go, it's like, it's a lady in the tramp

1355
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,680
and then the electric chemistry of Kylo Ren and-

1356
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,720
Well, you are actually saying the exact thing

1357
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,360
I was about to say.

1358
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,760
You were going right where-

1359
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,360
Oh my God.

1360
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,160
That's like the sexiest scene in cinema.

1361
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,200
There's a big argument about that kiss

1362
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,400
at the end of Rise of Skywalker.

1363
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,960
I think, and I'm not telling a tale out of school,

1364
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,040
Evan Susser says the kiss is good

1365
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,760
at the end of Rise of Skywalker

1366
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,480
when Kylo Ren and Rey kiss.

1367
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,720
And I know he also just said,

1368
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,840
he also just was saying some good things about Green Day

1369
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,120
so I don't know if I can trust the-

1370
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,480
Well, that's fair.

1371
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,840
So maybe, yeah, maybe his opinion, but you know what?

1372
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,120
I think I agree with him that the kiss

1373
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,680
at the end of Rise of Skywalker is good.

1374
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,720
And it makes sense.

1375
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,600
It's flawed. Why?

1376
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,720
Because there is like, it's more of like one of those,

1377
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,520
it's like the end of Speed

1378
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,720
where the two characters have just gone through

1379
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,880
some crazy nightmarish thing.

1380
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,040
And obviously Kylo Ren has done a lot of bad stuff

1381
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,640
and he's about to die.

1382
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,960
And it's not like it redeems him,

1383
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,240
but it's literally just like the two characters,

1384
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,640
like there's an emotion,

1385
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,040
like they have to get this just crazy amount of emotion out.

1386
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,520
And that's how it- A release of tension.

1387
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,720
A release of tension.

1388
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,080
And I think, I agree.

1389
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,800
Look, the Rise of Skywalker, does it have problems?

1390
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,640
Sure.

1391
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,720
But I do think the kiss, as Evan Susser said, is good.

1392
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,560
Well, similarly, another movie-

1393
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,240
Wait, you thought that though before he said it?

1394
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,520
Like you're in the theater and you think to yourself,

1395
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,240
this is good.

1396
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,200
I don't know that I even had a take on it.

1397
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,280
I don't think I necessarily was even,

1398
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,280
look, Rise of Skywalker, they throw a lot at you.

1399
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,480
So you're trying to figure out

1400
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,240
exactly what's going on a lot of the time.

1401
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,960
You're being the most political I've ever seen.

1402
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,600
That's another movie.

1403
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,040
That's another modern movie

1404
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,920
where there's just so many things.

1405
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,560
Like it's just a club sandwich.

1406
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,720
There's just so many layers.

1407
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,360
There's so much going on.

1408
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,200
And it's like-

1409
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,320
I think I laughed.

1410
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,960
I think I laughed when they kissed.

1411
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,680
I think the whole audience laughed where I saw it.

1412
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,520
Yeah.

1413
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,360
I think my memory is they laughed.

1414
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,920
It's so out of, it's just like-

1415
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
It is out of place.

1416
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
You're almost like, wait, yeah, were they?

1417
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,880
Was that the vibe even?

1418
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,560
That was the vibe in the second movie.

1419
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,840
That was in Last Jedi.

1420
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,760
That is the vibe.

1421
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,480
There's like a weird like-

1422
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,320
Yes.

1423
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,160
Yeah.

1424
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,840
Horny thing going on when they're telepathically

1425
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,680
communicating with each other.

1426
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,880
But then it hasn't been in Rise at all.

1427
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,760
It hasn't been in Rise of Skywalker.

1428
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,800
And then it happens at the end and it seems weird.

1429
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,720
And he's like PJs which makes it all funny too.

1430
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,560
After the thing about it.

1431
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,000
His wardrobe I think is funny.

1432
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,840
Yeah, his wardrobe is funny.

1433
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,360
He's in theater blacks.

1434
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,160
He's in stage crew blacks.

1435
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,400
That's what it is.

1436
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,240
That's what it is.

1437
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,080
He's trying to be invisible

1438
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,480
while moving a chair around.

1439
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,560
And like he kills the Knights of Ren

1440
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
who were missing in the last movie.

1441
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,160
And you're still not sure who the Knights of Ren exactly are.

1442
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,960
They're in the coffee table book.

1443
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,320
They're in that coffee table book.

1444
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,680
So is Constable Zuvio.

1445
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,680
Constable Zuvio, yeah.

1446
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,360
I wanted her to give just a little gentle kiss

1447
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,560
to the top of the head of Babu Frick.

1448
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,360
Babu Frick gentle Babu.

1449
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,440
Probably one of my favorite new character.

1450
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,280
We all love Babu Frick.

1451
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,120
He's so cute.

1452
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,960
Oh yeah.

1453
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,800
Please.

1454
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,560
He pops up in the big star fight,

1455
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,160
in the big battle at the end.

1456
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,360
And he's like, yeah.

1457
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,760
Like everyone loves that.

1458
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,000
The audience loves that.

1459
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,720
Yeah, we'll all kiss him.

1460
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,560
Sure.

1461
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,400
Yeah, Mark Kaur, whatever we've said about this movie,

1462
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,400
we would all happily kiss Babu Frick.

1463
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,360
Yes, easily kiss Babu Frick.

1464
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,960
So yeah, so as far as kissing,

1465
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,640
I think the Rey, Kylo kiss more appropriate

1466
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,320
than the kissing from the rocket

1467
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,120
and only blunt in this movie.

1468
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,040
That's my stance on it at least.

1469
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,880
True thing.

1470
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,600
I don't wanna speak for everyone, but that's yeah.

1471
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,440
Sure.

1472
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Now I guess you got another movie building up to it.

1473
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,040
This is, yeah.

1474
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,160
They're just like not getting along mostly.

1475
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,000
Right.

1476
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,840
But I don't know.

1477
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,660
Yeah, I agree.

1478
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,500
She's good.

1479
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,340
That whole ladder sequence.

1480
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,180
I think this whole thing is like,

1481
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,480
this is a cable movie.

1482
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,840
This is like, if that even exists anymore,

1483
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,240
it's hard to say.

1484
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,920
But right, isn't this the kind of thing you'd like,

1485
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,040
oh, this is on.

1486
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,000
You're in a hotel room.

1487
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,280
You're like killing time before you go out to dinner.

1488
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,760
All right, I'll watch 20 minutes of Jungle Cruise.

1489
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,600
Yeah, I think that's right.

1490
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Since I started watching AEW Wrestling, which is on TNT,

1491
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
I have now gotten a little bit more back in the habit

1492
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,600
of that, which is something we all used to do a lot more

1493
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,000
when stuff wasn't streaming.

1494
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,280
But you know, TNT, it'll like,

1495
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,720
they're always showing like Kong Skull Island

1496
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,080
and I'm catching 20 minutes of Kong Skull Island

1497
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,040
before or after watching like a show on TNT.

1498
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,840
You have watched Ben Affleck

1499
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,720
in The Accountant a dozen times now.

1500
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,040
Tony Schiavone or Jim Ross talking about like,

1501
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,080
you know, coming up next, The Accountant,

1502
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,560
Ben Affleck's The Accountant.

1503
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,240
Like, I go, okay, I'm watching 10 minutes of The Accountant.

1504
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,760
I do miss that.

1505
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,040
I wish we had that happen more.

1506
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,960
But yes, this would be a good movie for that.

1507
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,240
And maybe it'll be on TNT.

1508
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,520
I'm not sure how their contracts work with Disney

1509
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,800
if they're keeping it off of like networks like that.

1510
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,480
Although Star Wars still plays

1511
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,440
on some of these other cable networks.

1512
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,280
But those contracts-

1513
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,440
Star Wars and Marvel, I think.

1514
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,120
Yeah, you're right.

1515
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,160
And I don't know if those are probably old contracts.

1516
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,440
I don't know.

1517
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah, I think probably going for, you know, people,

1518
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,120
there's still a significant portion of the population

1519
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,200
who, you know, have cable television

1520
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,480
and maybe don't have any or, you know,

1521
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,400
only one or two streaming options.

1522
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,040
Right, of course.

1523
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,880
So yeah.

1524
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,200
So there you go.

1525
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,840
It's a hotel movie.

1526
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,680
It's cable-y.

1527
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,640
And, you know, which that's not a compliment.

1528
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,400
You know, yeah, I think I would,

1529
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,200
if this was just on, I would put it on,

1530
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,440
which a lot of things you wouldn't say.

1531
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,720
I like, think about it.

1532
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,480
I don't know if we've like really talked about

1533
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,080
a kind of movie adjacent to,

1534
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,240
a new movie adjacent to what we are interested in

1535
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,040
maybe since Aladdin.

1536
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,760
And that was hell.

1537
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,800
Aladdin, that Aladdin, it's god awful.

1538
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,680
This was nowhere near that.

1539
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,400
You know, there's like real film-

1540
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,800
That Aladdin as much as you did, I don't think.

1541
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,640
Is that right?

1542
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,040
I thought, was I the only one?

1543
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,000
God, I hate it.

1544
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,440
I wasn't wild about it.

1545
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,440
But when I, I think I was on Guy Ritchie's IMDB

1546
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,880
or Wikipedia the other day,

1547
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,040
I saw after Aladdin, he made like two in a row,

1548
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,240
Guy Ritchie, like comedy, gangster, ensemble move.

1549
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,160
And I'm like, I, Mike reminded me recently

1550
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,920
the Martin Scorsese, like one for them, one for me,

1551
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,760
sort of thing.

1552
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,280
And I was like, well, Guy Ritchie got to make

1553
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,600
a couple of his like, you know, kooky gangster movies.

1554
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,880
Like, yeah, he's got to make Aladdin every now and then.

1555
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,600
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

1556
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,240
Well, I don't know.

1557
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,520
I had a decent time.

1558
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,000
I saw Man-Made Bees.

1559
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,400
I saw Jesse Plemons talk to a bee.

1560
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,600
And I met Nilo Nimalato and that's not too bad.

1561
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,920
So do we recommend it?

1562
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,120
Do we, I don't know if we have any like movie scale here.

1563
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,600
Exactly.

1564
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,080
I know how to recommend this because like, yeah,

1565
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,320
it's overly complicated.

1566
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,000
They're definitely trying to milk it for some like takes

1567
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,840
or some memes.

1568
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,920
And I don't think that's going to happen.

1569
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,160
But I would recommend you wait until whatever.

1570
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,440
I think the date is already floating around out there,

1571
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,120
October or November, when it just switches over

1572
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:44,960
on Disney Plus.

1573
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,400
So anyone with Disney Plus can watch it.

1574
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,080
I would say watch it.

1575
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah, sure.

1576
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,840
No, put it on there.

1577
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,800
Definitely. Yeah.

1578
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,640
Yeah.

1579
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,760
Yeah, that's for sure do that.

1580
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,240
But if you, yeah, if you're way into, I guess, the actors

1581
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,480
or if you like the sound of a hammy,

1582
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,920
Paul Giamatti performance, sure, go ahead.

1583
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,320
Give it a go.

1584
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,880
And of course, you know, watch it in order to pay tribute

1585
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,680
to the rock of an actor who has respect for the pandemic

1586
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,520
that we've all been through.

1587
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,160
Who isn't callous, like certain other Disney stars

1588
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,280
who probably if you follow the logic,

1589
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,920
doesn't believe in the vaccines.

1590
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,680
I mean, like, I think Disney has outed

1591
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,640
one of the great monsters of our time.

1592
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,720
And this is good.

1593
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,760
They need to be more candid in their press releases,

1594
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,600
I think.

1595
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,160
I think, yeah, anyone who has a grievance with them

1596
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,080
in the last year and a half,

1597
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,400
those people having the grievance are the problem.

1598
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,400
Do you think his people behind the scenes just went,

1599
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,560
you're putting on Disney Plus,

1600
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,360
you gotta get him some more money.

1601
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,680
Like they just very quietly went like,

1602
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,600
this is one of the top five biggest stars in the world.

1603
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,960
Don't fuck with us.

1604
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,040
You know, don't get us.

1605
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,840
Ari Emanuel gave it a call, gave a call probably.

1606
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,240
That's right.

1607
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,320
That's how stuff gets done.

1608
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,160
Yeah.

1609
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,560
Still phone calls in this town.

1610
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,400
Lots of, yeah.

1611
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,360
You gotta be careful.

1612
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:13,280
It's the most litigious state in the country.

1613
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,120
That's right.

1614
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,880
You'll be wishing you were on La Guilla,

1615
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,200
on the Amazon, you know, the boat,

1616
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,600
the name of his boat that I'm probably butchering.

1617
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,360
You'll be wishing you were on his boat

1618
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,520
filled with magazine cutouts of drawings of cars

1619
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,920
and fancy suits.

1620
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,760
That's right.

1621
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,160
All right.

1622
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,440
Well, you survived the cruise.

1623
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,000
You survived podcasts to ride the second gate.

1624
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,200
If you, A, if you liked the cruise,

1625
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,480
our names are Scott, Mike, and Jason.

1626
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,560
And if you didn't like the cruise and our names are,

1627
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,640
you know, Frank, Sally, and Ben, right?

1628
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,760
That's like a kind of joke they would do, right?

1629
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,040
That's, yeah, exactly.

1630
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,480
Sort of the format of a, okay, okay, great.

1631
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,040
So I wrapped it up in the style, mission accomplished.

1632
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,840
Keep it tuned here for three bonus episodes every month.

1633
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,520
And yeah, we'll see you out there on the river.

1634
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,240
We'll see you on La Guilla.

1635
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,560
Bye.
