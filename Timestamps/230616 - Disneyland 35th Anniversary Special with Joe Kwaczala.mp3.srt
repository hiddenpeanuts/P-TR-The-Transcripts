1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A Dragon That Cracks Wise,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hip Hop Chimney Sweeps,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Comped Cousins,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the wide reaching appeal of Tony Danza.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All this plus a look back at the Disneyland 35th anniversary special

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with Joe Quizzala.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ayy, it's podcast, The Ride.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a podcast about theme parks where one of the hosts

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
got their pants souped by theme park water

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
within three hours of this very record,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which is a very interesting podcast.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a podcast about theme parks

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where one of the hosts got their pants souped

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
by theme park water within three hours of this very record,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which one was it? Was it Mike Carlson?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, no way.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Dry as a bone, Jason Sheridan.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, mine got sued for other reasons, don't worry about it.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You having a problem? We've been talking about feeling it,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
having issues down there lately.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I know you guys are having a little bit of early onset something,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but is everything all right?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, that just trickles a little bit.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's all we were talking about.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That dries pretty quick.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's normal, we're man in our 30s.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's nothing wrong with it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's when that happens.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So that's souping.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a big thing.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Across the board.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So a soup wouldn't happen from that.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Total.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That leaves me, Scott Gardner, high.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, do you want to guess the circumstances?

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What could have happened where three hours ago?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jurassic World?

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not Jurassic World.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
One other probably location in the vicinity

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
where you could soup your pants.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Despicable Me Super Silly Funland.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh yeah, were you fraudulently playing around?

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, you're right.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That would be another one.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, no, no.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't frolic, nor did I take a shot at the Irish Bar

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
where you can get hammered and end up face down in the kiddie pool.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Like Sunset Boulevard.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, no.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I didn't have my own.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't have to be resuscitated before this record.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because I'm happy as you're just lying there.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sometimes you get a little too happy around there,

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and that's what I was doing.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, this was City Walk Fountain.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I danced with the devil at the City Walk Fountain.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My boy was feeling a little oddly brave.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was kind of nice to see because he's a little bit hesitant.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He was getting pretty close to the water,

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so I decided maybe we should brave it a little more.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I picked him up.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was like, I don't want him to just get...

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because one of those jets is twice his size potentially.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Knock him over.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, yes, actually, genuinely.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's a lot of...

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And he's sitting in the car right now.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's just sitting around for 90 minutes to two hours.

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm just blasting the heat.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hopefully it's not too much for him.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But a toddler in a hot car is a problem if you forget that it's happening.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But if you did it on purpose, I think it's fine, right?

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you're controlling the heat.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, as long as the heat's on,

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and he's got the Steely Dan discography, which is what I'm assuming.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I got him a to-go order of bubblegum shrimp,

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
butterfly shrimp in the car too to keep him sustained.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, you know his taste.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I got him into shrimp early.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's heading from a royal scam to gaucho, I think, right about now.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So he'll be below five.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, but yeah, it got me more than him,

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which led to the funny circumstance of like,

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am pretty soaked, and luckily I was on the way out, not the way in.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So car ride home, I'm sort of like,

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the shirt got really soaked, souped too.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And like, do I really want to wear this for the whole,

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and I elected not to, so I was just driving without my shirt for a little bit.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wow, like a red pit in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Exactly the same, yeah, yeah.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And that's for anyone watching this one on YouTube,

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that's what you're seeing under here.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I would, but I don't want this to be a bawdy show.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Exactly, just imagine Brad Pitt, and it's just what I got.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, it felt weird, but I'm going to do it because I don't want this wet fabric on me

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
until I realized that my drive home had not one but two Rider Strike locations along the way.

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I'm like, what if I am at a stoplight, and right then a bunch of people go by,

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and what if it's people I know?

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What if it's like a lot of people I know at Warner Brothers or something?

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Or not people I know, but like someone I really respect.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like what if that's the day Vince Gilligan is out?

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then he sees a weird guy with his shirt off with a toddler in the back.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bill Prady, James Burroughs.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They're all out.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They're all there.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ah, that's a good little prelude.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, that's excellent.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Chuck Lorre's out.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's a reunion.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What if the reunion of the Disneyland 35th anniversary special was happening today?

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'd be mortified.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, so it worked.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I threw a jacket on.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It was fine.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now I'm regularly clothed, and I'm ready to talk about Disneyland's 35th anniversary special.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Excited for this one.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is a very good theme park special, I think.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
One I've always liked very much.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Maybe the best one.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It could be the best.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I mean, it's possible that you could enjoy one more, but maybe in a way, maybe because

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it's bad or has problems.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But in terms of like genuine quality and like good material and shooting style, this one's

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
pretty up there.

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This special is free on YouTube in various ways.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you want to watch along with us or watch it first before we do it.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And speaking of specials that are free on YouTube, that is something that our guest

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
has.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's a pretty good tie together, right?

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So put those back to back.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Disneyland's 35th anniversary special.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then right after that, ooh la la, the new comedy special from our guest Joe Quazzalla.

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's Joe Quazzalla.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hey, guys.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thanks for having me.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Absolutely.

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Very impressed by the segue.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's pretty nice, right?

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That you could load those up back to back.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, make a playlist.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We should do that, actually.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, this episode, we're putting something in the playlist right now.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's almost a full day's worth of entertainment.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
At 24 hours.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Perfect.

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So excited to have you.

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Excited to talk that you brought this to the table also.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I know and now I realize that it like I know this comes from an area of interest

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
of yours.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I know from going to your place that time that you have a fondness for not just old

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
specials, but old specials on VHS with the commercials baked in.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
From my personal collection.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So I have this special on a VHS tape from the night it aired.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I have at one point I converted it to DVD and then recently I converted it to digital.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So now I have it on a hard drive.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And that's how I watched it for this episode was I watched my taping of this special from

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
February 4th 1990 with the commercials intact, which you can.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's a version of this that's on YouTube that has the original commercials from the

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
original broadcast.

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Wow.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It matches.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Outside of one that was different.

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, it matched.

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It matched up with what I had.

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
One local.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Did I see one that I ended up after you said that I was like, I got to watch this.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I got to watch the commercial.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I want to see the commercials.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There seemed like a very like sad one about like homeless Louis.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So that must have been local to whoever uploaded that.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mine was commercial for Liquid Plumber.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For some reason we didn't have like an analogous local commercial.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It was just like two actors with mustaches playing Plumber is being like, I mean, I don't

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
want you to use Liquid Plumber, but it works.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that's uplifted.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's a good trade out.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's a happier.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Absolutely.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's what Pittsburgh, local Pittsburgh, NBC affiliate wanted instead of a harrowing

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
documentary about the homeless problem.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, then let me ask you Pittsburgh then.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So what is, you grew up there or lived there then at least?

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, my whole childhood.

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What was your theme park?

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, the thing is the local Pittsburgh theme park is Kennywood.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Uh-huh.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I, growing up, I didn't realize that it was like a kind of unusual thing to have like

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
a cool theme park in your town.

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But my parents are from Ohio, so we would go to Cedar Point.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Every summer.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I have very fond memories of going to Cedar Point every year.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Back then there was the kids area was branded with the Baron Stain Bears, which is how when

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the Mandela effect came up years later.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was like, no, no, no.

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I spent a lot of time with the family.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, you knew.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You were like, you've seen this in print in person.

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It was all over the place.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It was, yeah, not something that I would have gotten, you know, that just peripherally came

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
by, which I think was the problem with the Mandela effect is when you're not paying attention.

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,960
But when you're in the shit in the Baron Stain Bears park within Cedar Point, you don't

221
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
forget a thing like that.

222
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Were they the walk around characters?

223
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Do they have their house or anything?

224
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Like what was the setup?

225
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,120
Yeah, there was like, there was definitely a house and there were like, I recall there

226
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,960
being a slide inside of a fake tree.

227
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Yeah.

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,720
And when it was like a dark slide, I suppose, the kind of slide you go through and it's

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
pitch black for like three seconds.

230
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,760
And then you come out, which is scary, but fun as a kid.

231
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,960
And then one of the things I used to do as a kid at the Baron Stain Bears park, which

232
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,480
is like, my parents thought it was funny because it wasn't special to this place, but they

233
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,360
just would have pieces of paper and crayons.

234
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,000
I just sit and like draw for hours just like at the Baron Stain Bears park because it was

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
fun.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,760
And also, I don't know, maybe it was like novel that like I could like draw with people,

237
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,880
new people, I guess.

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,800
Now it's Snoopy.

239
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,480
As is almost every, there's so much, I was just at a Snoopy in the great America up north.

240
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,280
Is it Knott's also Snoopy?

241
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Yeah.

242
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,240
And then a bunch of other ones are, I think Canada's Wonderland that we just covered as

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
some Snoopy.

244
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Yeah.

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,720
Doherty Park pivoted from Bern Stain Bears to Snoopy at some point in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

246
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah.

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I mean, I get it.

248
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
It's a stronger brand.

249
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Like they were running out of stuff to do with the Bern Stain Bears.

250
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,040
Want to wear a Moo Moo like Ma?

251
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
Like Ma, Baron Stain Bear?

252
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,440
Joe, did you know this came up on the show recently in one of the books that says Ma

253
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,560
is 27 years old.

254
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
No.

255
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,480
Man, because Ma does, she's, I guess the phrase is old maid.

256
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,960
She seems like an old maid.

257
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Yes.

258
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
It's all about the hat.

259
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:44,880
When you change that hat out, it ages you down, I don't know, 30 years, 50 years, way,

260
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
way down.

261
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,240
Because it seems like she should be in a rocking chair knitting.

262
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,800
Like that's the vibe of Ma, Baron Stain Bear.

263
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Yeah.

264
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,280
No one, if you're just a mom, if grand or great aren't in your title, why are you wearing

265
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
that hat?

266
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Yeah.

267
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,320
It's like, but Pa was also felt, oh, he didn't feel like a youthful bear.

268
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
No, I mean he was Farmer Corps.

269
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,640
He's had the overalls and the hat.

270
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,880
So that's got a wider range than whatever that, I mean, should we try to describe the

271
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
Ma Baron Stain Bear hat?

272
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,960
I don't know how to quite, I almost want to say it's like a shower cap.

273
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
It's a lot like a shower cap.

274
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah.

275
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Such a strange choice.

276
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,200
It's like a sleeping bonnet, but she's wearing it at all times.

277
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Right.

278
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,280
It matches her dress, as I recall.

279
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,560
Which makes it seem like this is a pajama.

280
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Ensemble.

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,920
Ensemble, yes, exactly.

282
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,360
Yeah, so for whatever reason, I guess, look, as I think I said before, bears, I guess they

283
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
used to age differently back then, I guess.

284
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,520
When we were kids, they just seemed, people thought that we thought they were older, but

285
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,000
ultimately we don't know what the bear's lifespan is either.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
And when you start feeling old.

287
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
Yeah, exactly.

288
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,760
So yeah, it's possible that she was 60s bear years, in her 60s bear years.

289
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
And that might have been normal.

290
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,920
We don't know how many sets of children that couple had that then grew up and left the

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
den.

292
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
And they never saw them again.

293
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Oh, interesting.

294
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,280
And then how many were to come.

295
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah, there could be fully grown Baron Stain Bears.

296
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,880
Is there a Baron Stain Bears book like the end of the David the Gnome show where they

297
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:37,360
die and become part of the grass and everyone watches and horrified terror like the swift

298
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,640
the fox did on that episode.

299
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
If you know what I'm talking about.

300
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I do.

301
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I do.

302
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Absolutely.

303
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Did you have that on VHS from your childhood?

304
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,200
No, but I remember that was that was on Nickelodeon for a little bit.

305
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah.

306
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,920
Right in the age where I would have been watching.

307
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,960
And I checked out like the pilot of David the Gnome recently.

308
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,640
And if you guys have watched it recently, you'll notice.

309
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Oh, I will.

310
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I know exactly what you're talking about.

311
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Yeah, I don't.

312
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Harvey Harvey and Bob Weinstein.

313
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, no.

314
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
No.

315
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
What in the.

316
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
That's supposed to be so shocking to see.

317
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,640
Oh, and really, you're really not expecting it.

318
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Like what?

319
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
David the Gnome.

320
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
It's a beautiful theme song.

321
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,560
And then as soon as that's happening and like the lush you're going over like the.

322
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

323
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

324
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I think it's also repurposed cartoon from Spain.

325
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Yes.

326
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Or some.

327
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,680
Yeah, it was definitely an import.

328
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,480
And there was nudity in the original because Andrew Grissom gave me a David the Gnome toy

329
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,020
that was vintage.

330
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,640
And if you look on the back, there's naked gnomes.

331
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,120
And I went, what the heck?

332
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Well, that was custom.

333
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,960
That's the way it was custom.

334
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,640
Custom by him or for Mike.

335
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Oh, for Mike.

336
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Me.

337
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Andrew had that.

338
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,800
Naked David the Gnome's wife, Martha, I think was her name.

339
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,040
The opening shot of David the Gnome is David taking a bath.

340
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Yeah.

341
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,320
And like the big with the big scrub brush.

342
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,480
And then he but so in an uncut version, he stands up.

343
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,480
He stands up full frontal.

344
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Yeah.

345
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,000
A slow tracking shot into his pubes.

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Also uncut.

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah.

348
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

349
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Absolutely.

350
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where is he getting that thing circumcised?

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Come on.

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Come on.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
By a magical bird.

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, yeah.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Maybe like an ogre.

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
An ogre comes and chops it.

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,320
Has a sickle and just kind of.

358
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Any number of sources.

359
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah, you're right.

360
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm wrong.

361
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm sorry.

362
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm wrong about that.

363
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,120
Is that when you to go back to your specials with commercials collection, does anything

364
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,920
else strike you as like a crown jewel of something that you've kept up or that you know you have

365
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,560
or just that you're fond of?

366
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,600
My favorite discovery, because it was only maybe like 10 years ago that I found the tapes

367
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
and was like, oh, I should like I didn't realize I don't know what's here.

368
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Right.

369
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Yeah.

370
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,360
One of my favorites is the pilot of a TV show called Scorch.

371
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Yeah.

372
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,160
I think we talked about Scorch a little bit.

373
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Scorch is hysterical.

374
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I feel like we must have.

375
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,160
100% green lit in the success of Dinosaurs, the TV show.

376
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,760
Or and probably ALF.

377
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
And ALF as well.

378
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
It's kind of the ALF format.

379
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
It's early 90s.

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,360
And it was the backstory is that there was a guy like a nightclub act like ventriloquist

381
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,560
with a dragon puppet.

382
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,720
And they chose to take the puppet and make him the star of a sitcom.

383
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:45,720
And the premise is that the dragon overslept by 100 years, which doesn't seem like long

384
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
enough.

385
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Wait.

386
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
It breaks up in like 92 or something.

387
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,200
And we're seeing like 1892 when like there was photography.

388
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Maybe on like some fundamentalist Bible timeline.

389
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,880
Yeah, we had no we had dragons in the 1890s.

390
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Look at that.

391
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
They fought.

392
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,040
They rode on them in the Civil War.

393
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
But yeah, Scorch oversleeps.

394
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:14,920
And then he crashes literally into the home of a single father and his cute precocious

395
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,400
little girl and then is part of the family for some reason.

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Was the dad then the guy who puppeteered him or did the puppeteer stay below?

397
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,440
The puppeteer stayed below was not full ALF.

398
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Yeah, full ALF.

399
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
OK.

400
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,000
That guy's not a presence.

401
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,600
But the idea of ventriloquism is baked into the premise of the show because Scorch the

402
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:45,120
dragon gets stuck or sneaks into the like duffel bag of the lead who is trying out to

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
be the weatherman for the local news.

404
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,680
And they don't like him until this wisecrackin dragon pops up.

405
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,160
And they're like, we like him for the news.

406
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh, wow.

407
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
We like your puppet that you're doing.

408
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,680
And he's like, yeah, puppet.

409
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,560
And that's part of the premise of Scorch.

410
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
But what if?

411
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,120
What would have been the whole series is that it's a newscaster team of a human and a little

412
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
dragon.

413
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Yes.

414
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
One part of the.

415
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
And now we throw it out with the desk.

416
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
It's Dan and Scorch.

417
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Right.

418
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,160
And then the other aspect would be the home life of a little girl and her new brother,

419
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Scorch.

420
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
That's really insane.

421
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
I think my here's why I know about Scorch from prior.

422
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,080
I believe my wife, Erin, went to elementary school with the kid of Scorch's not owner,

423
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
but creator.

424
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
No.

425
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
What do you call him?

426
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
The weatherman.

427
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh, OK.

428
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
The father.

429
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
His landlord, really.

430
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
OK.

431
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Yes.

432
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Although there is a landlord character, as you can imagine.

433
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
It's not the land.

434
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I don't know.

435
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,440
There's a woman who's like, what's going on in here?

436
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,040
It's like, was that a puppet?

437
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
You know, that kind of stuff.

438
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,240
Oh, you need your ropers in this situation.

439
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,400
But the puppet is famous.

440
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
The puppet will be famous.

441
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Oh, right.

442
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Soon the puppet will be.

443
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Once you check out the evening news.

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
So that's going to have to go out the window.

445
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Oh, wait.

446
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Yeah.

447
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,000
And in their, the lie is that it's a puppet.

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Right.

449
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is very confusing.

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

451
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,120
Or is he more concerned about anyone finding out that it's a real dragon because they might

452
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
need to like test it?

453
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Probably.

454
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I guess that's it.

455
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
It breeds fire.

456
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
That's, yeah, kind of.

457
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,200
It's a workplace hazard at the news station.

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
And not good for the landlord and her property.

459
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Yeah, definitely.

460
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Oh, yeah.

461
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
That's true.

462
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
That's actually waiting to happen left and right.

463
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Yeah.

464
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,640
This is this made me think of I must have talked about it before, but I had to look up what

465
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,000
it was called.

466
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,720
And in doing so, I discovered something about it I did not know.

467
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
But the show Unhappily Ever After, that was the one.

468
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Of course.

469
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,560
The Mary with Children, which is off with Bobcat.

470
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
That was that.

471
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,960
Bobcat called to aid is a voice of a puppet.

472
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
I did not know.

473
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
I mean, I knew Nikki Cox.

474
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
I didn't know Kevin Connelly was on it.

475
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,960
I didn't realize there was 100 episodes of Unhappily Ever After.

476
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah.

477
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,080
And, you know, it provided an actual Unhappily Ever After, the marriage of Nikki Cox and

478
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Bobcat Goldthwait.

479
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Which didn't last.

480
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
What?

481
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Really?

482
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Yeah.

483
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Whoa.

484
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Did you know that one?

485
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
You know who she I don't know if she necessarily left Bobcat for him, but she went on to another

486
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
comedian after Bobcat.

487
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,400
I know all about the Nikki Cox marriage.

488
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
She then went to Jay Moore.

489
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,120
Oh, were they on a show together?

490
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Did that cause that or was that just a separate?

491
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,000
That seems likely, but I do not know.

492
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
Jay Moore who's now married to the owner of the laborers.

493
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
With J.B. Bush.

494
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Yes.

495
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
What an insane.

496
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Was Jay Moore on Las Vegas?

497
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
That sounds right.

498
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Because she was on Las Vegas.

499
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,000
I can't say that with any certainty.

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Did they meet at the upfronts?

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Like he was there for action.

502
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Action.

503
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
She was there.

504
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
It's possible.

505
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
That might.

506
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Yeah.

507
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
There's no better time to be Jay Moore than action.

508
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
You know, he's hot then.

509
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,240
She had a sitcom about married dating a pro wrestler.

510
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,080
I just want to confirm Nikki Cox and Jay Moore met while filming Las Vegas.

511
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Okay.

512
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Wow.

513
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
You do know.

514
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I don't know why you know.

515
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,480
He might have been a guest star or something.

516
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
You know, that one of those.

517
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I think that's what it was.

518
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Yeah, because Duhamel was the star.

519
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Yes.

520
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I mean, who can forget Jimmy Khan and Duhamel.

521
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Jimmy Khan, Las Vegas.

522
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,480
We have not talked about the show Las Vegas in six years on this show.

523
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,480
That's actually crazy because I remember when I was doing my tour guide training at Universal

524
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,280
Studios, one of the things that like they gave the whole class an assignment and everyone

525
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,320
had to go learn about an NBC or Universal property and do a little like book report

526
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
about it essentially.

527
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
And I was assigned Las Vegas.

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
I had to go learn who the stars were.

529
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,840
And you know, it's an action packed series involving the ins and outs.

530
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,200
Now I don't remember the name of the casino shows you how much it stuck with me.

531
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,600
I why they should have stripped me of that valedictorian.

532
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,160
They should now strip me retroactively of my valedictorian status.

533
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
That's right.

534
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I was the valedictorian.

535
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,640
I should drop that more often.

536
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Yeah, you really should.

537
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,120
I was I was never you can imagine I was never the valedictorian of anything else.

538
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,120
The accredited institutions.

539
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,940
But that's a school.

540
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,640
There was a classroom where you earn that status by naming all of the desperate housewives.

541
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,340
Their names and actresses.

542
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,740
Yeah, I've talked before about I had to know that because the wisteria lane was a big part

543
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,440
of the tour at that time.

544
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,060
So I had to know the actresses, the the character names and what house it was.

545
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,260
Is that Brenda Strong's voice I hear?

546
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,740
It sounds like we're coming up on with stereo lane.

547
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,060
I just remember it was always the most pained.

548
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,260
Never did I take pauses more because I was pretty slick.

549
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,060
Otherwise, like that's the bungalow where Alfred Hitchcock made many of his classic

550
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,060
films.

551
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,380
You know, that's the clip you got to do it at.

552
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,540
But I would just like go dark for like and over there, the periwinkle house is where

553
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,420
the home of Nicolette Sheridan, who played Brie.

554
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,980
Jesus.

555
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
That's not a name.

556
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Chris.

557
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,620
Jesus. I think her name is Jesus on the show.

558
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
Don't look it up.

559
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,020
You don't have smartphones right now.

560
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,140
Anyway, it's 2006.

561
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,100
You can't look it up. As far as you know, I'm the guy who knows everything.

562
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,220
Truly like like such torture.

563
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,060
But I had that information in my head for a week and a half and then.

564
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,740
Yeah, gone.

565
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,180
Pulling teeth to remember it.

566
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,020
But Scorch, I'll never Scorch and Scorch debuted with another show that was for probably

567
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,100
for a similar audience, a little more infamous Fish Police.

568
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,220
Of course, we just talked about the police.

569
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,780
Yeah, this really is awesome.

570
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,660
These things are really haunting the show.

571
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,420
Berenstain Bears, Fish Police.

572
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,620
Well, we just learned that that guy Ken drew the Fish Police comic.

573
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,380
Oh, yes, the guy who works at NECA toys.

574
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,660
No, no, he just worked with them.

575
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,620
Oh, he's the guy. He's like an animator and stuff.

576
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,660
And he worked on Tiny Toons.

577
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,460
He's worked on a million different animated things, but we learned he drew the comics

578
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,380
of Fish Police.

579
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,220
Spinoff. Wow. The most in demand item.

580
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,700
Craving more Fish Police.

581
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,140
Got to have more Fish Police.

582
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Check out your comics.

583
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,420
Local comic stand.

584
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,340
Primetime show.

585
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,260
The thing it's in Primetime, but you watch it and you're like, this is a Saturday

586
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,420
morning cartoon.

587
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,620
Did they just call it up and move it wrongly because the Simpsons did?

588
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,900
Is that what happened?

589
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,340
Yeah.

590
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,100
I never thought about that.

591
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,980
Networks were hungry for Primetime animated shows, but they they knew it had to be

592
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,940
animated, but they didn't think about why the Simpsons was funny or why it was

593
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
successful. Yeah.

594
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,980
It was just like, oh, it's animated.

595
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,860
Well, you need more animated shows.

596
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,900
And so they would get animated shows that felt like they should not be in Primetime.

597
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,460
Yeah. And it looked like they Fish Police looks like it should be.

598
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,300
We need our bleeping Simpsons.

599
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,940
We need our bleeping capital critters.

600
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
OK. Yeah.

601
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,620
That was the other I've never I've never dove into capital critters.

602
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,580
I'm curious. Is that like an alternate dimension where the president and all of

603
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,940
all of Washington are critters or are they critters who live?

604
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
They live underneath.

605
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,060
Oh, it's like that.

606
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,820
It's like that Ben Franklin Disney thing where concurrently there's an animal

607
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,580
equivalent of our human thing.

608
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,700
It's like the Tom and Jerry Wizard of Oz where they're just like hanging out in

609
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
the background while the Wizard of Oz happens.

610
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,180
Oh, yeah. Not affecting the right.

611
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,660
Well, this is good. I've learned so much now.

612
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,260
I know why Scorch was around.

613
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,060
I still am sorry to stay on Scorch.

614
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
I had one more question.

615
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,100
My my question.

616
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,260
Wait, I had it was a question.

617
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,620
Oh, that what they didn't take into account as a possible like what happens on the day

618
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:04,020
that a hurricane or a tornado like some acts like 500 are dead today in our town.

619
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,020
Now for a report from the weather, the carnage on the ground is Scorch.

620
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,700
You get solemn Scorch wiping his brow, giving a Cronkite level.

621
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,220
Saturday today, Sunday today, in Dallas today.

622
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,140
Scorch taking off his glass.

623
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,380
Yeah, put a glass of Scorch just so we can take them off.

624
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,300
Solidly take them off.

625
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,180
Shake his head.

626
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,140
But you know, he's a pro.

627
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,300
He gets his composure back ASAP.

628
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,540
The Vice President.

629
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Well, Jack Ruby being escorted through a parking garage.

630
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,100
If only Scorch had landed 30 years prior, the fun that could have been had.

631
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,900
He hadn't overslept.

632
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,940
But all the things Scorch was asleep for.

633
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,260
Oh, that all had to be explained to him.

634
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,580
I'll imagine that's the episode we never got.

635
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:03,980
Yeah.

636
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,380
Yes.

637
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,860
Catching Scorch up the last time.

638
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,820
Oh, you got a lot to learn Scorch.

639
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,980
That's actually better that he overslept for that because he was supposed to be on the grassy.

640
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,420
No, you're right.

641
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,420
There's remember, wake up at this spot from this grass.

642
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,180
You're either getting a call from the Cubans or from this guy, George H.

643
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,900
W. Bush.

644
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,420
OK, and you've got to be in this one know.

645
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,380
Do you know what a knoll is?

646
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,620
Was he supposed to help?

647
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,300
Was he like, like, OK, we got two people shooting, but just in case as a backup,

648
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,540
we're going to have a little dragon.

649
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,900
Who's the distraction?

650
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,020
It was going to be our first dragon sighting in America.

651
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,900
We've been waiting to deploy this for a long time.

652
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,020
We need so we need to kill the president, but we will have a dragon appear.

653
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,220
Everyone will be concentrating on the dragon and then, boom, we take out

654
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,100
tragedy, tragedy of Dallas Day, but also something else.

655
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,980
Dragon confusingly.

656
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,420
Dragons are real.

657
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,740
That's a tough day to be the newspaper editor.

658
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,220
OK, well, we got we know what the big headline is, but some of the front page has to be

659
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,940
dedicated something to this dragon.

660
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,540
Dragons are real.

661
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,620
We have this deproter film, but it left the car and it goes on with the dragon.

662
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,980
We got great footage of the dragon.

663
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,980
We almost saw the car, but then we got to see a dragon do a couple like barrel rolls.

664
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,020
Getting an AP wire that just says eating ash.

665
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,540
Oh, my God, what could have been?

666
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,740
But OK, we shift now to other 1990s prime time oddities.

667
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,060
And I'm so I'm so glad you brought up this one, you know, because it's a fun

668
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,220
what people have asked us to do this one.

669
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,020
Certainly I love this.

670
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,340
But but specifically, I remember this airing.

671
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
I vividly remember it airing.

672
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,220
I remember it scaring me because I'd been to Disneyland by that point,

673
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,020
was already obsessed with Disneyland by that point.

674
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,180
And there's a bunch of things that happen in it that made me have to ask my parents,

675
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,460
can that happen?

676
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,700
Does that happen?

677
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,580
Things go further in a lot of it's it's really that's what a lot of what this is,

678
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,980
is kind of ride throughs where things get a little crazier than your typical ride.

679
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,580
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,220
I had those questions, too, watching it as an adult, like, was that can that happen back then?

681
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,100
How much of this is canon?

682
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,820
Yeah, yeah.

683
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:31,260
I now some some bigger context for this also, the the 35th anniversary,

684
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,940
because I is also what you walked right into.

685
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm I'm very fond of the 35th anniversary.

686
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,460
Regardless, it's really what you know, when you're pondering your favorite

687
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,660
anniversaries.

688
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,660
It's such a bizarre one to pick, like usually like wait for 40.

689
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,780
Mm hmm. Right. Yeah.

690
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,980
Twenty five is is a classic one to celebrate.

691
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,700
Thirty five. Yeah.

692
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,420
It's like they had the they had the space in the schedule.

693
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,060
I mean, I think it just shows you that they had a lot of money.

694
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,700
I was going to say you're at the whim of the economic situation.

695
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah, I think so.

696
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,020
You have the money.

697
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,580
Anniversaries they've ignored.

698
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,580
But yes, five in 1990, they're doing great.

699
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,100
Little Mermaid has just happened.

700
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,660
Yeah. Yeah.

701
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,820
The Renaissance Renaissance is yeah, has gone is kicking.

702
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,340
Yeah, this is a very confident Walt Disney Company.

703
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,500
They have who Frayne Roger Abt was a huge hit.

704
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,740
Little Mermaid was a huge hit.

705
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,860
They got three parks open in Florida.

706
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,660
Yeah, like this is this is not the era of like we're taking down

707
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,220
the mysterious Benedict Society from streaming.

708
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,180
This Marvel movie made tons of money, but not enough tons of money.

709
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,580
Like this is a very different time.

710
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,020
You're not going to this era.

711
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,100
You don't call the the golden era.

712
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,900
A moment we're in now.

713
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,860
Yeah, this year.

714
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,740
Twenty twenty three has not been.

715
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,820
It's not. Yeah.

716
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,100
No, maybe Elemental will take them out of this mess.

717
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,860
Yeah. Bob Iger's at the the launch of the new Apple VR goggles for thirty five hundred.

718
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,460
Do you think Michael Eisner was over at the Virtual Boy launch

719
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,140
a couple of years later? No way.

720
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,860
He was swinging his big dick around and all the new parks.

721
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,660
That's right. Getting rides open, getting big stars to show up for these specials.

722
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,860
The thing I was going to say about thirty fifth

723
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,860
party grah parade.

724
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh, yeah. Very they milked the footage of this parade a lot.

725
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,140
It's in this special

726
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,660
very memorable parade with big, tall balloons of the primary characters

727
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,460
all in Mardi Gras mode.

728
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,140
This is the Calypso.

729
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,820
Yeah. Yeah. Montage that we see later.

730
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,580
Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,020
They packed those all up and then eventually shipped them to Florida

732
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,900
where they did a different parade.

733
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,860
Oh, right. Rearranged it a little bit.

734
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,740
So those are around.

735
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,260
Those were in the company vernacular for a long time.

736
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,780
There's some other special where they got the Buster

737
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,020
Poindexter in the fold to do hot, hot, hot.

738
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,580
Wow. In 1990.

739
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,260
This is this will be the year of hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot,

740
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,940
Renaissance. We're going to make it happen.

741
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,620
Also, and this shows up in this thing a little bit

742
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,260
or at the very end, they had something called the dream machine.

743
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,260
Anybody do you kind of remember the dream machine?

744
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,220
Every guest in the park for the 35th anniversary got a prize of some kind.

745
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,420
Everyone. It's our birthday, but you're getting the gifts.

746
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,340
And I think some of those gifts were sort of cruddy.

747
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,740
It could just be a long thing.

748
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,980
Yeah. Yeah. This whole this whole time, this particular anniversary.

749
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,820
But the gifts could be pretty solid.

750
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,740
It could be money to use on a Delta Airlines flight.

751
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,820
It could be US savings bonds. Wow.

752
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,140
Like your grandpa might give you Disney gave it to you.

753
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,260
And if you were very, very lucky, you would go and pull a lever

754
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,540
on the Disney dream machine.

755
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,940
And if that really worked out for you, you could win a 1990 GEO.

756
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,820
They gave away a car every single day.

757
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,100
Whoa. Every day, a big red GEO was

758
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,700
that would rise out of a platform.

759
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,780
You know how we've talked about how they that the partner statue,

760
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,860
the statue of Walt, they put in there so that they'd stop

761
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,020
like putting gaudy crap in the middle of the park and blocking the castle.

762
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,340
And to do this thing, they had to dig into the ground there

763
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,300
to make the space for a big platform that would raise a GEO up every single day.

764
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,460
They did like I miss this.

765
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,060
I vividly recall and because I assumed it would have in my head

766
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,980
at five years old and like, well, we're going to.

767
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,700
All right. So how many people are in Disneyland every day?

768
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,180
A hundred as much as I can count to.

769
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,300
Odds are pretty good.

770
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
I think we're riding a car.

771
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,300
And I also thought we will ride that car off the platform

772
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,100
straight down Main Street and.

773
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,580
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

774
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,620
And leave our old car to ride.

775
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,500
Or maybe take a quick stop at the Autopia, ride that track.

776
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,820
Oh, yeah. They got to show off your stuff and then. Yeah.

777
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,420
Oh, yeah. Demolish other cars.

778
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,340
Those are the other cars. Yeah.

779
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Yeah. Because they're replacing that underground GEO every day.

780
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,540
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,620
It's got to get swapped out.

782
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,660
Certainly, they did not just use the same car

783
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,580
and then give you a thing that you get a car somewhere else.

784
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,700
In my head, they're yeah.

785
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,780
Guests are riding new GEOs straight through the turnstiles every single day.

786
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,740
Yeah. The brand guy, the head, the like GEO guy is like, got to relocate

787
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,300
to Anaheim for a year.

788
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,460
I'm on a special project.

789
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,020
It's pretty cool. A lot of sales this year.

790
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,420
Of sales. Did you pull the lever ever?

791
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,060
No, no. OK, because I think only a rare few guys got to pull the lever.

792
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,180
Were some of the prizes like a 16 ounce bottle of Coca Cola?

793
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,660
I think that's OK.

794
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
OK, yeah.

795
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,620
Maybe just a thimble, just a taste, a free taste of Coke.

796
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,180
Yeah. Surplus new Coke being passed out.

797
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,900
They had to do something with it. Yeah. It was all sitting around.

798
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,740
But there's one more thing to say about this this special.

799
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,540
And Brad, I sent you a still if I just sent one still.

800
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,780
And it's this wonderful logo.

801
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,220
Do we have the logo

802
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,100
with the moving?

803
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,700
Well, you know, I don't I don't have that.

804
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,820
But here just is the basic the 35 years of magic logo.

805
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,740
I love this logo. Great.

806
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,820
So much super 80s, wonderful like dusk gradient.

807
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,700
My wife has a sweater that I think she inherited from her grandma

808
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,460
that she wears like almost every day.

809
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,420
I look at this logo almost every day.

810
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,740
I'm prepared to say that this would work today.

811
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,940
Like, this doesn't seem like that dated.

812
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,020
Yeah, there's a classic quality to it.

813
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,180
It gets reissued a lot like this and like the 25th

814
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,700
or 25th anniversary of Disney World,

815
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,860
which is mostly just the characters standing around around a big 25.

816
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,420
Yeah, tasteful logo, like cool, kind of forward thinking,

817
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:08,740
kind of 80s, 90s rather than like stuck at like kind of gaudy, stuck in an era.

818
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,020
That one that we just pulled up also, I believe

819
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,620
that wasn't like a like a digital asset.

820
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,100
That was a picture of like a signpost that they because they go up on that auction thing.

821
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,540
Oh, right. And I like they have them a lot.

822
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,500
I keep thinking I'm going to do it.

823
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,580
Do you know how much it's going for?

824
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,260
It's too much money for like

825
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,580
for one thing that was on one sign and it's kind of scuffed up.

826
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,620
What we just pulled up was kind of scuffed up.

827
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,100
But I take the scuffs. I love that logo.

828
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,140
How we get someone to just make it for you.

829
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,020
Yeah, maybe.

830
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,260
But you have to know that it was there.

831
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,380
Well, that's like it was getting the molecules from performances of hot, hot, hot.

832
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,900
It was like soaking them up.

833
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,660
It's in there.

834
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,740
The molecules are trapped in there still somewhere.

835
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,140
There's a cost.

836
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,420
There's a you do both costs and then see how much it's worth to you

837
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,820
that the molecules are in it.

838
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,460
That's what I think with some of this stuff.

839
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,020
Well, yeah, free is kind of.

840
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,380
Yeah, well, I'll think about it.

841
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,740
I do like those molecules. I want those molecules.

842
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,100
But so anyway, it's it's a big year.

843
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,580
Big, big logos.

844
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,060
Hot, hot, hot to have a lot of Geo's and they got to celebrate in a big way.

845
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,740
So you got this February 4th, 1990 on NBC.

846
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,740
Strangely, yes, it was you like you forget about that era.

847
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,460
But like I think would be like five years later when they merged with ABC.

848
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,220
Yeah, like just seeing a Disney thing on NBC with NBC properties.

849
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,660
It just like kind of gives you whiplash.

850
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,100
It still feels weird, even though that's how they were doing it for a while.

851
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,220
And really where I like kind of fell in love with these kind of specials

852
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,500
and with the Michael Eisner intros and the the hellos.

853
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,300
I don't know if you know this, too.

854
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,660
We're very we're so fond of Michael Eisner acting.

855
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,980
This is a big man.

856
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,940
What a treat. What an absolute treat.

857
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,060
It's also just crazy that I knew Michael Eisner by name when I was five.

858
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,820
Yes. Yeah. What a weird, weird thing.

859
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,420
Why? Weird.

860
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,100
Some CEO, especially in this era where like I'm going to venture to say

861
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,460
a lot of these CEOs right now are not particularly well liked.

862
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,140
No, sir. Sort of strange.

863
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,060
We all grew up with affinity for Michael Eisner as if it was winning the pool.

864
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,220
Or he was trying to be Walt.

865
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,140
Right. That's why he did it, I think, was because the, you know, precedent set by Walt.

866
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,580
And he's like, well, I'm Walt now.

867
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,260
Well, I don't know if that's exactly right.

868
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,060
But OK, the guy who got booked for this job, you didn't make this place for us.

869
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,980
But but the other like so.

870
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,780
So this is like right in the era that I love very much.

871
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,340
And I recall I like the I watched one YouTube that was missing some important elements.

872
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,660
Oh, glad I watched the full one with the commercials.

873
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,460
Does it remind me of something that I can't believe has not come up

874
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,900
in all the time we've been doing this, which is the magical world of Disney theme?

875
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Yes, I got this.

876
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,140
That's obviously what my tape had that full thing in there

877
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,700
and had the 90s like a remix of When You Wish Upon a Star.

878
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,780
Right. So good. I got a clip of this.

879
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,660
Brett, could you pull up magical world of Disney theme?

880
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,100
I think this had a let's just like the logo created an aesthetic like

881
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,060
or at least like influenced me in an aesthetic way.

882
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,180
The kind of aesthetics I like and chase this theme.

883
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,220
I feel like influenced my music taste in a major way.

884
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:53,980
That's bang.

885
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,900
And you're shooting past like going around the space like Spaceship Earth in this cool way.

886
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,580
Yeah. Yeah.

887
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,860
And claps that elevated everything to me.

888
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,180
It's like, oh, it's a wonderful world at Disney.

889
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,620
Here's the parks.

890
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,500
Here's like flying shots through the parks.

891
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,660
Yeah. It's like, well, the parks are important.

892
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,300
It's on television. Yeah.

893
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,220
Third parent. You know.

894
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,020
Is there anything comparable at the moment like that?

895
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,460
I know they do the music in there.

896
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,180
Yeah. For the movies, they have like a longer intro.

897
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,460
They've been doing it for a few years where they really like soar over the hills.

898
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,780
And you get a little bit of a longer like emotional beat, I guess.

899
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,060
But there's nothing is fucking cool.

900
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,620
Is that shit? No.

901
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:43,260
I mean, I did like when that that current intro, the like lush CGI worlds with the,

902
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,900
you know, very much the Disney World castle.

903
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,060
But then all these like it's all like rivers and trains going by, which is always cool.

904
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,460
But I especially loved it when then you hear a little voice humming the melody.

905
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,500
And then in comes the most well rendered cricket, the least creepy cricket

906
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,420
you've ever seen who lowers down.

907
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,540
Of course, describing the beginning of Zemeckis' Pinocchio.

908
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We all continue to think about and revere.

909
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,420
And it's just so great to see him, you know, land in our world like that.

910
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,940
Sure. With his his face that doesn't look like he was like cut by a knife

911
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,060
20 times, scored on every every inch.

912
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,020
Yeah, I was thinking yesterday, I was like,

913
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,580
was there a live action lady in the tramp in the middle of the lockdown years?

914
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,900
And I was like straight to Disney Plus.

915
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,980
Yeah, some of those live action straight to Disney Plus ones really,

916
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,700
you know, giving out psychic damage to a very hard time.

917
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,060
Was Justin Theroux Tramp or something?

918
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,580
I believe that's true. Am I wrong?

919
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,860
Oh, I first I was like, was it Dev Patel?

920
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,940
But that was a joke I made about the Fox and the Hound.

921
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,980
Oh, that was a hypothetical one.

922
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,660
Yeah, right. It's hard to remember.

923
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,660
It's like because it's just it's all folded into these.

924
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,820
Yeah, fake ones that I have joked about in the past.

925
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,620
Yeah, where you're like, you know, like, yeah, let's say the new little mermaid

926
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,740
where Aquafina is scuttle.

927
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,900
And wait, what do you mean that happened?

928
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,100
A funny joke a few years ago.

929
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,140
There's talk that they said that the Lion King is going to be their Star Wars

930
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,540
universe. Oh, my God.

931
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,500
Yeah, we haven't talked about that.

932
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,620
Yeah. What is that?

933
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,540
Wait, the rumor is is that, yeah, they're going to do Simba's pride.

934
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,860
They're going to do it all. Yeah.

935
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,940
Everything you'd ever want to see from that one movie.

936
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,620
Remember when you saw Lion King and you said not enough.

937
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,900
Yeah. I do all of it.

938
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,900
So it's just going to become a series of like made for TV, limited series.

939
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,740
Every place you want to watch it, it'll be available.

940
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,740
OK, Theroux and Tessa Thompson.

941
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,940
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

942
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,620
Yeah. I thought I've never seen it.

943
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,500
I just I just knew that this is as as arbitrary.

944
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,340
As any names we could have come up with.

945
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,780
Yeah. Yeah. Just like, you know, like go on the star meter.

946
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,460
Look at the top 500.

947
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,580
Pick a random one. 22 and four ninety two.

948
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,940
Some of the live action casting, it's like, OK, you can predict it by like

949
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,820
who got a profile in Vanity Fair Esquire.

950
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,980
Lord, it's just one of the things you get now when you get famous.

951
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,660
Yeah. Yeah.

952
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
SNL, you know, Disney live action.

953
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,660
Yeah. And you can get a liquor.

954
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,820
A magazine, a multi page magazine profile that an executive or their assistant

955
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,180
will see going, who's this new up and comer?

956
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,420
Well, they could be Bianca and Bernard.

957
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,900
Surely. Oh, let's mock like a mock up at GQ with you on the cover

958
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,860
and just send it to Disney. Yeah.

959
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,340
Oh, that sounds great.

960
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,500
Yeah. We'll get you in that.

961
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,700
The clothes that Jerry Seinfeld wore in that one photo shoot a couple of months ago.

962
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, right.

963
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,500
Oh, yeah. Cool jacket.

964
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
The cool jacket, everything.

965
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,100
And like we'll do the same poses and then we'll just send it a couple of

966
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,260
a couple of copies to Disney.

967
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,140
Yeah. It was a great spread about this up and comer, Jason Sheridan.

968
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,300
And I really liked his perfume ad, too.

969
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,820
Yeah. Yeah. The sample smelled wonderful.

970
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,060
Let's get him for Sword in the Stone. Yeah.

971
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,820
Look, me and Beanie, Beanie Feldstein, we had a great time

972
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,180
making live action rescuers, you know, I just call her Beanie.

973
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,980
Beans. You don't know this.

974
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,500
Yeah. I mean, Beans.

975
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,940
She hates that. She hates it, but she kind of likes it.

976
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,020
She lets me do it. Yeah, I do it.

977
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,900
So if I may just occasionally

978
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,980
give a little bit of texture to the tape that I was watching.

979
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,740
Oh, please. Yeah.

980
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,220
We got a snippet of a news promo right before this began.

981
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,580
And just so you guys know what's happening,

982
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,460
Geraldo was spending 24 hours as a condemned man on death row.

983
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,460
So that's what was happening

984
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,140
on NBC either that week or later that night.

985
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,140
Now, you go see what life is like if you were in prison

986
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,580
and then you and you eat the food and you experience the small spaces.

987
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,980
OK, sure. And then you really are doing it.

988
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,740
But if you're on death row, we're lacking one big actual component.

989
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,700
Climax of that experience. Yeah.

990
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,340
Was he did they at least like fool him into thinking he was really going to be executed?

991
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,540
I think these are all questions that were answered in the special.

992
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,620
I only got the promo. Yeah. Sorry.

993
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,020
You want to know if he got the last cigarette and the firing line walks at the root?

994
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,820
Well, I just want to know how committed to the bit Geraldo was.

995
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,100
Does he order a final meal that just eats the leaves?

996
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,700
That's the end. He just gets the nicest like a bunch of ice cream.

997
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,540
Do they do like the strap him in and like the that seems like a very

998
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,460
very franconstein thing to do? Absolutely.

999
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,940
It is like a big showy like Frankenstein's monster version of the electric chair.

1000
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,660
Just descending upon his fucking skull.

1001
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1002
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,740
And then you got to be that. Oh, we got to find that.

1003
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,380
Yeah. But then all the walls come down, right?

1004
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,540
Then they flip a switch.

1005
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,300
But it's just that all the walls come down and then all his friends and family.

1006
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,700
Surprise.

1007
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,140
Just did Blitzer scene from Mission Impossible.

1008
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,940
Yes. Yeah.

1009
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,220
Pulls off his fucking face mask.

1010
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,660
I've never seen is there is Trump.

1011
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,140
I've never seen someone eat a whole viennet of ice cream cake that

1012
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,540
I have experienced.

1013
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,740
I've never experienced it.

1014
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,980
Oh, so terrified thinking about a die.

1015
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,340
So one more. Is there a backup around anywhere?

1016
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,220
Geraldo was like an original try guy in a lot of ways.

1017
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,140
Wow. In many ways.

1018
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,020
Yeah.

1019
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,460
Geraldo tries out the Al Capone vault.

1020
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,100
He tries out death row.

1021
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,020
Tries out getting.

1022
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,260
Did he would do get like head butted or stabbed or something?

1023
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,380
What was the physical thing that happened to him?

1024
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,420
I recall Rick Sanchez, I feel like, kind of inherited that role.

1025
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,260
He was a guy got waterboarded because he was like, well, yeah,

1026
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,380
I guess not really torture.

1027
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,420
And they think they like do it for like one second.

1028
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,020
He's like, oh, oh, no, no.

1029
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,340
Geraldo tried out being in a

1030
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,500
foreign battlefield, being in a foreign theater of war while having a gun on him.

1031
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,420
Do you remember that? Really?

1032
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,540
No, I don't think I do.

1033
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,820
During the Iraq war, they were interviewing him and and he he made some weird

1034
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,380
offhand comment and they're like, Geraldo, are you armed?

1035
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,020
And he's like, well, I can't.

1036
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,860
This is a very complicated place.

1037
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,780
And it's just like Geraldo just want to brag about like having a

1038
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,460
handgun on his person.

1039
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,420
I don't remember that.

1040
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,020
No, me neither. But it's.

1041
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,420
We've said we've talked about him enough now that there'll be a pay walled episode

1042
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,620
coming soon.

1043
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,900
Probably enough for all of her all.

1044
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,740
Though, yeah. Yeah.

1045
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,780
Well, he's on Baywatch.

1046
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,180
So that's playing a wacky nerd.

1047
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,180
That's what got me.

1048
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,380
They watch and somebody let me know.

1049
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,220
I didn't know that.

1050
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,940
Was G Gordon Liddy ever on Baywatch?

1051
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,820
What wasn't he on the Miami Vice?

1052
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,700
Yeah, he's on a lot of shows.

1053
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,780
Oh, I love that came from nowhere.

1054
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah. And then also the Pennsylvania lottery numbers, Daily, eight, seven, four.

1055
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,980
And the big four is four, three, four, one.

1056
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,180
That's OK.

1057
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,540
Thank you. Thank you.

1058
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,700
That brings up like like now when my girlfriend and I, when we're like

1059
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,340
half asleep, we're winding down asleep.

1060
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,780
I will often put on YouTube compilations of like

1061
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,820
it's one of my favorite genres now of like 80s, 90s commercials.

1062
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,420
Like it's just like 30 minutes or an hour of commercials.

1063
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,100
But then I always reach over and like skip, skip embedded ads,

1064
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,260
like skip the YouTube.

1065
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,020
Yes, the current commercial.

1066
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,140
I need to watch the old ones.

1067
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,340
I want to watch the old ones that's lulling me to sleep.

1068
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,220
But yes, I'm watching lots of ads, but not like that.

1069
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,340
Yeah, I don't need to see the real ads for things I can't buy.

1070
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,460
So special proper.

1071
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,540
Let's here's some other like full wrap around context.

1072
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,900
And this is going to give away some of who's in it,

1073
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,540
which certainly we could do the list ourselves.

1074
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,140
But you got to we love our jam packed special openings

1075
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,140
where they say a lot of names really quick.

1076
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,820
Breck, you pull the clip 35th special opening

1077
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:15,380
because it is just an assault of of celebrities.

1078
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,980
Yeah, a good list. Sure.

1079
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,060
Tonight Disneyland's throwing a party and you're all invited.

1080
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,180
Host Tony Danza is all choked up with special guests from the cast of Cheers.

1081
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,580
Everybody loves Disney.

1082
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,900
Miss Piggy. Oh, I wish I could be Cinderella.

1083
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,660
And the Muppets.

1084
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,780
Know what I mean? Ernest.

1085
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,100
And it's true. Charlie.

1086
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,300
I sure know it has gotten wet in my mouth.

1087
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,300
President Reagan, DJ, Jassy, Jeff and the Fresh Prince

1088
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,860
and the whole cast of your favorite Disney characters.

1089
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,580
It's Disneyland's 35th anniversary celebration.

1090
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,140
It's a good lineup. It's a very good line up.

1091
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,540
Yeah, yes, indeed. All over the map.

1092
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,260
Pop culturally.

1093
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,780
Cheers, as we said, weird seeing NBC properties and like the biggest NBC

1094
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:05,220
property and getting to hear their thoughts about Disney.

1095
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,500
Something that probably didn't typically happen on the show.

1096
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,140
The supporting cast.

1097
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,540
Yeah, we're missing a couple.

1098
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,380
Yeah, that's true.

1099
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,660
You're right. You're right.

1100
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,700
Yeah, they are there for Mickey's 60th, which was two years before.

1101
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,060
And I guess Dancin and Kirsty Alley are not involved here.

1102
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,340
Yeah, you mentioned that when you brought up doing one of these specials,

1103
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,860
you also brought up Mickey's 60th birthday, which you also have

1104
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,340
with the commercials and all aired two years prior.

1105
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,260
Similar specials, but same format, like super jam packed.

1106
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,460
Hop around format wise.

1107
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,540
We go fully into the world of this sitcom.

1108
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,020
But then here's and here's a news report.

1109
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,180
And then here's a bunch of like stuff on film.

1110
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,660
Both of these are I think it's the same DP also.

1111
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,500
All this these specials are very elevated, I think, in terms of their

1112
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,580
their shooting style and oh, and Charlie Fleischer, of course, the other.

1113
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,620
Yes. The other.

1114
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,020
Well, Roger is a big a big part of.

1115
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,380
Oh, right. Yeah.

1116
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,540
So you got to have Charlie in there, too.

1117
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,100
But yeah, cheers in both of those specials.

1118
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,820
You get to and you get to hear their thoughts about Tony Danza, too,

1119
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,140
which is like when Rhea Perlman as Carla references

1120
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:17,180
Tony Banta on Taxi, a show that her husband is on

1121
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,100
and that she was also on a few episodes as his love interest.

1122
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,300
Anyway, yeah, yeah.

1123
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,900
Well, and kind of weird like, like, I mean, maybe they were

1124
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,260
knowingly dancing around that it's a Tony Danza guy

1125
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,340
who plays a lot of characters named Tony.

1126
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,940
Must have been a fun joke at the time.

1127
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,100
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1128
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,060
And but then also that they're talking about this with the confusion

1129
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,380
is coming from Woody, who is played by Woody Harrell.

1130
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,420
So that's another character with the same name.

1131
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,660
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1132
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,420
And he watches Who's the Boss, which is an ABC show, which I which was.

1133
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,460
Wait, what? Interesting.

1134
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,500
Oh, I looked at it.

1135
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,700
That must be another NBC.

1136
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,820
That must be why they have Tony Danza.

1137
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,100
No, I didn't know that either.

1138
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,060
I assumed it was NBC. Strange.

1139
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,820
Well, they lured him away.

1140
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,460
It was a friendly agreement.

1141
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,700
I I didn't I didn't realize that.

1142
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,580
So Taxi ends in 83.

1143
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,340
Who's the Boss starts in 84 and goes, I think, until 92.

1144
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,860
And it was very, very successful.

1145
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,620
So like this is a big get.

1146
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,980
You get all most of the cheers cast and you get the star of Who's the Boss

1147
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,660
on this anniversary special.

1148
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,180
Yes. Who's consistently been on TV for 12 years at this point.

1149
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,580
Yes. But it's it still feels to me I'm like, yeah, Tony, Tony Danza

1150
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,700
almost feels like a punch line a little bit now.

1151
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,220
Absolutely. Or like the like that getting him doesn't seem like it should be so crazy.

1152
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,100
But I saw I found an interview with the director of the special.

1153
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,100
I'll put a pin in that.

1154
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,740
That is a Shyamalan like twist for me at the end of the show.

1155
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,460
I jumped out of my chair when I saw who directed this.

1156
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,220
I scream. Yeah, yeah, right.

1157
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,860
Rightfully so.

1158
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,900
But no, the director said he was a little bit like

1159
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,980
when they called him in to do it, like and we got Tony Danza.

1160
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,260
And he's like, so and they're like, Tony, that's a big deal.

1161
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,500
He's on the biggest show.

1162
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,660
He has the highest Q rating.

1163
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,940
That old that outmoded thing of like who's the most likable,

1164
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,580
most known likable person on television.

1165
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,700
So the director is baffled.

1166
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,540
Who knew Tony Danza was such a big name?

1167
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,300
Also says he only had him for eight hours on one day.

1168
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,700
They shot all of that in that amount of time, which when you think like

1169
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,540
they hop around with them, there's the whole Jungle Cruise bit,

1170
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,780
which is very involved, said he was nice and extremely professional.

1171
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,700
So that kind of makes sense, given that he's credited as the host

1172
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,940
and he's really not that present throughout a lot of this shows up a lot later.

1173
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,300
Yeah. And you know, he doesn't really do any hosting duties

1174
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,660
for what it feels like at 30 minutes.

1175
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,980
Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.

1176
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,740
You lose him for a while.

1177
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,940
The whole beginning has nothing to do with him.

1178
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,100
They're like looking for him, you know, and then they find him and then like.

1179
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,820
Oh, yes. A lot of where is he?

1180
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,260
Yeah. Right.

1181
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,420
Yeah. They knew the time was like. Yeah.

1182
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,460
But so we get a bunch of stuff on the Cheers set.

1183
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,100
It's the framing device. Yeah.

1184
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:06,900
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's it.

1185
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,900
Ends up being the wrapper.

1186
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,380
It's around all of this.

1187
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,620
They are going to they are going to interrupt mud wrestling,

1188
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,460
which seems like a racy thing for children.

1189
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,820
I mean, a family special, really,

1190
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,100
so that they can watch the Disney special.

1191
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,180
Yeah. Wow. So everything you're watching is in the Cheers universe.

1192
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,020
Specifically, like our first cutaway, which is,

1193
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,860
I guess, arguable if it's Cheers canon, but it's about Woody as a boy.

1194
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,540
Yeah, I think it has to be.

1195
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,220
I think it has to be.

1196
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:40,180
Even though it's filmed totally different with it, I don't I can't imagine

1197
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,460
you ever saw young Woody again.

1198
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,220
Yeah, this this and I'm sure we've talked about it before.

1199
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,820
Maybe it's come up on every year of our haunted mansion.

1200
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,900
I don't know. I love to talk about this thing.

1201
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,780
It's so great that Woody has a lot of confused Disneyland

1202
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,980
memories that everybody's correcting him on.

1203
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,420
But there's one that is crystal clear in his head.

1204
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,780
And it's this special time that he went on the haunted mansion.

1205
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,980
And he was very scared to go on the haunted.

1206
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,900
First of all, just the shocker of flashback in Cheers Studio Camera World.

1207
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,900
You're in you're in the Cheers mode.

1208
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,940
Yeah. Yeah.

1209
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,300
And then you go as as as Jason was saying, this is Jim Burroughs directed this.

1210
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,580
It's on the set.

1211
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,300
This is identical to what you would see watching Cheers.

1212
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,420
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1213
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,900
Well, as we were saying before, in terms of the stacked lineup of this,

1214
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,580
Jim Burroughs part of it.

1215
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,500
But before we started recording, Jason said this news to us and said,

1216
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,740
I was watching the credits and I was like, oh, my God.

1217
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,860
Well, I had the biggest both directors, but I included James Burroughs in the.

1218
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,380
No, the oh, my God was specifically for James Burroughs.

1219
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,700
I remember specifically.

1220
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,060
Well, just because it was it was kind of strange where it's like

1221
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,620
80 percent of the cast and Bill Prady, one of the main writers,

1222
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,500
wrote that sketch, the wraparound sketch.

1223
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,060
You mean for the that's the sheer.

1224
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,020
No, Bill Prady wrote the Muppets section.

1225
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,980
Yeah, because he was a Muppets.

1226
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,460
He was a Muppets writer at the time.

1227
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,260
Yeah. Yeah. He didn't. OK.

1228
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,100
That makes more sense.

1229
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,940
They don't have any credited cheer like for some of this for

1230
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,980
for the earnest segment and for the Muppets segment.

1231
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,340
They they in the credits say who Ernest Ernest writers wrote the earnest

1232
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,340
Muppets, a Muppets writer, Bill Prady wrote the Muppets thing.

1233
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
But they don't say that for Cheers, which makes me wonder if it was just

1234
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,460
whoever wrote the special wrote this.

1235
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,020
It might have been same writers as that 60th birthday also.

1236
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:41,940
Two sets of writers.

1237
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,420
And I did I did look them up to see what they were about.

1238
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,700
None from Cheers.

1239
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,380
One. No, one is is they're both husband and wife teams.

1240
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,340
Interestingly enough. Yeah.

1241
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,980
One is is the people who did the Mickey special two years before. Yeah.

1242
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,940
And they fittingly enough made a name for themselves

1243
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,180
by packaging commercials and airing them as specials in primetime.

1244
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,620
Oh, OK. Oh, a lot about commercials.

1245
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,940
But that's like one of their big things. Oh, sure.

1246
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,020
That's it's like Joy Albrecht and Scott Garan.

1247
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,180
Very close to your name. Yeah, almost.

1248
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,980
And I think I actually think Scott Garan

1249
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,940
maybe directed the Mickey special two years before.

1250
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,140
Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah.

1251
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,220
And did not direct this one.

1252
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,020
And I know why, but I'll also put a pin in that pin in that.

1253
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:31,180
And then the other group of writers came out of.

1254
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,980
Do you guys know about almost live the Seattle based

1255
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,460
sketch show that aired locally before SNL?

1256
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,740
It's most notable because its alumni list includes Bill Nye

1257
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,300
and Joel McHale. Oh, OK.

1258
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,500
And it sounds familiar, but I don't know anything.

1259
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,940
Yeah, it's and I it's like it's a thing where you're like, oh, OK.

1260
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
Like I've never seen it.

1261
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,500
And I think in Seattle, it's like, oh, yeah, almost live.

1262
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,740
Like people who people who grew up with it, like it's on before SNL.

1263
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,140
So of course I watched it.

1264
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,780
And it was Joe and Nancy Guppy.

1265
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,980
And they're both still in Seattle.

1266
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,220
They wrote for not necessarily the news. Oh, yeah.

1267
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,580
Oh, all right. A lot of people came out of that.

1268
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,140
So there was a period of time when they were in L.A.

1269
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,980
trying to make it happen.

1270
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,220
And I think it was when this happened as well.

1271
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,180
Some of some of that Disney dough.

1272
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,100
But OK, so yeah, we we flashback to young Woody.

1273
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,220
His friends are making fun of him for not wanting to go on the ride.

1274
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:32,260
But then he gets some some comfort and like a ride buddy in the form of this girl

1275
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,380
who is a spoiler, pretty ghostly from the beginning.

1276
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,620
Yeah, appears out of nowhere.

1277
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,660
Yeah, perfect pink dress.

1278
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,860
And yeah, yes, yes.

1279
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,060
So it comes from nowhere.

1280
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,540
Why him specifically?

1281
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,860
I don't know. But you know, but but he's happy because he's got a female companion.

1282
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,740
And that's good. And you you then just get to go on this very charming

1283
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,460
Haunted Mansion ride that that typifies what I like about the special so much.

1284
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,620
And if we're going to pay tribute to Disney in a real way or to Disneyland

1285
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,620
in a real way, to like film and preserve the classic rides really well

1286
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,180
shot in an elevated way, then then specials would usually do it.

1287
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,020
And I like that it's kind of no frills a little bit.

1288
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,300
They like there's there's jokes and gags with everybody.

1289
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,020
But you also just get to see like singing busts and, you know,

1290
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:27,660
somebody lifting the lid of the coffin with just filmed very nicely.

1291
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,780
You get to see him in more clear ways than when you're on the ride even.

1292
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,260
Yes, true. Yeah. Yeah.

1293
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,620
You know, sometimes you want to see certain things and the car turns.

1294
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,060
Linger. It's nice lighting.

1295
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,980
Yeah. Close up. Yeah. Yeah.

1296
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,140
And there's a little extra fog machine.

1297
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,900
Yeah. In a lot of it.

1298
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,500
Definitely. And it was also there's a shot where Woody and the ghost girl

1299
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,340
are dancing in the grand hall, like next to the ghost.

1300
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,900
Before the big reveal, they puff out of their seats

1301
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,980
and are on the floor with yeah, with the ghost dancing.

1302
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah. You know, you know, you don't know anything's up, I guess.

1303
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,060
At that point, you're not supposed to.

1304
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,220
Yes, she has the ability to puff somewhere else

1305
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,740
and bring another person with her.

1306
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,380
But who know? I don't know what's up with this girl.

1307
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,220
Still a lot of questions.

1308
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,020
She's also rude.

1309
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,260
She's a smart aleck.

1310
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,780
She calls that she calls Charlie ugly, I think.

1311
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh, that's right. All dark and ugly.

1312
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,460
All dark and ugly. Yeah.

1313
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,060
Yeah. She's got a she's got some sass to her.

1314
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,180
Yeah. We forgot that.

1315
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,500
This is the kind of the the runner of the special is that

1316
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,460
Charlie Fleischer plays the only employee

1317
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:42,780
very surly employee at that with all always with different accents.

1318
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,060
Voice affectations. This one is Vincent Price.

1319
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,620
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1320
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:51,860
But, you know, good performances is creepy haunted mansion person.

1321
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,260
You get to there's the you see like somebody trying to get out of the coffin

1322
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,700
and they say Woody.

1323
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,660
And then you remember, oh, yeah, this is supposed to be Woody Boy from that's here.

1324
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,540
Yes, I fully forgot. I am. Yes.

1325
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,820
Lately, this is the character Woody that you know from working at a bar in Boston.

1326
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,500
But this is him years.

1327
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,380
So I guess it's the 70s, seemingly.

1328
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,900
There's nothing that really negates it being the 70s,

1329
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,620
but it doesn't feel super 70s either.

1330
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,980
But yes, the whole time.

1331
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,180
And it's a ghost girl.

1332
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,700
And also it's Woody from Cheers. It's so strange.

1333
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,300
The character full name, by the way, Woodrow Huckleberry, Tiberius Boyd.

1334
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,420
Thank you. That's a that's a solid sitcom joke

1335
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,260
where it's just like, oh, that character named like Jack or something

1336
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,540
has an insane name.

1337
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,860
Tiberius probably references Star Trek.

1338
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,260
Right. Isn't that a Tiberius James Tiberius Kirk?

1339
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah. Oh, that's cool.

1340
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,100
And then also there's long stretches of the ride without anybody talking.

1341
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,020
They just like let the ride just kind of do its thing,

1342
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,940
which makes me wonder what is Woody's describing?

1343
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:03,060
He's just describing the the ride because all of this is a story that he's telling.

1344
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:03,940
Oh, that's right. Right. Right.

1345
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,340
And like they say, like, well, what a beautiful story.

1346
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,100
So like and then you'll never get then we went by this these four.

1347
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,740
We're in an omnimover Bob Gurr built.

1348
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:19,380
And then the omnimover rotated to this point in the ride

1349
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,220
where there was an effect that he's really specific about.

1350
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,140
It's kind of like you're the camera.

1351
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,740
Like you're the view.

1352
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,420
They could point you where they want you to see.

1353
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,180
Yeah. Well, faced every which way.

1354
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,380
Walt's philosophy was not actually one vocal, one point of watching.

1355
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,900
You saw things all around you and you'd have a different

1356
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,940
different experience each time you went on to rewrite ability.

1357
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,220
Norm Cliff, you're falling asleep.

1358
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,220
What are you doing?

1359
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,740
Also, we haven't mentioned yet in the cheer scene, Maris is there.

1360
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,780
No, little lily that's played by Bebe Newworth.

1361
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,500
Maris, you never see that's Niles.

1362
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,700
OK, yeah.

1363
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,820
I so then, you know, so they're showing really all the classic,

1364
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,180
the big parts of the ride that we know.

1365
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,180
And then, of course, you got to go out on the grand finale.

1366
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,780
The fat lady. What is this? Why does this happen?

1367
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,140
I've never noticed that statue.

1368
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,420
Oh, right.

1369
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,020
But it's but she's it's almost it's presented like the climax

1370
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:27,660
that the girl says it's not over till the fat lady sings and Woody says, who?

1371
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,980
And then it shows this statue or this animatronic

1372
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,460
that I've never thought about before.

1373
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,620
Yeah, but is the she's in the back somewhere.

1374
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,340
Yeah. Yeah, that's the is that the official name?

1375
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,100
Well, we'll get to that.

1376
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,940
We will we get to this person this year?

1377
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,860
This year? I don't know.

1378
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,060
Twenty twenty three. We'll have to wait and see.

1379
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,820
Jason turned into a little ghost boy there.

1380
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,980
There's a ghost of his ghost boy energy.

1381
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,220
But just a strange way.

1382
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,620
You don't get hitchhiking ghosts.

1383
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,060
You don't get suddenly it's the climax is this character who?

1384
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,940
Yes. Isn't it kind of background?

1385
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,860
Yes. No, I know.

1386
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,860
And when she said that, I go, oh, yeah, I guess, because there's I've talked

1387
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,580
to I've talked about this and I don't want to turn in on a mansion.

1388
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,820
But I feel like, you know, someone they can brighten some of these ghosts up

1389
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,740
because a lot's going on in the Haunted Mansion graveyard, but you can't see it.

1390
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,740
And sometimes you go, oh, wow, there's a game going on or something

1391
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,060
between two ghosts back there, but I can barely make it out.

1392
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,340
So, yeah, it's this is another one where it's like, that's a weird pull.

1393
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,260
I guess just because of the phrase and insulting close up.

1394
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,620
Yeah. Domain joke that they wanted to use. Right.

1395
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1396
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,700
You don't have to pay any husband, wife, writer teams for that.

1397
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,460
Yeah. A lot of opera based jokes back in the Golden Age of sitcoms.

1398
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,340
That's true. Yeah.

1399
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:44,500
So then it's a nice ride and he made it through.

1400
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,740
And then they share like a moment, but then she disappears.

1401
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,700
And then the friends there again.

1402
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:54,100
And I feel like I presented this once out of context on Twitter,

1403
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,780
which if you take it out of context, is really funny that he's what it's.

1404
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,460
Well, if you don't know the information, you're watching a kid talking to his friends.

1405
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,540
And then he turns and looks and sees a girl and waves fondly.

1406
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,220
And then the girl disappears.

1407
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,660
And then he keeps looking and rubs her ribbon on his face.

1408
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,460
And then it fades to Woody from Cheers on the set of Cheers.

1409
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,860
And everyone from Cheers is there.

1410
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,460
Like if you turned on the TV, if you were late, if you put this on

1411
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,380
six minutes in and then like, wait, huh?

1412
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,260
This was all within Cheers.

1413
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,180
Oh, yeah. I would say there's several moments within this special

1414
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,500
where if you tuned in, not at the beginning, you'd be like, Oh, what is happening?

1415
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,180
Yeah. In America.

1416
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,140
Why is Charles Fleischer firing a gun a lot?

1417
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:40,780
Yeah, indeed.

1418
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,340
But a fun sequence, a good sequence.

1419
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,500
I also want to note that it's I didn't catch it to watching it a second time

1420
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:55,020
that when Kelsey Grammer says, Yes, Disneyland is a magical place.

1421
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,020
I realized, wait a minute, he was part of a Disneyland anniversary.

1422
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,900
Just 15 years later. Oh, yeah.

1423
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,860
He would be on a stage talking about being a UN interpreter for it's a smart.

1424
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,060
Oh, dear Lord.

1425
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,100
Dear God.

1426
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,460
That was only 15.

1427
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,140
Here he is, like being just a peripheral part of a Disneyland anniversary.

1428
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,500
Probably if it occurred to him, you know what?

1429
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:19,860
I should try to expand my I should be the host of the next one is what I'm

1430
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,180
calling Disney now. I'm going to get ahead of it on the 50th.

1431
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,020
It'll be wonderful and not perilous.

1432
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,620
The falling. You've seen this clip.

1433
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,380
Oh, I mean, yeah, many times.

1434
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,500
It's important. You've seen an American flag.

1435
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,300
And certainly you've seen another hallmark of this great nation.

1436
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,940
It's one of the finest things we've ever produced.

1437
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,140
Did we talk on the show?

1438
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,100
I think Jane explained it to me because I think one of her friends

1439
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,580
might have been there or like worked that theater before.

1440
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,780
But that stage is not totally flat.

1441
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,420
There's a lot of divots.

1442
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,740
There's a lot of cutouts for effects and stuff rising in and out of the ground.

1443
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,820
A weird jagged. So is why it happened.

1444
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,060
Yeah. He should not have moved so much

1445
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,700
because it was an insane.

1446
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,060
So you're blaming Kelsey.

1447
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,660
Jason officially puts the blame on Kelsey Grammer.

1448
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,500
I for the he should have known.

1449
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,580
I heard it here first.

1450
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,980
I was at the stairs.

1451
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:17,900
So like the director told him to go up there and just wander around.

1452
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,820
Actor worth his salt knows that you go and you see the show

1453
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:26,620
of what the theater you're performing in is before to know the layout,

1454
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,700
to know that when at the end, Jeannie turns into the

1455
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,700
turns Jafar into the Jeannie Jafar and shoots out of that area

1456
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,100
where he was going to walk.

1457
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,780
And then he would have known that there was a hole in that part

1458
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,260
or whatever you're saying. There's a curve.

1459
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,300
Jeannie pops out and makes a joke about like the Scion hamsters,

1460
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,180
you know, and goes about his day.

1461
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:50,460
The what? Remember the giant CG creatures in those cars? No.

1462
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,100
Am I Joe? Do you know what I'm talking about? No.

1463
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,220
This wasn't sorry. You're not.

1464
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,740
This isn't the dragon who does the weather on the news.

1465
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:02,140
No, I was trying to think of a topical thing that he might have said

1466
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,460
that was like really big at the time.

1467
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,700
You should have just said I guess I should have just said snooki,

1468
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,260
but we said snooki so much to wait.

1469
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,060
It's not Scion. It's Kia. It's Kia.

1470
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,820
No, you all remember.

1471
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:16,940
You all remember.

1472
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,460
I know. I know.

1473
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,180
We know what they are.

1474
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,020
I'm off today.

1475
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,820
I got my Maris wrong or got my Kia wrong. Oh, yeah.

1476
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,740
There's just this special is so action packed.

1477
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,020
It's a lot to keep.

1478
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,380
It's going every which way.

1479
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,740
Plate spinning balls in the air, you know.

1480
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:38,340
OK, where we move after this, we see our eyes here for the first time.

1481
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,580
Yes. Yeah.

1482
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,140
The the Cheers cast then turns on the special.

1483
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,740
This isn't in every version.

1484
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,940
This is an in the expanded cut.

1485
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,980
I didn't realize. Yeah.

1486
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:51,300
Yeah. So they turn back to the TV after this ghost story.

1487
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,620
Let's watch the special.

1488
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,140
And then you're getting they didn't turn it on two minutes earlier.

1489
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,220
They would have seen themselves.

1490
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,940
Oh, and it would have like mirror in a mirror in a mirror.

1491
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,940
Explode.

1492
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,500
Hopefully first collapse. Yeah.

1493
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,540
But yeah, they turn they turn on the TV and then Eisner is like,

1494
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,180
we'll have more after the break and maybe says some names.

1495
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,020
Anytime they say the list of names is very funny.

1496
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,780
Yeah. And he gets like winded.

1497
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,180
They give him that get like DJ Jazzy's having the rest of it and more.

1498
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,620
Miss Piggy. President Reagan.

1499
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,100
And they make a big deal of President Reagan, which is the next big thing,

1500
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,420
which is really just that they filmed a speech of his.

1501
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:24,100
And there was a big deal that he came back

1502
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,220
since he was the host of the opening.

1503
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,820
Right. Special.

1504
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,420
Can I do my quick commercial break of. Oh, yeah.

1505
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,500
Yeah, let's check. We had

1506
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,900
I don't know if you guys remember the Reach toothbrush commercial

1507
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,940
with the drawn like Ziggy like character who opens his mouth

1508
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,100
180 degrees and then brushes his teeth like it's a straight line.

1509
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,540
That one has stuck with me because it was horrifying.

1510
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:47,380
Just a guy opening his mouth like Pac-Man and then it going all the way around.

1511
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,500
Oh, his reach can get get back there, you know.

1512
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,060
Then there's a Diet Coke commercial that's an Indiana Jones homage.

1513
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,460
But you don't know why.

1514
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,780
And it's a to be continued.

1515
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,020
And so, yeah, two part commercial. Yeah.

1516
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,700
And then Alf and the Hogan family have new episodes this week.

1517
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,300
And in the Hogan family, Jason Bateman's hitting on Lisa Rinna.

1518
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,820
Wow. OK. Interesting pair.

1519
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,580
Wow. Both still relevant.

1520
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,300
Yeah, very much so.

1521
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,340
And very short commercial break, though, the first one. That was it.

1522
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,060
Yeah, they were shorter in general back then.

1523
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,540
You can really feel that in this.

1524
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:24,940
So you come back for with Reagan quick speech.

1525
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:30,340
And this this led to this might lead right into finally to talk about the director

1526
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,660
for a minute.

1527
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:37,060
They do bring Reagan out to Yankee Doodle Dandy, which I thought was very

1528
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,540
unpresidential and maybe a little bit mean, but

1529
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,820
couldn't clear the Star Spangled Banner or Hail to the Chief.

1530
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,580
This is a quote from the director.

1531
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:51,220
And this is all this info is from Filmmaker magazine from an interview.

1532
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,900
Oh, I hated him.

1533
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,140
Reagan gave a speech at Disneyland and we just shot it.

1534
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,860
We used very little of it in the special.

1535
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,580
I didn't didn't like Reagan as many people don't.

1536
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,500
The director. Who is this phantom director?

1537
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,220
We reveal it this early.

1538
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,060
We reveal it when we all learn who it is.

1539
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,740
I well, I knew it going in.

1540
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,980
I will say I knew it going in.

1541
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,580
I might say doing doing it sooner or later, because I have stories to pepper in.

1542
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,940
OK, from this interview, which was kind of interesting.

1543
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,580
This is this is directed.

1544
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:24,980
Anyone want to do the honors or do anyone feel not cursed to say his name?

1545
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,340
Yeah, I'm worried like Beetlejuice if I say so many times.

1546
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,700
Well, look, if he shows up, it's OK.

1547
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,260
It's the kid I'm worried about.

1548
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,140
Well, this guy is also here.

1549
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,980
Beetlejuice Jr. has done some bad thing beyond canceled.

1550
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,220
John Landis is the director of this special. Shocked me.

1551
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,100
Yeah, shocked. Yeah, huge.

1552
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:51,140
It I feel like it kind of let me know why this thing was elevated,

1553
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,740
why like it does feel very filmic and, you know, kind of advanced

1554
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:59,660
beyond more just like TV ish stuff that they they'd done.

1555
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,580
Good director. Great father.

1556
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,980
But good director.

1557
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,380
To some certain actors didn't make it out.

1558
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,540
Oh, sure. Yes. Yeah.

1559
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,660
And a lot of us.

1560
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,460
Yes, a lot of those movies.

1561
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,860
Yeah, that's it.

1562
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,900
But that's what he's saying about it.

1563
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,140
What he's saying about Reagan is like the interviewers like,

1564
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,940
felt weird that you would do something with Reagan,

1565
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,980
because I thought a lot of your movies like Animal House were very like anti.

1566
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:28,780
Or wait, this thing said, you know, Spies Like Us was a very anti Reagan movie.

1567
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,660
We could forget. Yes. So they.

1568
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,940
But anyway, yeah, John Landis.

1569
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,540
Here's here's why it's it's John Landis.

1570
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,980
I did find this pretty fascinating that.

1571
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,540
OK, so the Muppets are part of this. We know this.

1572
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:47,580
Jim Henson had committed the Muppets to be on the 35th anniversary show.

1573
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,940
Disney made a deal with an outside production company to make the specials.

1574
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,500
That's it must be some of these people who made that that last one.

1575
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,980
So Henson goes down to Anaheim 10 days before the show

1576
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,300
with the Muppet performers to see what's going on.

1577
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,900
And he is, quote, appalled at what they had planned.

1578
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,420
Jim thought it was amateurish, but it's all ready to go.

1579
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,780
They're shooting it really soon.

1580
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:11,140
The talent is already signed. We got Danza.

1581
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,500
We can't go backwards now.

1582
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:21,340
So Jim knows Landis knows he's a big Disney freak, as Landis says himself.

1583
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:25,540
So Jim Henson calls and said, says, do you want to shoot a show in Disneyland?

1584
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:29,620
It's the 35th anniversary special. It's shooting in five days. Wow.

1585
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:34,980
Yeah. So he only had five days to do all of this, which and it's a very

1586
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:38,140
what we have described as being a pretty high end special.

1587
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,900
I mean, some of it was in motion without him.

1588
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,660
But yeah, he only got a five day heads up on this thing at Jim Henson's request.

1589
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,300
Yeah, it's pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

1590
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,540
So to do like, I guess, presumably, please save this.

1591
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,980
I don't know what was going to be going on.

1592
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,860
That's what I want to know. What did it look like before?

1593
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,420
How different could it have been? I don't know. Yeah.

1594
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,900
I bet that Scott Garrett guy was going to direct it, though.

1595
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,060
I think so. Yeah.

1596
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,500
Because like if all the other credits are the same and he did the previous one

1597
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,700
was probably going to do this and then Henson had said no.

1598
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,140
Henson gets you booted from a job. Yeah.

1599
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,580
Personally, what does that even look like?

1600
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,980
The night Mr. Nice.

1601
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:17,380
Yeah. And also, apparently this this period of time where like there

1602
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,780
Disney is interested in acquiring the Muppets is like a very fraught time for Jim.

1603
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:27,060
Oh, right. And maybe stressed out and maybe like a perfectionist in this.

1604
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,460
Like we don't want to do some some Disney crap.

1605
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,740
That's like what he's worried about.

1606
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:34,900
And not unlike Ted Danson and Kirsty Alley's absence later, we do not.

1607
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,220
There's no Henson characters from the Muppets. Oh, true. Yeah.

1608
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,380
It's Oz and goals goals there.

1609
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,620
I was worried I was going to go for a terrible pronunciation, but it is.

1610
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,500
Or gals. I don't know. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Maybe could be.

1611
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:49,580
So anyway, really last minute on on Landis's part,

1612
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:53,260
he seemed pretty delighted by all of this, by getting to do stuff in the park.

1613
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,820
Also, not long after did Beverly Hills Cop 3, which is this big theme park

1614
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,660
romp also shows his super fandom.

1615
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,780
So I think his like love of it definitely is clear in this.

1616
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,300
And I think it's just it's probably just good that Disneyland

1617
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,300
doesn't have a helicopter ride. Jesus Christ. No.

1618
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,460
That's sweeping a wonderful world at Disney.

1619
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,100
They were like, it's already shot. It's already done.

1620
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,300
OK, we got it on tape. We got it on a digital beta.

1621
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,500
OK, so we'll just cut it in. OK, you don't have to do that one.

1622
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,260
You'll see it. We got somebody.

1623
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,980
It's got guns doing that.

1624
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,060
OK, so now we've established director.

1625
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:32,420
Let's let's see a little bit of Eisner, because he and he he said,

1626
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,860
Landis said, like, I got to direct a scene with Eisner and Tony Danza

1627
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,060
and Goofy, and this is what happens right before that.

1628
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,420
And I love, you know, we love our straight to camera Eisner addresses.

1629
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,980
But this I love because it's like a little scene.

1630
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,820
Yeah, this might be my favorite in the whole special.

1631
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,860
I rewatch this so many times.

1632
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,860
We have this is basically this is a little scene between three non actors.

1633
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,980
And two of them, I don't think fancy themselves actors,

1634
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,420
but one of them does.

1635
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,340
And oh, some some flat deliveries here.

1636
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,420
I am excited. Here we go.

1637
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,580
Hi, folks. How are you today?

1638
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,060
Hi. Oh, you didn't have to see Tony Danza, did you?

1639
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,260
No. Have you been to Disneyland before?

1640
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,380
Oh, yes. In fact, I have a snapshot of our first visit.

1641
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,580
Christine Graff and Michael Schwartner.

1642
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,100
You were the first guest 35 years ago on this very spot.

1643
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,540
Now that is impressive.

1644
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:30,060
Christine Graff and Michael Schwartner.

1645
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,420
Christine Graff and Michael Schwartner.

1646
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,420
The only way to elevate that scene is if Michael Eisner recreated the pose

1647
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,740
that Walt was in with the two kids arm around the lady and shaking the hand

1648
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,940
of the guy. Yeah, I know.

1649
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,860
Yeah, he should have made them get on their knees.

1650
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,980
Yeah. You got you look little.

1651
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,420
Let's recreate the pose.

1652
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,940
No, we don't have knee pads.

1653
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,140
I'm going to. All right. Fine.

1654
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,460
You don't want to bend out. Get on this apple box.

1655
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,180
I looked these people up.

1656
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,700
Oh, really? I don't know anything about these.

1657
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,380
Yeah, that's interesting.

1658
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,780
The first people and the first kids in Disneyland.

1659
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,020
Apparently. So it's also funny to think like, OK, 35 years ago.

1660
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,940
And you look at those two now, they are 40 and 42 years old.

1661
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,140
I mean, all due respect, they look.

1662
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:20,180
I mean, everybody in the 90s kind of, you know, a 40 year old looked like he was 60.

1663
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,060
You know, that's true. Yeah.

1664
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,420
Like the Berenstain Bears.

1665
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1666
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,500
Is there like a life parents things?

1667
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,380
But yeah, I looked them up and they they're cousins.

1668
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,620
And it would be and they're married.

1669
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,500
Yeah. They really.

1670
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,300
When you see them, they're like that is a married couple.

1671
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,180
That's what I thought.

1672
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,300
Oh, they were at Disneyland when they were like five and seven.

1673
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,420
Like, that doesn't make any sense. Oh, wait. Yeah.

1674
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,300
Yeah. Wait, why did I think they were married?

1675
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:50,780
And they came out at Disneyland together as children.

1676
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,220
They would not make any sense.

1677
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,180
They were arranged to be married.

1678
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:55,980
Their parents, their cousins.

1679
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:00,500
The story was that, you know, the the Michael Little Michael had had heard

1680
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,180
that Disneyland was opening and they were taking a family trip to Mexico.

1681
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,780
And it was like a stop along the way.

1682
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:06,980
And they stopped.

1683
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:11,020
And the little girl like fell and scraped her knee and was like making a lot of noise.

1684
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,780
And then that kind of got the attention of some officials who are around

1685
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,020
and came up like, are you OK? It's OK.

1686
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:16,980
And like these kids are cute.

1687
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,340
And they're like, you know what?

1688
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,580
Why don't you guys come with me?

1689
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,340
And they're just because they're like playing around.

1690
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,780
Everybody's waiting to go in and they brought them in.

1691
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,820
And, you know, did the photo op and stuff.

1692
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,020
And these are the first two kids, the first two people in Disneyland.

1693
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,260
And they both got lifetime passes to do.

1694
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,540
Which they described as just like

1695
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,660
you get like a new annual pass every year.

1696
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:42,140
OK, there's not some like piece of paper they have.

1697
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,180
I wish there was like a medallion or something.

1698
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:49,380
But no, it's just they got a bunch of annual passes and got three up them every year.

1699
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,620
Wow. Wow.

1700
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,300
I wonder if they got block out dates or anything at this point.

1701
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,940
Yeah, they might be. They have to.

1702
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,660
They started like just shortening their weight around like, do you understand who I am?

1703
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,140
Excuse me. Do you understand who I am?

1704
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,620
Yeah, that's right. Michael Schwardner.

1705
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,940
Oh, yeah. That's where the first people in Disneyland.

1706
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,380
Wow. That's that's all fascinating.

1707
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:14,420
And this also comes after the Calypso montage, which

1708
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,700
just shows like the construction of Disneyland and a bunch of people

1709
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,340
have been to Disneyland throughout the years, including Michael Jackson,

1710
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,940
Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, R.F.K. and JFK.

1711
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:29,500
Yeah. I had a moment where I was like, was that Harry Truman?

1712
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,420
Does that make? Yeah. You know what?

1713
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,940
Yeah, it does. It was the.

1714
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:35,740
Was he still?

1715
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,660
I don't think he was still the president, but he had been the president.

1716
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,060
He had been the president fairly recently. Yeah. Yeah.

1717
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,900
This seems like this is an angle that used to work that I feel like they don't

1718
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,220
as much anymore that they would say, like, why presidents have been here?

1719
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:51,260
Because now I think Disney's fine whether or not you know that presidents have been.

1720
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,620
Yeah. Yeah. They might have been here.

1721
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:54,980
We don't know.

1722
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,860
Probably at some point. We don't drag it anymore.

1723
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,620
I think there were some foreign heads and heads of state in that montage,

1724
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,660
and I could not place.

1725
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,220
Yeah, that was my experience as well.

1726
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,540
So they they're showing this white man.

1727
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,500
I don't know who he is.

1728
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,100
It's like, oh, and then they end with like George H.W.

1729
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,460
Bush, the current. He's in the parade.

1730
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,300
Yes. Wave it.

1731
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,340
Oh, yeah. Kind of like pointing aggressively.

1732
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,260
Yeah. A thousand points.

1733
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,300
He's getting his points done.

1734
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,460
Yeah. I'll do 100 right here and now.

1735
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,980
Then we head into some Danza stuff.

1736
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:29,260
I don't have the Eisner Danza clip.

1737
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,860
Thank God Goofy found him.

1738
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1739
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,820
He's yeah. He comes out and helps.

1740
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,740
He he chews away.

1741
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:41,020
Schwartner and everybody finds Eisner found Tony's in the Jungle Cruise line.

1742
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,540
Danza starts.

1743
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,180
There's a little bit.

1744
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,940
Eisner is annoyed by Danza liking the park and the rides.

1745
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,580
And they get they give Danza the equivalent of exposition.

1746
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,740
He's like, I've been at Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1747
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,180
I've been on. He just like lists a bunch of stuff.

1748
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,500
Yeah, I've been on every ride where we didn't film stuff.

1749
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,540
Yeah. No, every ride with no sketch.

1750
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,580
He also says Jungle Cruise.

1751
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:11,140
Oh, yeah. Well, Jungle Cruise really emphasizes the cruise part.

1752
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,220
Brett, can we play the clip?

1753
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:17,340
Danza. I really like this.

1754
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,420
All the pronunciation.

1755
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,500
This place called Disneyland has come to symbolize

1756
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,380
more than just a locale of mere amusement.

1757
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,620
Play, Tony, it's your turn.

1758
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,620
Got to go, folks. It's Jungle Cruise time.

1759
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,620
All right. All right. Thanks.

1760
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,980
OK. All right.

1761
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,420
All right. All right.

1762
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,500
Was that a catchphrase?

1763
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,420
That's something he said. I really don't think so.

1764
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,220
Were there all right shirts in the late 80s?

1765
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,260
Yeah, it could have been tax.

1766
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,500
It could have been who's the boss.

1767
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,580
Like, it's just general Italian guy.

1768
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:02,780
Like fun loving. Yeah, I've I've I've rewatched some of the early

1769
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,860
taxi episodes recently and you watch it.

1770
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,700
You're like, oh, Rocky had just come out.

1771
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,380
Stallone was a guy.

1772
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,740
They're like, let's have a Stallone in here.

1773
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,660
And that's how Tony because he's a real boxer.

1774
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,940
Yes. Yeah, he's. Yeah. Oh, interesting.

1775
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,700
So, yeah, it is it is Jungle Cruise time.

1776
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:26,620
And this this is a pretty successful sequence, I think.

1777
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,380
Like if the idea of the special is we lovingly

1778
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,900
pay tribute to the rides and shoot them nice and do the basics of the ride,

1779
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:41,340
but then elevate it to like experiences that couldn't usually happen.

1780
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,900
That's that's really what happens here, because when that guide shows up,

1781
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,380
it's not some regular guide.

1782
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,660
It's crazy.

1783
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:52,500
Charlie Fleischer time is Charlie Fleischer doing a little different voice.

1784
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,420
OK, a very unique voice, singular to.

1785
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,580
Is this a good time to talk about what's up with Charlie Fleischer?

1786
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,180
What? Absolutely. What's going on?

1787
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:05,460
Has everybody has everybody like gotten a vibe essentially in some

1788
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,140
at some point in your life, if you thought, why don't we hear

1789
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,100
from Charles Fleischer more?

1790
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,300
And do we know the answer?

1791
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:17,060
I mean, like he it's clearly the afterglow of Roger Rabbit still,

1792
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:20,340
like a thing that helped one of the first things to help revitalize

1793
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,860
Disney out of their kind of valley, their low point.

1794
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:28,100
And so I don't know if they feel like they owe Charles Fleischer something.

1795
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:32,140
If you watch a special, you're like, what fucking stranglehold grip

1796
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,940
did he have on Disney?

1797
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,620
Because he's the true host of this thing.

1798
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,340
Like he has the most lines by far.

1799
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,780
He's in every segment. Yeah.

1800
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:43,460
Shows his range in jungle in the Jungle Cruise segment.

1801
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,340
I don't think Tony Danza says like a word.

1802
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:48,780
Yeah, or just like, oh, excuse me.

1803
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,820
Yeah. Or just like kind of looking looking around.

1804
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,540
It's a lot of talk. But yeah, he's they give him a lot of stuff.

1805
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,940
And I don't know.

1806
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:00,580
I think he's I think Charles Fleischer has a reputation as like a difficult

1807
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,620
weird man.

1808
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,940
Think so. I feel like I'm I don't know what I'm basing that on.

1809
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,740
Yeah, I don't I don't want to say that and not be true.

1810
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,500
Yeah, just like he got a deal.

1811
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,140
It just it feels like I mean, at the Oscars,

1812
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,860
I don't know if it was this year, maybe it was post Roger Reven.

1813
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,140
It was 89.

1814
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:23,300
There was a like tribute to cartoons and it's presented by Robin Williams

1815
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,620
and Charles Fleischer and they're presented as like equals.

1816
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,580
Right. And they have kind of the same energy.

1817
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,980
It's a thousand voices and they just riff and riff.

1818
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:34,100
And that bit is like 12 minutes long. It's crazy.

1819
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:38,460
But you can still you kind of feel the audience reeling from Fleischer

1820
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,700
a little more.

1821
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,980
Maybe there just wasn't a room in this town for the both of them.

1822
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,900
Maybe Robin just completely took that mantle.

1823
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,580
There's a vibe. Yeah.

1824
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,300
And maybe that's all it is.

1825
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,900
Maybe that's all I have to say now is the DM us a few some information's out there.

1826
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,260
But it's a vibe.

1827
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:59,380
I feel like all of his cast member characters are a little surly,

1828
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,380
like a little like, hey, what do you do?

1829
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:07,460
Yeah, I also didn't realize that when I was looking him up,

1830
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,380
how many voices he is in.

1831
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,420
He's not just Roger Rabbit.

1832
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,620
He's like he's a weasel or two.

1833
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,380
Well, isn't he? Is he the baby or is the baby?

1834
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,900
Yeah. Wait, is he?

1835
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,900
Oh, wait, is he all of them?

1836
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,260
I think he is. Yeah, I think he's the cat, too.

1837
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:25,940
Oh, my God. Right. No, totally forgot.

1838
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:30,420
Yeah. So, yeah, it's he it's it's interesting because you would think,

1839
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:34,580
yeah, he would he exploded after this, but it sort of was was Roger

1840
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:38,100
and then little things and then they stopped using Roger.

1841
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,180
What did Roger what why did they stop using Roger?

1842
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,860
Was there a vibe?

1843
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,100
It was just a vibe.

1844
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,300
Might be a vibe with Roger.

1845
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,940
I feel like it was once they once they really started going with the Disney

1846
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:54,660
animated features, it was like, that's our the new canon for us.

1847
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:59,660
And Roger was kind of like before that and wasn't as kid.

1848
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,140
I mean, isn't as squeaky clean as the rest of them?

1849
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,340
Well, other people are involved in it.

1850
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,260
Right. We don't only own it.

1851
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,140
We know it was one of the guys, though, back then during this year.

1852
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:13,260
Oh, yeah. Yeah. He was in either the seven considered in like the big ones.

1853
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,220
Yeah. Fisher was Roger Rabbit, Benny the Cab, Greasy and Psycho.

1854
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,260
Not the baby. He was not the baby.

1855
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,820
OK. Baby.

1856
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:26,220
I but so this this sequence is a lot of fun.

1857
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:30,420
And you Lou Hirsch, Lou Hirsch.

1858
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,180
He doesn't have a picture on IMDb.

1859
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,180
So without a picture was this famous character that wow, wow.

1860
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,460
That's a good name for that voice, too.

1861
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,700
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like a Lou Hirsch.

1862
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,260
Yeah. You know him as Fred from Superman three.

1863
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,140
OK. Oh, interesting.

1864
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:51,660
Baby Herman, who almost had his own MGM studios ride and is.

1865
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,180
Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1866
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:55,380
Maybe Lou demanded too much.

1867
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,340
This is where Louis cashes in a billion bucks.

1868
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,300
All right. Do it.

1869
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,900
So this gets I mean, this gets nuts pretty fast.

1870
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,420
People are dropping like flies.

1871
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:08,740
Yeah. Everyone.

1872
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:13,740
It's just that like all of the Jungle Cruise gags happen, but they are more harsh.

1873
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:18,100
Starting with somebody just going into the water and then getting eaten by

1874
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,740
by one of the crocodiles. Sure.

1875
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,660
Yeah. Somebody's eaten right away.

1876
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,380
And then other people just are weirdly getting into the water.

1877
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,580
We don't know what happens to them.

1878
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:29,540
Yeah. That at first is a trick from from Charles Fleischer.

1879
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,900
Because you go, why don't you go pet that crocodile on the schnozola?

1880
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,940
And then then the guy just kind of falls in.

1881
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:41,180
But it escalates to full on murder by the end.

1882
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,340
Yeah. Uh huh.

1883
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,260
He's doing nothing to stop just then.

1884
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,580
Arrows are being thrown every possible way on the Jungle Cruise.

1885
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,380
People could die.

1886
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:53,940
And you guys would say that some of these jokes have to be jokes from the Jungle Cruise, right?

1887
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,580
Some are. There are some classic.

1888
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,540
Yeah. I feel like he throws away the more classic ones.

1889
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,260
OK. And he's you know what I mean?

1890
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,860
Do you feel that at all? That he doesn't do like that?

1891
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,380
Backside of water stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

1892
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,100
Yeah. Like maybe he was more focused on like getting his own shit in there.

1893
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,580
I think he was trying to get his shit in.

1894
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:15,020
This in Hornet Mansion, it's like, OK, we're going to play the reality of the ride

1895
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,260
and really heightened it.

1896
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:22,980
So Jungle Cruise, the kind of flippant danger is going to this segment is going to have a body count.

1897
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:26,220
OK. Yeah. Well, it was Scott was just real quick to go back.

1898
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:31,500
Maybe the Fleischer thing is like, you know, he needs his own generate his own material.

1899
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,340
And that's difficult when you're on a shoot that's only got a limited amount of time.

1900
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:38,340
Yeah. They lose Tony. We lose Tony at five.

1901
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,500
Right. And he wants to do all his jokes.

1902
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,380
And they're like, we got jokes from the ride.

1903
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,980
They've been doing them for decades. Yeah, they work, baby.

1904
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,900
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

1905
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,540
Shoot Tony out, get him in front of Splash Mountain.

1906
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:53,020
He's got to be back at the castle by by nightfall.

1907
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,620
And then we'll run 50 times the boat around so Charles can do all his ad libs.

1908
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,740
Yeah. To get Charles's angle. Yeah.

1909
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,340
Several more days.

1910
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,660
Landis is long gone.

1911
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:07,380
I like that when the there's the hippo

1912
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:13,020
like intimidation part that is it is just him shooting the hippo.

1913
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:14,900
Pulls out a gun. Yeah. Yeah.

1914
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:18,980
Which there's always that I was always I was confused about this for a long time,

1915
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:22,860
but it is supposed to be that you were scaring the hippo with the gun.

1916
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,380
Yeah, you're not supposed to not shooting the hippo in the face. Right.

1917
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,420
So the gun is is a part of the Jungle Cruise. Yes, it is.

1918
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,220
The captain does pull out a gun. Yes.

1919
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:33,740
Just this is different because it's fired.

1920
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,540
Well, back in the day, they used to point it at the end.

1921
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,100
It is always fired. Yeah.

1922
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,820
But I think it's I mean, I did think for a long time,

1923
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,580
it's really weird that they shoot the hippos.

1924
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,340
Yeah, that's not what it's supposed to be. Yeah. Yeah.

1925
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:50,380
But they didn't, you know, again, Charlie went off script in a lot of ways.

1926
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:52,020
Yeah. Script in that way.

1927
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,540
No, I think that was the cannon for a while.

1928
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,180
They would shoot at the animals to like scare them away.

1929
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,380
And then eventually they start shooting in the air.

1930
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,580
Oh, so shooting at it was supposed to be that they're shooting a bullet

1931
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,940
near the hippos.

1932
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:07,540
I don't know near or like, yeah, it's a big hippo.

1933
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,140
A little 38 in the cheek isn't going to kill it.

1934
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:13,780
Like, I don't know the justification or like knock a tooth out.

1935
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:15,500
Like it's a carnival game.

1936
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,060
There would be no reason to shoot at it if you're not going to hit it.

1937
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,740
Yeah. Right.

1938
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,980
It's just shooting in the air.

1939
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,460
If it's just the sound that's supposed to scare them. Right.

1940
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:23,820
Wow. I'm curious.

1941
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,300
I would like to, you know, one of the things we've never covered

1942
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:28,780
on this show is the Jungle Cruise.

1943
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:33,580
We've never, you know, we've covered Chris Gaines in the late shift.

1944
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,460
We've never done the Jungle Cruise.

1945
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,380
You know, what's funny about it is

1946
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:39,700
this is maybe blasphemous.

1947
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,780
I don't care about the Jungle Cruise that much.

1948
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:42,900
I don't really either.

1949
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,340
I like the other one.

1950
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,500
I got to get to the other one.

1951
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,500
The other one is we don't like the crying.

1952
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,820
Joe is sobbing at that statement.

1953
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,980
Well, the thing is, the classic Jungle Cruise, as we know, it is gone, right?

1954
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,540
No, no.

1955
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:01,420
Oh, I thought they updated it for the movie, but I know.

1956
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,420
No, no, no, that never came to pass.

1957
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,460
So yeah, there were possibilities.

1958
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,220
Well, that's good.

1959
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:10,660
There were various updates, like some of the more culturally sensitive things

1960
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,900
that I don't. Yeah, I don't think I've been since.

1961
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,660
I don't think I've seen how they changed it.

1962
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:17,660
But no, the rock is not the Emily.

1963
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,300
There is no Emily Blunt animatronic.

1964
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:22,220
All that to say is that the ones we haven't done, I think we're like, oh, yeah, man,

1965
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,700
we're going to really psych ourselves up for this.

1966
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,580
I think Jungle Cruise hasn't come up because we're not that interested in it.

1967
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,580
I like it. OK.

1968
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:32,420
Well, that's what that what an endorsement for one of the classic Disney rides.

1969
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,180
It's a ringing. It's like the bell.

1970
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,580
It's a ringing. I'll go on.

1971
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,260
We'll go down there tonight. I'll go on.

1972
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,740
And I'm not saying I hate it or anything.

1973
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:42,100
I just think it's funny because that's the big class when we haven't done in six years

1974
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:46,740
that I think has really just been not done because we're like, I always like.

1975
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,620
I admit you're I'm impressed that you're willing to vocalize.

1976
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,780
People are going to be mad at me.

1977
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:52,620
Exactly. What's been silently in my head?

1978
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:56,660
I always like when I get a really like good like really into it.

1979
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:01,020
I was like I had a host in Florida a couple of years ago who talked so fast.

1980
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,460
I was like great Jungle Cruise skippers.

1981
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,900
I really like the Jungle Cruise with the really forced Christmas.

1982
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,660
I like it, too. Yeah.

1983
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:12,300
But ultimately, overall, I don't spend much time thinking about it.

1984
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,580
Wow. Hot take. Maybe that changes today.

1985
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,700
Hmm. Hmm.

1986
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,940
Charlie Fleischer will reinvigorate your love.

1987
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,220
I sure the Jungle Cruise.

1988
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,820
I don't know. Well, I mean, it sets the bar so high because usually

1989
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:28,580
there's not a part where a snake strangles strangles one of the guests.

1990
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:30,420
Yeah. It's maybe the speaks to you.

1991
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,420
You know, Landis is like, we're going to jazz this up.

1992
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:35,300
We got to do something.

1993
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,860
I cut that out. I'll cut that out.

1994
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,500
OK, OK.

1995
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,540
I so big jump pulled for it.

1996
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:46,860
And then I will say that then the solution to the snake

1997
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:50,740
problem is also just shooting at the snake, the snake,

1998
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:54,420
which is wrapped around America's sweetheart, Tony Danza.

1999
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:58,980
I mean, I you must have been confident in his aim or,

2000
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,300
you know, collateral damage.

2001
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,580
Sure. Yeah.

2002
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,060
If I hit Tony Danza, I do.

2003
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,420
Tony's gone. Who's stepping in as host?

2004
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,860
It's probably Charles Fleischer. Yeah.

2005
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:10,460
Oh, that's true. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

2006
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:12,500
I don't want to be crude.

2007
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,060
He loaded it. He brought real bullets for this.

2008
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,900
He was hoping it happened.

2009
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,260
So that's all fun.

2010
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,220
On then we get another great throat of commercial.

2011
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:25,220
Oh, yeah. He gets the list. He lists the name.

2012
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:27,620
I just love Tony Danza be like, come on up next.

2013
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:31,180
Miss Piggy, DJ Jazzy Jevon, the Fresh Bridge, the three little pigs.

2014
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:35,220
Ernest C3PO and R2D2, the great gonzo Cinderella and much more.

2015
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,100
We grew up in such a fun time.

2016
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,620
What a time. There was so much for us.

2017
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:43,220
And yet there was a lot of like adult stuff because they forgot.

2018
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,620
They still forgot to make enough kids stuff.

2019
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,060
So adult stuff mixed up with kids stuff.

2020
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,700
It's all so confusing and funny and silly.

2021
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,900
Here's my commercial rundown.

2022
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,900
Oh, yes. Continuation of the Indiana Jones diet coke commercial.

2023
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,180
This time you learn that you can save up to five dollars on the VHS of Last Crusade.

2024
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,980
So that's why they were doing nice.

2025
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,900
Also, the woman's kitchen splits in half.

2026
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,860
Like, yeah, this is the one of the most high production value commercials

2027
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,900
I've ever seen. It's it's yeah.

2028
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,620
Indy saves her and then tosses her entire body.

2029
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:16,980
He throws a woman and you're like, Jesus, until you realize it was to save her

2030
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:20,740
because her own kitchen door is lowering into the temple doors.

2031
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,140
Yeah.

2032
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:25,540
There's a static cling commercial for a snuggle dryer sheets

2033
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,220
with the classic snuggle bear.

2034
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,100
Oh, yeah.

2035
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,140
The technology is not great at this stage of snuggle bear.

2036
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:35,620
Sometimes it really just feels like they're shaking a stuffed toy in the camera.

2037
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:40,460
Dogs marching army style, singing kibbles in bits and bits and bits.

2038
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:45,860
There's a McDonald's coffee commercial about how it always tastes fresh.

2039
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,940
This would be two years before a woman would be hospitalized for McDonald's

2040
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:52,540
coffee being scalding hot and setting your taste fresh

2041
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:55,340
because the freshest temperature is one thousand degrees.

2042
01:34:56,180 --> 01:35:00,340
Introducing new coffee mate liquid, non dairy creamer in your grocers

2043
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,620
dairy case, which is an interesting phrase that could not have lasted longer

2044
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,900
after 1990.

2045
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,300
It's a sea monster mystery, exclusive pictures on unsolved mystery,

2046
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,860
creature found in near Loch Ness.

2047
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,740
Yeah. As you get the little unsolved mysteries,

2048
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,940
a new Loch Ness monster, scary stuff.

2049
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,940
Then it's a special wedding night court.

2050
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,500
One of the characters gets married at a bar.

2051
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:30,180
A felon threatens the club at the show Dear John,

2052
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,860
which was a Judd Hersch sitcom in the 90s.

2053
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,580
And a special quantum leap mystery

2054
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,460
that's happening.

2055
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,620
And I loved after all of that, they cut to like kind of

2056
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,900
the background splash of NBC.

2057
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:52,260
And it's just the video of Scott Bakula going Wednesday.

2058
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:56,500
Which they used to do that.

2059
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,420
And it was like a ring of bell.

2060
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,460
But it was like, oh, yeah, that's so weird.

2061
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,740
Like after a commercial, you go to a completely different shot

2062
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:06,540
with like graphics behind one of the actors just going

2063
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:11,140
Thursday. You needed that personal touch.

2064
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:11,860
Like, I don't know.

2065
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,700
I can't tell if the actors really want us to watch it or not.

2066
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,180
Prove it. Yeah.

2067
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,300
Well, they were friends you would invite into your home.

2068
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,260
You know, almost like family.

2069
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:28,220
When you come back, some beautiful, pristine, new star tours,

2070
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:30,100
it's still only a few years old.

2071
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:34,620
And you end up with like, what's better than Michael Eisner

2072
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:37,020
saying a bunch of pop culture figures names?

2073
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,660
What's better than Tony Danza saying a bunch of names?

2074
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,700
Why, see 3PO.

2075
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,940
Brett, can we see a clip of the best voice that could ever say

2076
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:49,420
character names that don't exist in the Star Wars universe?

2077
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:56,180
Establish high frequency bias connection with satellite five in sector Q368.

2078
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,980
Excellent.

2079
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,860
I can't wait to see Miss Piggy.

2080
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:03,300
She is on location in Europe shooting her new film.

2081
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,460
Now, don't blow a circuit out to Gonzo should be on screen any moment now.

2082
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,060
But look at the time.

2083
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,620
I'm most concerned about the absence of our host, Tony Danza.

2084
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:23,420
Oh, and he's delivering it with not no wink at all.

2085
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:27,620
He's just Anthony Daniels is doing it as it's perfect.

2086
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,220
He never did it in some muggy way.

2087
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,140
No, he always committed no matter what it was.

2088
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,340
One thing I looked up, because I was like, had people not seen

2089
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:40,660
C3PO and R2D2 on a screen in like since Return of the Jedi?

2090
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,220
And I because I was because now it's like you can.

2091
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,860
Yeah, they're in every trot these guys out all the time.

2092
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,780
It's not like special.

2093
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,580
But I was like, I don't know.

2094
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,020
And I looked it up.

2095
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:55,780
And I guess there was like a one off Sesame Street episode that C3PO

2096
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,220
and maybe R2D2 are in.

2097
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:00,340
I just looked up Anthony Daniels is IMDb to see like what's going on

2098
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,180
in between Return of the Jedi.

2099
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,620
Well, surely he did a lot of non C3PO stuff.

2100
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,580
He did some.

2101
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,580
There is some really.

2102
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,260
Some. Wow.

2103
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,980
I mean, like after the trilogy, it's like he probably that's probably

2104
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,100
the best shot for him to try and do other.

2105
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:12,860
Sure. Yeah.

2106
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:15,060
Do other things, you know. Yeah.

2107
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,020
Time to play Lear.

2108
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:22,980
But but like he has it in no real major way.

2109
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,740
This is like the first time those characters are seen again.

2110
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:29,540
And there was like it was like a cartoon called Droids that I don't think

2111
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,020
was very popular.

2112
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,700
And also it's cartoons.

2113
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,220
You're not actually seeing them because we were it was like a bit of a Star Wars

2114
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,460
desert there. Yeah, there was a time.

2115
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,860
It's hard to imagine.

2116
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:40,660
Yeah, there was a time.

2117
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:44,660
Well, there was also another Disney special, which was the opening

2118
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:47,580
of Star Tours in which C3PO wraps.

2119
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:48,340
Oh, my God.

2120
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:50,140
That is the other one that possibly.

2121
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:53,980
So this is the first time he was on television in a while, not rapping.

2122
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,140
Yeah.

2123
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:02,340
Droids and the two Endor movies were kind of repeated a lot on TV

2124
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:05,820
and they all made me feel uncomfortable.

2125
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,260
Right. Strange, strange films.

2126
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:11,180
We were watching the Ewok movies on TV.

2127
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:15,460
Why aren't Luke and Leia and Han here helping these people?

2128
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:19,740
And the answer is, however, before it was making the Patriot games.

2129
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:23,020
I was busy with the witness.

2130
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:26,660
Yeah, he forgot what his Star Wars character's name was.

2131
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,980
That's how past it he was.

2132
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,180
Indiana.

2133
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,980
So he brings out Tony Danza.

2134
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,420
Tony Danza.

2135
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,940
And he calls him Sir Tony.

2136
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:39,220
Sir Tony.

2137
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,220
He's just brought it.

2138
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:44,260
He's dispatched just because they have a big TV in there

2139
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:46,420
so they can watch the the Muppets.

2140
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,980
And he brings the three little pigs because they want to meet Miss Piggy.

2141
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:55,460
That they also several times reference the three little pigs as special guests

2142
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,060
in this special.

2143
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:57,900
Yes, they don't.

2144
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,860
They don't say anything.

2145
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,820
And they're here at this point and never do anything again.

2146
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:06,020
I don't like a Greek chorus who shows up.

2147
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:09,980
And you see the judgment on their faces, but they never utter any lines.

2148
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:10,940
Not a word. Yeah.

2149
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:13,420
I like that they're presented as equals to Reagan, though.

2150
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,540
That's pretty good.

2151
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,020
That's worth the trip. Ronald Reagan.

2152
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,620
The three little pigs.

2153
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,540
Ernest.

2154
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:24,260
And then I mean, I just love seeing the Muppets on the Star Trek screen.

2155
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,020
That's great. Room looks beautiful.

2156
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,940
And then it's a look.

2157
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:32,060
It's I think it's a great Muppet piece of material.

2158
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,340
I think it was right.

2159
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:36,860
I think Landis brought it.

2160
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:40,420
I think Bill Prady brought it.

2161
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:46,740
It's a good little sequence where it's kind of a flashback piece.

2162
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:53,340
Again, we see young Woody, young Ernest and somewhat younger Miss Piggy.

2163
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,380
I don't know if it's 70s or 80s.

2164
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,740
I can't really tell when they're setting her, but I like her hair.

2165
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,660
Her hair is cool.

2166
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:02,980
And she sees Cinderella in a parade and is jealous.

2167
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:06,220
And wants to be Cinderella, but instead is

2168
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,300
and consults who does he consult?

2169
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,820
The nearest employee, the nearest mean employee doing

2170
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:16,020
what I would call a what's a matter you accent.

2171
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,180
Which every boomer thinks is like the funniest thing in the world.

2172
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:22,660
I don't know. That's a Cinderella. OK.

2173
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:25,540
It's a good word for it. Good word for the egg.

2174
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,060
Yeah. You can't have a bit of Cinderella.

2175
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,700
You want a bad balloon? I got to rate a balloon.

2176
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,260
Hello, mother. Hello, father.

2177
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,300
Do you want a balloon?

2178
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:33,300
You want a balloon?

2179
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,940
Balloony.

2180
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:38,820
Charlie Flesher doing voices no one else can do.

2181
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:43,140
And he gets her a job as a as a maid.

2182
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,540
A scullery maid. Yeah.

2183
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,900
She hits the beats of Cinderella, basically.

2184
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,540
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2185
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:53,580
I guess also just about Charles Flesher, like we've seen him

2186
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:56,500
once in the present day, but twice in flashbacks.

2187
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,940
And so he could be playing the same character who's just

2188
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,500
bopping around to different positions, getting fired

2189
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,620
because they got a vibe and then getting rehired

2190
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:10,100
by confusing them with a new accent. Yes.

2191
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,540
No, I'm not in the same guy.

2192
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,860
I'm not. I'm Italian.

2193
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:17,300
I kind of thought of him as like the I'm going to make a reference.

2194
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,620
We're all thinking about the Johnny Depp, Willy Wonka.

2195
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,980
I think of like the Oompa Loompas in that are all played by Deep Roy.

2196
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:27,660
Oh, yeah. And he's sort of every different version.

2197
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,900
And that's kind of how I think of Charles Flesher is that they're

2198
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,180
just like an army of Flesher's working in Disneyland.

2199
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,540
That's good. I thought you were going to say he's Richard Alpert from The Show Lost.

2200
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,340
It's a deep, Roy thing.

2201
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:44,180
They're doing a deep Roy. That's a deep Roy.

2202
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:48,860
But yeah, we go through some steps of Cinderella in Miss Piggy's quest

2203
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,940
to become Cinderella.

2204
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:54,980
They they give her an insulting job and make her wear

2205
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,620
tattered clothes and scrub a floor.

2206
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,740
Cinderella still in that interaction is perfectly nice to her.

2207
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,820
But Miss Piggy despises her.

2208
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,180
It's good piggy business.

2209
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:09,740
And then it's good gonzo business because he shows up as a fairy god thing.

2210
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,540
And there's this little moment.

2211
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:15,260
Can we pull up a clip Muppets?

2212
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,340
This really made this joke really made me laugh.

2213
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:20,740
Is it a top tier Muppet joke?

2214
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,300
She's making wishes, I should say.

2215
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,180
And then we're at the third.

2216
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:28,940
Oh, I wish it be more serious.

2217
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,460
That was your third wish.

2218
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,820
Here is your receipt. Goodbye.

2219
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:38,620
That's a very good joke.

2220
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:43,380
Yeah. For the listener, he transformed from fairy godmother kind of clothes

2221
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,620
to just looking like an accountant.

2222
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:46,780
And I really like, you know what?

2223
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,100
I like the joke, but it's not even a punchline.

2224
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,500
I just really like the way he says goodbye.

2225
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,700
Yeah, no, it's very serious.

2226
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,820
Gonzo is very serious.

2227
01:43:53,820 --> 01:44:02,820
Gonzo. After that, Gonzo is trying to hook up with a woman of age in the theme.

2228
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:04,180
Is that canon?

2229
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:05,980
Because I thought Gonzo was into chickens.

2230
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:08,700
But like, was he a flirty kind of a horny character?

2231
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,940
Yeah, he's kind of horny.

2232
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:13,780
In the lack of chickens, he'll demean himself for humans.

2233
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:16,580
Yeah, but he's when he's flirting with those two girls.

2234
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:21,340
What I thought was funny was clearly their background and they can't have lines.

2235
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:26,940
So you cut to Gonzo and he'll go, Detroit, you say, huh?

2236
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,780
Well, like, they can't.

2237
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:30,020
He's like, where are you from?

2238
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,980
Detroit, you say.

2239
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:33,820
Like they just stand there smiling and they can't say any words.

2240
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,580
If he has to say all their lines for him.

2241
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:36,620
Yeah. Wow.

2242
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,300
He's trying to hook up with like college juniors.

2243
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:42,420
I always saw chickens too.

2244
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,940
I thought it was like a Troy McLaurin fish kind of thing.

2245
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:49,420
You know, but in this one, he's just like, whoever's around.

2246
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:51,940
Anything with a pulse.

2247
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:52,940
Basically.

2248
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:58,380
I you know, it's this is one of these like land.

2249
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:02,460
You can tell Landis is a park sky because he's like just for a background shot.

2250
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:04,340
Let's get some climbers on the Matterhorn.

2251
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,900
Yeah, I felt like a detail like he knows they do it.

2252
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,740
He knows he has power over Disneyland for these couple days.

2253
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,740
Let's get a couple climbers back there.

2254
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,380
He also cast some characters as background.

2255
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,380
Like you see the the Queen of Hearts just kind of like, right.

2256
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,740
Pretending to talk to somebody.

2257
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,300
All right.

2258
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,300
Mm hmm.

2259
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:26,100
And I also like that the plan is to hang Cinderella by her leg.

2260
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,020
They're going to snatch her.

2261
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,740
And then it ends up happening to Piggy.

2262
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,060
Very good gag.

2263
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,700
I'm going to try it.

2264
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,580
I'm going to I'm going to be really curious if that tree is still there outgrown.

2265
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:38,620
Next time I'm there, just going to think about is that tree there where they

2266
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,060
just yanked physical Miss Piggy.

2267
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:45,860
The wonder like I mean, we all pine for like practical effects in many, many ways.

2268
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,420
The Muppets and they've the Muppets obviously have kept it up,

2269
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:52,420
but it's so satisfying that they can just take a puppet, pull it, yank it.

2270
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,620
Yeah, yeah.

2271
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:57,340
Yeah. I think that would have been funny either way.

2272
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:01,060
Like I was like, oh, it's probably going to be one of them.

2273
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,780
Get their comeuppance.

2274
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:09,180
But also if they like get Cinderella in that snare, that's going to be really funny.

2275
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:11,180
You think that'd be funny?

2276
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:15,700
I think that would be funny to get see Cinderella get in a bear trap.

2277
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,900
Like not a bear trap, like a lose a foot in a bear trap.

2278
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,380
You sick monster.

2279
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,900
Jason's sick sense of humor.

2280
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,460
Oh, God. Clean off.

2281
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:26,820
Can't put that foot in a glass slipper anywhere.

2282
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:32,060
What if they put Cinderella on a jagged stage and made her walk around and she fell?

2283
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,780
Well, she should know.

2284
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:35,340
It would be her fault.

2285
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,380
She does like a pratfall kind of thing.

2286
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,380
And the orchestra pit was like that pit in Mortal Kombat.

2287
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:44,020
Yeah, you're the one who went to Violet.

2288
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,140
I went to the rope gang like the rope on a foot.

2289
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,100
Well, you said bear trap.

2290
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,300
You did say bear trap.

2291
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,060
Well, what do you call that thing?

2292
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:55,500
A rope. Just a snare, I guess.

2293
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,380
OK, the last trap, I think.

2294
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:59,980
Yeah, the claws and it really digs into your flesh.

2295
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:01,220
Yeah, absolutely.

2296
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,540
No, that was violent.

2297
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,620
You sent me into Mortal Kombat land.

2298
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:06,260
I guess so. Yeah.

2299
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,260
That's your subconscious.

2300
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:11,940
Do we think they cast Cinderella or they got an actor from the park?

2301
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:12,980
Oh, I don't know.

2302
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:15,220
I think that's the A team Cinderella.

2303
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,020
I think that's the one they would do.

2304
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:18,020
That's the best.

2305
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:18,620
The favorite.

2306
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:20,180
That's Friday, Saturday, Sunday Cinderella.

2307
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:20,700
Yeah.

2308
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,660
During the peak season.

2309
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:24,900
I looked her up on IMDb to be like, I wonder if this was an actor.

2310
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,780
It's the only credit, which makes me think it's a character actor.

2311
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:33,340
Oh, there's also is this like a famous Muppet fact, weirdly?

2312
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:35,420
And I didn't I'd never heard this before.

2313
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:40,700
In terms of the Landis Muppets connection, that that may be that goes back to

2314
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:45,020
I mean, I'm not aware it goes back to, but that one part of that is that Landis

2315
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:48,700
is puppeteering in the last shot of the Muppet movie.

2316
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,020
Oh, I don't know.

2317
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,620
I don't know. It was expanded out.

2318
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,740
It's like 200 Muppets.

2319
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:58,300
So they just they got anybody they could for that big group shot,

2320
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,140
which is so wonderful.

2321
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,980
And also in there, not famous yet,

2322
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:05,580
but they just needed people who could pseudo puppeteer.

2323
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:09,660
And I got a young fresh out of CalArts Tim Burton.

2324
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,500
Tim Burton, that makes sense.

2325
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,660
Yeah. Yeah.

2326
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,220
And they met years later and they land is thought they had never met.

2327
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:20,300
And he said, I was at the final shot of the Muppet movie.

2328
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:23,820
And he's shooting Beetlejuice Junior overseas right now.

2329
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,500
Is oh, really? Is that happening?

2330
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,580
It's Beetlejuice 2.

2331
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,100
OK, they are. It's not.

2332
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,100
It's not Beetlejuice Junior.

2333
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,580
I don't know. Yeah, not yet.

2334
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,940
Yeah, they got Jamie Kennedy.

2335
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,860
They got the different baby.

2336
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,140
Feel just wrapped now.

2337
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,060
It's good.

2338
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,100
Good Lord.

2339
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,100
Fun Muppets thing.

2340
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:41,300
Oh, yeah.

2341
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,540
You mentioned Bill Prady, like props to Bill Prady.

2342
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:45,180
Did a good job writing the segment.

2343
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:48,580
Also, if I assume your listeners would know, creator of the Big Bang Theory,

2344
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:52,620
Bill Prady, OK, co-creator and also the ABC Muppets.

2345
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:54,140
Yes, yes. Right.

2346
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,060
And he has continued to I don't know if he still does, I think.

2347
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,460
But he he did create the ABC Muppets.

2348
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,940
Yeah. From like 2015.

2349
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:02,340
Oh, yeah.

2350
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,780
And Muppet Vision 3D, am I making that up?

2351
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:07,220
No, I think you're right. Yeah.

2352
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,700
So Muppets stuff good. Commercials.

2353
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,300
Commercial break. OK.

2354
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:13,660
Quaint back in the day commercial about seeing the Oscar Meyer Wiener

2355
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:15,740
mobile in the 60s.

2356
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:18,580
Then we get a very 90s commercial for Permasoft Conditioner.

2357
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,980
How Scotty Henry's brother eats a Reese's.

2358
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:23,580
And if you remember that one, I don't know.

2359
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:25,420
They say Scotty Henry's. I looked him up.

2360
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:26,620
He wasn't like a celebrity at the time.

2361
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,540
He's just a kid and he has a younger brother.

2362
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,660
And do you remember how he ate a Reese's?

2363
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:33,780
One clean hole in the middle of the cup.

2364
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,780
Yeah, I remember that.

2365
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,180
I feel like I might have tried that.

2366
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:37,980
Yeah, I think we all did.

2367
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,340
Yeah. Eating out a fucking Reese's.

2368
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:42,900
Trying to get a perfect circle.

2369
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,900
You're supposed to make the alphabet, I think.

2370
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,900
So.

2371
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:53,820
It's Sunday Fun Night, the greatest practical jokes of all time,

2372
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:56,620
which I believe was airing right after this special.

2373
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:59,500
Wow. Oh, Johnny Carson and Stevie.

2374
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,140
They say Stevie Wonder. Yeah.

2375
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:05,820
With friends like Johnny Carson and Stevie were friends of mine, I guess.

2376
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,740
Friends you invite into your home.

2377
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,180
We get a quick update.

2378
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:13,460
It's 29 degrees in Pittsburgh and it's 738 p.m.

2379
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:16,220
They just come in for two seconds to say that.

2380
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,900
Do you remember that? That night?

2381
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,700
It was 738.

2382
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:23,180
Cold, cold that early in the evening.

2383
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:25,860
Yeah, you know, but it was February.

2384
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:28,580
And then this is when we get the liquid plumber commercial with the mustache.

2385
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,140
You guys. You're a local.

2386
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,300
Now we know that was a slide out.

2387
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:32,700
If you're watching on YouTube, that is the St.

2388
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,900
Louis version. Right.

2389
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,060
Don't freak out.

2390
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,580
And then we finally get Tony.

2391
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,300
We come back. He's doing hosting.

2392
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,620
Yeah. Yes. It's been a long time.

2393
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:44,220
I think. Yeah.

2394
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,620
He's in front of Splash Mountain.

2395
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:49,620
They're pushing Splash Mountain all the time at this, but then new and now closed.

2396
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,660
And ring, ring, ring.

2397
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:55,820
And then the best person who could be calling who's calling Disney.

2398
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,780
Is this Disneyland, he says, which I like.

2399
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:03,980
And it's Ernest in crossing over with Splash Mountain.

2400
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:07,140
We did a whole another thing we've done an episode about and not the Jungle Cruise.

2401
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:11,460
The another special from around this time, Ernest goes to Splash Mountain.

2402
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,340
Ernest, a big part of the Disney family around this time.

2403
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:21,140
Given the green light by Eisner himself, we really he was like a discovery of Eisner's.

2404
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:22,420
He got a race track.

2405
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,740
And it was yeah, it was at the Indy 500 or something.

2406
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:28,140
And like everybody, there was a little parade and there was Mickey Mouse in it.

2407
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:30,620
And then some guy Eisner had never seen.

2408
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:32,660
And everybody liked him a lot more than Mickey Mouse.

2409
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:35,180
And he's like, whoever it is, give him a four movie deal.

2410
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,860
That's crazy. That happens.

2411
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,460
And I've been there.

2412
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,220
Tony Tony Danza can't go.

2413
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:44,660
Ernest, who after he just said he teased Ernest's appearance?

2414
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:50,300
Yeah, I guess he forgot a lot on his mind.

2415
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,700
Only our shoot. Yeah.

2416
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:54,540
Losing light, lunch panel, they's racking up.

2417
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:58,180
Yeah, I got to say I loved Ernest as a kid.

2418
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:00,020
I love Ernest now.

2419
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,220
This segment goes on a while.

2420
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,420
Good God. Sure.

2421
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,300
Yes. Yeah.

2422
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,300
This segment comes on really long.

2423
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:12,580
You you could fairly classify it as not an Ernest segment

2424
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:17,140
because it's not about for most of it, Jim Varney is not playing.

2425
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,420
Yeah, yeah. He's Ernest's grandpa.

2426
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:20,460
Yeah. Yeah.

2427
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,180
And a kid is young Ernest.

2428
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:23,900
That's the theme of all of these.

2429
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,500
But I like him as the grandpa.

2430
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:30,180
I like when he gets mixed up in the cute like the turnstile.

2431
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:34,380
You were out by then. You know, I guess this was just like interminable

2432
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,940
for me when I was watching this and I was just like,

2433
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:40,620
I don't like this new character Jim Varney's doing.

2434
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,340
It's boring.

2435
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,300
I guess it's a generic old man.

2436
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,980
Should have let Charlie Fleischer do it.

2437
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,100
He would have brought a whole other.

2438
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:50,740
No Fleischer at all to kind of ramp up the energy in here.

2439
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,100
It's toward the end of the show.

2440
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,300
Like, yeah, it should have been earlier and shorter.

2441
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,060
Yes. Yeah, they should have given him some notes.

2442
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:59,260
It's a pretty brisk special.

2443
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:04,060
Like when I looked at the time I was watching, I was like, oh, this is almost over.

2444
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,780
But then, yeah, this Ernest thing, no Danza, no Fleischer.

2445
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,540
Like there is just an Ernest short film.

2446
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:15,420
No, Ernest proper Ernest Ernest Ernest puts on like a film canister

2447
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:19,020
to watch an old home movie of his, which again is within Cheers.

2448
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,860
Well, like, let's track where we are.

2449
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,860
The Cheers gang is watching a special.

2450
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:27,300
And on the special, there's a phone call from Ernest who puts on a movie for

2451
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,380
who at this point?

2452
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:31,940
Yeah. Cheers.

2453
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:34,540
This is for Norman Cliff to watch.

2454
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:37,100
But how are we seeing it?

2455
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:41,380
I don't know. This is a lot of that with Ernest, like with a POV.

2456
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,620
I don't understand in the universe what's happening.

2457
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:47,220
You know, they got a tainted keg of Narek Ansett logger,

2458
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:51,460
and it's just they're all freaking out and hallucinating these Disneyland memories.

2459
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:55,700
I like that the highway patrol, this was maybe I only liked this as a kid,

2460
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:59,180
but this really this had a big grip on me when I was five.

2461
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,380
That does this this is one of those things.

2462
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,420
Does this happen, Mom and Dad?

2463
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,860
I've been on the Autopia.

2464
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:08,300
I don't remember a police officer stopping me.

2465
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:10,140
Does that happen sometimes?

2466
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:13,820
And I was like really like scarred by it.

2467
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:17,780
So I think every Autopia trip from then on, I assumed this will be my day.

2468
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,700
Well, I was also like, is this era appropriate?

2469
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,660
Because like, when is this supposed to be?

2470
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:26,100
This is an old film from when Ernest was a boy.

2471
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:26,700
Yeah.

2472
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:32,140
And then like, the cop looked modern to me, the highway patrolman.

2473
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:33,900
Yeah, as do the Mickey and Minnie.

2474
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,940
They don't get it all right.

2475
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:39,420
So this has to be 35 years ago.

2476
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,620
So how old is Ernest?

2477
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:44,420
Yeah, how old is Ernest supposed to be at this point?

2478
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,820
Ernest is at least 35, right?

2479
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:50,340
And he's also at this point has been doing Ernest for 10 years.

2480
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:51,100
Yeah.

2481
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:55,140
So would have to see what the kid is like eight years on this footage.

2482
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:57,740
That says about maybe as old as 10.

2483
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:02,540
Let's say Ernest is 35, then it would have to be 20ish.

2484
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:05,740
Goodbye that Ernest doesn't look young to me.

2485
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:11,380
No, he did all those soda commercials, drinking all that free soda probably.

2486
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:13,060
Oh, you think that damages the skin?

2487
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,100
Yeah, that hurts.

2488
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,140
Too much free soda.

2489
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:19,620
Glug, glug.

2490
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,540
So it's fine.

2491
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:24,180
I guess we have mixed notes about the Ernest part.

2492
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:26,900
I missed Charles Fleischer, and I didn't know that I would be thinking that.

2493
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,660
Wow.

2494
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,500
Maybe Ernest said not on my watch.

2495
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,580
Maybe he considered himself a competitor.

2496
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:33,260
And this was written by Ernest's people.

2497
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,740
This is all, yes, John Cherry, the Ernest team.

2498
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:38,500
John Cherry directed, and then some guys who I was like,

2499
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:39,700
had they written an Ernest movie?

2500
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:43,100
But no, they wrote on the Ernest sketch show, which I didn't know existed.

2501
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,580
Was it a kid show?

2502
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:47,500
Hey, Vernon, it's Ernest, I think was the idea.

2503
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:51,340
And then they wrote additional material for other Ernest stuff.

2504
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:52,900
Everybody brought in their people.

2505
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,300
All the brands are well represented.

2506
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:55,820
What's that?

2507
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:56,900
Except Cheers?

2508
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,540
Except maybe Cheers, not written by Cheers, but directed by Cheers.

2509
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:02,500
But I'm wondering if they did write it or ghost write it and couldn't.

2510
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:03,140
Right.

2511
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:05,700
There's some WGA thing maybe.

2512
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:07,620
There's a special thanks to Glenn and Les Charles,

2513
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:10,540
but I assume that was just for using the characters.

2514
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:11,060
Yeah.

2515
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:12,540
The Cheers section is funny.

2516
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,300
Everybody feels like silent.

2517
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,860
Yeah, yeah, no, it's good.

2518
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:18,700
Commercials, pre-the closing.

2519
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:22,580
Yeah, a wholesome ad with a State Farm life insurance

2520
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:25,940
talking about a young family, like they have a new baby.

2521
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:30,700
And it seems like it's a real insurance agent, because he says his name

2522
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:33,540
and he's like, hi, I'm Gaylord Moose Man.

2523
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,700
What?

2524
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,140
It's like, I'm Gaylord Moose Man.

2525
01:56:38,140 --> 01:56:41,220
And it was like, oh, what?

2526
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:42,500
It was just so distracting.

2527
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,700
It's so strange.

2528
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:46,820
And that one's definitely on the YouTube upload.

2529
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:50,860
His parents, Mrs. Moose Man in the delivery room.

2530
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:52,540
And it's like, we know.

2531
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:53,860
It's like, Saint's Moose Man.

2532
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:55,300
We know what we're calling him.

2533
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:57,140
That feels like a character in The Love Guru.

2534
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:00,540
Yeah.

2535
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:05,060
Yeah, Gaylord Moose Man has not aged well in the 10 plus years.

2536
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:08,300
Yeah, that one really knocked me out.

2537
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:09,540
Oh, my God.

2538
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:13,060
Then there's a guy talking to his dog and it turns out to be an equal

2539
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,100
sweetener commercial for some reason.

2540
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,060
And then this was interesting.

2541
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:20,100
There's a very 90s backdrop with like this young guy and the

2542
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:23,700
narration is like my son, Jim, skateboard fanatic, music lover,

2543
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:26,780
guitarist, computer whiz, avid cyclist, football, basketball,

2544
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:28,460
hockey player and all star catcher.

2545
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,420
But there's one thing he'll drop everything for.

2546
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,180
Campbell's junkie suit.

2547
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,700
And at the time, like all these things are being like thrown at him

2548
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:37,180
like the skateboard and like a football helmet and whatever.

2549
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:39,820
But then, you know, he loves that he loves that Campbell's junkie suit.

2550
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:44,060
But what I really loved about it was that the young actor

2551
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:47,700
is Academy Award winning writer and director, Tom McCarthy.

2552
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,580
Whoa. Oh, yeah.

2553
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:51,540
Wait from what? Who's Tom McCarthy?

2554
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,420
He directed Spotlights.

2555
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,940
He and like the station agent.

2556
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:56,900
And he was an actor.

2557
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:59,500
He's in the fifth season of The Wire. Oh.

2558
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:02,940
And he yeah, it was it was him.

2559
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:07,900
Very funny because he's not the most recognizable actor, but I was

2560
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:09,660
I had to like go back. Yeah.

2561
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,340
Yeah. That's that's him.

2562
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,220
That's a catch.

2563
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:15,660
He's like Todd Field, where it's like if you look at the whole career,

2564
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,500
it is like a Forrest Gump.

2565
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:21,820
Like you were at every event of the late 20th century.

2566
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:23,020
Yeah. You know, Todd.

2567
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:25,740
Todd Field was in the Oscar Mayer Wiener Mobile commercial.

2568
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,900
He was in the Oscar Mayer Wiener Mobile.

2569
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,580
Coming up with the idea for Big League Choo.

2570
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:30,700
Big League Choo.

2571
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:33,740
Eventually would make tar and little children.

2572
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:36,220
Yeah. And B in Eyes Wide Shut.

2573
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:38,060
Yes. As the keyboard.

2574
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:40,060
Right. Yeah. It's a jazz guy.

2575
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:43,500
And then we get a commercial for Double Mint and Big Red Gum.

2576
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:47,820
And it's one of these like quintessentially 90s commercials where it's like

2577
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:50,620
seems like the budget was millions of dollars.

2578
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:57,740
It's like a lot of shots of like people playing like muddy football and then like

2579
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,780
surfing and then like airplanes landing.

2580
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:05,900
And there's a song going like share a little piece of America.

2581
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:06,780
It's about gum.

2582
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:10,060
I miss that era.

2583
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,340
That incredibly earnest.

2584
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,220
I mean, there was one.

2585
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:14,220
It's a little it was kind of a viral thing.

2586
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:18,060
I feel like this this six minute sizzle reel.

2587
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:19,740
That's a long song like that.

2588
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:21,420
And then a children's choir and all that.

2589
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,620
That's all for Sizzler.

2590
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,900
One of the longest songs I've ever heard.

2591
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,180
Advertising budget.

2592
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:27,980
That keeps going.

2593
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,340
The guy has nowhere to go by the end.

2594
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,940
Yeah. I highly recommend Share a Little Piece of America.

2595
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:37,500
Wow.

2596
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,780
The Gums jingle.

2597
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,820
Little piece of America.

2598
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:45,900
And then we get a quick promo for an upcoming Today show.

2599
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:49,340
A radical new way to cut medical bills.

2600
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:50,700
I'm very curious what that was.

2601
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:52,400
Death.

2602
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:53,900
Die angle.

2603
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:55,120
Suicide.

2604
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,520
And an up and coming anchor starts tomorrow named Maddy Lauer.

2605
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,480
We're excited for him.

2606
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,400
He's going to go places.

2607
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,800
He's joined by a little dragon named Scorch.

2608
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,120
Our new weatherman.

2609
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:13,200
And then we cut to Tony Danza eating a burger.

2610
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,800
Squirting ketchup on a burger.

2611
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,840
Squirting ketchup on a burger.

2612
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,600
Like, oh, hey, okay.

2613
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:20,880
So DJ Jazzy jumping a first prince.

2614
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,120
And there you have it.

2615
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:24,640
Mr. Slap himself.

2616
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,560
We get a good performance, I'd say.

2617
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,800
I liked this a lot.

2618
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:35,120
And I was kind of like, I feel like the special maybe should have been a little bit more of this

2619
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,040
peppered throughout.

2620
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:41,520
Taking something very current, feels new, fun.

2621
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,920
A very young kid would enjoy this because it's colorful.

2622
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:46,960
There's a lot of movement.

2623
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,880
But it's also taking a classic Disney thing and giving it a twist.

2624
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,840
Doing something new that doesn't feel out of the realm of...

2625
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:54,640
It's not...

2626
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,600
It's like there's other things like this that are embarrassing.

2627
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,920
I would say 90% of things where Disney meets rap are embarrassing.

2628
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:10,000
There is a very awful tag team Mickey Mouse Womp remake that starts with Mickey saying like,

2629
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,640
Yo, yo, Mouse Pussy.

2630
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,600
That's a whole album.

2631
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,120
Yeah, we did.

2632
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,880
Again, an episode we've done and not the Jungle Cruise.

2633
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:19,760
Just keeping track.

2634
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:25,520
A couple moments and I mean that they do a good job of inserting some cartoon footage from Mary

2635
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,000
Poppins.

2636
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,400
Yes.

2637
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,280
There's also some very funny cutaway gags to like...

2638
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,240
To chimney sweeps.

2639
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:34,480
Yeah, there's one or two certainly chimney sweeps in the crowd.

2640
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,520
Just pumping.

2641
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:41,040
If your hip hop doesn't have a video with chimney sweeps dancing, what are you doing?

2642
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:41,760
Yeah.

2643
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,520
It is funny to think about that.

2644
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:48,000
If you could travel back in time and go to this filming, you could pull Will Smith aside

2645
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,280
and go like, hey man, in 32 years, you're going to win a best acting Oscar and it's

2646
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,880
going to be the worst night of your life.

2647
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,120
The Fresh Prince pilot would shoot in three months from when it's coming out.

2648
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:04,400
It would be an NBC pilot.

2649
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,720
I think the idea was probably already percolating.

2650
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:13,280
Well, here's what's weird and this is the most fascinating thing about the Landis interview

2651
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,640
that there was a musical segment.

2652
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:20,880
Again, he's coming in so last minute and they did have a musical segment planned,

2653
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,720
but the musical segment was supposed to be with Donnie and Marie.

2654
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:25,920
Wow.

2655
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,240
Something else we've talked about recently.

2656
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:36,080
We covered this awful Star Wars routine that they did, which itself was cruddy and out of date

2657
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,600
in the late 70s.

2658
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,480
And yet in 1990, the plan is Donnie and Marie.

2659
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:45,680
But so claims Landis, I'd seen the world premiere of the...

2660
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:46,800
He watched the world.

2661
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:47,200
Hang on.

2662
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:51,680
I'd seen the world premiere of the DJ Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince video for parents

2663
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,880
just don't understand on MTV and I thought those guys are great.

2664
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,240
Let's put them in the show.

2665
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,160
He saw the first time they ever show.

2666
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:00,080
He like, did he make a point of it?

2667
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:00,960
Max, get in here.

2668
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:02,720
Big new video.

2669
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:07,920
So anyway, he claims that he brought this to Disney.

2670
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,720
Why don't we do something newer and fresher?

2671
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,600
If you can imagine something newer and fresher than Donnie and Marie.

2672
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:16,720
He claims first time Will Smith was ever on national television.

2673
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,880
He gave them a list of eight Disney songs and said, choose one and write it as hip hop.

2674
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,160
And they chose supercalifragilisticexpial...

2675
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:27,040
I'm not gonna say the old word.

2676
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,120
It's too late in the episode.

2677
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:36,240
And they wrote it on the plane, landed at LAX, were taken to a recording studio,

2678
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,680
they recorded the song, went straight to Disneyland from there,

2679
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,920
where it was just put onto the PA system.

2680
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:42,800
They recorded it.

2681
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,120
They did a couple of takes.

2682
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,960
Then I put them on the Star Wars ride and then they flew home.

2683
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,800
From Philadelphia and back, the entire thing was 48 hours.

2684
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,360
My God.

2685
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,800
Congrats, Landis.

2686
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,640
I was curious if they wrote this.

2687
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,080
Yeah, I guess so.

2688
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,960
And I guess they did.

2689
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:04,000
Yeah, which maybe it showed that it wasn't some like, let's get Disney's hacks on it.

2690
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,400
Let's get someone over 60 to write a hip hop song.

2691
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,760
The Sherman Brothers themselves.

2692
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,080
You ain't making this rap without us.

2693
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:15,520
We understand how to rap to rhyme.

2694
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:17,920
You don't think we've been rhyming for 40 years?

2695
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:19,600
Original rapsters, we were.

2696
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,160
So fascinating.

2697
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:24,800
Gotta credit Landis for that.

2698
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:25,120
Sure.

2699
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:26,080
And yeah, it really worked.

2700
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,440
And I thought, yeah, it's cool.

2701
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:31,520
And that's pretty much the special.

2702
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,000
The group is thanked, again, the entire list.

2703
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,720
Most of the special is saying the list of celebrities.

2704
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,080
Including the three little pigs.

2705
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:41,680
Thank you, three little pigs, for making time for us.

2706
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:43,200
We say thank you, especially.

2707
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:47,680
Look, a lot of big stars, Reagan and everybody, but three little pigs, we see you.

2708
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,200
There's also a list of special thanks at the very end,

2709
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,080
and the very last name of the list is George Lucas.

2710
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,120
Yeah.

2711
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:56,800
Sure.

2712
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:01,520
Yeah, without him, we couldn't have had this robot want to find Tony Danza.

2713
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,560
Yeah, that's the Tony.

2714
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:04,960
But we do cut back to Cheers.

2715
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:07,680
We get like our final wrap-around of Cheers.

2716
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:08,480
Still within Cheers.

2717
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,600
Lilith does say, oh, watching Mickey and his gang cavorting across the screen.

2718
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,200
It's like Mickey's not in this.

2719
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,840
You see a tuned version of him dancing with the Fresh Prince,

2720
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,840
but not saying anything very briefly.

2721
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,040
But they must have shot this and not have known what the special.

2722
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,480
I mean, they must have known the Woody thing.

2723
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:28,960
But yeah.

2724
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,400
It was the old version, probably.

2725
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,600
The non-Landis version.

2726
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,480
Probably pre-Landis.

2727
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,240
Oh yeah, they might not have known what was.

2728
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:36,720
That's why the Muppets didn't like their segment.

2729
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:38,400
It was mostly Mickey cavorting.

2730
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:38,800
Yeah.

2731
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,160
Woody's joke about the animatronic Regan.

2732
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:42,880
Very funny.

2733
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,560
Oh yeah, a little risky for something that Regan is in himself.

2734
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,120
Right, yeah.

2735
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:49,360
And then they're like, we gotta watch Mud Wrestling.

2736
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,040
Very, very weird.

2737
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:51,760
Very weird runner.

2738
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:53,040
And to end it.

2739
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,880
It doesn't feel like what they do, does it?

2740
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,320
Yeah, did they ever watch like Mud?

2741
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:58,160
First of all, was Mud Wrestling on television?

2742
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,360
Maybe pay-per-view.

2743
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,320
Yeah, that's what I would guess.

2744
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,760
So the bar paid for it.

2745
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:04,080
The bar paid $40 to watch women Mud Wrestle?

2746
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:10,640
They use their diners club card to order women's Mud Wrestling into a venue.

2747
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:12,560
The final line of the special.

2748
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,320
Can we please go back to Mud Wrestling?

2749
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:18,080
And then Lilith stands up at a protest in the special.

2750
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,400
And it says, directed by John Landis.

2751
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:22,640
Wow, wow.

2752
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:24,640
And then you're, so for everybody who didn't know,

2753
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:27,600
you really didn't know, then that must have like, yikes.

2754
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,880
Yeah, it was crazy.

2755
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,240
Also, Deborah Hill was an executive producer.

2756
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,120
And she's like John Carpenter's producer.

2757
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:35,600
Oh, wow.

2758
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:36,880
She's very, very strange.

2759
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,040
And then, yeah, we get the credits we've already talked about.

2760
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:46,320
Well, the end summation from John Landis is,

2761
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:49,840
so I went out there and shot this thing, which you ever see it, is insane.

2762
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:50,960
Some of it's very funny.

2763
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:51,760
I enjoyed doing it.

2764
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:54,080
Miss Piggy's funny in it, but it's awfully odd.

2765
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,560
That's about right.

2766
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:57,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2767
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:00,960
Must be especially, I really thought that it was a premeditated thing

2768
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,720
to get Landis in late, well, for the 35th, let's make it very cinematic.

2769
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,520
Go for it.

2770
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,560
Discovering that it was just a happenstance.

2771
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:09,040
Henson was mad.

2772
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,320
Henson mad.

2773
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,720
One of his final decisions in the year of his demise.

2774
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:15,280
Another thing that would happen in three months is that he would be dead.

2775
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,200
Three months, my god.

2776
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:20,400
And people close to him say that all the Disney stuff,

2777
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,440
like Disney trying to acquire the Muppets, really took a toll on his health.

2778
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:24,400
Yeah, yeah.

2779
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:27,200
So any of these fun specials that the Muppets are in,

2780
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,840
when you're watching it, think about at what cost.

2781
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,640
Kill Jemisin.

2782
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,720
I did get a brief commercial break.

2783
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,880
Mid credits, they then go back to it.

2784
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:37,840
Oh, so I'll cut in?

2785
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,680
But we get a commercial for something called a Micro Cup,

2786
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:46,400
which is just a Hormel dinty more stew that you can put in the microwave.

2787
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:47,920
Oh my god, Jason, do you have Micro Cups?

2788
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:48,800
That's what I'm talking about.

2789
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,240
You have Micro Cups at home right now?

2790
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:50,880
What did you say, brother?

2791
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,920
You have them at home right now?

2792
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,480
Do I have them in my pocket right now?

2793
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,680
Do I have them in my purse?

2794
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,800
Very 90s commercial, though.

2795
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:03,280
Very like, and like very fast zooms in on the Micro Cup.

2796
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,280
It's funny you say that.

2797
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,200
My mom does have stories of like,

2798
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,200
when you were little and starting to eat solid food, you loved beef stew.

2799
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,720
That story is multiple.

2800
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,240
We get a companion commercial to McDonald's.

2801
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:20,400
Coffee is fresh, McDonald's eggs are fresh.

2802
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:24,080
That's because our chickens lay two and a half million eggs every day.

2803
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:27,360
And then that makes a cartoon chicken that was dancing die.

2804
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,560
It like passes out because it's really distraught.

2805
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,600
Then we get a classic, you just won the Super Bowl.

2806
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,680
Joe Montana.

2807
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,880
You won it for the second time in a row.

2808
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,200
You and the 49ers have won back to back Super Bowls.

2809
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:42,800
What are you going to do?

2810
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,120
And he says, I'm going back to Disney World.

2811
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:45,520
Wow.

2812
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,080
Nice.

2813
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,640
Amended.

2814
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,600
It's a back to.

2815
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:47,760
Wow.

2816
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,880
And I haven't thought of those commercials in a very long time.

2817
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,520
Oh yeah.

2818
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,920
And I looked it up and like, I guess I was naive at the time,

2819
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:57,920
but like obviously they, these were paid sponsorships.

2820
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:58,480
Yeah.

2821
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,240
They felt like casual or something.

2822
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:00,560
Right.

2823
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:00,640
Yeah.

2824
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,360
When you're, because I only experienced it a kid, I never really thought about it.

2825
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:07,600
And also like they paid the losing quarterback to also do this.

2826
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:08,480
Oh.

2827
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,720
Cause they would air it right after the Super Bowl.

2828
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,280
Right after.

2829
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:11,600
Yeah.

2830
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:12,320
So they'd have to get.

2831
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,480
So they would, they would pay, you know,

2832
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,520
John Elway or whoever was the losing quarterback.

2833
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,080
The same amount of money.

2834
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,520
And then it just would never air.

2835
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,800
And still going.

2836
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,920
I think I do it live on the field.

2837
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,240
Now.

2838
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:27,840
I, I don't know.

2839
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:31,600
Peyton Manning said it once and was not paid just because it's part of like the.

2840
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:32,560
Oh yeah.

2841
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,840
It's a lexicon.

2842
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:37,280
But sometimes I think it depends on where the Super Bowls help.

2843
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,960
Sometimes they say Disneyland.

2844
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,320
It's sometimes they say Disney World.

2845
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:41,120
Look this up.

2846
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,240
I record both.

2847
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:45,840
And regionally they, they are a different one.

2848
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,720
Oh, I wonder what the mini episode about this is all fascinating.

2849
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:51,680
So mine was Disney World because Pittsburgh is closer to Florida.

2850
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:54,960
Oh, it's not based on which one the guy's going to.

2851
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,480
It's based on where you're watching it.

2852
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,920
The market that's airing the commercial.

2853
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,320
Yeah.

2854
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,040
Wow.

2855
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,360
Wow.

2856
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:02,800
And so that was like an unexpected like Disney commercial.

2857
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:04,640
Yeah.

2858
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:07,680
Now they would do it with for certain regions.

2859
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,640
They would do.

2860
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:11,680
I'm not going to Disney World because of their woke agenda.

2861
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:21,120
And then it got a promo for a special DuckTales Valentine episode coming up with Afro Ducky.

2862
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:22,800
What?

2863
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,840
Who?

2864
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,200
The Aphrodite.

2865
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:25,600
Yeah.

2866
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,160
Oh, okay.

2867
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,440
Oh, wow.

2868
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:28,640
I don't remember her.

2869
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:28,880
Yeah.

2870
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,520
It was a very is a DuckTales Valentine.

2871
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:32,640
And then of course, stay tuned.

2872
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,520
They do the classic.

2873
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,360
The credits are scrolling back to the credits on the special and they do the classic.

2874
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:41,200
Someone speaks over it like stay tuned for the greatest practical jokes of all time.

2875
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,680
And a cop meets.

2876
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:45,520
They describe lethal weapon because lethal weapons.

2877
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,200
Okay.

2878
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,080
And then I got a very before the video cut out.

2879
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:53,280
I got a very, very, very quick second of a Cosby promo.

2880
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:54,400
Oh, great.

2881
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:57,200
Last thing is not like a jump scare.

2882
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:57,520
Yeah.

2883
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:03,840
I truly think and maybe if your listeners want it, I can upload it because it's digitized.

2884
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:07,280
It's truly Bill Cosby popping out from behind the wall.

2885
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,040
He's scary.

2886
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:09,200
Oh, no.

2887
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,080
Felicia Rashad.

2888
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:11,680
Oh, no.

2889
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:12,080
Going like that.

2890
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:13,680
It isn't saying boo or something.

2891
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:14,880
Wow.

2892
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:15,360
Wow.

2893
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,000
Perfect.

2894
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,800
Well, I mean, this is everything you want from an old special.

2895
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:25,440
You know, weirdos who've done odd things since, but then, you know, some of the greats that you

2896
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:33,360
miss like Tony Danza, Charles Eisner, Michael Schwartner, the three little pigs, you get them

2897
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:37,120
all fun to rewatch fun to revisit for these purposes.

2898
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,320
Yeah.

2899
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:43,600
And I appreciate the opportunity to watch it again because it's like,

2900
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:48,400
I will say when I was digitizing this tape not long ago, it does it in real time.

2901
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:57,360
So I put it on to get like the however long this tape was and like left the room to go do other

2902
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:01,680
stuff. And then I did come back during the earnest part and I was like, what on earth is this?

2903
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,080
Yes.

2904
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,360
How did we get here?

2905
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,760
And so I'm glad I got to watch it and get the full context.

2906
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:11,920
To know how cruddy the earn-out-cuddle-able the earnest segment was.

2907
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,040
Well, thank you for revisiting this with us. This is a blast.

2908
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,200
Joke was all you survived podcast, The Ride.

2909
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:17,680
Oh, my God.

2910
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,320
So happy to have you. Long overdue.

2911
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,200
Thank you, guys. This is a blast.

2912
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:23,600
Great to have you to do with. Let's exit through the gift shop.

2913
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:24,800
Anything you would like to plug?

2914
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:29,600
Of course, my special is on YouTube at Helium Comedy Studios page, but you can just search

2915
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:34,240
Oolala and Joe and Helium and you'll probably get it if that's what you do on YouTube. But yeah,

2916
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:38,000
that's the special. It's called Oolala. And also if you want to just click on a link for it,

2917
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:45,040
you can go on my Instagram and TikTok is joecwaw, Twitter is joecajokey. I have all the links

2918
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:50,560
up in there. And soon, keep your eyes and ears open, I have a sketch album coming out.

2919
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:54,880
Cool. Funny songs and sketches. And that'll probably be out in August.

2920
02:12:54,880 --> 02:13:01,680
Oh, I'm excited for this. I really like that idea. Hey, lots down your rabbit hole. I would say

2921
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:06,960
great videos all over the place from you. Your podcast, Who Cares About the Rock Hall,

2922
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:14,480
which I love doing and happy to go the other way podcast. It'll be on this side of the desk.

2923
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:20,480
Or the table where you do it. It'll be a table in that case, but pretty much the same thing.

2924
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:26,560
And Joe, I was so glad we finally had you back on. But you and I had talked about another-

2925
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,200
We'll tease-

2926
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,400
Thing. We'll tease this.

2927
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:33,520
Something, which is that my girlfriend has an exceptional cranium command story,

2928
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:39,600
which maybe I think this is the best place to do it. To reveal that story. Someday,

2929
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:44,960
hopefully we can figure that out. I really love this story and that's all we'll say about it.

2930
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:48,720
And you told Scott there is a story. I know what the story is.

2931
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:51,280
Yeah, Jason does know it because I pitched it to Jason.

2932
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:58,160
When you met my girlfriend, we were talking about it, but it's all under wraps what the

2933
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:04,640
content of the story is. Yeah, yeah. No spoilers for me. This is like Dial of Destiny. I don't

2934
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:09,280
want to know what- If it covered my ears, I don't want to hear any more about the dial.

2935
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:13,200
Well, sorry, I don't mean to spoil anything for you, but that dial could change the course

2936
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,480
of world events. Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me if it does.

2937
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:21,200
Now I know there's a lot of repercussions to this dial.

2938
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,800
Well, yeah, thanks so much. That's a good tease. We'll figure out how to unveil that tale.

2939
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:32,080
And for us, you can find us on all the socials at Podcast The Ride. Thanks to Brett Bomet,

2940
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:36,320
Forever Dog for producing this episode. And there's a video version of this. It's a good one to

2941
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:42,400
do it for. We should make a playlist of this and your special and this special and maybe just that

2942
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:46,880
Bill Cosby clip right at the end. Right after your special. So it's the face people remember.

2943
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:52,000
Curious about any- Yeah, absolutely. We should see if we can actually retrofit it into the special.

2944
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:56,640
Honestly, if there's any clips that I described from the commercials that anyone wants to see,

2945
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:01,840
I can cut that and put it out. Wow, what an offer. Oh, geez. That's very personal.
