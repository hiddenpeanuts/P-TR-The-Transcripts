1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, let's just start.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We gotta start.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We gotta use this.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm recording now.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You know what I mean, I was just checking in.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, thank you.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're just checking in on Jason.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're checking in on the second gate, Celebruary.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, that's it?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All right.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, we're checking in on Jason.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Honest, hi.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hi.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, Celebruary.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, it's the Celebrity Restaurant Month.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And we made it here now to, well, I previously called Planet Hollywood the big dog, but that

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
was a lie.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You were lying to the listeners again.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, this is in my mind the big dog, I think.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,640
I think so, well, and if you haven't already seen the arch and the postcard and what it,

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,000
that's what makes it the, I think the simplicity and the bareness of how they advertise the

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
restaurant.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The silhouette.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Our guests specifically honed in on the silhouette when weighing her pros and cons.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You want to say, you want to introduce our guest?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, it's Marissa Strickland back on the show.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hi, Marissa.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Woo, woo, woo, hi.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Woo, woo, woo.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Al Lewis's famous catchphrase, woo, woo, woo.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, he energized the set.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hi.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Welcome, hi.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hi, I'm excited to be here.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That reminds me of the phrase I say all the time that Marissa coined years ago when like

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
something impressive has happened, you go, ooh, aloo.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's good.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Which I still say once in a while.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's the rationale of that?

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You got to ask her.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It sounds good on the tongue.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not ooh, aloo.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's an unexpected turn.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, yeah.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's going to kick people off.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, and then people are like, woo, ooh, aloo.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Their eyes get big and they're interested.

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Have you said ooh, aloo lately?

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Not lately, but it does happen in my mind often.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you remember the last time your mind said ooh, aloo?

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, I don't remember.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sorry.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, hopefully today.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It just happened.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
These sparkling facts about grandpas, which is Grandpa Al Lewis's restaurant.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He, of course, from the Munsters.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We don't necessarily need to explain him from the ground up because there's been so much

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Munsters talk.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel like from Halloween on, there's been a, as if Grandpa Munster himself has been in

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the corner of the, he might be, his ghostly presence might be in this garage.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Maybe that's why.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's come up, correct me if I'm wrong, it's mostly my fault because I am very intrigued

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
by him and I like watching old Munsters.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is a kid.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's one of those guys that I, we've talked about this a little bit before, I think.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
When you watch, especially the old sitcoms, he's one of those as a kid.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think most kids go, he's funny, I like him.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You don't know, you can't articulate what about the performance is good or what you

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
like about this weirdo, but you know as a kid, oh, that guy's funny.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I like that guy.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I think that's where some of my fascination with these older character actors like you're

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ed Wins and you're Al Lewis, like as a kid, those are always the ones you look at first,

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think, because they pop more than a lot of the other characters.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're like living cartoon characters.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Exactly.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And they often did some of these, like in Ed Wins also did the Mad Hatter, some of them

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
did like Disney cartoon characters, but then they all like, a lot of them just in real

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
life.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it seems like they even, as we learned about Alan Hale, he was just a little buddy

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
out in the world.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And Grandpa, it sure seemed like he was Grandpa a lot of the time.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He wasn't specifically Grandpa and he was, you know, being a funny weirdo.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, he was Grandpa, but he was also, I think the difference from reading is that Grandpa

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
was not as happy to be at Grandpa's as Alan Hale was to be at his lobster barrel.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think that's in general, but he was still, he was a very odd cartoon character of a man.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, he's sort of like a walk around theme park character, escaped the theme park.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You could see him in real life, but he would also maybe complain and run for some state

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and national offices.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Like if Gaston suddenly showed up and was like, I'm running for the Senate seat in New

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
York.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sure.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Gaston.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
As Gaston.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But just like Gaston and then Gaston's real name right afterward.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because I feel like that's what Al Lewis tried to do.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He tried to get Grandpa Al Lewis on the ballot.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They would not refer to him.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They refused to put him on the ballot as Grandpa Al Lewis.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are we holding?

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What norms are we holding up that we can't put the word Grandpa in a ballot?

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Of a guy we know isn't going to win.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Give everybody a little smile when they go to do their due diligence of voting.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, it should be, yeah, you should be allowed to do that.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean, we talked a little bit on the Alan Hale because it was Skipper Alan Hale where

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
they have to add their character because they're worried people won't know, which I think is

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
something that should come back.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think like whatever character Jesse Tyler Ferguson played, it should be that character

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
name should be planted in the middle of his three names.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just so you remember.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like I like it on Andy Griffith.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There was George Goober Lindsay.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He played Goober.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But when he was on a hee haw, they still threw the Goober in just in case you forgot that

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
he played Goober on a sitcom.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you have a preference for it being thrown in the middle with quotes or do you want it

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
upfront and then the real name afterward?

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, I think it depends.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think an official title like Skipper or Grandpa.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Grandpa Lewis, I guess would work.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But I don't know.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think if it's a title, I don't want to answer for you.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I think if it's a title, you put at the top and if it's a weird name, you put in the middle.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Like Richard Karn.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It would be Richard Al Karn.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In quotes, Al in quotes.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And it's Tim, it's Tim, Tim, Tim, the tool man, Taylor Allen.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Exactly.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You need like the single quotes and the double.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you pick your favorite sitcom actor just now and try it and see like which way

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you would feel comfortable.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, what popped in my head was just John Jack Ritter.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, cool. Yeah.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I don't know if that reads, you know.

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, I think what's the last name was Tripper.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tripper.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK, so it would have to be John Jack Tripper Ritter.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's too much.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Tripper? Not Tripper wouldn't work either.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like Charlie Anger Management Sheen, everyone's favorite sitcom.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The one he's known for.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The one he's known for.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Wait, that's his name of the show, though.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He doesn't play a character named Anger Management.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Unclear, unclear.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Has anyone ever seen an episode?

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Jason Stiffens.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It could be.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
One of us in this room would have had to have watched it.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I mean, like late, like they will.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They have put Vermin Supreme, the performance artist who sometimes run for office, I believe

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is listed on ballots as Vermin Supreme, but they wouldn't put Grandpa Al Lewis as Vermin

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Supreme. He's the guy who wears a boot on his head.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's what it looks like from here.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
All I could see was a boot and a beard.

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Where is he? Where's Vermin Supreme doing his running?

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think he's been involved in like the Libertarian Party and like I think he'll just show I think

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
he's always at the New England primaries, presidential primaries.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is it one single person or is it an identity that can be passed?

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't think it's like a James Bond style character.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think it's this guy specifically.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OK, is he a bad guy?

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Do we know?

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Specifically on the member of the Libertarian Party Judicial Committee.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So that could really go either way.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's not the best sounding thing in the world.

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But OK, Vermin Supreme.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can we use that as a catchphrase or a name for someone here?

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Vermin Supreme.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, I guess Jason Vermin Supreme.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't think he's won a lot of elected offices.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I don't know.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's never been officially a Supreme.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Unlike you.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, you think I could take some of his shine?

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I could take some of his energy?

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think that's true.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So yeah, so we've talked so much already about old sitcom actors.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, I have a question here.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, first, just basics before we get into it.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is in this restaurant was in Greenwich Village in the 80s and 90s,

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
like late 80s, I think it opened.

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It is now a mac and cheese restaurant.

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you're around, if you're on Bleecker Street,

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
there's a mac and cheese restaurant called Murray's.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's what it is today.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I've eaten at a mac and cheese restaurant.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Did we eat one when we were in New York?

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I think we did.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Could it have been grandpa's?

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was very small.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I bet it's not.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It was very small.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They could have divided it up, though.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, it might not be the full space.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because the picture, there's a video of Al Lewis during this time,

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and they show a picture of grandpa's, and it's on a corner of something,

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and I think the place we ate was in the middle.

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't think it was.

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, yeah, maybe only some of the space.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But anyway, that's the basics.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He was, and this is a restaurant, he was around a lot,

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
like six days out of the week, and you might go into the restaurant

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and he would be the host.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And we'll get into all this, but I just wanted to say the basic stuff about it

216
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
before I ask you, Marissa.

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We sent you, like, here's what we're noodling around with on the second gate,

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and there was Allen Hales lobster barrel, and there was grandpa's,

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and you said it was a tough decision.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh my God, it was.

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry to put you through this.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What ultimately tipped it in the favor of grandpa?

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, grandpa was my heart.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was like the first choice was like, oh, grandpa's.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And then I was like, oh, like, Allen Hales,

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
like I wanted to talk about Los Angeles in the 70s,

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
so that was like hard to like say we're not going there, you know?

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, sure.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But then when I did see the menu, I was like, the menu is his profile,

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and it was made by Fred Gwynn, too.

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Like Fred Gwynn drew the profile, which I thought, you know, is like extra special.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's pretty neat.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
His monster buddy was an illustrator,

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and I love the fact that he was the president of the Harvard Lampoon.

235
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, yeah.

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
50s.

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That a weird thing?

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, yeah, multi-talented guy.

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I also you know what?

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was kind of laughing at the profile.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There's a version I saw of it where it's really tiny and it looks a little like photocopy and chintzy.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But then I saw a big version of it that might have been like on the front of the menu.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was, yeah, on the front of the menu.

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's pretty great with like thick line weights and that's pretty iconic.

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it's beautiful.

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, yeah, I do.

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I respect the art, seeing it in full and with color.

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, got me a shirt that someone drew that logo on the front of it.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's sweet.

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wow.

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Really?

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So that means you have two Al Lewis shirts, counting the one you're currently wearing.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I own two shirts that have Al Lewis on them, and I hope that's not the end of it.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I hope there's a chance like a Car 54 shirt maybe or a different Munster shirt.

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
An Al Lewis for Governor.

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Can I ask you, Mike, would one day you want to say, Ooh La Lewis?

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I mean, yeah, I would like to say it every day.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ooh La Lewis.

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now that'll replace the other instinct I have.

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Marissa, can I ask, what is your relationship with Al Lewis like?

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, in my mind, we're married.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No, I think I mean, I grew up on the Munsters like everybody because it was just constantly in syndication.

263
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So like, to me, it's just one of those things where I don't remember particular episodes, but just all of it is like such a wash of joy and fun.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I loved watching it.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Same with Gilligan's Island.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Like it felt like both of those were on constantly.

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it just feels like, you know, feels like home.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because you're like us where you're like, there's you like the magic is much more in like late 70s and lower like TV.

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lower.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Lower. That's how you describe the numbers going down in the past.

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Real low. You know, a long time ago, real low.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The numbers of the years get lower.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, yeah. Lower years ago. Lower years ago, I said.

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Our Lord Jesus was born in the lowest year.

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah. So I feel like you're like Marissa, correct me if I'm wrong, your favorite show of all time is Match Game.

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, it is.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay. The original Jean Rayburn, Matthew.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There were earlier versions. It's the Jean Rayburn ones for me.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah.

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah. It's like, it truly like makes me salivate. I've watched way too much of it in Pandemic too because it's like one of the bigger things.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Who were your guys?

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's the way to put it.

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, I mean the classics on the show.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Sure. Charles Nelson Riley and Brett Summers.

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Brett Summers.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean, really them. Like it's, I just want to watch them.

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think Richard is a little too kissy for me.

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's kiss and kissin'.

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, which he took into family. Richard Dawson we're talking about from Hogan's Heroes and Family Feud.

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah. It just is like really uncomfortable.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I know the sexual politics or whatever of the time where like you can just kiss anybody, but I don't like that.

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah. Somehow not the weirdest sexually from Hogan's Heroes though.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't forget Bob Green.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's true. Rayburn a little loose on that show too. I would, my memory is correct.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
A little bit.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, he's a little loose, but like he's such the consummate host. Like he's just keeping it up.

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm currently reading this fan written book on Match Game.

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So I'll send it to you guys.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's Justin Got It For Me For Christmas and it's very like, I would say the spelling's a little weird.

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The syntax is a little weird, but it also is a compilation of a lot of cool stories that you wouldn't get from like PAs and producers on the show.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It looks like a labor of love. So like I just, I'm reading it for the details.

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's nice. You're looking past the poor. You gotta have an unedited, just like on Amazon kind of books.

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's very that.

306
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You ever see one of those like small press or self-published books where when you put it in the bookshelf, you realize like, oh, the spine is the wrong way.

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The letter, like it's, you have to read the spine bottom to top.

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I was like, oh no. Lower years to higher years. Lower. Lower years to higher years.

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mike, did you say lower because that's just where like you, the lower number channels, that's where you'd find MeTV or AntennaTV where you would likely find the monsters nowadays.

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I think you're giving me too much credit. I think my brain just malfunctioned and that's what happened.

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're also kind of repeating something from Alan Hale where you're making this demand, but you would agree that like late 70s and then back and that's the cutoff.

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, we don't talk about anything but that. I kind of bullied Marissa into saying that, but I do know it's true.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're not letting anybody dip into even 80 or 81. That doesn't count.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I mean, when you, okay, the cutoff is elf.

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh sure. That's the end of the silliness you feel like that was the last gasp of. Exactly. Yeah.

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Elf and anything before it. There's a few, you know, you still got your small wonder and. Yeah, that's true.

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh my God. I love small wonder. Yeah. I've rewatched it.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Just as a series. I mean, not as a series, but just I've rewatched episodes and I'm like, I loved this.

319
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's interesting to watch something when you're older, when you have such nostalgia for it.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But then you're like, as a person that has an adult brain, I can see this differently.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're like a more sophisticated viewer in terms of like, I can tell what is a like high production value, well-made show and what is a cheap ass low rent.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah. No one involved in this will be invited to participate in Hollywood in any other way.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, but I love it. Man, I love it. I love it. It's in my heart.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, how did we have to, do we have to say more stuff about Al Lewis to figure out why he got into the restaurant gate?

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Where did this, what happened? I watched some of an A&E biography.

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a little bit like he has a real, like I don't want to say low stakes for his scump.

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like it feels like he has so many things he did, but like I, it's hard to tell exactly how much any of them were.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like he's, oh, he performed everywhere and he was a vaudeville guy or I think he's, he called it like vaudeville.

329
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, like he added the extra syllable in there. He later. Basketball scout? When was that?

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
He was a scout. He played basketball when he was young.

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think he had like a children's program with basketball also. Something like that.

332
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Something like that. He was involved in two different comedy clubs, one in Staten Island, one in Yonkers, comedy Mecca's if you will.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sure. And that was after the restaurant.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, I hate to cut you off, I apologize, but can you imagine, Jason, Marissa and I of course did improvising.

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We were improvising.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
At the improvising club.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I did not sleep a lot last night. I'll say this, but you know, can you imagine if the three of us, instead of coming up at UCB, came up at a grandpa,

338
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Al Lewis owned comedy club.

339
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
At grandpa's Yonkers or whatever.

340
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Or grandpa's Franklin Village. Grandpa's at an LA spot, you know.

341
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I made it onto a GFB schtick team.

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, see I'm on a level three schtick team. My schtick's getting pretty sharp.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Look, yeah, I mean, some people say it's a little corny that we all wear the capes and the big necklace like Dracula, like grandpa, you know, but it's part of the, you know, part of the performance.

344
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We do the same sketch every night where like, Jason, like you like are gambling and you lose your clothes and have to wear a big barrel.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is comedy. This is good. I love this.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Very good. I mean that, yeah.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Where everybody ended up having to work at a 50s diner type restaurant and wear big pink aprons in addition to your ghoul face paint, just as Herman and grandpa had to do in the movie.

348
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think it's called the Munsters Revenge from the early 80s.

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This still is so insane because you don't see the Munsters in color a lot.

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So knowing that their face color is like weird gray green, then they're in bright pink gingham with red hair. This is bizarre.

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, really bizarre. But you know what the best revenge is? Success.

352
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So with grandpa and Herman running a good restaurant, running a successful restaurant, that'll show them.

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That was a little luck. Yeah, I know, because I was like, I don't think that movie did well.

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I mean, within the universe of the movie.

355
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, okay. Yeah.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, I don't know how the scene proceeded, but do you think that these two then were good at waiting tables?

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't. I mean, it was probably a success in terms of, you know, you got to put in your work.

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You got to put in your time behind the counter.

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Was it Tom Sharpling or somebody? I said something similar and then somebody pointed out Tom Sharpling to the same thing.

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The Munsters is basically a show about dressing Fred Gwin up in the silliest outfit possible.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
On top of the silly outfit he's already wearing.

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Right. Like that's most of the episodes.

363
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He does seem to describe the Munsters writer's room as just like bored out of it, angry.

364
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
How quick can we get a sandwich in here to focus on? I don't know.

365
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We'll put him in all this clothes. All right, good. Call out Shirley.

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I have a pit. You know what? I don't usually give away my great Hollywood ideas, but I want to give one away right now.

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, my God. I just had a few weeks ago.

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Southern Munsters. Get like a Reba, Tim Blake Nelson, dress them up as a wolf man, creature from the Black Lagoon, and let's go.

369
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Same gimmick as Adam's family, Munsters. It's a family, but they are from the South. There you go.

370
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's fun. Yeah, I agree.

371
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Can I ask this, just because you're talking about reboots, what are we thinking about this Rob Zombie Munsters?

372
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, we have one thing we're excited about, I would say.

373
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you know who's playing Al Lewis, who's playing Grandpa in it? It's the actor who played Jay Leno in the late shift, the movie about the late night wars.

374
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So we're very endeared to being, well, he was cinema's first narrative Jay Leno. The second has now appeared with Adam Ray, Pam and Tommy.

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So it's exciting now to compare contrast Lenos, but at least at the time he was the only one. So knowing he's going to bring his impressions.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He also played Gary Marshall in a really a couple of crazy bad TV movies. So if he can do Gary Marshall so well, I bet his Al Lewis is going to be pretty spectacular.

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's going to be fun. Yeah, and we're getting closer to the Leno multiverse too.

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yes. All the Lenos pointing at each other. That's right. It's about time.

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, the Adam Ray Leno and Daniel Roebuck Leno and then hopefully Jay Limmo from the car, the carified version of Jay Leno from Cars.

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And when you talk about those universes collide, here's the, these are the two people who Daniel Roebuck has played most prominently in one sketch together.

381
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is a Halloween sketch from 96 on Jay Leno's tonight. I don't know what's happening.

382
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Jay is at a scary desk wearing not his suit, but like an Edgar Allen Poe kind of suit, which is different to see from Jay.

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And Al Lewis is waiting on him to sign something with a feather. So if you have that full sketch, please send it away.

384
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Appreciate that. There's a lot of older like older Al Lewis with the costume or half the costume on.

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Here is a particularly jarring photo of him in the middle of yelling or something.

386
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Look, here's the thing about Al. After 19, probably 75, any photo of him is very jarring.

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
His hair is crazy. I've said this before. I thought he was 70 on the Munsters.

388
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And he was young. And he was like 42. He was like all of our age.

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He was not much older than Fred Gwynn and I bought that he was grandpa. But yeah, the picture of him is a bit unnerving.

390
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So who I forget who asked the question to finish a point about why there might be a restaurant is I'm saying this guy maybe did a lot of stuff.

391
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He, you know, he cast the net wide as far as what he was going to try out and restaurant ended up being there.

392
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, he seems like maybe he as opposed to Alan Hale, who was just like, yep, I'm skipper forever.

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems like he maybe wanted to get away from it for a little bit before like hard re-embracing it seemingly like in this restaurant by just and by the restaurants, grandpas and grandpa on the ballot.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But he like came back to it. You know what? I feel like this is an arc for Adam West.

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe too, that he had a frustrating 70s before in the 80s going like, all right, this is what people want.

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I should just love it and embrace it. Yeah. Now, sorry. No, no, I was just curious.

397
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Like if you guys had like a core character you were known for, would you embrace it or would you try to distance and then maybe embrace it?

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If it was like, like if my character was like something like like toilet boy or something from a sitcom, maybe I would say I don't want to be toilet boy for my whole life.

399
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But it depends. Like I think you I think people have seen the arc of these actors so many times now and maybe hopefully like learned like Leonard Nimoy was upset to play Spock and then he wrote a book about it.

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Like then he wrote a book that he liked being Spock. So I feel like the older I get and maybe the the far the farther I feel from having any tangible success, I start to think, you know what?

401
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Maybe I used to think maybe I used to think, oh, at a comic convention, seeing some old actor sitting at the table, that's kind of sad.

402
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Now I go, what a gift. What a like Butch Patrick. Like, yeah, you were on the fucking monsters, man.

403
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like, that's pretty great. So as I get older, I have a slightly different perspective on that. So maybe toilet boy, I would be happy to be for the rest of my life.

404
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm sorry. Toilet boy has been given to somebody else.

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I was so close.

406
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Rebooting it. It's a new take. What's your feeling on that?

407
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I feel like I would do kind of what grandpa did. You know what I mean? What else?

408
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah, I like doing my best to be like, hey, can I get back to some serious roles?

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Can I be known for something else and then be like, give the people what they want, you know, if those things didn't take off.

410
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, yeah, grandpa seemed like he might have been a little cranky to go back to grandpa as well.

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Well, in some ways, I feel like Adam West, once he was like old, old was like, got it.

412
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm Batman. And whenever you want me to be like, he was fine at a certain point.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Just being like, yeah, thank God I got Batman. At least I can cash in on this thing.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And he didn't seem too unhappy anymore to be Batman. But yeah, it's everyone's different.

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, I get it in the mini bubble of people listening to this show and what it has done to my social media,

416
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
where it is mostly comments reminding me about a clown I don't like and insisting that I am Peter Pan.

417
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I could see in this miniature way, I could see wanting to step away from some of the things that you're known for.

418
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But we'll maybe down the road, things will change.

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you want to trade? Because for the last week, I've just been being sent the picture of the new coach of the Miami Dolphins,

420
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
who I don't think resembles me at all, but has a couple of similar like hair swoops and a similar pair of glasses.

421
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
He's a decent looking guy too. I don't think that would be a bad looking guy.

422
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm just confused at what exactly.

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I got the text too. I got a text from somebody about you, about the coach.

424
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Like, hey, did you see this? And it's a picture and I go, oh, yeah, I've seen people have been saying this looks like Jason.

425
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, he's not a bad looking guy. And I was just like, wait, I don't, I guess I don't see. I kind of see it.

426
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I kind of see it. Yeah. I don't know that I would have thought and thought about it.

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But all right, we'll switch. I'm now. I look like the Miami Dolphins coach and you can do art of Jason.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I can be will love it. Jason will be paying all day.

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He'll go put on a costume. You'll go buy it down the street. Come back.

430
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, just like if I were to I'd be the most annoying toilet boy ever.

431
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll be paying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. One room one room at the Courtyard Marriott Cleveland, please.

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So when you said I lost the role of toilet boy, I lost it to Jason. Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't want to I thought it would be too much.

433
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm going to get snake. It's going to go to a big budget.

434
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Reimagining starring Chris Pratt after me. So you said snake.

435
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I thought you meant snake like a toilet. Like you're like going to have a big tube.

436
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, that's what deadline that's what deadline variety snakes.

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Jason the drain. My girl sends fortunes down the drain.

438
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Baffo box office for toilet.

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Toilet boy snakes, baffo box office.

440
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's a real it's like the back to the future thing where I had the role for two weeks and then I got fired as toilet boy and then Jason stepped in.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah, they wanted a less. Yeah, less weird annoying toilet boy.

442
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm sorry. I'm conflating. I'm conflating.

443
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What's his face?

444
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Eric Stoltz and the guy who's the father who's kind of a lover.

445
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Crispin Glover, who's a weirdo.

446
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think it's just kind of a guy.

447
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Was goofy as he wasn't as much as playing too straight.

448
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He's very straight, like very like just a cool teen, I guess.

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. So well, the point is he he re embases.

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He re embraced grandpa in various ways in various forms of business, including this is what you guys might have stumbled upon.

451
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I have it. I think we go for it.

452
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is this the the hotline?

453
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, I know. No, it's a different thing. OK, but that's good, too.

454
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm going to play as much of this as I don't want to give away what the hotline is.

455
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But here's here's something. Here's a product he was excited about.

456
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Hi, kids, it's me, your friend, Grandpa.

457
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I got to tell you, I am starting a new club and I want you to join it called the Junior Vampires of America.

458
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean, you'll hear scary monster stories.

459
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The call you got to ask your parents permission and call the phone number one nine hundred nine oh nine four three zero zero.

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You'll hear all about my monster friends.

461
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Learn how to get a free vampire patch and a list of special vampire tricks and secrets.

462
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So call one nine hundred nine oh nine four three zero zero.

463
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Learn how to scare your friends, even yourself.

464
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Join Grand.

465
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So, by the way, did he say did he say, hey, it's me, Grandpa?

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Grandpa. Yes, I have a feeling because the D dropped for the restaurant.

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Like, I think he was like skirting some copyright stuff with different grandpas.

468
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It is odd because on the show friend, grandpa, grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.

469
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I wish the restaurant was grandpa's.

470
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Then it's like truly the greatest restaurant and topic ever.

471
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Grandpa. Grandpa's calzone.

472
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He he was doing unlicensed grandpa monster stuff, which is really funny.

473
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Like, I'm trying to think of there's a good example of somebody who played like a very famous character and then just tried to do it without the rights of the original property.

474
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm sure there was a got to be an example.

475
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But like, this is what I was going.

476
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He made a movie where he played a vampire in like 1990.

477
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Do you see this, Scott? No, it's called My Grandpa is a Vampire.

478
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That poster is a big moon and it's him.

479
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah. And he's like not completely made up to look like Grandpa Monster.

480
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But I watched the trailer and it's 1991.

481
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And yeah, he's just a vampire.

482
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The two boys figure out that their grandpa is a vampire and there's hijinks.

483
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I couldn't tell the whole thing, believe it or not, is up for free on YouTube.

484
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's not it's not on HBO Max.

485
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's not being it's not on the Criterion channel.

486
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's not on Criterion.

487
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now, can you just confirm? Is there grandpa vampire or their grandpa?

488
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, the writing says, you know, grandpa, but I didn't I don't think he says his own title here.

489
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I mean, I prefer grandpa in general, but I like that in it that it seems I consider him less grandpa and more grandpa.

490
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Right. The way the restaurant is spelled.

491
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The restaurant is spelled grandpa.

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In the Munsters credits, it says Al Lewis as Grand Pa.

493
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah. So maybe that's a skirting too, that it's grandpa.

494
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But it's a pretty generic word.

495
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hmm. You're saying as the G-R-A-N-D in the Munsters.

496
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's like M, the cuddliness of M.

497
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, wait a minute. There's a different name for this movie.

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Maybe in America. Hold on. Let me find this.

499
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This sounds familiar. I feel like like there. Yeah, I know some bizarre.

500
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
By the way, his character name in it is Vernon Cougar.

501
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah, yeah, right.

502
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And he's the star of that. Was there an Al Lewis starring movie in 1991?

503
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's shocking he hasn't shown up in Disney Channel Original movie, like some of the old actors they got for those to play grandparents and stuff.

504
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh, sure. I didn't realize he was in used cars.

505
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He's a judge and used cars. One of the early Zemeckis movies.

506
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He's not even he's not like making vampire puns and winking.

507
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
He gets to like actually play a character and he does pretty well.

508
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I think Moonrise I'm seeing a poster for. Is that the alternate title?

509
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes, that's well, that's one of them. I think there's a different one as well.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I'm trying to find it. Sorry.

511
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The New Zealand Film Commission. Yeah, that's there's yeah, there's there's a I have a poster for Moonrise as well.

512
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's a lot more like like drawn. Oh, yeah.

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Which is like grandpa flying with the two boys. That feels much like if that's 91 that to me feels like 81 to me.

514
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's possible they completed production in 81 and it didn't come out until then.

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But yeah, I'll keep looking for this. There's a different I think there's yet another title.

516
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So maybe in America they wanted to call it a different thing just so they could escape the rights.

517
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The Universal Studios, right? I assume Universal has the rights. I don't know.

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Look, I haven't vetted this and I don't want to go looking for a clip where I can't find it.

519
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But I'm seeing thumbnails in Google images of it seems like he has taken the two boys to McDonald's.

520
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

521
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was I was shit. I meant to take a screenshot of that and show it to everybody and I completely completely slipped my mind.

522
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, there's a shot that's clearly a promotional shot.

523
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I think of McDonald's in the background always with the boys.

524
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So McDonald's has to have had some sort of like investment or deal.

525
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I know McDonald's. Wait a minute.

526
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
There's a three minute my grandpa is a vampire cut down on YouTube that's from Everything is Terrible from Oh My 80s, which I think is Doug Jones.

527
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, right. Yes, I believe. All right.

528
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, Doug, if you're listening, sorry, we haven't watched your three minute my grandpa is a vampire cut.

529
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm excited to check it out once we're done. Yeah, I mean, we doing it.

530
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I mean, is there a future? My grandpa is a vampire episode.

531
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't know. We'll have to we'll have to judge. I'm not saying there is.

532
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't know. Is our excitement about Al Lewis enough to sustain another episode?

533
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I still think we could do like an Al Lewis month potentially all the different things he's been in or whatever.

534
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But this is about just the food. We want to stick to the food.

535
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well, let's talk about the restaurant a little bit.

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes, please. Well, yeah. What what did we learn? Is there like I mean, it's so it's a pretty like old school.

537
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't think the restaurant is weird or like it's not like, you know, fang burgers or anything.

538
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's just like good Italian. Right. Do we know if it was good or not?

539
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Do we have any idea? Looks like standard.

540
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Grandpa said it was great. I know that he said I don't and I don't have cooks.

541
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I have chefs. So that should tell you the quality is high.

542
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah. The logo usually was accompanied by the phrase Italian food dot dot dot at its best.

543
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OK, then and the full. He's no liar.

544
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Did we say the full name of the restaurant yet? OK, because it's is it Bella Gontay?

545
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think it's gente. Bella gente. Bella gente. I was curious.

546
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I have a Google. I think it might be a hard G. Let me see.

547
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Gente. Gente. Bella gente. Bella gente. Oh, in Spanish it's gente.

548
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Bella gente. Beautiful people or nice people. Yeah, beautiful people.

549
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Rampa's beautiful people is the name.

550
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Wait, yes, that's weird. Possessive. Yes. Grandpa's beautiful people. Yeah, that's great.

551
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That's a delightful name. Yeah, and that's for coming in.

552
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think so. People he employs or. Well, I think they serve the nice people.

553
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They serve nice people. You know what I mean?

554
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's like being like you're part of the mix. That's what it feels like.

555
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah, that's nice. And there's this there's a 20 minutes and I've already forgotten the name of it.

556
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There's like a little mini documentary on Al Lewis that gets into like what he's doing there.

557
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And you can see good quality footage of this place, which looks like I don't.

558
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If he wasn't there, it wouldn't seem like anything special, I don't think.

559
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's like, you know, there's not very New Yorky. Right.

560
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Kind of kind of packed and but but but pretty upscale looking and kind of an old school feeling.

561
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah, but there's no like crypt or anything.

562
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There's no I don't think it was super themed. I think it's an Italian restaurant. Right.

563
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So really, the highlight was just he would greet you and ask how many people in your party.

564
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That's a dream. Smoking or non-smoking.

565
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He seems to every time they show it in that footage, it seems like he's asking it for the first time.

566
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Maybe a little like confused. How many?

567
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He's eating while he's doing it, too. He's eating some pasta off a plate.

568
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
A big bowl. It's holding up real high to his face.

569
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, how many or whatever?

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And then he's like, too. Non-smoking or smoking. Like, what a crazy thing.

571
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This guy was on TV and now he's greeting you and seating you in a restaurant.

572
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There's also great footage of people on the outside all like looking in like he's there.

573
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Grandpa, I see Grandpa. Grandpa's in there right now.

574
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, it is wild. He's visible from the window. He's in a little like cage.

575
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's like he's like he's at the zoo. But you get to go eat at the zoo with him.

576
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I would so I really wish there was footage of Alan Hales because the way Alan Hales was described is that it was a party in there.

577
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Alan was thrilled to be there. He'll be talking to everybody, doing whatever.

578
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
This is the complete opposite. This seems like you're bothering a man on his meal.

579
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He's there and does he really he's a performer. He's an actor.

580
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Does he really want to be sitting and seating people? No, there's no way.

581
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But then so why is he? Because he needs money.

582
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But he gets money for doing that. He can't just put his name on it and then not be there.

583
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Here's what here's where I'm a little confused.

584
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm a little confused. And this is where if you listen, there's a couple episodes of the Gilbert Godfrey podcast with Billy West where they talk a lot about Al Lewis.

585
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They believe this was a mob joint. This was owned. I don't know this.

586
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This is true. So don't sue me. But they believe this was a mob joint slapped with his name on it.

587
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And they were just paying him some money to be the greeter that he did not own this at all.

588
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And to create a big distraction in the front. It's grandpa. Look, Grandpa.

589
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And nobody's thinking about what's happening in the back. Exactly.

590
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Because like why not if he was owning this and putting the money in? Yeah, I don't think he owned it.

591
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Like what I read was that somebody approached him. Some restaurant tour was like, hey, come over here.

592
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then he was like, I guess I'm in the restaurant business. Yeah.

593
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So he was getting a salary to greet people. Essentially, he wasn't like Carol O'Connor with his place or anything like where it was like they were owner and they were it was just probably he was getting what?

594
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And what in 1989 to do this? A grand a week? Five grand? I don't know. I don't know. Who knows?

595
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But that's the I don't know if they were joking as much, but it seemed like Billy and Gilbert were insinuating this was some mob controlled restaurant.

596
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And they were just using him to get the gin up business. Interesting.

597
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Interesting. Which one is still what a terrible plan.

598
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
How about you just the food should just be good and advertise, you know, but obviously the biggest two is the star is going to pack them in and legitimize.

599
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Did they go to other people first? Did they go to I don't know Patrick, which Patrick or like he's not a Fred Gwynn.

600
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They went through the full cast. Yeah.

601
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They started low. They went through the whole Addams Family first.

602
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah. John Astin said no. And then they went to Maury, Amsterdam and Rosemary.

603
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They said no. So but the thing is, I found an article where he's talking about opening up more of these. Yes.

604
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
He wanted to like scale it. Yeah.

605
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Louis predicts the pasta restaurants will be the next gigantic national franchise.

606
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He hopes to open two more grandpas Bella Gante, beautiful people restaurants in Manhattan and by 1991 to expand into Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago and sell a commercial line of pasta products.

607
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I saw a pick up some pasta. Yeah.

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right. So it's unclear exactly what the business dealings here were.

609
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But I get the sense from that video and from some of the anecdotes Billy tells that he wasn't so thrilled to be here all the time.

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I think Billy has a lot of affection for him on that on these episodes.

611
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But he tells a story where he watched his like two ladies who were so excited there and like thought the food was great.

612
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Thank you so much. This is great. We're going to tell everybody about it. He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
He's like real short with him. And then they like left and came back in to like ask for him.

614
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, can we get a menu or whatever? And he's like, yeah, yeah. And he left and he turns to Bill and he goes drop dead.

615
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So which is great. And there's plenty of anecdotes like that in these two, maybe three podcasts of him like hanging out with them.

616
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Who he said was like a good guy, like a good guy, but like was obviously eccentric and cranky in a lot of ways.

617
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, he kept interesting company. Here's a story that I found about him is that when the Ramones were going to produce,

618
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
they were going to maybe seek the production efforts on an album from the great Phil Spector.

619
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And they went to his house and his house had a lot of signage on the way in of like, beware, dog, stay away.

620
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's a scary house. It's falling apart. It's locked in time. And they get into a room that's all red velvet or Phil Spector says, Ramones,

621
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
are you ready to do the best album of your life? And then they look over to the side and there's a huge red love seat and Al Lewis is sitting on the love seat.

622
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:25,000
He's just hanging out in Spector's house. And then he was around a lot. He'd like go to the, it wasn't just there.

623
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
He'd like go to the real recording studio and just be there just because Phil was there. So he's hanging around.

624
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And then he'd go down, the Spector and the Ramones. He was like, Yoko Ono or like hanging around.

625
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What a Yoko to have. Al Lewis. But then he got into, this is indeed Ramones biography or his autobiography where he got into big political fights with Johnny Ramone,

626
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
who was very conservative. And they'd get into huge fights about where Al Lewis is adamantly in support of universal health care.

627
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And this is in 79. He's yelling about health care. And it's Johnny Ramone who's saying, then those lazy immigrants will never get up their asses again.

628
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And Al Lewis is saying, you're an idiot. You don't know what you're talking about. Hey, I'll probably feel Spector fires a gun.

629
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah, that's what I was wondering. Did Al Lewis ever see Phil Spector pull the gun?

630
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That wouldn't shake Al Lewis. He's got the gun again.

631
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Also side note to that, that he was usually, or at least when they met him, he was wearing a big cowboy hat and boots.

632
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Gilbert talks about that all the time. Like why the country western? Like all of a sudden he was wearing like a bolo tie and a big hat.

633
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And he was like, he even like started talking like that a little bit.

634
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Like he affected a southern accent and a southern persona.

635
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
He was always smoking like a gross cigar, like wine flavored cigar or something maybe.

636
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's insane. Is that a thing? Do you think this is a wine flavored cigar?

637
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Do you think this? I also like there's a photo. There's like a headshot, a signed headshot of him in a taupe in a chef's hat with a big plate of pasta.

638
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:28,000
A lot of this month has been relying on stuff that is only preserved on the website worthpoint.com.

639
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know if it's true, all the menus.

640
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
All the menus and autographed paraphernalia. So I don't know who all these people are. If this is like the celebrity autograph spot nowadays.

641
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like you got to register for worthpoint.com to get a quote.

642
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's an unfriendly website. They don't want outsiders. They want people who are serious about bids on photos of Al Lewis with wet pasta.

643
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Wet pasta. Not cooked pasta.

644
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There's no sauce on it is what I recall. That's what's funny about that pasta to me.

645
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's a very butter pasta situation.

646
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It could be clams. It could be linguine with clams kind of like tossed in.

647
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's so much better than the celebrity alcohol craze of these days. It's all boring. It all looks like the same bottle.

648
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The stories are boring. You've told them so many times. The motorcycle stories.

649
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Most of the stories are boring. Some of them are riveting. Some of them are some of the most exciting stories. Origin stories.

650
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But like yeah. Is anyone other than Paul Newman still selling pasta? Is there a celebrity pasta happening?

651
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh well one of the Ramones has a pasta sauce.

652
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
What?

653
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
One of the Ramones has a pasta sauce. This has also come out. Tom Charbling has brought up before.

654
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh I didn't know that.

655
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Is it Dee Dee?

656
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't know.

657
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Well I know Aerosmith's drummer Joey Kramer has a coffee. Which is at least different.

658
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Coffee is different yeah.

659
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah. Marky Ramones.

660
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Marky has Marky. Steve Sharippa from the Sopranos I believe also has a pasta sauce.

661
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Alright that's good.

662
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Celebrity pasta sauce.

663
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh celebrity pasta sauce.

664
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Once you take locations out of it. Now we're so far from the themed experience.

665
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know. We're drifting. This is a whole month this has been a big experience.

666
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
How far can we drift?

667
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That could be one episode though where we taste a few celebrity pasta sauces.

668
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That'd be very fun. Wine taste them too.

669
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Sure. Marissa is there any celebrity you know living or deceased that you'd like to taste their pasta sauce?

670
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I mean.

671
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That sounded like an I apologize for that.

672
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I would taste any celebrities pasta sauce.

673
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Okay but there's not a specific like if somebody is on.

674
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Like there's obviously people we all like that if they were on a sauce bottle we'd go we have to try it.

675
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh yeah.

676
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We get fooled into buying it.

677
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm looking if I'm not seeing it. There's a lot of recipes but you don't see a lot.

678
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The official because that's what's so fun like Paul Newman in the different hats is such a delight.

679
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So good.

680
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah.

681
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Makes me happy.

682
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm glad that's still around too but yeah I'm trying to think because on the Ellen Hale we all were kind of brainstorming which celebrity restaurant we would like to create.

683
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like I wanted to Paul in I think I said Paul in stew cauldron is the idea for the name of my mind there.

684
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So if you can even think of that too.

685
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah I'll think on it. I don't know.

686
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Brett Summers.

687
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah I mean I would I would I mean I love her.

688
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah.

689
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Who do I love.

690
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I don't know.

691
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't know.

692
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Maybe.

693
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
No.

694
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I was like I was like it's someone in a caftan.

695
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's what my brain just said.

696
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Like who?

697
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I don't know.

698
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't know.

699
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But I was like that's the vibe of the celebrity I want to eat their food is someone in a caftan.

700
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I mean this guy is very famous but we you have a fascination with Jack Nicholson.

701
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Especially in his later years.

702
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

703
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Eating a hoagie.

704
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah I mean I would I would eat.

705
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The pieces of dropped hoagie.

706
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Jack Nicholson's pieces of dropped hoagie restaurant.

707
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah like the whole onion slice.

708
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's really gross.

709
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Like a tasting platter sort of thing.

710
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah.

711
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Are you saying there's not even connected to a restaurant.

712
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I would eat his hoagie droppings.

713
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Off the floor?

714
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
No off his chest.

715
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Off his chest.

716
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The off the Lakers off courtside.

717
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah well I'm not going to do it in front of people.

718
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's private between me and Jack.

719
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
There's a very I don't know if you've seen this guy.

720
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
There's a there's a picture a couple years ago.

721
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
He's on a big boat and he's eating a hoagie.

722
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Have you seen this?

723
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
No.

724
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Look up Jack Nicholson hoagie and these photos circulate once in a while.

725
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah they're truly a delight because it feels like.

726
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh my god.

727
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Well the Know Your Meme describes his moobs.

728
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh sure.

729
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Well I don't care for that.

730
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm not there for that.

731
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah.

732
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
No I'm there because he's more interested in his sandwich than the fun in the sun.

733
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah.

734
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You know.

735
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
He's smoking a cigarette in the water.

736
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It's a fantastic photo.

737
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's the greatest photo of all time is Jack just his head poking out of the water with

738
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
a cigarette.

739
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Like making sure it doesn't go out by by going under.

740
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Marissa can I pitch you a possible.

741
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
A possible.

742
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No a possible a possible celebrity you might be drawn to.

743
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You had told a story I don't know if you had told it when you were on the show before

744
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
but you had told to us and you had received the same Jerry Saltz book multiple times.

745
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Is that correct.

746
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh sorry.

747
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
No.

748
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
No.

749
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Wait and who's Jerry Saltz?

750
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Do I have the name wrong?

751
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yes you have the name wrong in my head.

752
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But you know the story I'm talking about.

753
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh Jerry Stahl.

754
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I heard Jerry Saltz.

755
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh I had the name wrong.

756
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I had the name wrong.

757
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah Jerry like a Hollywood like dark side of Hollywood Charles Mikowski kind of guy.

758
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You have received that book like twice.

759
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I think three to four times I've received that book from my father.

760
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
From your father.

761
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So if like Jerry Saltz had like a sandwich.

762
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm not having Jerry Saltz salt.

763
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
He's on Twitter too and I'm going to get he's going to yell at me Jerry Stahl Jerry Stahl.

764
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You've gotten the Jerry Stahl book so many times the hearing about Jerry Saltz is a nice break in the pattern.

765
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Jerry Saltz is a fried place and pretty tasty a little salty if you can believe it.

766
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Now that is an alter ego of yours is Jerry Saltz.

767
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Jason Saltz.

768
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Jason Jerry Saltz Sheridan.

769
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And then signing that at the podcast conventions.

770
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Remember me?

771
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Keep it salty.

772
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Keep it salty.

773
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Keep it salty.

774
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Well for no reason you're dressed as a vampire.

775
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Not even you didn't do well it's not your character it's not what you were on the show.

776
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It attracts people to your booth.

777
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah.

778
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Keep it salty.

779
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's an icebreaker.

780
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You draw them in with the vampire outfit you keep their attention with why is the vampire saying keep it salty.

781
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Well anyway that was a long digression with no outcome or no end point.

782
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The outcome was a great catchphrase.

783
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Sure.

784
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Grandpa.

785
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oola Lewis.

786
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Grandpa there's I took a screenshot of the video this documentary.

787
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
He's got some of the longest nails I don't know if you can see that.

788
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean he was perfectly cast.

789
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah.

790
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You've got those nails you've got to play a vampire.

791
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yeah but it seems like and they're long but they also look like dirty.

792
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't think it was even a look.

793
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I think it was just like he didn't cut his nails.

794
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I feel like he's not a person that's concerned about outward appearance.

795
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think he's rolling through life being like sure.

796
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah.

797
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
No I hate this.

798
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Bye.

799
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I think yeah I think that he didn't worry about that as far as maybe hygiene as much from some things I've heard.

800
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I don't need to get into it too much but.

801
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You're going on record saying Al Lewis didn't have good hygiene.

802
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I will go out on a limb here because it's the Patreon only though.

803
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Because that's I don't want the general.

804
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I don't want people to get mad at me if they knew like Al Lewis smelled like a fresh bar of soap.

805
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You son of a bitch for slandering his cleanliness.

806
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But yeah there's some really.

807
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In what way?

808
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What body part?

809
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah what do you?

810
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh I think there was just there's an anecdote I think I read when he made an appearance on the Howard Stern show and I think there was speculation that it seemed like he shit his pants.

811
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That's all I'm saying.

812
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh my god.

813
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Well wait that could be a one off.

814
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Hopefully a one off.

815
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You're just assuming you know that shit.

816
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
How sad that this speculation is now built into he's not hygienic as a human.

817
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Well I'm just saying the nails look just like I'm just saying.

818
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
There's speculation of like.

819
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I could see someone who wears repeat wears an outfit like he wore the tuxedo and cape or whatever.

820
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I could see that not getting enough dry cleaning.

821
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Like it's a little funky.

822
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah I don't know if he's wearing the cape I'm just saying there's some of the anecdotes and like the cigars and everything I think it was just you know.

823
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So you're thinking like sweat human fecal and wine flavored cigar.

824
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm just yeah again because we're on the Patreon I'll say yes.

825
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm reading this I wasn't there.

826
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I don't know.

827
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
You never smelled that.

828
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I didn't smell it.

829
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You never had the pleasure.

830
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah so yeah there's these there's a lot of video there's yeah that's where on the video too there's a picture of the menu.

831
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's great.

832
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's so good.

833
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah.

834
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's an excellent thing.

835
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
There is a little I guess I would call it an Easter egg in today's parlance in the menu.

836
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The monster you can order monster pizza black olives capers and monster cheese.

837
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Oh that is pretty good.

838
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But it's real subtle like it's mixed in with the other pizzas like there's no other real mention.

839
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yes that's like the only fun item because this is what this is a common refrain on this month of shows of like not enough fun named things.

840
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I believe it.

841
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yeah.

842
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think we need it like if you're giving me a theme give me a theme and I want to be in an experience too.

843
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Like I don't want just like white tile.

844
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So you're saying you would have been disappointed with grandpa's because it's not.

845
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't think it's enough.

846
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't think it's enough.

847
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah I will I mean yeah I don't know if we're at the end of the plug.

848
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I agree I agree that we want a coffin of some kind.

849
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We want something.

850
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
We want to enter through a coffin.

851
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah sure.

852
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That's good.

853
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
A little if there's stairs like a little rumbling from spot.

854
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Spot was their pet.

855
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The dragon.

856
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That lived under the stairs.

857
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It was like a dragon yeah.

858
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah.

859
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So like all that stuff for sure.

860
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And then at least at the bare minimum is like a glass case filled with like merchandise and then fun names on the menu.

861
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Yeah that's the fun names on the menu is the bare minimum.

862
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I think right.

863
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That takes like no time.

864
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yes.

865
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And which are we in like is it does it have to be Munster characters or is it vampire style.

866
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
They even have the rights to do Munster stuff.

867
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Drop the D from every word.

868
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Just the D gets dropped and then it's copy.

869
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You can do it.

870
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And then and then restaurants where John Gotti could do it every once in this restaurant.

871
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Could a good like John Travolta play a Gotti movie where Gotti sets up grandpas.

872
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So you have like Robuck and then Travolta as Gotti.

873
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I'm here to see him organizing again.

874
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah Travolta is Al Lewis is pretty I don't want to take it away from.

875
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I refuse that I cannot watch that.

876
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The Travolta is Al Lewis.

877
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yes.

878
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm still upset that Travolta played Devine's character in that second hairspray.

879
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's under my skin in such like I'm so angry about it.

880
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But that was sort of in the tradition of how the Broadway show was it was always like you know.

881
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah but funny gets it was like Harvey Fierstein like Fierstein Fierstein.

882
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah.

883
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah.

884
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And that was lovely.

885
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I saw it and it was lovely like hairspray is one of the best movies in my opinion of all time.

886
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The 1988 you know the original one.

887
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And so like I don't know.

888
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I just just drawn just John Travolta.

889
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
John Travolta like you can't have him.

890
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You were having a physical reaction.

891
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You were like really like.

892
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah it was bizarre looking.

893
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah.

894
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
My organs turn over and they're upset at John Travolta as.

895
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
With all the prosthetics and then digital touch up on top of the prostate.

896
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It's sick.

897
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

898
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It got into some weird.

899
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I've never seen you more passionate about anything.

900
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I mean it pisses me off.

901
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I really wish we could just erase that part of American history.

902
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Wow.

903
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So for you and this here we go here's another reach classic short reach it did stop the beat.

904
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Sure.

905
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That's a song and hairspray.

906
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I assumed yeah.

907
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah.

908
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I haven't seen the movie actually.

909
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So I don't know.

910
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Don't.

911
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I walked out.

912
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I've walked out of two movies.

913
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You walked out?

914
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And that was one of them.

915
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yes I could not handle it.

916
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So I did the Los Feliz 3 and I was like I cannot fucking watch this.

917
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What was the other movie you walked out of?

918
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Center Stage from like I think it's like a Julia Stiles movie.

919
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I remember that yeah.

920
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

921
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It was fine.

922
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I just didn't want to be there.

923
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Not a big stand.

924
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
No it wasn't a big stand.

925
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
In a moral way.

926
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

927
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Sure.

928
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yeah.

929
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
How?

930
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I've I there's been a couple times in this because of my lack of sleep but also because

931
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
we go so far off I go why how did we get here in this kind of part of the conversation?

932
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I feel like I'll completely forget.

933
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It was Travolta and Gotti.

934
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah.

935
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Sorry.

936
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't know.

937
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's great.

938
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
That's big feelings on that.

939
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah.

940
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We I don't like look I don't want to be against everybody here but I do I do kind of like

941
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
that it was just a restaurant that Al Lewis was sitting in.

942
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's so funny.

943
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's so funny.

944
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You're not wrong about that.

945
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I know the idea is to Oscar it up.

946
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Of course.

947
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Plussing it up this month it's Oscaring it up which is the thing where you put a bunch

948
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
of stuff on top of a steak.

949
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah.

950
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Crab.

951
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Crab.

952
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Creamy crab.

953
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Crab and birthdays I believe.

954
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But yeah Scott.

955
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah.

956
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
To improve it to take it to another level.

957
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah Scott you're not wrong.

958
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I have a picture of it.

959
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It just looks like nothing like it doesn't look like anything special.

960
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It just looks like this.

961
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It's a red awning.

962
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's very like 80s New York basic.

963
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah.

964
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah.

965
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think the confusion of this and that that would be enough for people that he would be

966
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
sitting in there when you came in and he might mutter at you on the way out.

967
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's pretty it's pretty fun to me.

968
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah I would 100 percent go and I would linger near wherever he's standing.

969
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You know what I mean.

970
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Like he'd be like you can sit there and I'm going.

971
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,400
Actually I would guess though maybe some of the best food this and Alan Hales as like

972
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,400
actual restaurants that seem committed to what they're serving which is like high end

973
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:15,040
seafood and like you know American Italian kind of food.

974
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,400
Probably the most reliable of the places that we've talked about in terms of quality of

975
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
the food.

976
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,120
Well I think the most direct that you can get where the select I think the celebrity

977
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,600
having eyes on it and then knowing that it's not some big corporate entity that it's good

978
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:38,360
honest hardworking mobsters putting the place together as opposed to these awful like groups

979
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,920
and organizations I mean everywhere that did the that did Planet Hollywood or some of these

980
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,560
other put like the more corporate things get the celebrity connection is so tenuous by

981
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
the end.

982
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
Yeah.

983
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,120
The mob was I've said this I've told this before where Bob Newhart talked about on some

984
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,960
special where it was Vegas was better when the mob was in charge and not corporations.

985
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,280
Interesting everything was better because like corporations it's truly all about math

986
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
and money bottom line.

987
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
So he was like yeah they would have weird things even if it wasn't making money like

988
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,880
certain rooms or certain things in casinos just because like it would offset them by

989
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,800
the money they made and like they weren't so like like hyper focused on like everything

990
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,120
having to make a certain amount of money which yeah that's that's what you get with

991
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,400
grandpas and unlike a corporate celebrity restaurant.

992
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,360
So Pacasaray is pro mafia.

993
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,360
We love mafia.

994
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,600
As long as it's got it as long as it's Travolta Asghati.

995
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,440
No offense Marissa I'm just saying we love Travolta Asghati.

996
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:46,960
But Mike you and I we had an improv festival once we like on a whim ate at an Italian restaurant

997
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:53,920
in this part of New York in this part of Manhattan and I bet grandpas was it was solid.

998
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,440
I don't remember anything about it.

999
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,600
I don't remember the name.

1000
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,560
You're saying that was on the same level of quality.

1001
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:05,520
I bet grandpas would have been as solid as that like nice kind of regular hole in the

1002
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,520
wall place.

1003
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,000
Are you talking about the macaroni place or what are you?

1004
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,920
No no we like like that was like a hipster show.

1005
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,720
Yeah no it was just like a Italian.

1006
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,720
You and I ate there?

1007
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,240
And like some other people.

1008
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,400
Was it oh let's spend a couple more minutes where I try to think.

1009
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Let's play this out fellas.

1010
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,600
We just needed something quick and someone had heard this place was good and we went

1011
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
there.

1012
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
And you're guessing that's the same quality.

1013
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,720
I think that is on the level of like.

1014
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,960
I mean there's no way I couldn't possibly speculate.

1015
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,320
It seemed like this place was okay but it lasted a couple years.

1016
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,560
So I feel like you could do Italian pretty badly.

1017
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Like you know what I mean.

1018
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,560
Oh you can.

1019
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
Like I think there's bad Italian about that.

1020
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,560
Oh for sure.

1021
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,880
Three words that tell you how to do it badly.

1022
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,120
It's hard to do it badly I feel.

1023
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,120
That's the hard like.

1024
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,800
Yeah something has to be really wrong in an operation.

1025
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,240
Exactly because people have people are like oh yes I like cheese I like tomato sauce you

1026
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,520
know what I mean and then and pasta.

1027
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:10,520
And people still like make it sad make it like thick like too thick a pasta and you're

1028
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,920
like what am I doing here.

1029
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,640
I could eat this at home better.

1030
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,520
I don't want to give it away but if my calendar is right what we're doing in two days to close

1031
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:26,000
out the month I strongly suspect that the Italian side of it is rough.

1032
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,480
I don't know if you've looked into the pictures of the.

1033
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,200
And I can't go in it's in the future but like that seems like they didn't do it but who

1034
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
knows.

1035
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:42,560
The get a day at that restaurant are not going to be very nice about the quality.

1036
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:48,560
I found a vintage according to the so according to this this is a vintage this was something

1037
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,640
you could get.

1038
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:56,520
It was a shirt called grandpa's and it's just a picture a different picture of his face

1039
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,240
and it says grandpa's and then it says under it we love you.

1040
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:08,720
Do you think Al Lewis made that shirt for himself after grandpa's closed and was like

1041
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,600
cashing in on like a separate like sidestep.

1042
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:12,360
Right.

1043
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,480
Well this looks like he's in like a like the porthole on the love boat.

1044
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
Maybe.

1045
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,520
Do you think maybe he did like a whistle stop tour.

1046
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,840
There's a fame and there's a story about Lyndon Johnson when he was running for office in

1047
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,640
Texas.

1048
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:34,680
He got some sort of a medal or something in World War Two solely by being on a plane that

1049
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:40,200
flew through a certain area of combat like entitled him to a certain star or something.

1050
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,640
So when he ran for office he had a guy at every stop on the campaign tour present him

1051
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,040
with this medal.

1052
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,800
So do you think Al Lewis when he tried to run for governor and then senator do you think

1053
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,800
he was presented.

1054
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,360
And of course Al we made you the shirt that we love you grandpa.

1055
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,920
Just at every stop along the way.

1056
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,480
Every Italian restaurant at every cigar store.

1057
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,960
That's right.

1058
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,000
Something you said I remembered another part of this article.

1059
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,520
Lewis also performs on the college circuit.

1060
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,720
He says I entertain them and then they have eight million dopey questions.

1061
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,040
I answer some of them and that's the end of the act.

1062
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,680
He's braver than Seinfeld.

1063
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,360
Al Lewis never stops playing the college circuit.

1064
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,480
Yes Seinfeld just call him dopes but answer the question.

1065
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,720
That's all you gotta do.

1066
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,760
Here's a couple other fun facts.

1067
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,600
Several years ago he was the opening act for and I've never heard of this.

1068
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:45,520
Eddie and the Munsters the rock and roll band of Butch Patrick the Munster grandson who

1069
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,880
sometimes joins Lewis for lunch.

1070
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,840
There is a take you now to the cute up song.

1071
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:56,560
Here is so this yeah this is this weird I think this got I think remember like in the

1072
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,000
when in the early 80s there's weird things that would get played on MTV because they

1073
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,880
didn't have enough tapes to fill up the day.

1074
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,480
If you just took the effort to make a music video it might get played.

1075
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,000
I think that's the story with whatever happened to Eddie by Eddie and the Munsters.

1076
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,200
So this is Butch Patrick the kid from them as you're singing.

1077
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,200
You've never heard this before.

1078
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,280
I'm debuting this.

1079
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,960
I think I think I've never heard me.

1080
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,960
I've never heard it.

1081
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,040
Oh this is this is something who boy oh boy.

1082
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,040
All right.

1083
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,040
Here's whatever happened Eddie.

1084
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:53,680
And then some sex effects.

1085
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,760
The Jets like the specials right.

1086
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,600
Pretty good.

1087
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
That's legit.

1088
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,720
Oh good with a mixed up brain.

1089
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,680
My brain went to like the psychology of someone who creates that song.

1090
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,480
You know what I mean after having gone through whatever being a child actor and then making

1091
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,840
that like that's a very that's dealing with like deep material inside of them.

1092
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,280
Whatever happens to you.

1093
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,920
You're asking the question about yourself.

1094
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,920
Yeah.

1095
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,920
Never happened to me.

1096
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,920
Essential kind of.

1097
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,920
Yeah.

1098
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,920
That's what I'm thinking.

1099
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
Or it's a cash grab.

1100
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
I don't know.

1101
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:35,280
I mean I think you had to grab like the thing that I was reminded on this and Alan Hale

1102
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,360
is that Gilligan's Island and the Munsters both only lasted like two or three seasons.

1103
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,360
Real short.

1104
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:46,040
Revived eventually but like God knows what the TV residuals were like.

1105
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,040
Well yeah.

1106
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,040
Back then.

1107
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
Yeah.

1108
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,640
These people did not make a lot of money on these famous shows.

1109
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
Yeah.

1110
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,080
If they didn't make it that long.

1111
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Yeah.

1112
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,080
Well that's yeah that's a bummer.

1113
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,520
You gotta make your your new wave song.

1114
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,440
Finally cash in.

1115
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,080
I'm sure that was any toward like say so and guess what Eddie the Munsters are coming to

1116
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,440
your town and guess who the opening act is.

1117
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
G.G.

1118
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,040
Allen in the murder child case.

1119
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:19,120
But like what then what so all right we're gonna play some songs about me and the Munsters

1120
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,240
and then what does grandpa do before that.

1121
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,240
It's not stand up.

1122
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,240
He answers questions.

1123
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,240
Some of them.

1124
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,400
And then he leaves.

1125
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,400
That was dumb.

1126
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Next.

1127
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Next.

1128
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Gotta be some very sleepy magic in that.

1129
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Oh I don't know.

1130
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Gotta be some very sleepy magic.

1131
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
I'd like to hold.

1132
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,400
He yicks a little too hard and then all like the five things all come out of his sleeve.

1133
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,400
He rips like his sleeve rips from the thing.

1134
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,400
It gets caught.

1135
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,400
Ah yeah.

1136
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,600
He just like makes this motion and leaves.

1137
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,440
And then Eddie only has the one song.

1138
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,960
So this ending of entertainment is over in 16 minutes.

1139
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,400
One of my favorite things is finding like a how would I describe it.

1140
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,480
I guess a back to the well type of a thing.

1141
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,640
Like I've talked before about Bobby Boris Pickett who did the Monster Mash.

1142
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,640
Yes.

1143
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
Which is kind of a fluke hit for him.

1144
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:16,600
And then he went back multiple times to try to do it again in a different version.

1145
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,480
He wanted to do the monster swim and then there was a monster rap in like 1990.

1146
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,480
I love back to the well material.

1147
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,480
So this feels similar where it's like well I don't know I'll just sing lyrics over the

1148
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
monsters theme.

1149
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,280
Is it the well if it wasn't the well that you created?

1150
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,280
You know what I mean?

1151
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,280
But he's part of the well.

1152
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,280
He was like next to the well.

1153
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,280
He was trying to dip his siphon.

1154
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,280
Lower in and grab something and get out.

1155
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,480
A real mole hole in.

1156
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:49,680
I wonder what Butch Patrick thought when that pop punk song from a few years ago that sampled

1157
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
the monsters theme.

1158
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
The Fall Out Boy?

1159
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
The Fall Out Boy song.

1160
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
What do you mean what he thought of it?

1161
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,680
I wonder what he thought of it.

1162
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
Oh we thought a lot of it.

1163
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,680
They're ripping me off.

1164
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,680
Oh so you like it when they do it.

1165
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,440
When my punk band does it.

1166
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,480
Did Fall Out Boy ever go like folks there's a special guest in the house tonight ladies

1167
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,840
and gentlemen say his name you know who it is Butch Patrick.

1168
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,840
Cricket.

1169
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,960
Cricket.

1170
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:19,440
There is I believe today on our Facebook group I noticed this.

1171
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,880
I don't know if you guys did you notice this?

1172
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,880
No no.

1173
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,040
This is posted by Andrew Ratner.

1174
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:30,600
He said today at the American Dream Mall Butch Patrick is signing and they have the full

1175
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,600
Dracula.

1176
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
Whoa.

1177
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
That's very cool.

1178
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,600
Wow.

1179
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,160
So on this very day we're recording this you can go get an autograph from Butch at the

1180
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,880
At a giant graveyard.

1181
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,320
A terrible mall that everyone hates.

1182
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,520
And by the time you hear this it'll be last week.

1183
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Yeah.

1184
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
That's right it'll be.

1185
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,440
So go to the mall like go stand around see if you can see Dracula tracks anywhere.

1186
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:02,280
We're recording this at a lower date than you think is what I would say.

1187
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,760
I mean but knowing how they operate we will have announced it before they do.

1188
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,640
They will announce an event in the past.

1189
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,640
Right right right.

1190
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,640
Dang it.

1191
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,640
We're ahead of that.

1192
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,640
Who messed this up?

1193
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,880
Look it makes sense if it's just me messing up the buffer app to schedule posts but the

1194
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,280
American Dream Mall is doing it.

1195
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,800
I mean they got a lot of money.

1196
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,840
Yeah they really yeah they should get on top of it.

1197
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,160
But they look they're obviously they've got some good ideas to drive traffic.

1198
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,160
Yeah.

1199
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,160
So.

1200
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,200
Sit in the fan get Butch Patrick in here.

1201
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,080
Get her there brother get Al Lewis.

1202
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,640
He died many years ago.

1203
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Ah damn it.

1204
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,880
Southside Johnny's busy.

1205
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,320
The Al's Asbury Dukes will not show up.

1206
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,200
Johnny should be like the greeter at the American Dream Mall.

1207
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,200
He should be like the Al Lewis of the mall.

1208
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,960
Like tell how many where you want to go.

1209
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,960
It's sugar.

1210
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,960
Oh yeah.

1211
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,960
To point you in the direction.

1212
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,960
I don't know where it is.

1213
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,960
Yeah.

1214
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,520
You want to hear some harmonica.

1215
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,320
Guys would you like to head into the the presence portion of this episode.

1216
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
Oh yes.

1217
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,440
There is a presence portion of this episode.

1218
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,440
Hang on.

1219
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,680
Okay let's see.

1220
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,000
Is it behind the palette of pasta sauce jars.

1221
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,120
Oh my god.

1222
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,040
Covered in a bug con shirt.

1223
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,160
So these are not I have three things here and they are not I didn't pick them for individually.

1224
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,400
So you just like say what speaks to you.

1225
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,320
I just really want to see a pile of Al Lewis things and for you guys to get to go home

1226
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
with them.

1227
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,320
So let's see.

1228
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,320
Wow.

1229
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,320
I mean this this really is a pretty mad.

1230
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,320
This is a foot tall.

1231
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,440
This is really good.

1232
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,200
With a plastic head.

1233
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,280
It's really it's like the the Woody from Toy Story.

1234
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,280
Yeah.

1235
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,280
Fabric body and plastic head.

1236
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,280
Pretty massive.

1237
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,760
Really soft feet on that one.

1238
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,560
Looks like very soft feet.

1239
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,800
And yet the the fabric on it is kind of scratchy.

1240
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:59,640
The insides are soft but scratchy maybe like Al himself.

1241
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,680
I don't know the hygiene of this item.

1242
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,680
I don't know where it's been or if it's any it's similar to.

1243
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
I'll just put them on.

1244
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,560
You don't have to say now but just know that you're you're going home with something Al

1245
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,560
Lewis related.

1246
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,560
This is beautiful.

1247
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,560
That's great.

1248
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,000
That this is what now that when that showed up I didn't realize how much huger it was

1249
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,320
than this other one I got which is just a couple of inches tall.

1250
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,200
But it does come with a little dragon.

1251
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,200
Wow.

1252
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,200
That's great.

1253
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Wow.

1254
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Thing here.

1255
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,240
And then this is from a Etsy store.

1256
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,240
Now I don't remember the name.

1257
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,360
I'll post it somewhere if I can.

1258
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:39,880
This is a flask that says grandpa's secret formula super powered rocket fuel.

1259
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
This is pretty good.

1260
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
That is good.

1261
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,840
Say the name at the end if I find it really quick of the store because it turned out pretty

1262
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,240
solid but flask Dracula.

1263
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,600
Anybody call out what's speaking to you.

1264
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
You don't have to do it right now.

1265
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,600
No pressure.

1266
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,200
But I'm curious if one item if one way to represent Al Lewis.

1267
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,960
I think Marissa should choose first.

1268
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
Oh man.

1269
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,960
I like them all.

1270
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,320
I think I'm most attracted to the doll the big doll.

1271
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,680
Yeah I mean that's the piece to resistance.

1272
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,680
Yeah.

1273
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
Well absolutely.

1274
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Is that OK.

1275
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,680
Yeah that's fine.

1276
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,600
I'll make it fly like a vampire.

1277
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600
Over to you.

1278
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,600
Here we go.

1279
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,600
Sore.

1280
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,600
Oh it flipped up.

1281
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
That was pretty great.

1282
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh my god.

1283
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,600
This face.

1284
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,600
Marissa.

1285
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,080
This face he's like looking up at you with delight.

1286
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,080
Will you take me home.

1287
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,080
I will grandpa.

1288
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,080
You're in love.

1289
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,080
Forever.

1290
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,080
I know.

1291
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,080
For as long as I live.

1292
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,760
How come every time I come on this I get a new boyfriend.

1293
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Oh yeah.

1294
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,760
I'm sorry Mr. Tato.

1295
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,760
Old news.

1296
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,360
Well if we're calling it I think I'd like the cast iron.

1297
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,360
All right.

1298
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,360
The toy.

1299
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,440
If that's all right Mr. Toy.

1300
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,440
And some hooch.

1301
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,840
Are you are you assuming that I don't already have an Al Lewis toy.

1302
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,960
You're being correct.

1303
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,580
You just seem to have like lots of nice display flat surfaces.

1304
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,340
So I feel like the flask would be easy to prop up.

1305
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,140
Well I'm not going to display I'm going to drink out of it.

1306
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,140
I'm going to get hammered.

1307
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,140
Sure.

1308
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,140
That's a functioning.

1309
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,140
Thank you.

1310
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,140
Yeah.

1311
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,140
Thank you so much.

1312
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,140
This is so much fun.

1313
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,140
Absolutely.

1314
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,140
Yes.

1315
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,140
Well yeah.

1316
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,140
Take it on treasure him.

1317
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,140
Treat Al as your own.

1318
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,140
I mean are we at the end.

1319
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,140
Anything else we want to say about old Al?

1320
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:23,860
Can I just say something about the Munsters.

1321
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:29,300
This might be it was a real like mind blower to me when I was reading.

1322
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:35,380
I didn't realize that the Munsters were like comedy versions of the Universal Monsters.

1323
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,700
And it's like so obvious.

1324
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,700
And I was like I never understood that.

1325
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:45,940
You know and you know I mean it's just like making a cute funny version of the monsters

1326
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,660
we already knew and loved.

1327
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
Right.

1328
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,500
A higher Frankenstein's monster.

1329
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,060
Bride of Frankenstein.

1330
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,060
Wolf man.

1331
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,060
A Maryland.

1332
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,060
Regular lady.

1333
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,460
Which is a funny bit.

1334
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,700
Yeah I think it's great.

1335
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,300
I think it's super funny.

1336
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,300
Yeah.

1337
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,300
Yeah.

1338
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,300
I guess I don't I don't even know if I really knew.

1339
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,300
I mean I guess it makes sense.

1340
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,300
It makes sense.

1341
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:11,420
But I never put it together that that's they were like using the IP and kind of like.

1342
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,420
Yeah.

1343
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,660
Do you have a Munsters versus Adam's family preference.

1344
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,660
Munsters.

1345
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,740
And I feel like I my aunt always had like Adam's family books.

1346
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,740
Yes.

1347
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Right.

1348
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,740
Right.

1349
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,940
And so I feel like I saw those first because like I was a little kid and would be looking

1350
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,940
at them.

1351
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,940
But the Munsters like they're they're more funny to me.

1352
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,060
They feel they're like the people you want to hang out with.

1353
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,700
Yeah the move I think the movie Adam's family knocks knocks it up.

1354
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,700
Way out of the park.

1355
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,700
Because those are so great.

1356
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,700
I was only thinking about the shows.

1357
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:45,980
Yeah.

1358
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,260
Specifically because of Al Lewis and Fred Gwynn.

1359
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,260
Yeah.

1360
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,540
Show might be strong.

1361
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,540
Yeah.

1362
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:56,220
Even though like what's his name Jackie something who played Fester Jackie Coogan.

1363
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,220
Thank you.

1364
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,220
And ask them.

1365
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,220
Those are fun.

1366
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,220
They're fun.

1367
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,220
But they're great.

1368
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,220
Gwynn and Lewis get out of here.

1369
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,220
These two guys.

1370
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,220
They're so funny.

1371
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:07,140
I'm also I'm confident that I've said this on the show before but it bears mentioning

1372
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,380
again since it's a monster episode.

1373
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,820
When I was making Moonbeam City with my friend Tommy Blacha when we would have to do the

1374
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:22,180
boring ritual of notes calls and does a grind through like like like we just really think

1375
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,300
that it should be less this.

1376
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,460
We would just dread it so much.

1377
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,460
We had to get through it.

1378
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,980
So the deal you make to make the show and we would do the way we started getting through

1379
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,420
it is by putting on Netflix.

1380
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,060
I don't know where the Munsters is now was on Netflix then and we would put it on mute

1381
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,740
and just have the Munsters on.

1382
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,660
So if we're ever frustrated by the call then we point and then like this sped up footage

1383
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:46,460
of the Dracula going really fast and crashing into the barn or whatever house and smoke

1384
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,860
flies up or like you know Herman's dressed like a greaser.

1385
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:56,420
But all the time we'd go we'd start dragging and like oh yeah this is oh hey look at that.

1386
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,900
And so I would say and now we're in a world like hopefully we're getting out into the

1387
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,660
world and they were a little less zoomy in the near future.

1388
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,500
But really the listener the next time is something you don't want to do.

1389
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,620
Something in the air.

1390
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,940
You're stuck at a computer.

1391
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,980
Get a little make it take a little screen.

1392
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,460
Make it small in the corner or big.

1393
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,700
Put make your zoom small.

1394
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,700
Fuck the zoom.

1395
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,940
And then put the Munsters as the main thing on your screen on me.

1396
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,740
It's going to get you through whatever crap you don't want to do.

1397
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,780
Highly recommended.

1398
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,180
Well Guardian Munsters.

1399
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,620
And you have what you have now to take home with you.

1400
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,940
It's like it's like the elf on the shelf.

1401
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,380
We talked about a while back.

1402
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,740
Or the mention on a bench.

1403
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,180
You got a Lewis.

1404
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:38,300
I don't know what it rhymes with a grandpa on your hamper.

1405
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,540
Yeah.

1406
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:40,780
Grampa.

1407
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,780
Grampa in your hamper.

1408
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,780
Grampa in your hamper.

1409
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,260
You're going to have to move them to take the laundry.

1410
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,300
Good news I just checked.

1411
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:54,700
Peacock is your place to currently see both seasons of the Munsters.

1412
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,740
They grabbed it back.

1413
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,180
They're like we're bleeding out to Netflix.

1414
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,100
We need to get our properties back.

1415
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,900
Yeah.

1416
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,140
Bring the Munsters home.

1417
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,420
Munsters go home.

1418
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Yeah.

1419
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,420
Take a back seat.

1420
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,660
Take a back seat in Herman's coach WWE.

1421
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,100
The Dragula is saving us.

1422
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:18,900
Well, we've we've you know like I think maybe we when the Munsters

1423
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,340
Rob Zombie movie comes out is when we start to do more Munsters content.

1424
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,540
But for now I do feel like we've got a lot we got a lot out.

1425
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,380
Yeah.

1426
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,940
And that's going to be on Peacock also.

1427
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:28,980
Is that true?

1428
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:29,980
It is. Yeah.

1429
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,180
Is that confirmed?

1430
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,180
Oh.

1431
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,420
We're going to do the AMC rent a theater.

1432
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,180
No, you can also rent a theater.

1433
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:36,500
Oh, OK.

1434
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,740
It's going to be like it'll be on Peacock, but also in theaters.

1435
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:40,940
I'm so curious.

1436
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,940
Like I truly don't understand what the tone of that movie is going to be.

1437
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,300
Yeah, it's hard to tell.

1438
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,060
Well, yeah, when you see just like goofy smile and Munsters,

1439
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,820
but then Rob Zombie, Mr.

1440
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,780
Scary.

1441
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:51,420
Yeah.

1442
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,180
Mr.

1443
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:52,860
Scare.

1444
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,140
As I call him Mr.

1445
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,140
Scary.

1446
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,740
I know we're in parentheses Mr.

1447
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,740
Scary.

1448
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:00,340
Mr.

1449
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,340
Scary.

1450
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,380
I know where at the end, but like I did do Rob Zombie's American Nightmare,

1451
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:09,340
which is like an immersive maze haunt thing that they had in Pomona.

1452
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,020
It was in Pomona like maybe like eight years ago.

1453
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,700
It was a while.

1454
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,580
Whoa. At the fair or just a freestanding standalone haunt, right?

1455
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,620
It's a standalone haunt.

1456
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,020
It was like three mazes and then like,

1457
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,860
you know, like some cover band singing something that was unrelated.

1458
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,060
You know, like, you know, like some kind of 80s cover band.

1459
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,900
But it was one of the best haunts I ever went to.

1460
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,780
Very fun.

1461
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,580
There was one where you had to like wear a bag over your head.

1462
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:40,700
And I got stuck in a corner at one point because you can't see because you got a

1463
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,580
bag on your head.

1464
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:46,700
And a little man came out and in by my ear was like, you're in a corner,

1465
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,060
which was very helpful and also kept to the theme.

1466
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,940
So you're saying you have faith maybe in Rob because this this immersive was

1467
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,700
good. The immersive. It was truly beautiful.

1468
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:02,260
It was like one of the best mazes. Like there were three mazes.

1469
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,900
One was like House of a Thousand Corpses and it was done really well.

1470
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,820
And then one was like a neon maze, which I don't remember as well.

1471
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,020
And then one was the bag head.

1472
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,460
I don't remember what the name of that one.

1473
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,100
How many times have you had a bag put on your head for immersive?

1474
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,340
Maybe like twice.

1475
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,460
OK, I'm not I'm not because I had an anxiety attack in October

1476
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,660
when they were about to put a bag on my head for something.

1477
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,580
And I tapped out before the escape.

1478
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,020
Was it one of the spooky ones?

1479
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:27,340
Was it an escape, scary escape room?

1480
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,380
There was a minute are involved. Oh, yeah.

1481
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,060
Did you do it? No, I didn't.

1482
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,100
But I've talked to people who have. OK.

1483
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,300
Interesting. Mm hmm.

1484
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,540
I don't I don't I'll say it later.

1485
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,820
There was a funny thing, a funny Rob Zombie thing going around

1486
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,300
the Internet recently where it was like a live, laugh, love kind of painted sign.

1487
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,940
But it says dig through the ditches, burn through the witches.

1488
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,740
Slave in the back of my Dracula.

1489
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,300
And that really says it all.

1490
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,380
I mean, as far as the episode up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1491
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,540
No, it's a it's a beautiful message.

1492
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,740
Thanks for touring the crypt with us.

1493
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,700
We're strictly just survive podcast, the ride, the second gate, celebrity.

1494
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,260
Take good care of the gramp on the.

1495
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,660
Oh, oh, my God. Let's exit through the gift shop.

1496
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,100
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1497
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,140
Um, I guess if you're curious, you could.

1498
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,300
I like made a little like short that you could see.

1499
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,860
It's called Give Me a Sign on my website, Marissa Strickland dot com.

1500
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:32,900
It's kind of moody. Oh, cool.

1501
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:38,660
OK, like the monsters or I mean, it's not spooky because, you know what I mean?

1502
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,700
I think the monsters are like funny, spooky, but it's more like

1503
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,340
take a little walk and be like, hmm.

1504
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,020
Oh, cool.

1505
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,220
Well, sounds great.

1506
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,580
You know, it's just talking about, you know, life and sadness.

1507
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,420
But it's like it's not sad.

1508
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,780
You know, I mean, you make your own choice.

1509
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,340
That's a really intriguing plug.

1510
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,180
That sounds great. Yeah.

1511
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:07,380
Wonderful. And we've got to like, I'd say like a moody little walk

1512
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,660
coming up in two days on the main feed to close out celebrity.

1513
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,860
Is it for the main?

1514
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,500
There's it for the second gate and for celebrity.

1515
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,980
One last one. I think we're we're we're closing it out in a pretty interesting

1516
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,860
way, I believe. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1517
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,820
Yeah. Yeah. This is yeah.

1518
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,220
Well, no need to say too much more.

1519
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,020
But be excited for that.

1520
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,500
I'm afraid that Etsy store, by the way, timeless terrors.

1521
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:35,020
If you want a monster related flask, I think I think they have other stuff like that.

1522
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:35,900
It all looks very cool.

1523
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:40,500
So shout out to that Etsy store and keep it tuned here for a sadly next month

1524
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,780
when it goes back to not celebrity restaurants anymore.

1525
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,180
I know this is who I don't want it to end you guys.

1526
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,060
Yeah. Maybe we just switch.

1527
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:53,540
If anyone notices, it's hard for we might run out of topics fairly quickly.

1528
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,900
But who knows?

1529
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,540
We keep digging.

1530
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:58,620
Or who gets restaurant tours?

1531
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,980
We didn't do an episode about Cougar.

1532
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,020
Both Xavier Cougar's.

1533
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,180
I read Charo. Oh, yes. Yes.

1534
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,780
No. Yeah. I said Marissa videos of Charo every couple of.

1535
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,860
Frequently. Yeah.

1536
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,580
Frequently. Yeah.

1537
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:12,140
Usually no context.

1538
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,940
And then like we don't even say anything about it.

1539
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,660
Like I haven't talked to her in a month.

1540
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,940
Here you go.

1541
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,780
So we communicate.

1542
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,100
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

1543
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,460
Well, thanks for listening.

1544
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,860
Ula Lewis. Keep it salty.
