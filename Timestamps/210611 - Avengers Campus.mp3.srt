1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Hi, true believers.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,400
The following podcast is exploding with reclaimed manufacturing facilities.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,480
Mesmerizing restaurants with shockingly similar names and that eye-popping shade known only

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
as gargantuan gray.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
Thwip, Snicked, Clang.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:47,480
This is Avengers Campus on Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a show hosted by three men who get a surge of self-satisfied

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,480
adrenaline when they use the word Q instead of line.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,600
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Excelsior, Michael.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Yes, thank you.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,120
You know, I saw someone holding, they're still having to do all the outdoor Qs, and someone

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,400
had a big sign on a stick that said like, end of Q here.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
And I was like, that's interesting.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,840
Disney is like officially saying Q on a sign.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah, I think that is now like just basic like theme park language.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I think so too.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,280
I wonder how many like man on the street, you know, your average Joe.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,720
Well, we're doing our part educating people every day of the updated vocabulary and Scott

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,360
Garner is here doing his part.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah, this seems like the kind of thing like one day somebody's going to be so mad about

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
it on Twitter.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,880
It's a Q, okay?

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
I'm only going to say this one more time.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
They're not lines.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
They're Qs.

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
Normalized Qs.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,720
It's what we call them now.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,160
And it has like 1.2K likes and like, why?

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,280
Why is everyone so mad about it?

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
It's like something like the, you know what I don't get mad about like other people do

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,720
is sketch and skit.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,160
That's some weird like comedy writer.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,120
Excuse me, skits are at summer camp.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,920
I think skits are, I think it's kind of fun to try to announce like, no, this is a skit.

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
This is what we're doing.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Like, isn't it more, it takes the pressure off.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
You call it a skit.

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,440
Skit feels like something they did on Hee Haw, but like you didn't have to worry about it.

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
It's not as much art.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
And I don't mean that in a bad way.

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,840
I mean that in the sense that like it's a little skit.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
Does just a little, it could be 30 seconds.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
Skit and play is cute.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,200
It is not Saturday Night Live where it's like a set that's very good and it immerses you.

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
It's like they didn't even change the set.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,800
They put like half a costume on a guy who's smiling at you.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,700
Like, I'm not really a cowboy.

51
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,240
It's like Slim Pickens and Junior Samples doing a 25 second skit.

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
That's what they were doing.

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Those are names by the way.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
It's actual performers.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I've never heard the name Junior Samples.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,640
You're getting too obscure for me.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Yeah.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,280
I was really listening to some of these old, Jason knows about this.

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
I was listening to an old country artist named Little Jimmy Dickens a couple of days ago

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,120
as well.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,080
So yeah, anyway, that's not what this podcast is about though.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,680
No Lil Nas X for you.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
It's Little Jimmy Dickens.

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Well, that's pretty funny to say that.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Okay, really quick back to Little Jimmy Dickens.

66
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,480
We learned that he was born in 1920 and he passed away in 2015.

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,040
And he was so around that he was on like the Country Music Awards in 2011 doing a bit playing

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,560
Justin Bieber, playing Little Justin Bieber at like age, what did we find, like 90?

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Something like that.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
And also it's important.

71
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
That's not just a nickname.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
He is like 4'11".

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Right.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Oh, okay.

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
He actually was young.

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Anyway.

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
So he's living his truth.

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Wow.

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Still doing skits.

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Now that's a skit.

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
That was a skit.

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,040
Him and Brad Paisley did a little skit on the Country Music Awards in 2011.

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
It's freeing.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Skit is freeing.

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,600
Like, sketch comedy should not be precious.

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,160
Skit comedy is a phrase that's never been said.

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,040
So you can invent it as you go.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,240
I work in skit comedy.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,240
You're doing a great job of like taking the thing that's happening this very week and

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,160
immediately alienating audience with talk of Lil' Jimmy Dickens.

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Junior Sample.

92
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Junior Sample.

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
We're saying his many names.

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,880
But however, this is how the whole episode is going to feel to me.

95
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,920
Admittedly a non-Marvel person.

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know what anything is.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,960
You might as well, you know, Jimmy Dickens could be an Ant-Man character for all I know.

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,520
Lil' Jimmy Dickens, yes, he was good friends with Hank Pym and...

99
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
He's one of the Yancey Street Gang.

100
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Oh, you're right.

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
He was one of Ben Grimm, aka Things, Yancey Street Gang.

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
The Young Tops.

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,720
The thing is from the Fantastic Four, of course, Scott.

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
He's the Orange Rocky guy played by Michael Chiklis in the two movies.

105
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Yes.

106
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Yeah.

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
And I forget who plays him in the Josh Trank version, but that's okay.

108
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Yeah.

109
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,200
But I should just keep tally marks of things that I don't understand in this episode, which

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
there's going to be a lot.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,560
Should we slip in once in a while just a completely fake thing, a fake piece of information and

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
see if Scott can point it out?

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,400
I was going to say if you do those tally marks by the end of the episode, you'd look like

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,680
Batman's villain, Mr. Zazz.

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,320
But that's another universe, you know.

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm going to guess that that one's not fake.

117
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
It's not fake.

118
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
That is not fake.

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,640
That's a serial killer who puts a hash mark on his body every time he kills someone and

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
he's covered in hash marks.

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,680
He's actually a very creepy character.

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,400
I think he showed up on some of the shows.

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,920
If you wrote out the word little, it would kind of end with an apostrophe.

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
That was what I'll look like.

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Hash marks.

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
That's true.

127
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
That's a good point.

128
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh, that's true.

129
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,640
Words you can make entirely using hash marks.

130
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Yeah.

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Fascinating info.

132
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
So Avengers Camp.

133
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,720
We're talking about Avengers Campus today and the new land and California Adventure.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
The parks are back open.

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,800
It's all new place to go to.

136
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,160
And Scott, you're going to be, of course, even more in the dark because you did not

137
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
you were not able to attend.

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Didn't go.

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,960
So the intent was for, you know, we reserved it in advance and synced them up.

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,460
And the intent was that this would be the first time all three of us were on Disney

141
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,520
property together and then a work thing came up and I could not do it.

142
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
So it'll just be questions on my end.

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,360
I will say this right away because listeners may have seen things that you tweeted and

144
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,280
I know that you you had pretty good luck, I feel like, with with with stuff.

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I mean, we'll get into it.

146
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Yeah.

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,160
But I had a feeling unfamiliar to me in like a year and a half, which is the dreaded feeling

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,260
of FOMO.

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
You were FOMOing.

150
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Absolutely.

151
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,520
I had my friends are at Disneyland and I'm not and they're getting on all this stuff

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,960
and I got to go come on the podcast with my my head between my legs.

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Is that the phrase?

154
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,840
No, with tail between the legs.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
It's your tail. It's your tail, not head.

156
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,520
That's like I'm trying to the knees if you're feeling dizzy.

157
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,640
That's like that's like a Ventura or something when you're talking out of your butt.

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,920
Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Yeah. Or if I'm trying to pleasure myself, it's between my legs.

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
That's what I was sitting around trying to do instead of going to Avengers campus.

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,320
So I will you will have to explain this to me like a four year old who's never been to

162
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,160
Avengers, which which we would also probably have to do if you had gone to Avengers.

163
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,720
But you would have had a visual reference in your brain, a direct visual.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,160
I do have a visual reference because Jason was kind enough to bring a map that was very

165
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,640
thoughtful of you that it would be helpful to have.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
Did I just open the non-manual?

167
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,480
No, that's the official.

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,200
So that's a full California adventure map.

169
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,280
And then the other one is just details.

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,080
I think that the other one is called Recruits Guide.

171
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,280
And that is specifically what you can do in the land.

172
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,520
But this is their current California adventure map.

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,160
It's the souvenir kind of card stock map.

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,560
I got one of these when we went to the opening day of the Galaxy's Edge 2.

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,880
And it's it is very nice.

176
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
It's a nice keepsake.

177
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,960
Not the most practical map, but, you know, they're really pushing people to the app.

178
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,680
For better or worse, they're pushing people to the app.

179
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,240
Yeah, interesting, interesting.

180
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm very curious.

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
We have not really this was pretty fresh.

182
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,360
We're recording this just two days after you went and then we're putting it up

183
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,040
two days after that. So it's all it's all pretty quick.

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,440
I don't really know how it went for you guys overall.

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, we say we say save it for the year and we saved it for the year.

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,840
I guess let's do a little bit of just the day, how the day started,

187
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,000
because, yes, like Rise of the Resistance, you have to get a spot

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,920
in a virtual queue to even enter the land.

189
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,480
Really, you can wait on standby, but it's much easier if you get a ride,

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,920
a reservation for the Spider-Man ride.

191
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,480
And then you can go basically right into the land.

192
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Yeah. And then you can go in the land and you should probably stay

193
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,760
because you're probably not getting back in the land.

194
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
For a little while, it seems like

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,440
it seems like parks will be increasing capacity pretty rapidly.

196
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,800
There's a lot. Yeah, there's still a lot of covid protocols in place.

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,600
There's still capacity issues. There's still I don't I

198
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
maybe I don't want to tip my I don't think there's going to be a crazy

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,840
rush on this land for a long time.

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,600
I feel like in a month or two, you'll be able to comfortably walk in, at least

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,640
maybe not get on the ride necessarily right away.

202
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
But I think I can't imagine it's going to be a queuing up situation

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
for this land. I think that's correct.

204
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,440
We did take the risk as theme park journalists, like any

205
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,120
even during normal times, if you go the first week, even the first month

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,480
of a new land attraction, you are a live test.

207
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,280
You are an active guinea pig.

208
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,840
And even from opening day on the Friday opening day to we went on the Monday.

209
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,480
So we went a few days later.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,840
They had already tweaked a few things. Right.

211
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,920
So so basically what it was seven a.m.

212
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,520
is when you have to get your reservation.

213
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,440
And this is pressure. This is what I live for.

214
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,120
This is the this is the thing I love is checking is getting things

215
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,840
very fast.

216
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,440
I mean, the odds are against you when like people are tweeting.

217
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,880
I didn't get it. And they're mad. And you find a way.

218
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,320
Yeah. And seconds go by like it's seconds.

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,160
This stuff is done.

220
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,800
And so you really have to keep refreshing at six fifty eight

221
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,520
and then click join at all the party.

222
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,000
Now, the party was me, Jason, Lindsay, Zachary, you know, and his wife, Nicole.

223
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
So we had five people there.

224
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,640
And I kept giving I was giving everyone instructions because everybody has to do it.

225
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,280
We all have to chip in because maybe I'm going to fail. You know?

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Yeah. And I got to give a shout out to two people.

227
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
One, Carly Weisel posted a while back an article by women.

228
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
I believe it is Brooke McDonald.

229
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,120
And it said here are the step by step instructions

230
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,080
that will make it pretty likely you'll get at the rise of the resistance

231
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,680
virtual queue spot.

232
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,600
And it's identical.

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,720
It's the same process for web slingers.

234
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,160
It's just web slingers is the thing, the new thing of the moment.

235
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,000
And it probably filled up even quicker.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,960
And there's less spots, I believe, on web.

237
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
And there isn't rise of the web slingers.

238
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
A Spider-Man adventure.

239
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,080
That's the thank you for showing the proper respect.

240
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,760
Web slingers, which is a fight for you for.

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah. And I made a joke about this on Twitter.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,200
And you thought I was joking about having to wake up early.

243
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
And yeah, it sucks to wake up early.

244
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,320
But I was joking more about the fact that you have two one minute windows

245
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,280
in a day in a day of 24 hours that if at the moment,

246
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,360
if you're trying to get in this land, your best bet is is seven o'clock to seven

247
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,240
to one and 12 p.m. to twelve.

248
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh, one. It's very harrowing.

249
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,400
I had to do it for rise of the resistance when we returned a couple of weeks ago.

250
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,240
And I missed the seven. I screwed up.

251
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I was not quick on the draw.

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
It really is like an old west gun.

253
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,840
Gunfight. I got the 12 and you're watching everyone around you.

254
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,280
Like suddenly all the phones come out and like this is like all the

255
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
everyone around you becomes an enemy all of a sudden.

256
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah, no. You're going to stop me.

257
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,680
And and and I I have to say, I I did get a seven a.m.

258
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,400
rise a few weeks ago when I went back to Disneyland.

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,640
And I think because I kept double checking what I was doing.

260
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,360
And I had an extra pass in my thing or a legacy pass or whatever.

261
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,280
And so I I think I got like group 28.

262
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,600
And we had plenty of time to get down there and walk over and all.

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,080
And so I took an extra minute to double check everything and still got a spot.

264
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,320
This you don't I think by the grace of God.

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Well, Lindsey pulled it.

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Well, he just yes.

267
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,640
So so I'm over in this green sheer.

268
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm like sitting on the ground in a stress position in six fifty nine.

269
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
Lindsey's over here.

270
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,080
And she and the chair that she I go through.

271
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,200
I refresh it. I refresh it. I refresh. I'm going to do this.

272
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,440
I remember the join button appears.

273
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,280
A blue join button appears and I'm like, here we go.

274
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,360
This is it. I I remember I hit the wrong part of the join button.

275
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,920
It doesn't work. I had to hit it three times.

276
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,320
And I was like, fuck, I'm fucked. We're fucked.

277
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,800
And all of a sudden then I hit join and then there's an error,

278
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
which means somebody got it.

279
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah, and I got that too.

280
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,560
Yeah. So we're all on a text chain now because Zach and his wife are trying it.

281
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,720
Jason is trying it. Lindsey Lindsey just goes, Oh, I think I got it.

282
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I go, are you sure? Are you sure you got it?

283
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,840
She's like, yeah, I think I got it. Yeah.

284
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,680
It's 17. And to see it, you have to quit the app.

285
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Someone else got it.

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,040
I found it by quitting the app and going back in.

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,200
And then he told me this is very Lindsey, I feel like is like invested in all the stuff,

288
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,520
likes all the stuff, but way chiller about it than you than us than all everyone.

289
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,920
Of course. Well, she and she and she I was so riled up.

290
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,320
I was like not even believing.

291
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,720
And she goes, look, I know you wanted to be the one to get it.

292
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,600
And I'm sorry.

293
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,280
But I got it. And I'm like, no, no.

294
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,000
OK, thank you. Yeah, you did it.

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
No, you did it. You did it. Yeah.

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
I didn't do it. You did it.

297
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,120
You deserve the credit.

298
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,080
And so, yeah, so we're 17.

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
So we're like, well, you got in the car because that's.

300
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
I threw Mike. I was sitting up in bed doing it.

302
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,960
I threw my clothes on.

303
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Also, like, you know, hustled to the car.

304
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,160
Yeah. Yeah. Because this also now this dictates when you leave.

305
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,400
Yeah. We got a later group.

306
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,480
Yeah. Now, that's the other thing, too, because it said

307
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,720
estimated wait time, 182 minutes.

308
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,240
It does not say whether that is from when you pulled it at 7 a.m.

309
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,880
or from when the park opens.

310
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,160
It appears to be a rough estimate from when you pulled it,

311
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,840
because we got called at like nine, nine, nine o'clock.

312
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,480
Yeah. And I was still in line for parking.

313
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,200
Because I was in line for parking for 35 minutes.

314
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh, no. You talked a big game about getting there for breakfast.

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,160
Then you were the last one of all of us.

316
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,680
We were all in the same spot.

317
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,640
We were all like one of us was like you were entering the tramway.

318
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,960
Zach and Nicole had pulled into a parking spot.

319
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
I was still in the. They were ahead of us.

320
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,920
They arrived first and then we were waiting.

321
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,800
And let's you had to like call me because I get so worked up

322
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,160
like getting into play because I'm worried like something's going to go wrong

323
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,280
or they're going to be like, I'm going to get arrested for something.

324
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,760
I don't not arrested, but like I did something wrong.

325
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,040
And then Lizzie, I'd be like, it's fine. It's fine.

326
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,960
Like, what do you what's wrong?

327
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,600
I go, no, it's fine. I'm just waiting for Jason.

328
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
She's like, it's fine.

329
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,760
Because Zach and Nicole had already gone in and done the ride.

330
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,480
So I just oh, you didn't all have to be together.

331
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,200
No, we didn't. We didn't have to be together.

332
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,960
Every every person has a individual QR code.

333
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,120
Yeah. And they are scanning that they are checking and double.

334
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,160
Yeah. OK.

335
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
So Jason shows up.

336
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
I take a little bit of a sigh.

337
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
And then we head in the land.

338
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
We see Zach and Nicole. They just went on.

339
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,120
And then we get in line for web slingers.

340
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,120
A Spider-Man adventure.

341
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
And I to give, you know, Mike some solidarity.

342
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
I was also very stressed because I didn't know.

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,480
You know what to say.

344
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
I didn't understand that.

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
That was like, oh, I think they called us.

346
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
I didn't see that for a few minutes.

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,720
So I'm like hustling through security, hustling through the thing.

348
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,760
And I got like it said, get here by nine thirty nine.

349
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,120
So I think it was an even smaller window than when I did rise.

350
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,320
So when I saw Mike and Lindsay, I felt like it was like five minutes left.

351
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
I felt like Indiana Jones reaching back for his hat.

352
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,360
Or like Jason Sheridan making it into

353
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,600
I make it in the way to get that sun to get that special Sunday.

354
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,040
And then Mike goes like, I think they're doing like a 30 minute buffer.

355
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,840
Like I've seen other people going like, yeah, they're not.

356
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
I think if you're late, oh, the parking was bad.

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,720
And I didn't I didn't I didn't I was like, like, I got to get over there

358
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,480
because I was also trying to be considerate that like Zach and Nicole,

359
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,360
you know, don't go is like it's like, oh, we have to make sure they have a nice day.

360
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,800
Like they're not maybe acts like they don't go for war purposes.

361
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Yeah, go to battle.

362
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,200
This wasn't a work day for them.

363
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,680
This was a fun day. Yeah.

364
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,640
So we went in there and we got right in the line for web slingers.

365
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
And like we're going to talk.

366
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,840
We have to talk a little bit about web slingers. Yeah.

367
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,280
Yeah. No, no, no.

368
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,800
I think anything's on the table.

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,520
I'll get down and do it when things are a little less crazy.

370
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,000
Our episode. Yeah.

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
Crazy rumor.

372
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,440
Maybe this is going to make me sound I saw crazy rumor

373
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,680
that maybe annual passes will be back soon. I don't know.

374
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,200
Yeah, I forget who put you sent me this.

375
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,360
Someone posted a clip of someone talking to like a cast member at the gate.

376
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,080
And he's like, yeah, no.

377
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, sorry. That's your scandal. Legacy Pass.

378
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah, we don't have those right now.

379
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,960
They'll be back in July.

380
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
And when I I had a whole thing where I reactivated my leg,

381
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
my legs passed, it disappeared.

382
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,440
And the woman told me at the ticket booth, she's like,

383
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,480
and that's good until the end of the month, till the end of June.

384
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,000
And I was like, oh, that's weird that they're expiring so quickly. So.

385
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,440
Oh, no, we might just be spreading rumors.

386
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,800
We might be rumor rung.

387
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
We should do more where we go up to just random employees

388
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,160
and shove a microphone in their face and see what things they heard.

389
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,280
Because oftentimes it's just like second hand or like, hey, yeah,

390
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,680
I heard the guy say that I did overhear like some random employee stuff

391
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,000
where it's like, oh, that would have been helpful to know.

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Or like there was some weird.

393
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
The cast members were doing great, by the way.

394
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,400
They were real troopers because some of this stuff was kind of a shit show.

395
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
I was a little exhausted by some of it.

396
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Can I say I know I know that we'll get to that.

397
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Can I say a real thing that happened?

398
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
A funny thing that happened later.

399
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,880
I love when I overhear somebody saying something wrong.

400
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
And I'm sure people listen to this podcast have it happen all the time.

401
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,760
But I heard a guy talking to his family and explaining why Star

402
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Tours wasn't in Galaxy's Edge.

403
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,320
And he goes, yeah, Star Tours not in Galaxy's Edge,

404
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,880
as George Lucas said, he didn't want his ride anywhere near those new shitty ones.

405
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
That's why Star Tours isn't in Galaxy's Edge.

406
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,840
And he kept saying it like definitively.

407
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
And I was like, just what?

408
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,320
True. What is it?

409
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,480
And then you to then like, who is that?

410
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,160
What? Mitch is back in town since when?

411
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,600
One of the wealthy as a family.

412
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
They had a family over the quarantine.

413
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
A quiet quarantine.

414
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,920
One of the wealthiest men in the entertainment industry

415
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,800
and also a pretty reserved man, I feel like in the entertainment industry.

416
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
George, George. Sure.

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,720
But a long falsetto sentence.

418
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,280
You really like it.

419
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Am I wrong?

420
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,480
Like I could be wrong, but like I feel like George Lucas

421
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,560
pretty restraint in his public conduct doesn't mean he

422
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
doesn't say like those motherfuckers ran Kylo.

423
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
He's mad.

424
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,960
He is mad about those movies.

425
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,840
He was on Charlie Rose and he said that was the most like angry he's ever been.

426
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,400
And he was talking about those with what Disney did to the Star Wars movies.

427
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,720
He's like, well, they just want to make a movie about a spaceship and

428
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,000
movies were never really about spaceships.

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
It was more like a family drama.

430
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
And make art films.

431
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
Yeah. Do we get to see him?

432
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,840
No, no, no.

433
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,280
Well, I think he said you you might to Charlie.

434
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,880
He said that I believe I hope not anymore.

435
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, that's a first privilege.

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,160
Charlie Rose lost. Yeah.

437
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,680
He was going weekly to see the weekly new film The Dailies.

438
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,680
Maybe it'll be like maybe there's a safe maybe when George passes.

439
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
Like it's like there's a bunch of J.D.

440
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,040
Salinger books. Oh, you think that are in the same matter?

441
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
Like that might come out.

442
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,680
Maybe, you know, it's possible.

443
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,320
So all right, we're in the queue for for Web's Web Slayers.

444
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,920
And Spider-Man, Spider-Man Adventure, Spider-Man Adventure.

445
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,960
Got to say, pretty much walked on to this brand new track.

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Well, yeah, but that's also the virtual queue and the covid protocols.

447
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,040
The less when we got out, the line actually had gotten much bigger.

448
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,000
So it's the so if you don't know, the premise is like Tony Stark

449
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,680
has given a grant of some kind to give the like youth of the Marvel

450
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,840
universe, like the very smart youth of the Marvel universe.

451
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,640
I don't know, experimental lab to do experiments.

452
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Yeah. And it's all Easter.

453
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,280
There is loaded with Easter eggs.

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,480
It's loaded with fun references, the alter egos of Marvel characters.

455
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,400
Of course, in there, the character from Iron Man 3,

456
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,200
who is like crying at the funeral.

457
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,360
And the little boy from Iron Man 3, Scott, is in this featured in this ride.

458
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Here comes the glaze over.

459
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
It's starting. No.

460
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
OK, I've seen like two or three of them.

461
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,040
Which one? Yeah. Which ones have you seen?

462
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,760
So we know. But maybe it's not two or three.

463
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm I really I feel like I've said this before.

464
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,360
I am not trying to be some cultural snob.

465
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,040
I am not trying to be some cultural snob.

466
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,240
I am not trying to be some cultural snob.

467
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,920
I just don't connect to these movies.

468
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,080
I just don't get it.

469
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,480
I have no in on them.

470
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,640
I don't feel invited in by them and I don't see them.

471
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,280
I'd like to. It seems like everyone's having a lot of fun.

472
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,040
Fun that I'm not having. That's fair.

473
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,440
I think Iron Man 3 is the one Shane Black directed.

474
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,080
And I think that one's pretty self contained.

475
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,640
So I think you could watch that.

476
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
But the whole thing is about his PTSD from the Avengers movie.

477
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Yeah, that's true.

478
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,560
I have PTSD when you say Shane Black, because I was working in an office once

479
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,440
where it was a bunch of like young nerdy guys like myself.

480
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
And except for one cool like I think he was like a made husband

481
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,760
who like was married to an executive and lived on a boat.

482
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,760
And he's this like this like buff, you know, weird dude.

483
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,600
And he just apropos of nothing on a Friday afternoon.

484
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
It's silent. Everybody's working.

485
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,040
He stands up and says, hey, is anybody else going to Shane Black's pool party tonight?

486
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,040
To utter silence.

487
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,120
No one said anything.

488
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,040
No one looked up because no, look at who you're with.

489
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,120
No, we're not going to Shane Black's pool party.

490
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,800
And that's the only association I have with that name.

491
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Look, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the good guys, you know, the great times, you know,

492
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,440
you can do a lot. He's in Predator.

493
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
Shane Black. Yeah. No, is he?

494
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,680
He directed. He's the predator. He's in the suit.

495
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,600
No, he's not in the suit. He's one of the guys.

496
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
One of the guys on the team.

497
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,280
I think he was in the suit, too. He was not in the suit while he was there.

498
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
He figured. Oh, the predator.

499
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,880
OK, the what's interesting, the predator is in Avengers campus.

500
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
He's stalking around. Oh, cool.

501
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,120
Yeah. Now I remember hearing a cast member secretly record saying that.

502
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Yeah, cast members will not tell you what time the predator is at.

503
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,640
Although the predator did serve Jason as French toast.

504
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,280
He was behind the counter.

505
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
That's true. Very overwhelmed.

506
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,040
Very, very overwhelmed.

507
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,200
Jason has the same sort of predator radar vision when it comes to food,

508
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,000
heating of the heating of food, to French, to bread pudding style.

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,320
French toast. Absolutely.

510
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,600
French toast is purple in his vision.

511
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,960
And then if it's more of a sourdough, it's green.

512
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,800
And then if it's wheat or rye, it's more yellow.

513
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Are you crazy? You got to make.

514
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,880
Well, it's not my like, yeah, sourdough or brioche.

515
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,400
Not my bread vision. You're the one who has the bread vision.

516
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Jason's by the bread bug.

517
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Anyway, very funny Easter eggs.

518
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,200
Yes, there are a lot of web slayers.

519
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,320
There's a bunch of peanut lockers that are like one looks like Venom.

520
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,600
One looks like Spider Gwen, Ghost Spider.

521
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
One looks like Miles Morales.

522
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,760
And so the whole premise basically of the of this area of the land is that, OK,

523
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,840
Tony Stark's dad, Howard Stark, he's you know, he was around a lot.

524
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,040
He likes Tony Slattery.

525
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,880
John Slattery, John Slattery, Tony Slattery.

526
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,520
Yes, that's a little I'm so out.

527
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
It's like I know something finally.

528
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,640
And I was wrong. Roger Sterling himself.

529
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
Yes. Great.

530
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,360
So the idea is like this used to be like a old Stark Motors building.

531
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,200
And now they've sort of repurposed it to be this exploration campus area.

532
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,920
Much like in Burbank, the old Lockheed Martin plant is now the Empire

533
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,200
Center shopping center with the target in the Walmart.

534
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,720
It is not getting it.

535
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,280
What a great what a great thing to reference in your theme park.

536
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Yes, very.

537
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Renovation of warehouse.

538
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,640
You know, the Imagineers, they know the score.

539
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
They know the score. They're going to the Empire Center Target.

540
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,960
They're not going to that Clint weird Glendale two story target.

541
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,480
That Glendale targets fun.

542
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,640
I don't know. It's three stories as well.

543
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,520
Oh, it is. Yeah, yeah.

544
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
It's its own thing.

545
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,680
I wanted to be ready for that escalator.

546
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,640
The Shove and Gardeis.

547
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,280
The Lock and Nada target today.

548
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,360
And it was small, but it had everything.

549
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,840
And I was very often do the small ones are good.

550
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah, because I was worried they weren't going to have like a neck,

551
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,400
a collectible section, and they did have one. Wow.

552
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
So really great.

553
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,200
So so, yeah, so the aesthetic is like and I there's, you know,

554
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,960
I like stuff about Avengers campus.

555
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,520
I there was other stuff I could nitpick and we'll get into all of it.

556
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,720
But and this is a joke I saw other people make.

557
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,600
It's not my own joke, but the front of it does look like an old circuit city.

558
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,320
It's a big red like plug.

559
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
Yeah, it looks like plugged in.

560
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,560
And then it's sort of been it's like parts of the building are more like

561
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,640
of that aesthetic and the parts are more like, yeah, an old brick building

562
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,880
that's like Howard Stark or whatever.

563
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Like a Halloween adventure moves in to a circuit city.

564
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, right. Moved in.

565
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,840
Well, it also like as you get a third of the way into the land,

566
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,880
like the old Stark facility starts to fade away.

567
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,600
Like that story gets kind of abandoned kind of.

568
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,040
Right. They don't do that with the whole thing.

569
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,360
I mean, the first part part of it feels like Disney.

570
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,320
Honestly, a lot of a lot of it feels like Disney Springs to me.

571
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,960
I'll be honest.

572
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,760
And like, yeah, pleasant buildings, some like and then obviously the Avengers

573
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,680
headquarters is a different type of building.

574
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,000
But it feels very much like that aesthetic from Disney Springs,

575
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,360
where it's like brick and there's some like little touches and accoutrements.

576
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,120
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,880
Yeah. Fake aging, old fonts.

578
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,120
And in the pit, we took a picture of it.

579
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,160
And there is another fun joke gag.

580
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,320
Yeah. Is that on the side of the building,

581
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,960
there are two trees and regular size trees and then there's a giant tree in the middle.

582
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,520
And if you look over on the bottom, there's a little gamma gamma runoff.

583
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah. Basically like it's the whole tree has been hulky fire holes.

584
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:08,360
Yeah. Basically. So yes, they they I mean, it's really bad for the environment to dump gamma rays

585
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,760
or gamma waste out of these holes into just the dirt.

586
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,040
But that's what they did. And the tree is now giant.

587
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
The tree has been poisoned, essentially.

588
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,680
And it's like a whole tree. It's a whole tree, really.

589
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,600
There's a fun. Oh, there's funny Easter egg, too.

590
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,680
There's a bumper sticker on the one like sign for a pizza place with lucky on it, who is.

591
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,160
Oh, yes. Pizza dog Hawkeyes dog from the

592
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,600
Hawkeye comic book run, which presumably in the TV shows soon, the coming TV show.

593
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,600
This one's fake. No real pizza dog pizza dog with a hit award winning.

594
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,440
I have a toy of pizza.

595
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,840
Pizza dog, beloved character for the last decade.

596
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,400
Yeah. So and he's not been feed yet. He's not been featured yet.

597
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,160
Yeah. Some of this stuff is clearly like arrested development style flash forwards

598
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,960
where it's like this is a reference to a thing you haven't seen yet.

599
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,920
I think there's a little nods to the Loki show, which just aired today.

600
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,960
And I would say I like the Loki.

601
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,560
The Loki show is a bunch of crazy comic book nonsense in it that I think is lacking,

602
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,280
is slowly coming into the Marvel cinematic universe.

603
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,680
And but he is lacking in this land a little.

604
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,720
Well, yes, that's yes, that would be the first thing I would say.

605
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,160
I have not seen the Loki show yet. I'm going to watch it.

606
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,880
I watch all of this stuff. Obviously, I'm a fan of it.

607
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,640
I will say just off the top. OK, of course, my wheelhouse is the 90s comic books,

608
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,280
that aesthetic, you know, like Islands of Adventure.

609
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,960
It's not quite fair to compare them.

610
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,480
It's not completely fair to compare the two rides,

611
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,720
Universal, Orlando, Spider-Man and this one.

612
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,560
But yes, my my preference for these characters and type of stories is colorful nonsense.

613
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,160
It is Batman 66.

614
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,600
The villain has a giant base that is based on whatever dumb gimmick he has.

615
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,080
If it's Clock King, it's that he's tied Batman Robin to the hands of a clock

616
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,040
and his whole layer is this giant clock, like whatever.

617
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,680
So, yes, the bigger the crazier nonsense, which is why I'm such a big fan of Guardians.

618
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,960
It's a big gaudy, colorful villain's band.

619
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,840
He looks silly. He looks very silly.

620
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Cosmo the dog is in there.

621
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,400
Yeah, there's all those fun characters, fun characters inside the queue.

622
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,760
References. But then like there's stuff like Howard Stark's, like,

623
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,960
you know, designs or ads for like the flying, like sleek, like Cadillac cars,

624
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,160
which is a nod to the old like 1960s Nick Fury Agent of Shield comics.

625
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,800
And it's like, why isn't that in all of the movies?

626
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,040
Why isn't Shield flying around and flying cars?

627
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,280
Why is it like SWAT teams?

628
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,120
Why is it our boys in blue and camo?

629
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,040
The famous like the most famous Agents of Shield thing, Scott,

630
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,160
the comic book wise was made by a guy named Jim Steranko.

631
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,840
And now he's a fucking lunatic.

632
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
He's lost his out of his fucking mind.

633
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,000
He's always been a lunatic, but he's really crazy.

634
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,920
I paid him twenty dollars to get a head shot of him, like an old like

635
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,680
because he's a magician to an old like magic magician's head shot of him.

636
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,920
And he really was confused why I wanted that one.

637
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,200
But he also drew like promo art, like early concept art for Indiana Jones.

638
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,880
Oh, wow. Yeah.

639
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:32,360
And his agent is his Nick Fury stuff is very cool and pop art and colorful and like psychedelic too,

640
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,560
where you could see how like, oh, this influenced like just a lot of popular culture of its time.

641
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,400
And he didn't even make that many comics.

642
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,840
That's the other right.

643
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,160
But like, I don't know, some of the fun of Marvel Comics and the comics industry in general

644
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,240
is the insane like contradiction like Marvel.

645
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,360
I think Perlmutter, the guy who owns Marvel, is a real life super villain.

646
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,120
He's a fucking scumbag.

647
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,400
He doesn't technically own it anymore, but he's still like kind of in charge,

648
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,840
even though he's kind of been like pushed to the side by.

649
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,600
Thankfully, sidelined him a little.

650
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,360
Yeah, we've talked a little bit about him before because he has some real

651
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,720
nasty, ugly stories that you can find online about him.

652
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,220
Yeah.

653
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,080
But we won't get into all of the toy biz restructuring of Marvel in the 90s.

654
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,440
Like Scott wishes we were.

655
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,320
Oh, man.

656
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,040
Sorry, Scott.

657
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,960
Good boy, there was the time.

658
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,480
Nope, nope, not happening.

659
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,120
We're not talking about the ride.

660
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,960
So we are a little, yeah, because like Mike said, we were both 90s Marvel kids.

661
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,440
I also very fond of the 2000s era like bankruptcy era Marvel,

662
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,080
where they were taking a lot of risks because like what's the harm this company could go under?

663
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,360
So it's like, yeah, give Grant Morrison the X-Men, give Kevin Smith Daredevil,

664
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,320
like all of these other voices kind of coming in and fiddling around with the character.

665
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,640
That's alias came out in that time, which was made into a Netflix show.

666
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,080
And yeah, and there's some stuff.

667
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah, Jessica Jones.

668
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,080
That's what it was.

669
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

670
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Yeah, they changed it because there was already a TV show called Aliens.

671
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,000
And right now I like there's some current Marvel stuff I like, for example,

672
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,280
the X-Men live on a tropical island that is a mutant and they've declared a mutant state.

673
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,080
The island itself is a guy that itself is alive.

674
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:23,160
Oh, and in the month of June, they're having a big party and I am a gal of the Hellfire Gala.

675
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,920
And I am very excited.

676
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,000
There's so much great nonsense.

677
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,120
And I will say also, I'm an X-Men guy and the X-Men haven't come into this MCU yet.

678
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,800
There's a little X-Men representation of California Adventure right now.

679
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,160
It almost feels like they got my letters and they're making fun of me.

680
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,040
The X-Men, I don't want to be such as the X-Men are the coolest heroes.

681
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,440
In Marvel Universe, they are cool.

683
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,880
I have to.

684
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,320
They just happen to be cool.

685
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,440
Make me not say it.

686
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,800
They're still the coolest and it's like I always, and I've said this before on the show,

687
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,360
as a kid, I liked the Avengers, but the Avengers felt like these are mom and dad's heroes.

688
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,440
These are mom and dad's heroes.

689
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

690
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,440
And I think of movies.

691
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,120
I think the coolest is it's got to be into the Spider-verse.

692
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,400
Oh, well, of recent times for sure.

693
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,560
That feels like very vibrant and cool.

694
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,120
And modern.

695
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,480
Comic booky and risky.

696
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,120
Yeah.

697
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,440
It has its own voice.

698
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,000
Again, I like all the Marvel movies, but there's a sameness to the voice of the movies sometimes.

699
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,560
Some of them are a little bit different than the others, obviously, but there's a tone.

700
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,680
There's a thing they like to do.

701
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,960
They don't go crazy.

702
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,360
But yeah, the Spider-verse is like, oh, this is his own thing.

703
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,920
This is cool.

704
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,320
Anyway, so yeah, the X-Men are not there yet, but yeah, there's some wild nonsense.

705
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,760
And this is what we want more in the land.

706
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,880
And so here, I'll say this before we even, I'm all over the place here.

707
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,360
I think this thing, this Avengers campus and this ride, I think the idea for this

708
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,720
is this is just the little hub that's going to lead you to way more nonsense, I think.

709
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,880
And it's hard to kind of weigh it and judge it because I know people are really hating on it.

710
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,480
And they can't tell you exactly what's coming and what they have planned.

711
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:23,080
But I feel like it's almost as if they opened up Main Street and the hub and a little ride

712
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,840
and we're like, here you go.

713
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,920
And I get why people might go, well, wait a minute.

714
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,800
It's not bad.

715
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,760
I like this, but I'm here to see everything.

716
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,520
You're leaving out big stuff that hopefully, fingers crossed, is still coming.

717
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,920
The E-ticket, they're not even necessarily talking about a time frame still for when

718
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,120
that big Avengers ride is coming or even alluding to the fact that, which is what I think,

719
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,280
is that they'll probably go around and get rid of Monsters Inc and all that Hollywood stuff.

720
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,680
I think what would make sense to me is start filling in a high rise skyline back there.

721
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,320
Yeah, because the Marvel Universe, to me, if you say the Marvel Universe, it's New York City.

722
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,160
It goes to space.

723
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,520
The X-Men are outside in West Cheshire County and there's any number of international heroes.

724
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,320
But Marvel, the creators, publishing was all in New York City.

725
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,520
It was set in New York City.

726
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,160
It's what set it apart from DC Comics, which is Metropolis, Gotham, fictional cities.

727
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,480
New York City is a big part.

728
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,920
It's almost a character in itself.

729
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,600
But because it's in California Adventure, they're really trying hard.

730
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,200
This is a California tech campus, Avengers campus.

731
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,880
This campus thing also ties into the international thing because it's in Hong Kong and it's in Europe.

732
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,240
They're all supposed to be a little different.

733
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,440
It's not like Galaxy's Edge.

734
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,960
It's all a bunch of outposts of this organization.

735
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,440
Yes.

736
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,280
So I think the idea would eventually be have more of this stuff around it.

737
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,440
So I'm trying to give them some credit here because they were obviously given this tiny

738
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,280
piece of land and they needed to get stuff in here in a relatively fast time.

739
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,640
And there was space limitations and I'm sure budget limitations on

740
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,520
Ride.

741
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,000
But as Tony Baxter says about the opening of Tomorrowland in 98,

742
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,320
the audience doesn't necessarily know what your budget was.

743
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,800
They don't care.

744
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,600
And there is some other stuff that when I was in college, they called it bad production sense.

745
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:37,800
Of like, well, that why can I not hear this person talking, but I can hear the music

746
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,320
and why is it the same three songs on a loop?

747
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, that's yeah, we'll go back to the ride.

748
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,680
So we'll go back to right now.

749
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,800
You brought that up.

750
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,360
They play the Avengers score, which I honestly have come to like a lot more

751
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,280
hearing it over and over again in the land.

752
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,720
I think it's Alan Silvestri who did Back to the Future.

753
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,120
He's done a lot of great things,

754
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,560
but it's a very specific tone.

755
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
It's like very like, yeah, here we go.

756
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,240
We're rising to the occasion.

757
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,800
But like when you're sitting out at a beer garden drinking a beer float,

758
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,840
you don't necessarily need that tone for two hours straight.

759
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,240
Yeah, it's like if you went to Galaxy's Edge and they played theme from Star Wars and then

760
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,920
Duel of the Fates and then theme from Star Wars and then Duel of the Fates.

761
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,440
Lindsay and I both, I think, had the same reaction of like,

762
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,280
this music is stressing me out.

763
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,080
This is like, this is like a Psy Ops where like they blast,

764
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,520
like someone has taken hostages and they're blasting music at them.

765
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,680
Like there's enough like play like back in black by like,

766
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,600
because that's that they play that in Iron Man.

767
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,360
Like, yeah, like I understand, like there's a lot of different like superhero.

768
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,360
So many scores across all these.

769
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah, like 35 movies.

770
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,800
The Black Panther soundtrack has all these bangers by these huge artists that you could easily.

771
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,000
It's supposed to be an open house.

772
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,600
It's like a party almost.

773
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,000
And Guardians does play like diegetic music that makes sense, you know,

774
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,960
spacey music and then the classic rock from the movies.

775
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,000
The music in the queue.

776
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I never, I hadn't gotten like stuck in the queue.

777
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,680
I've kind of always like maxed past it and I was out there the whole time.

778
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,240
Dude, the COVID lines and cool music that that cues.

779
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,120
The Guardians queue.

780
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,920
Yeah, it's fantastic.

781
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,960
There's a there's one line.

782
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,000
I think I said this like when we first went maybe on the show,

783
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,440
like there's some Easter egg for some Disneyland stuff.

784
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah, music that they've like, like turned up.

785
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,360
I don't know, the base or trouble or turned off or something.

786
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,160
And like he's like collecting because he collects, you know,

787
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,080
Tanelier Tavon, the collector collects.

788
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,000
So he's like playing some like really like faded old Disneyland,

789
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,080
like loop music in the queue at a certain point.

790
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,760
But that's all well done.

791
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,120
There's so much stuff.

792
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,560
And, you know, I also feel like I never get the same part of that queue loop.

793
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,400
So I yeah, I'm assuming they'll eventually maybe give you some more variation in

794
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,040
Avengers campus as far as you're the tone.

795
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,120
Sure.

796
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,440
Like you're not always rising to the occasion.

797
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,360
Sometimes you're just eating.

798
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,920
Chilling out.

799
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,080
Because then I will say this, I like it's going to be a nice little area to drink by the Pym

800
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,400
test kitchen, you know, at night or something like we got to order this thing.

801
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
We've been stuck in the queue for I know we're back to this.

802
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
So we'll finish it.

803
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,880
We'll go back to spider web.

804
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:22,840
Yeah.

805
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,480
So the actual ride I think is fun.

806
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,360
I had a good time.

807
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
I think the yeah.

808
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,800
So you so yeah, if you don't know.

809
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,120
No, that wasn't definitive.

810
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,960
Well, here's here's what I was thinking about it.

811
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,800
OK, so you get in these like little cars and it's a 3D ride where you're shooting webs.

812
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,840
Basically, spoiler alert, the actual Tom Holland, they got Tom Holland to do the pre

813
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,040
show, which is fun.

814
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,320
Cherry himself.

815
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,960
Cherry himself.

816
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,360
Cherry is there.

817
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,520
He announces himself as cherry cherry.

818
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,840
And he's got there's a bunch of spider bots he's created and for some reason they self

819
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,320
replicate, which seems I don't know what that technology is, but they have technology that

820
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,440
robots can self replicate, which seems real dangerous.

821
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,520
And it happens they get out of control and he basically said he doesn't want to look

822
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,440
like a fool in front of the Avengers.

823
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,960
So he says we have to go help.

824
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,200
So we get in these vehicles and put our 3D glasses on and then we have to basically shoot

825
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,920
webs at just an onslaught of of little spider bots.

826
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,720
Onslaught of villain is not in the villain.

827
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,320
The onslaught is what happens when Professor X tried to white Magneto's mind during the fatal

828
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,480
attraction storyline and they created this kind of monster, ethereal creature who eventually

829
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,080
Avengers sacrificed themselves and got sent to a pocket dimension to defeat.

830
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,800
Yeah, heroes.

831
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
It was called Heroes Reborn.

832
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,200
Yes.

833
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Is that real or fake?

834
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,600
I think it's too specific to be fake.

835
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,000
It's real.

836
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,600
It was a way to get some of the founders of Image Comics to come back and do some

837
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,800
characters.

838
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
Jim Lee, Rob Liefeld, of course.

839
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,240
They didn't really all finish their books, but it only lasted a year.

840
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,680
You both could have the no prep podcast.

841
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,480
Just record a whole season of a Marvel podcast where you just start at 8 a.m.

842
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,640
and end at 10 p.m. and then you just release that in two hour chunks.

843
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,600
You wouldn't need a break.

844
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,240
I would be able to speak that disgusted at some point, but I haven't quite found the angle.

845
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,720
It's still possible.

846
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:27,960
Yeah.

847
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,360
Yeah.

848
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:28,440
Yeah.

849
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,720
Okay.

850
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,440
So yeah.

851
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,400
So basically it's like three major screens, really.

852
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,800
It's like three or maybe four.

853
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,600
I forget, actually.

854
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,280
This is all now it's in the building where it's tough to be above.

855
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,680
Yes.

856
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,720
So that was a very small footprint for a ride.

857
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,480
So they didn't even put up a new structure.

858
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,640
Yeah.

859
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,320
I don't know if they extended the building at all, but yeah, it's basically the same

860
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,160
structure from what I understand.

861
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,640
And the idea is that now you sort of have spider powers and you're shooting webs at

862
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,400
little robots coming at you.

863
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,880
Yeah.

864
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,520
And I didn't realize this until later.

865
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,800
They kind of don't.

866
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
There's signs instructing you as you're walking up.

867
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,360
But again, we were walking by everything kind of quick.

868
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,400
The pre-show sets up the story pretty well, but the mechanics of the web slinging,

869
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,920
you can apparently sling and then pull levers or pull boxes.

870
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,160
Okay.

871
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,600
So this is what I was wondering, because the problem is I only went on this once.

872
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,280
And I was just saying, man, it would be great if you, because basically all I thought

873
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,000
I was able to do was like shoot little bursts of webbing.

874
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,640
And I'm like, yeah, Spider-Man does that.

875
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,040
But what I want to do is pull, like shoot my web, pull an object and have it fly or whatever.

876
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,360
Yeah.

877
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,320
It is also kind of missing like web slinging to me always meant like flying through the city.

878
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,480
This is the thing, because like they're very, very focused on you become the hero.

879
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,600
You're here to learn.

880
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,080
This is college and you're learning.

881
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,120
And I think they're a little too focused on that.

882
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,240
Unless you're truly like doing some sort of like definitive transformative experience,

883
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,040
which is what you're saying.

884
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,400
Like the thing you always want to do with Spider-Man, I was never like, man,

885
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,640
I got to like shoot my webs like they're bullets.

886
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,120
That was never what I wanted to do as a kid.

887
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,600
I wanted to swing like that's the Spider-Man thing you want to do.

888
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,160
You do get to do on the islands of adventure one.

889
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,720
Which I do more of for sure.

890
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,000
And in that leaked pat, not leaked, but that patent that Disney made of that probably

891
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,800
Spider-Man ride.

892
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,280
You see it certainly seem like you get to do that.

893
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,360
I'm sidetracking because there was that patent that came out a couple years ago

894
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,320
that made it seem like they were developing a ride that you would get in like a row of people

895
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,520
and swing from the ceiling in front of like practical building sets.

896
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,520
Which sounds amazing.

897
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,080
Way better.

898
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,960
But obviously that's a budget and time thing or a budget time and space thing.

899
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,560
So maybe this will do that.

900
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,880
Something for the web slingers ride that we did, we both agreed we liked

901
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,520
is that in the ride you go through the other parts of Avengers camp.

902
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes.

903
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,240
So one of the one of the level like levels in the ride was the collector's building.

904
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,080
So all of a sudden you're inside the Guardians ride and you're shooting at the bugs,

905
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,040
which is really cool.

906
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,280
And there's little like secrets or whatever.

907
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,480
Oh, I like that.

908
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,560
And then yeah, the last scene is you're on top of the Avengers headquarters.

909
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,600
OK, which is that what like the other main structure that might lead into an attraction.

910
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,840
Right.

911
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,400
Possibly.

912
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,240
So I liked all that stuff a lot.

913
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,040
I guess I just really like when you compare it to something, another 3D ride like Toy Story,

914
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,040
I feel like you don't have like the time with it.

915
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,840
Like there's a feeling of like chaos because truly it's just like robots coming at you and

916
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,920
you're shooting things so fast versus like Toy Story, even though like there's a quality,

917
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,600
like there's a crazy quality to it.

918
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,880
For some reason, I can remember the levels of Toy Story and I feel like

919
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,360
I feel like there's not so much chaos.

920
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,480
Maybe it's because I've done it a lot.

921
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,600
Well, you stop your park and you while you do park in these two, you're parked basically.

922
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,000
But the the like levels are like much more manic feeling to me.

923
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,680
They're manic and I kind of like that.

924
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,640
I wouldn't say the ride.

925
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,600
It feels short.

926
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,080
It feels like an appropriate length.

927
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,560
Sure.

928
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:15,960
But I know Toy Story does feel like twice as long, even if it's probably about the same length.

929
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,200
Yeah.

930
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,040
I think it might be longer, but yeah.

931
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,320
So it's like you get a little more like I think there's just there's a lot of these,

932
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,680
you know, they want to be more interactive, but it's like and same with like Millennium Falcon,

933
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,440
but it's like I think we don't need too much of this.

934
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Like we just we want to sit and enjoy more than we need to be flailing our arms at an image.

935
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,160
It just feels just my first time going on it.

936
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,800
I was like a little overwhelmed as opposed to being like, wow, isn't this so cool?

937
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,640
Because there was elements that like I was intellectually saying, oh, that is very nice.

938
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,760
But I wasn't like, oh, wow, I'm I'm doing it.

939
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,520
I'm shooting my webs like bullets.

940
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,200
Like that's just what I've always wanted to do.

941
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,080
You get used to learning it and everything.

942
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,760
And that's that's a little exhausting.

943
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,400
So I'm sure by the time I do it a few more times, I'll at least I'm sure I'll have more

944
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,280
fun playing the game.

945
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,200
But I definitely want to dedicate more time, write it a few more times and then do a full

946
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,400
episode about it because there's there is there was a lot of stuff I liked,

947
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,400
but it was yeah, it was so manic and we went through it once.

948
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,520
And I'll admit, I tried to pull a noon reservation, too, because sometimes the app breaks and

949
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,120
lets you do stuff like that.

950
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,680
Like later when I went to the legacy pass holder, Al Fresco tasting terrace,

951
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,480
Oh, man was behind a group where the lady said I made a reservation online and they said,

952
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,160
oh, are you a legacy pass holder?

953
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,720
And they went, no, but it let me make a reservation.

954
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,040
They're like, oh, we got to look into this.

955
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,960
And I think they were just like, yeah, there's not that many people up there.

956
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,600
Yeah, let them up.

957
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,560
So that's probably a better spirit.

958
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,240
That place used to be for everyone.

959
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,440
There were no rules.

960
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,320
And then Jason went right to City Hall and complained.

961
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,760
He said, that's for me.

962
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,080
That place is for me, a legacy pass holder.

963
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,920
But you know, like little little things like that slip through the cracks sometimes.

964
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,480
So I sure.

965
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,440
So you tried to slip.

966
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,840
So I tried to do it because I only had a one day one park ticket and you were holding a

967
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,320
rise.

968
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,520
So you were going to hop.

969
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,040
So I was like, well, I'm going to stay here.

970
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,880
And I stayed in the land the longest.

971
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,120
Yes, you were you were staying.

972
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,960
I was in the land for three hours.

973
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,480
That may have been my error error because by the end I was like, I have to get away

974
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,360
from this music.

975
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,520
I just would be too much.

976
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,560
We would be in Disneyland.

977
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,360
We would be like sitting out by the lake or the river or whatever.

978
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,200
And we're like, I wonder what Jason's doing now.

979
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,480
Oh, I'll tell you about it when we wrap it up.

980
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,160
I'll walk you through what I did.

981
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,920
So so, yeah, so Spider-Man, it was like it was over before I knew it.

982
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,640
And I also think the script was like too tall for the computer to read me.

983
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,400
I feel like the computer was not quite noticing, like where my arms were.

984
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,480
So we got done with it and it was like, OK, yeah, sure, sure.

985
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,640
And I know people are like, I've seen the discourse of like, why would Disney open

986
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:11,160
a ride that's so similar to the other the Orlando ride, like a 3D ride with Spider-Man

987
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,280
with no villains?

988
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah, that was a big criticism I saw that I did have to agree with where Spider-Man

989
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,480
has this like Batman, both have these great rogues gallery galleries and you didn't

990
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,480
have anyone you didn't have like, you know, Vulture or Doc Ock or, you know, even yeah,

991
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,960
Vulture was in the first Tom Holland one.

992
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,000
Dr. Frameworth.

993
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,360
Yeah.

994
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,160
Spider-Man villain.

995
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,280
Fake, fake, got it.

996
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,040
That was the add to tell.

997
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,760
I also was just looking around the room.

998
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,480
Looking around the room.

999
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:43,960
Frames.

1000
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,120
Damn it.

1001
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,760
And it requires worth to have frames.

1002
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,280
So you can mine those words.

1003
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:57,320
This, the Smuggler's Run does not have villains.

1004
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,880
Also, it's about crates and elements.

1005
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,480
And this doesn't, it's about learning and training in a facility.

1006
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,880
Maybe this is a whole thing.

1007
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,400
There's, I guess there's no, you know, Star Tours has a lot of villains.

1008
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,200
It didn't really the first time, but there is the Death Star.

1009
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,600
There's the feeling of, I think maybe this is a thing they keep going wrong with.

1010
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,800
There's a new, there's a newer, I don't know what it is.

1011
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,640
I wonder if I, I'm sure if, you know, we had like a real inside, like a imagineering source,

1012
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,280
they could tell us maybe if there's some sort of edict or something.

1013
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,240
Cause I do feel similar things to this and Galaxy's Edge where I go, I don't know.

1014
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,560
It feels like sometimes there's an overthink maybe.

1015
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,000
Like, yeah, I don't know why there's not just one bad guy that broke in and made

1016
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,720
the spider bots crazy, like made them wild.

1017
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:48,040
And then I don't know if it's like, cause well, this could be like, well, Sony technically has

1018
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,920
the rights to Spider-Man and they won't let us, we don't want to use Michael Keaton in this ride

1019
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,600
cause he's the vulture in the first Spider-Man.

1020
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,000
And we don't want to use Jake Gyllenhaal because he's like, I don't know what like hoops they feel

1021
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,440
like they have to jump through.

1022
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,320
Just put a, or use a new like, or use a, like a villain that they're never going to use

1023
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,880
in one of these movies or what like.

1024
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,320
Yeah. I mean, that could be it. And not a lot of the actors otherwise,

1025
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,200
besides Tom Holland represented some dialogue.

1026
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,280
Yeah. Like a lot of voices.

1027
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,640
Some we were like, is this an impersonator?

1028
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,080
Well, a couple of them came to the opening ceremony.

1029
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,720
Well, of course.

1030
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,880
Rudd, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie.

1031
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,280
Yes, indeed. What I was wondering is,

1032
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,320
is Paul Rudd probably not used to being not the most handsome man on a stage,

1033
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,360
but when he's up there with Josh Demaro, president of parks in general, right?

1034
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,640
Do I have this right? Finally.

1035
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,800
Not Disneyland.

1036
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,480
Yes. Yes. Overall, probably intended. I bet he was back there like,

1037
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,280
I can't go out there. I can't go out there. I'm Paul Rudd. I gotta be number one.

1038
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,640
Sure. Anthony Mackie. Anthony Mackie. Great. Good looking guy.

1039
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,560
Yeah. Yeah. But both of them put to shame.

1040
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,720
By Josh Day.

1041
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,800
Yeah. I mean, every Hollywood casting director probably looked at that stage and said,

1042
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,240
what are we doing here?

1043
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,480
And putting the wrong people in things.

1044
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,160
We let this guy get through the slips of the cracks and he's an executive.

1045
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,680
He's not in front of the camera.

1046
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,520
Kevin Feige was there too. And I think Feige probably also had the thought of,

1047
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,120
let's make him like, let's make him Dr. Frameworth in the Spider-Man movie.

1048
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,480
Let's do something with him. Fake. Yes. Still fake.

1049
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,240
Still fake. True or false?

1050
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,400
Kevin Feige shows up in the new issue of X-Men.

1051
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,440
Just him in it? I don't know. That sounds awful enough that yes.

1052
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,280
That is a true thing.

1053
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,720
Wow. I don't look, it seems like he's doing a good job, but there's nothing interesting about him.

1054
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,480
When he talks somewhere like at the ceremony, that is not interesting.

1055
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,040
This ceremony was very boring to me.

1056
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,720
He's not there. And I think it's a gag because it's like, oh, everyone's here.

1057
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,320
Dignitaries and the Fantastic Four and the Avenger, everyone's here.

1058
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,960
But it's got a soon on with the baseball cap. It's him.

1059
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,920
I want Kevin. He needs to do the show. I know he's a big theme park guy.

1060
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,160
So let's bring him on. Okay.

1061
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm sure he can't do it. I'll take it back.

1062
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,760
Yeah. Take it back. John Favreau, Happy Hogan.

1063
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,280
His character's name is Happy Hogan in the movies.

1064
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,560
Not a lot of Happy Hogan.

1065
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,360
Happy Hogan featured very heavily in the new Spider-Man movies.

1066
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,400
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I always liked Happy Hogan.

1067
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,840
Interesting Punisher representation in the land, by which I mean I saw a guy with a Punisher

1068
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,040
tattoo on his leg and I made sure not to tread on him, which is what his other tattoo said.

1069
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,960
And yeah, his mask was below his nose for sure.

1070
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,520
That's right. It's how patriots wear them.

1071
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,200
Yeah. Stupidly.

1072
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,920
The Punisher is a character.

1073
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah. That's for sure.

1074
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,040
That was a joke. Yeah. There's no other Punisher. It was just a guy.

1075
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,160
My thing with this ceremony maybe ties into some of what you didn't like about the attraction.

1076
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,840
What's making me nervous and not going to like this place more is that there is just a lot of

1077
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,480
we wanted to create a place where you could unlock the hero within.

1078
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,240
Tap into your own hero potential and unlock. And I'm like, this is all word soup, nothing.

1079
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,280
This is like these are words designed to be translated into 100 languages and still not

1080
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,320
really mean anything. Like how can it have almost no meaning to where does the non thought can just

1081
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:42,840
shift to do as many places as it can? I think that I think they got that with the actual

1082
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,520
walk around characters. I saw kids excited to see like Captain Marvel and Black Panther and Iron

1083
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:55,320
Man and the door and Milaje. People were excited to see that people checked out to

1084
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,440
in like Marvel clothes, like t-shirts and jackets and stuff.

1085
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,240
Yeah. But I mean, I think we've talked about this before the over like kind of like

1086
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:11,880
relying on you're the hero you're becoming. And it's like that's always been part of the theme park

1087
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,920
experience is like you're along for the adventure. You're going to help.

1088
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,320
Like the original Spider-Man at Universal was like, you're now on the adventure and you help

1089
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,600
and transformers even more so you're in evac and now evac and this car full of humans,

1090
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,360
they rise up and they take out the, they take out Megatron or whatever.

1091
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,880
We're proud of you. You did it. You Michael, you, I love you. I'm Optimus Prime.

1092
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,800
Big deep breath. Your bravery, your bravery earned you this kiss.

1093
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,360
Michael. Another thing.

1094
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:57,240
Somebody give me a Peter Cullen cameo where he says that to me. Does he do that? He's got to do that.

1095
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:04,200
Another thing that is in both the islands of an adventure Marvel and the California Adventure

1096
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,680
Marvel is the presence of superheroes on like extreme vehicle on like trucks and sports

1097
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:17,000
utility vehicles. Cause that, that weird like truck, like characters are standing on that

1098
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,920
truck that they had driving around like California Adventure for the summer of heroes

1099
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,320
a promotion. And that trucks just parked there. That's where I got the picture of like,

1100
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,600
look, it's Loki on his famous car. And it's just like, why is the God of Mischief standing

1101
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:37,560
in the bed of a truck? It's like a really low budget per, this is a local parade. It was like

1102
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:45,000
a Chatsworth parade. I marched in as a boy scout. It's not as it's, it's still not as funny as like

1103
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,760
the X-Men showing up on ATVs and islands of adventure. Well, that's what I'm referring.

1104
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,880
I know their vehicle. I'm saying it's just not as funny. It's not as funny, but it's not as funny

1105
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,360
as all of a sudden you're like, why is Cyclops on like a vehicle? You would see like people in Tampa

1106
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,640
driving on the beach. Like, well, I mean, I guess we're not asking for the locals. That's to relate

1107
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:09,240
to the locals. Cause I know the X-Men have a cool vehicle. There's a black, the black bird is their

1108
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,880
jet. And that's true. They decided to come here. And, and in the, in the 70 in the Phoenix saga or

1109
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,080
the dark Phoenix saga, Cyclops is driving a very big car, like a Rolls Royce or a Maybach. And it's

1110
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,280
like, we have to drive into the city and they're driving this insane chauffeur car. In the first,

1111
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,640
is the first X-Men movie, Wolverine borrows his bike, his motorcycle. That's right. Yeah. So that

1112
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:37,320
the Fox, of course the Fox produced X-Men movies. So there's a lot of, you have funny vehicles.

1113
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,280
And did we get, oh yeah. Real quick with web web slingers, the Spiderman adventure.

1114
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:49,560
There was a lot of discourse around the additional items you could buy to upgrade your experience on

1115
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:57,400
the ride. I saw people had them. I did not see anyone in line with them. Yeah. And I, we didn't

1116
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,960
buy them. I'm tempted to do it because I, people, it's funny cause online people are like, oh,

1117
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,200
Disney and their commercialism. And you're like, yeah, yeah. Yes. Have you, have you been not

1118
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,160
paying attention for a century? It's like, well, pain DLS, like real, like a live, live DLC,

1119
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,120
essentially. And you're like, yeah, but I don't know. This is the one of the least egregious

1120
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:27,640
things to me that Disney like jacking the price up crazy over a decade and like icing out like,

1121
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:33,560
you know, people like, uh, middle-class families. Like that's worse than like paying $30 to get

1122
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,760
like Iron Man's gauntlet. I don't know. That's cool to me. Or, uh, and I said this to Jason,

1123
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:45,000
I was like, if they sold like Cyclops's visor, we'd be climbing over each other wearing the

1124
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,480
visor right now to like, we would be doing old podcasts, wearing this visor, his famous, uh,

1125
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,760
visor to keep his optic blasts from destroying everything around him. Well, I like visors,

1126
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,720
so I'd probably do it too. Sure. Um, so I don't know. I kind of think that's cool, honestly.

1127
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,640
Um, cause if I was a kid, I would be like, oh, I can buy the thing that my hero has and I can take

1128
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,120
it home and then I can bring it back to the park. And like, that gives me a special power. That

1129
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,800
actually is a cool idea to me. It's like Harry Potter and the Wands and sure.

1130
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,960
These things happen over and over again. That's, this is a, like agree or disagree with, uh,

1131
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,240
theme park, Twitter discourse. It is full of, do you not remember that this happened? Yeah.

1132
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,360
Six months ago, whatever. Two years ago, whatever. 10 years ago, whatever. 50 years ago. Yeah. Yeah.

1133
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:39,080
But I'm mad now. I need a post now. I'm going to, I'm going to roll this into a discussion

1134
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,720
about the merchandise in the land. Okay. There's only two outlets in the land and they're pretty

1135
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:49,480
small. It's web suppliers, which is across from web slingers, the spider man adventure, and then,

1136
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,120
um, Avenger, uh, campus supply pod. But Scott, if you look at that recruits guide that I handed you,

1137
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:04,040
you'll notice that it says outside the land, uh, backlot shop stage 17. This is a massive big box

1138
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:10,360
store size Marvel clearing house. And I walked by a cast. It's a Costco. You need a membership.

1139
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,000
It's a Costco base. Wait, this is the thing. This is the thing that the place that depressed me

1140
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,640
during their holiday. Yeah. It's, it's, I, I think it's, it's awesome. Cause it's got, uh, uh,

1141
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,880
movie Marvel stuff. It's got theme park, Marvel stuff, and it's got comic book Marvel stuff.

1142
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,440
And I walked by a cast member going like, yeah, anything that's for sale in the land is for sale

1143
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:35,240
in here. And I don't know why they're not telling people that enough because it's huge. And there's

1144
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:42,200
so much stuff. And this is where I saw the X-Men represented in the form of $600 statues of gambit,

1145
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,840
Colossus and Cyclops. And even though, even though I had my fixed legacy pass holder discount, I was

1146
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:56,840
like, if I buy a, a $600 statue of Cyclops, I, I, there's no coming back from that. Like first off,

1147
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:03,240
either there's either no coming back from that. Um, my girlfriend would probably throw it at me

1148
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:10,200
like, what are you doing? And also I know as a regular comic book store patron, there's plenty

1149
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:17,160
good, like $50 Cyclops statues I could get, but I was like, Oh man, that does look cool, but I just

1150
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:23,480
cannot do this. Well, we'll talk after I, well, we'll talk after. Oh, okay. No, that sounds like

1151
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,640
I'm going to steal it. I'm not going to steal it. Just saying this. You're like the collector.

1152
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,880
I'm, I am. I relate to Tanelier. He's the, you don't, he's not a villain to you. No, Tanelier and I

1153
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,440
are the same. Yeah. Tanelier and I were the same. Uh, so I did not make it in this big warehouse.

1154
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,880
I didn't actually even realize it was there. I just went in the tiny version and there's not a

1155
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,880
ton in there. There's some like cool little chemistry set kind of thing that I probably

1156
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,880
would have liked as a kid. And they're selling a lot of these spider bots. And I will say

1157
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,680
the premise of the ride that the spider bots are out of control, there are spider bots all over the

1158
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,000
land, which is fun. There's like, you know, they're caught in a web and they're like buzzing over the

1159
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,280
bathrooms. Um, and there's like, you know, they're, they're keeping that fun narrative going. And

1160
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:13,800
what's the, uh, the goo there's, uh, before all this open, when I went on guardians is goo on the

1161
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,920
ground. Oh, what's with the goo? Oh, the goo. I got it. Yeah. Let's talk about the goo. I saw people

1162
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,960
online referring to it as Kirby crackle, which is a comic book term that refers to Jack Kirby.

1163
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,680
When he would draw like something pulsing with energy, it was like a colored energy surrounded

1164
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:34,280
by black dots to denote like it's powerful and it's very pop party. It's a big part of like

1165
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,680
sixties Marvel. This did not look like Kirby crackle to me. It just looked kind of like generic

1166
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:44,040
space goo or geodes and it is colorful and I do like it, but I'm like, that's not Kirby crackle.

1167
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,840
It's not authentic Kirby crackle. If it was the building, it would be like scattered about the

1168
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,160
building or the building would be pulsing with it, which I think they should do with projection

1169
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,800
effects. But what are they, they can't be Kirby crackle in the world of the, of the attraction

1170
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,200
of the land. What is it like meant to be? Well, oh, from a narrative standpoint, I believe Joe

1171
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,640
roadie mentioned this before he left, uh, well it was before he left for space where he actually

1172
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:15,080
went to space. Uh, it was the idea, the narrative reason that that guardians like spaceship building

1173
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,360
museum, whatever like combination of it is the idea is that it's just now all of a sudden come

1174
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,520
out and appeared on the plate. Like all of a sudden it came and like planted itself.

1175
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:30,840
And I think that's like the energy signature or like it's, it's left like some, you know,

1176
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,600
transport goo or whatever. Was it always there? I thought it was new or no, it is new. It is new.

1177
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:43,080
It used to be that big Avengers like a lock kind of vault thing. And now it's open. They open it up,

1178
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:48,120
you know? Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So the goo is new. The goo is new. It was loose.

1179
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,480
What was that episode? Why are we talking about goop punch? I think, was that a Patreon maybe?

1180
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,160
That was Nickelodeon. We were talking about the first one. We talked to my brother and me, which

1181
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:08,040
we had those in fake doc browns. Yeah. Yeah. And then then the Patreon, we, we watched the famous

1182
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,000
episode about where goo fantasizes about having his own punch, his own brand of punch on my brother

1183
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
and me. That made me laugh so much. It's so good. If you haven't seen it, just Google goo punch.

1184
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,160
And go to the Patreon obviously to hear our thoughts about goo punch. Yes, that too. Yes, that too.

1185
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:30,200
Did you get to try any goo punch at the Fimtesk Kitchen? Oh yeah. Let's talk food. Is goo part of

1186
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,280
the? That's fake. Goo, the character from my brother and me is not in the Marvel universe.

1187
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:42,920
Goo is not in, but goop. Goom? Goop. Goop is. And yeah. No, doop. Doop.

1188
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,240
Goom I think is one of Jack Kirby's old monster. Yes. Or a, a Dicko monster. I don't know. I

1189
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,800
forget. There's references in the web slingers. We'll save more web slinger stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

1190
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,720
That's fine. We'll do it. We'll come back around once we can ride it a few times, but it's fun.

1191
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:04,840
Check it out. So food. Okay. We got breakfast. This was at Fimtesk Kitchen. And this is a lot,

1192
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:10,440
you know, COVID protocols. It's all mobile order basically. But there are standby lines. Yeah.

1193
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,440
There are standby lines for the Pym test testing lab. Okay. The Pym testing lab is the bar. The

1194
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,760
test kitchen is the restaurant. Oh God. There's one of these. There's two testing labs. Yeah.

1195
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,360
They're connected. They're connected. Okay. Separate app. It's separate app ordering. And I

1196
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,600
asked someone who was there opening day, like, can you just walk up and pay it or register? And

1197
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,840
they went, it was unclear. And I was like, Oh, you never want to hear that. That's never the

1198
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,360
answer you want. But we could tell at least the day we were there, one line was mobile or pick up.

1199
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:50,440
One line was, you know, stand, just walk up and order food. So that was pretty clear. Yes. So,

1200
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,800
but we, we, we weren't sure we were, we walked on guardians. That was nice. Yeah, it was great. And

1201
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:02,040
of course rocket is not so Zach and Nicole, um, they have not been on guardians before, but rocket,

1202
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:07,000
of course, is not work. Like they're not right. So we had to do the whole show for him. Oh, well,

1203
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:17,320
that's, there's a QR code. You can scan in there and scan. My hands don't scan the code.

1204
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:23,560
Oh, you're about my hand scans, scan the QR code. That's going to launch the Disneyland app. And

1205
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:28,840
then it's like, you're doing a messaging DMS back and forth with rocket. And he explains about the

1206
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,520
gantry lift in your hand scanning. It was actually a pretty cute little,

1207
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,760
Hey, if you wanted to play Disney app, you can play as well as enjoy. There's two different apps.

1208
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:44,280
Okay. There's two different apps. Play Disney and then mobile order at Pym test kitchen, not the

1209
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:52,360
testing labs. That's two different paradise gardens. Park is different than Pixar pier,

1210
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,200
which is different than paradise pier hotel gantry lift.

1211
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:04,040
Um, it, it, yeah. So it, oh, and also if you click on the mobile order, if you click on it on the map

1212
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:11,160
in the app, it does have two arrows pointing at the, the test kitchen and the testing lab.

1213
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,840
It's, it's a little, it's yeah, it is a little crazy, but we were like, we gotta try and find

1214
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,960
slots. We are at opening day slots ran out in the morning for the whole day. And we're like,

1215
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,800
well, we want to eat something like we were all pretty hungry. And then in the line for guardians,

1216
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,760
we just refresh, refresh and slots started appearing. Yeah. So I checked, I was checking

1217
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,520
in line. I just started ordering things. Yeah. We just got one of a few things and then I was

1218
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,680
checking and I was like, guys, I got a slot for drinks. Everyone put your drink quarter in.

1219
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:49,960
It's 11, it's 11 a.m. Oh yeah. That's so, hey, Monday morning, 11 a.m. Let's drink. Love it.

1220
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:57,640
Galaxy's edge drinking that blue wine at 8 50 a.m. The earliest I have ever drank. And hopefully

1221
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:05,080
that stat continues. Hopefully I do not upslide to first thing when I wake up. We'll see. Cause

1222
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,840
in our experience, Pym particles are sugar contents with what we ended up eating. Oh,

1223
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:16,040
yeah. Good way to start the day. Get that energy. Wait, okay. So whatever, what would you get to

1224
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,680
have a Pym test kitchen featuring impossible or Pym testing labs? Well, we'll get to the

1225
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:28,200
impossibles. Well, so I had the ever expanding Cine Pym toast, which is a long like cartoony

1226
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:36,920
strip of like a kind of French toast, kind of bread pudding with two or three strips of bacon,

1227
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,880
a side of maple syrup. I did not get the little test tube shot glass of maple syrup. I just was

1228
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:49,800
handed a regular thing of maple syrup and it was pretty good. Like I liked it a lot. So I would

1229
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,560
recommend that. Mike, you and Lindsay had some of the egg dishes. Yes. And I'm trying to find my

1230
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:01,640
order of one of which is plant based egg. A lot of plant based stuff. Yes. They have a lot. And

1231
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:07,720
impossible is sponsoring the impossible meat. Yeah. So prominent time in the park maybe or the

1232
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,120
first prominent, really prominent time in the park. Wait, wait, we got to remind people. I mean,

1233
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,800
I'm sure we've said it, but the whole, the premise of Pym test, right? So Hank Pym is Michael Douglas

1234
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:25,960
character from Ant Man. He's the original Ant Man. And yeah, Scott Lang is Paul Rudd. Of course, Scott

1235
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,760
is original. Oh, he says Scott in this. Great. And I, one of my favorite things about, yeah.

1236
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,640
And the first two Ant Man is that Michael Douglas says Scott over and over again, like behind the

1237
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,880
cantaloupe. So maybe those would be your two favorite movies just for that reason. I like that.

1238
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,160
I like that personal touch like with Optimus Prime. Yeah. I like hearing Michael Douglas say my name.

1239
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:51,720
Exactly. So yeah, I got the impotent. Do you have the names of all of it in front of you or no?

1240
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:58,120
Um, uh, no, but Scott does. Oh, I do. Scott does in the Recurrence Guide. So it's like,

1241
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,440
it's experiments. So everything is sized bizarrely. Yeah. Stuff is either really like there's a really,

1242
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,440
there's a pasta dish that comes with one really big meatball and one small meatball in a tiny

1243
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:14,200
little fork for a place that's stressing the environmental message. Cause I'll get to,

1244
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,760
I'll get to the environmental stuff. Another part of the land describes the environmental stuff.

1245
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,560
They sure do give you a lot of little plastic things to throw out that you might not even

1246
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:28,520
use when you eat. But they have paper straws. Uh, Lindsay had the calculated breakfast equals

1247
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:38,680
E times two plus B plus P, uh, slat, uh, divided by T, which is, you know, uh, eggs and potato bites

1248
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:45,400
and toast. Uh, and that sounds like it's not even the size. It's just a weird name. Yeah. And I had

1249
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,520
basically the same thing, the impossible quantum garden breakfast, um, but it was all plant based.

1250
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:59,800
And I will say Lindsay's was, uh, better than mine. Uh, I like impossible meat, the impossible

1251
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:09,080
impossible eggs was like kind of eating, uh, like a, a washcloth that had been flavored.

1252
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,000
I don't even, that sounds too harsh. Uh, it was just, it wasn't my favorite. Uh, the,

1253
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,960
the impossible sausage was better. And again, I like impossible meat in general. I think that,

1254
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,920
that it was just not maybe the warmest, uh, it could have been. Um, but I had some of Lindsay's,

1255
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:34,760
it was good. Look, this is all fine. This is all fast service theme park stuff. It dressed up, uh,

1256
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:41,960
in a fun way. Yeah. And so there's, so they, okay, this is the whole thing, but, um,

1257
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:48,360
there's very little seating at both Pym establishments. And after everyone left,

1258
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:55,480
I learned that there is tons of seating in what was the queue lines for the Hyperion theater.

1259
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:01,640
There's tons and stuff. If you walk over there. Yeah. And, but no one as like Mike was waiting

1260
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,440
for the last thing and Lindsay and I are like awkwardly holding things of trays. No one is

1261
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:12,840
telling us, Hey, there's a million seats just down the street. We're like looking for tables.

1262
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,760
And I got to say there was plenty of cast members clearing tables. But one thing that I was really

1263
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:26,120
hoping for was a recent theme park, uh, innovation that I think universal had first was like, okay,

1264
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,480
team members sees you, you've ordered your food or you have your food. How many I'll take you to a

1265
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,960
table. They were not doing that. There was a lot of cast members just standing around and like,

1266
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,520
it's, it was a little the wild west. It was a little like, can someone tell me what to do?

1267
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:49,480
Yeah. There was a late, yeah. That's look, that's the work that out. I think, um, yeah, they,

1268
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,360
they could have tables like kind of by the like fast pass for guard. There, there, there's spots

1269
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:00,520
that you could fit more. Yes. Um, inside, I'll say this inside the Pym test kitchen, there's from

1270
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,640
some fun little gags. There's like big ketchup and mustard bottles. Yes. What are bountiful valley

1271
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:12,360
farm branded the land that was there before. That's right. California. That's right. Very

1272
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:20,680
boring. How far we've come from like several tractors in a, like a broken hose to like the

1273
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:27,480
most popular IP on the planet. Yeah, boy really worked out for DCA. Yeah. Um, and then there's

1274
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,560
like, you know, they show there's a big pretzel, which I did not get to eat, but there's a famously

1275
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,920
big pretzel and there's like an enter and there's a, yeah, there's a, but where they grow, yeah,

1276
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:42,200
make the pretzels big. Cause yeah, cause Pym Pym, uh, Hank Pym is, you know, he has shrinking

1277
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:48,840
technology. He has growing technology. Uh, and he is now using it to make quick service meals.

1278
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:54,600
Okay. Or theme park patrons. I'm sorry. I gotta stop. The official names are Pym test kitchen

1279
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:02,200
and Pym tasting lab, but tasting lab only has one snack, one or two snacks. It's mostly drinks.

1280
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,280
So you're thinking of it as tasting, I guess it's a tasting menu. I guess it's still

1281
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:12,200
a mistake, but it's, it's, it's a little, it's a little taste of beer. All right. Put your arms in

1282
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:19,720
the air and you know, scan, you know, if there was like a performer playing Hank Pym, you know,

1283
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:25,000
and be like, do you want to taste Scott? Do you want to taste like then now we're talking,

1284
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,240
I think, but like it's just, they're full, they're full portions. Yeah. Yeah. I guess

1285
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,240
that'd be a little creeped out, but do you want to taste Scott? Do you want to taste Scott? Scott,

1286
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:39,720
do you want to taste? Scott. Um, so let me, I'll say this. I ordered also for breakfast,

1287
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:46,520
the Choco smash. Oh boy. Which is, uh, it's fun. It's got a, uh, like a wrapper outside that says

1288
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:54,040
it's like one ounce, but of course it's a giant candy bar and there's a big, there's a big Choco

1289
01:13:54,040 --> 01:14:01,080
smash, like, uh, a big one over by that seating area. And it says fun sized, even though it's like

1290
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:09,080
eight feet. This is bite size. Yeah. And it's got caramel nougat, peanuts, brownie, dark chocolate,

1291
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,160
and Lindsay and I loved it. Oh boy. It was fantastic. And there's all, there's like layers

1292
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,320
to it and we were chopping. It's a little hard. It was like the, uh, with caramel probably,

1293
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:25,480
or the nougat was hard to chop them. Jason, I will say having a hell of a time cutting through it.

1294
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:30,120
And he was not pleased. I got to say, no, the nougat was the nougat and peanut butter were great.

1295
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:35,880
Very soft. The brownie, not very flavorful. The caramel was like pulling my teeth. You were upset.

1296
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,880
I was upset. Like we were eating this and going, this is delicious dessert. And Jason was like,

1297
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:48,520
really mad. I was mad because like, I had also just like loaded up on, uh, uh, sh I loaded up on

1298
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,720
sugar on French toast. I love my sweets. And I was like, Oh my God, I'm going to eat this candy bar

1299
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,040
and then I'm going to get a sugar beer cocktail. I'm going to feel like shit in a little while. I

1300
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,960
know I'm going to feel like shit, but I want to taste this stuff. Were you worried it was going

1301
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:08,680
to pull a tooth out of your head? I did bite. I did like a tooth, like a bit down on something there.

1302
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:13,000
And I was like, I don't know if the candy bar or something else or it was like a burnt piece

1303
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,280
of bacon or something, but I was, I was like, Oh no, cause you did see what happens when you said,

1304
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:24,040
I was like, I don't know. It's true. I was like, chewy, but I don't know. It was just so soft.

1305
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:28,840
Like most of it was so soft. And then this caramel was like, so, so the caramel like slapped you in

1306
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,640
the face is I guess what you were surprised of. You've never been surprised by caramel before.

1307
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,040
I've been surprised by caramel plenty. I feel like Twix caramel has really fallen off in recent

1308
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:45,800
years. Don't get me started, but yeah, no, I think it's, you gotta have a few people for this.

1309
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,800
This is overwhelming. Yeah. Yeah. This is not a, this is not a single side, like four people,

1310
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,320
probably. We split of course, three between three people. Cause Zach and Nicole ran away from us.

1311
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,680
Cause I think they were, they were like, we got to do that. I wanted to have fun. Yeah.

1312
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,800
And I kept saying, this is important. We have to do this. Eat this impossible to eat nougat.

1313
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,200
Eat the hard nougat. Eat the hard nougat and tell us what you think. So yeah, I would recommend four.

1314
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,480
I mean, five, five people, a family could easily split this and feel very satisfied having a little

1315
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:23,000
like a nice little dessert. It also felt like it was interesting because it was, I'm sure it was

1316
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,880
made by like in-house, like they make their treats, like you see in the window on main street and the

1317
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:34,120
confectionary. But they had put it in this like fun, like candy wrapper. Cause I honestly didn't

1318
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,480
even know. I was like, Oh, I wonder if they got like Milky wait a minute. I'm like, Oh no,

1319
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,880
this is probably made in the bake, like made in the bakery. And yeah. Anyway, so I, I, I,

1320
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:47,240
I was a big fan of that. I didn't have the opportunity to get the giant sandwich. This,

1321
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:52,680
this recently Jason was upset when I even, there's a hundred dollar sandwich. And even when I

1322
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:58,120
suggested it, Jason was upset. Okay. I'm upset at the idea of it. Again, I feel like if you listen

1323
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,160
to the second gate, you know, I very revealed, I felt so self-conscious. I was like, Oh, I am

1324
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,680
revealing. I have very particular food tastes and this sandwich. I saw a review saying like

1325
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,120
this sandwich is not worth it. I think I saw a couple of views, people saying like this

1326
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,760
sandwich is not good. Jason searched a hundred dollar sandwich, not worth it to find this

1327
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:24,200
need back up. I was just reading the $15 one like review, but I was also flashing back to

1328
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,560
this is the thing that was very common at theme park, like a cafeteria style restaurants in the

1329
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,920
nineties, like a pizza sandwich. And it was always disappointing, like pepperoni and salami.

1330
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,440
And she, I was like, Oh, there, this is just come back around. They're just trying to do pizza

1331
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,880
sandwich. I'm like, the only thing that's ever satisfying is the Subaru inside out pizza. That

1332
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,720
is delicious. And that's, that's a full day's worth of calories. Oh, it's awesome. What is that?

1333
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:54,920
Oh, it's, it's where like there's crust on like all the sides and inside it's like sausage,

1334
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,880
pepperoni cheese. So was it like a pezone? No, but it's triangle shit. They break it in the

1335
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,240
pizza shape and slice it into slices. I can't even picture that. That concept is confusing to me.

1336
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,480
So yeah, I twice tried to soft tell you, maybe we should get the a hundred dollar sandwich and

1337
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,880
split it. And both times you shut me down. The second time I'm not, I've not fallen for pizza

1338
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,840
sandwich again. I really wanted the big chicken sandwich and the mobile ordering situation was

1339
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,600
just not on our side. Sure, sure. But yeah, the night before I was like, no, that big sandwich.

1340
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,600
And that's when you hit me with like, I read reviews, I checked the touring plans posts and

1341
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:38,920
they said, do not get this sandwich. And I called Len up and Len said the sandwich was bad. He has

1342
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,080
three different touring plans, employees, a good joke about like, why did they make all the bread

1343
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,080
like, and I kind of was wondering the same thing, but it was fun. You know, I didn't see the joke.

1344
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,880
What's the joke? Just pointing out like, oh yeah, that blue bread looks great. Like it's,

1345
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,040
it does kind of like, if you think about blue bread, you're like, oh, that bread has gone bad.

1346
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:03,960
But in the story it's like, oh, they're doing science and you know, science is blue. I don't,

1347
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,840
I'm withholding my judgment on this. I was watching the video before the opening ceremony

1348
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:15,640
and Aaron, my wife was like, this place is infuriating. I do not like one bit of Pim says

1349
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:24,040
size nonsense. No, she was each one made her angrier and angrier, a big meatball and a little

1350
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:29,880
meatball. I, what's the other crazy, I mean the chicken thing. I do want that sandwich. It looks

1351
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,520
good. And I love stuff covered in sauce. It's got a lot of sauce. If you haven't seen it, there's a

1352
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:41,400
very little bun on a giant piece of chicken. Yeah. Yeah. That's just old, good old fashioned fun. I

1353
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,280
think that's what I'm so excited to go back and have the chicken sandwich. How are these cocktails?

1354
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,960
Oh, is that going to get me in? I had a great, I really liked it. We have, we got to keep the

1355
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:58,120
little plastic. They come in like beakers and say Pim on it. So you get a little souvenir plastic

1356
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:05,080
glass, which is fun. Yeah. Mine was like a mango cart, golden roads, famous mango cart beer,

1357
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:11,160
and then tequila and then a Boba Boba bubble popping bubbles. The only thing was

1358
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,320
a lot of ice in it. And so I got to wait for the ice to melt for the Boba popping bubbles.

1359
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:26,040
If only I had my official annual pass holder bamboo straw, I was given at the tasting terrace.

1360
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,160
I could have gotten to the popping bubbles much easier. You get a straw for being a legacy.

1361
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,800
These are the perks. We'll go through this pile of freebies. I got it. The

1362
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,640
Alfresco tasting terrace at the end of the episode. I'm a little upset that I didn't get that.

1363
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:47,400
That also, look, these, ooh, liquor concoctions. And we do, we did his Pim dare to weave his magic.

1364
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:53,960
Like, listen, I'm going to go get a glass of wine. I'm going to get real drinks several steps away.

1365
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,880
Well, they do. Non-complicated, non-sugar. No, you can get regular beer and wine. You can get

1366
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,360
regular beer. Okay. And the beer, I didn't get a chance to see it. I should have thought to just

1367
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:07,400
order a single beer, but the beaker, like proprietary cups, I think are set up in such a way. They have

1368
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,600
these devices where like you can, they put it on a thing and I think the bottom pops out a little.

1369
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:19,400
Yeah. It fills from the bottom. That's fun. That kind of got Erin back and forth. She's like hanging

1370
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,280
on by there. That's the only thing getting her to that's why I'm saying hang out around the Pim.

1371
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:30,120
What is it called? Tasting lab. Tasting lab. And then you'll, yeah, have like a cocktail. And then

1372
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,400
you, I'm sure at night, especially you look at the guardians' tower, you know, you're having a nice

1373
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,160
little time. I think so. This all seems like maybe you wait it out and do it in a less stressful.

1374
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:45,160
There's no protocols. You're not, it's not, it seems like it was all too much that it's the opening

1375
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,560
day madness mixed with the protocols and the ride is cool, but it's also a thing you got to learn

1376
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,720
and you got to get there right away and you got to wake up and get the reservation. It seems like if

1377
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:01,080
you're able to fold this into the chillest park, the most relaxed, right? Like the most resorty

1378
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:08,840
vacation of all the parks. I think once this place gets up to or slows down to DCA speed. Yeah. Oh,

1379
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:15,240
a hundred percent. Yeah. Because like a big thing since we're in this neck of the woods,

1380
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,720
they've annexed guardians, which storyline yet it's supposed to be in this part of the park,

1381
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:27,160
but now for the moment you can only get to guardians through Avengers campus. So guardians,

1382
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:33,720
I, we walked on it and then after they left, I waited 15 minutes and wrote it again and they

1383
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:40,520
should just put the end of the lamb land at the, the tasting lab and, and annex the guardians and

1384
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:46,920
the shawarma palace too. And the Terran treats into Hollywood for right now. So people can get at

1385
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,240
least a little Marvel just walking around because that's a huge attraction, eating up people

1386
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,200
and not a lot of people are going to ride it. Cause especially cause it's a, you know,

1387
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,640
and I don't think I'm insulting it by saying the Spider-Man ride is like a C ticket ride.

1388
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:05,160
It's like Mater's, it's like Luigi's dancing car attraction. Is it that level? Wow. I mean,

1389
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,960
it's, it's a little better. It's certainly more high budget or whatever. That doesn't mean if you,

1390
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:16,120
that's not even an insult. That's just a matter of that's like the scope and kind of the wow factor

1391
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,040
and what it's intended to be. I know what you're saying. It's more expensive, but I think it's that

1392
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:25,320
level of, and I like both of those cars. I like the Mater thing. I like the, oh, I do too. Yeah.

1393
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:32,280
But the fact that it's not a like, but it's not like a blowout crazy ride. Like I don't, I mean,

1394
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:37,480
it's like the Falcon opening opening day. It is, but the Falcon, the folk, I should say Falcon,

1395
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:42,680
cause that's what Han Solo says. Yeah. The Falcon though, that is trying. I mean, yeah,

1396
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,560
that's what everyone can, I will say I agree with, cause I, look, I read all this discourse.

1397
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,880
There's some people that are like, no, you don't be mean to Avengers campus in this ride because

1398
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:56,040
this is sort of the low key ride and this isn't the big one. I'm trying not to be mean. It's the same

1399
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,120
as the Millennium Falcon. And I'm like, the Millennium Falcon is a different story. The

1400
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:05,640
Millennium Falcon is a high level attraction. Like that is a major, I know it's not supposed to be

1401
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:12,040
maybe as impressive as Rise of the Resistance, but like that's not Mater's junkyard jamboree or

1402
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,680
whatever the hell it's called. That's like a, like knock you out. Like you're sitting in the

1403
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:21,240
goddamn cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Like, yeah, I mean, Spider-Man ride, you get to see

1404
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:26,680
everyone's friend's Spider-Man and that's kind of nice. I like that it's got that going for it.

1405
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:31,640
So, but yeah, it's not the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Yeah, no, it's, I'm just saying,

1406
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,400
yeah, that's the Millennium Falcon. When people are comparing the two of them, I'm like, that's not

1407
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,360
the same. Yeah, yeah, right. Being in the Millennium Falcon cockpit is like a transformative,

1408
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:48,280
like, oh my God moment for a fan of Star Wars. It's the whole, it's the, it's all a really great

1409
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:54,040
experience until the actual thing starts. And which sounds like a big insult because you were,

1410
01:24:54,040 --> 01:25:00,760
you're there for the thing, but that, you know, the, yeah, the cockpit is great and the lobby,

1411
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:05,640
what is it called? Yeah, I don't know, the commons area of the Millennium Falcon. You see the blankets

1412
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,360
on the Millennium Falcon. Game room. I wish that was, we had more time in there. Condo is great.

1413
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:16,040
It's like, I want an hour. Seeing it up from the outside, I don't, if I've been too negative on

1414
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:22,280
Smuggler's Run ever, like it is everything until the four minutes that you do. And even that is

1415
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:28,600
not like so awful. It's just not what it, it doesn't top everything that came before it,

1416
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,720
which is a bizarre syndrome for a ride. If the Indiana Jones adventure was like a little less

1417
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:38,840
good than the Q, that'd be strange. Yeah, exactly. And it's like, it doesn't, I've said, we've said

1418
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,680
this before. It's like, there's, there's moments on Star Tours, the new version where you're like,

1419
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:46,440
oh man, that's so great. You get caught in that thing's mouth and you do this. And it's just like

1420
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,480
sort of missing some of that. And again, I think, you know, they do a new, new like ride video

1421
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:58,360
cause you can change it. And it's like, it could probably be elevated to what our imaginations.

1422
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:04,360
My argument to like, yeah, you know, hey, you can't judge Avengers campus in this way. And you

1423
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:11,080
know, look, it's, you know, cause it's similar to this thing. These are buildings. Nobody's,

1424
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,560
you can say whatever you want about any of it. I don't think there'll be any feelings.

1425
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:21,080
People were doing good jobs. Don't we? I think they were saying like, all right, don't be,

1426
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,640
don't be like gleeful. And you're like, like criticism. I think it's fair to be tough on this

1427
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,600
stuff because it's also fucking expensive to go right now. It's not an annual pass. So like you

1428
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,800
want to get your money. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is bizarre to be in this scenario where you might,

1429
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:41,880
like you may have bought a pass for this day to go do experiences that you might not get to do,

1430
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:47,160
or it requires a lot of stress to do them. And it's, and some of that is, I think they're doing

1431
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:53,160
the best they can, but it's not certainly not an ideal situation on this week. No, I talk about this

1432
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,640
place. They should have waited for later in the summer or the fall to open this stuff. Yeah,

1433
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:03,080
do it with a little less spells, a little less red tape. I'm going to, I'm going to swing positive

1434
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:10,760
now. Oh, I was ready. I was ready to swing right there with you. Oh boy. I, so, you know, after

1435
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:16,040
they all, you know, went over to Disneyland, I hung out in the land for a while, was driven insane

1436
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:22,440
by psychological warfare from Alan Silvestri's beautiful music, deed guardians again. And then

1437
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:28,040
I was like, I'm not hungry right now, but a thing that usually travels well is a shawarma wrap.

1438
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:35,160
So I'll get one and I'll get it in a bag. Um, and, and I'll walk around a little and, and eat it

1439
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:42,280
somewhere more peaceful. I'll eat it in a grizzly peak. Um, so I had New York's tastiest chicken

1440
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,240
shawarma wrap with coconut yogurt, tahini sauce. I don't know why they call it that it's to,

1441
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,560
it's clearly tzatziki sauce. It just has a coconut yogurt base. It might have tahini in it,

1442
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:58,280
but, um, and it was, it was good. I thought the shawarma was good. Um, because it's like ready to

1443
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:03,080
go, there's not like, if you, if you go to a usual shawarma place, there's like a ton of,

1444
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:09,560
you know, cabbage and peppers and pickles and stuff like that. But there are vegetables in like the

1445
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:14,120
sauce and the sauce is very flavorful. The pictures of the sauce online, frankly, look

1446
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:21,400
disgusting, but it was really tasty and traveled well. Um, so I want to saw it. Yeah. That is

1447
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:26,600
like, it might not on a hot bay or that's in a bag for a while. It's a coconut yogurt base. It's

1448
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:31,720
not a dairy base. So I think it holds together a little more with theme park food. That is a wild

1449
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:37,640
thought. I'm going to get this and put it in a bag and hold it for a while. Like that is a big risk.

1450
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:42,280
It seems like it worked out, but that could have gone real. That's like putting the arc reactor

1451
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,040
in your chest. That's right. Level Tony Stark, whatever it takes, Michael, whatever it takes.

1452
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:53,160
We kept texting each other those pictures. Yeah, we did. I did that too. Um, uh, I liked, no,

1453
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:58,040
I thought it was very good. Well, cause I knew it was just seasoned chicken and PETA and the sauce.

1454
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,240
I was like, well, that sauce doesn't taste good. I'll toss the sauce and just eat the chicken and

1455
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,840
PETA. I thought it was pretty good. I think it's a great walk around food. I didn't try the

1456
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:12,760
falafel and I did not risk getting a cream puff, uh, to travel around, but I was just

1457
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:20,280
between the beer cocktail and the French toast and the, um, uh, uh, the candy bar. I was like,

1458
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:26,440
I can not eat something else. Sweet. I have to save this. Yeah. Wow. I would,

1459
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,880
I had clam chowder in New Orleans square later because I was pretty bold choice, bold choice.

1460
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,840
I just needed a little something. It was a little chilly. It was getting chilly that day. Um, what

1461
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,240
was the positive thing you were going to say? Uh, I, the spider, the bro, look, the dummy, the robot,

1462
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,040
whatever you could, the stunt Tronic, whatever they call it, uh, is awesome. Yeah. It's great.

1463
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:51,800
That is a highlight of the whole thing. Now, is that a show that you line up? Okay. Let's talk

1464
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:59,240
about this. Okay. Okay. Uh, so a thing I saw going around was people saying, you know, it's pop-up

1465
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,880
shows. It just like action starts happening around you. But then I also saw people saying,

1466
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,400
if you ask cast members, when does this happen? They will not tell you or they do not. They have

1467
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:14,680
a rough estimate and, uh, that sucks. And I feel like this is a thing theme parks have been doing

1468
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:21,160
with these like little pop-up shows or event show stuff. Um, where I think Ray and Chewie wandering

1469
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:27,080
through galaxy's edge. I think that's really fun. This, what happens when black Panther and black

1470
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:33,480
widow fight task master or spider-man tests out his new suit is that people he go like in a movie,

1471
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,920
Hey, there's spider-man and rush the pathways and fill the path. Yeah. There's not a ton of

1472
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:45,320
room to see it because the whole show happens on the top of the, of the web. Uh, what's the name of

1473
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,320
it? The worldwide engineering brigade. Well, yeah. Okay. The web. Yeah. Worldwide engineering

1474
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,720
brigade building the circuit city building. So that happens the whole on the top of it.

1475
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:59,720
And that walkway sort of into Avengers campus is pretty narrow. So, and he goes, he's like

1476
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:07,000
walking the whole length of the whole building. So you gotta like move to see the whole thing.

1477
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,080
It's tough to see it because you want, cause he goes, she starts over here. And I think they're

1478
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:16,840
doing that so you can, you know, everybody gets a little taste of that spider-man fun, but everybody

1479
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:23,160
wants to watch the whole show. So like, I found we were like trying to cram together to try to get

1480
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:28,520
around to see, we saw Kanye on the stage where he's above you and then the whole crowd moves

1481
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:34,040
like the sea. Yeah. Very stressful at times. And there's a lot of built in seating into the

1482
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:40,200
landscaping and planners that are covered in do not sit social distancing. Yeah. A lot of that's

1483
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,840
COVID. A lot of that's first week. So like COVID it'll be different. I mean, the direct, it's that

1484
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,440
I compare this to the dragon and Diagon Alley where it's like the, the flying cause so basically if

1485
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,480
you don't know what we're talking about, uh, there's a little show where there's an actual stunt

1486
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:58,600
performer. He gets on wires. He's doing some like crazy stuff where he's hanging from, you know,

1487
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,960
three stories in the air and he does like iconic spider-man hanging upside down with

1488
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,960
like your feet together. Yeah. And that's, that's pretty fun. That's fun. If I was a kid,

1489
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:13,160
I'd love that and love it now. Uh, and then they, Disney developed this thing. You can see it online

1490
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:19,800
where they dress essentially like a crash test dummy, like a high level crash test dummy and

1491
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,200
fly them through the air. Like he's spider-man swinging on a web and he, he goes very high.

1492
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:30,280
He lands very impressive. Uh, and that feels like, yeah, they're like dragon and Diagon Alley where

1493
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,280
you're like, that's kind of the thing you got to see. Like I haven't seen that in a park because

1494
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:38,120
like it looks like a human being. It looks like he's just flying in here and he's going to land

1495
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,000
and kill himself. It's pretty crazy to see it. I wonder where it goes. What is the backstage?

1496
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,880
It's a good question. And it's a good question because like I, it's very impressive because

1497
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:54,200
I, I don't know if anybody has pointed, like I'm sure there's some vantage point where you can see

1498
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,680
where it lands, but there's not a good one around. I'll tell you a great vantage point to see at the

1499
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:04,280
alfresco tasting terrace because I got to see it up there. I was thinking like, can I see spider-man

1500
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:09,240
from up here? And then suddenly just looking in that direction, you just see spider-man

1501
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,600
jump into the sky and it was awesome. It is cool as hell. It was to see it from elevate. Like that

1502
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:22,920
was a nice little hit, uh, of the campus and then stage 17. I think like if you want some Marvel

1503
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:28,040
stuff, uh, I think it's super fun. I want, yeah, they need to fling more dummies in the air at

1504
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:34,120
Disney. That's what I think. It was, yeah. Goofy. Yes. This fly. Yeah. Tinkerbell. I mean,

1505
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:39,640
she's a famously like is on that rope or that line at the end of the fireworks show, but they should

1506
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:47,960
just fly. Just catapult the catapult or from the Matterhorn into the castle. Indiana Jones. Yeah.

1507
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:56,760
Oh no. The catapult. I assume that's how they do this is a catapult. The other shows that the door

1508
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:02,440
Milaje show, the performers are great. Audience was really into it. Um, that's a black panthers,

1509
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:08,440
like guard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. They were already in California adventure a little. Um,

1510
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:12,600
so they, they do a little, just a quick little thing, but they're, they're out wandering around

1511
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:18,120
a lot. The suits are all really great. And I know this is important to fans of it and to kids and

1512
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:23,400
everything that you get like such quality. This is so not theme park costumes have come a really

1513
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:29,080
long way. Yes, for sure. It's not, it's certainly better than the islands of adventure stuff. Uh,

1514
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,160
you're like, it is funny cause like iron man, you're not going to get a perfect, like it's gotta be.

1515
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,440
Yeah. But it's, I mean, they're doing their best. They can't, I don't know. Yeah. That our man,

1516
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:42,120
it's the iron man. It might be the roughest one. Yeah. Um, but, but I will say this to praise Len,

1517
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:49,160
all the characters you like are there. And in my talk, am I also throwing shade at galaxy edge

1518
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,200
a little bit? Cause it's like, I think there's a plaque somewhere in the land that says like,

1519
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,640
this is where all the friends, like all the friends can meet here from any time. Like there's sort of

1520
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:04,920
a thing to like blanket say like, eh, don't worry too much about the timeline. Cause you see everybody

1521
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:10,280
you see captain America. You can see, you see both Captain America, Steve Rogers and, uh, and Sam

1522
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,480
Wilson, Anthony Mackie. Yes. Who just recently debuted as captain America on TV, not in the

1523
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,960
comics. That was a few years ago during the Rick Remender Ron, Jason, is that correct?

1524
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:25,160
I think that's right. Uh, it was when cat America was, well, Bucky Barnes took over when cat America

1525
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:32,120
was presumed dead and then when cat America was, uh, aged, uh, aged up became commander Rogers.

1526
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:37,560
Right. Uh, uh, Falcon took over. Right. Cause, cause Rick sent him into like a different

1527
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:41,880
universe to live like 30 years or something at a time. Something like that. Yeah. Anyway, fake. Uh,

1528
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:49,160
all of it. All of it. Um, so yeah, you get all the heroes that are all there. There's constant heroes.

1529
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:53,960
There's constant things happening. And that's really like when, and I know it's a much smaller

1530
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:59,720
land than galaxy's edge, but it's like, and I, and like, you go, oh good. Like this is right. This

1531
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:05,160
have to be constantly here. Whereas galaxy's edge is so much empty space with no characters.

1532
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:12,200
The catwalks. I like that social distancing. I have this awesome picture from, uh, my return to

1533
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:18,520
galaxy's edge where of chewy, like it was like perfectly in the sunset, like putting up a fist

1534
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:25,080
victoriously, like from up as if he's like giving an election speech while people cheered him on from

1535
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:30,120
below. And I'm like, this is great. They're using social distancing is causing these catwalks to be

1536
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,400
used finally. And maybe can Marvel inspire that stuff to happen a little more? Cause there was,

1537
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,560
there was, there was never, there was never a time when there wasn't something going on. Like

1538
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,960
Spider-Man does the whole, his whole show and he flies and then he comes down and does like photos

1539
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,840
with people and then Captain America comes out and Iron Man comes out and they come, Iron Man comes

1540
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:54,520
out of like a utility door on the Avengers and go, Hey, what up? He does kind of come out of like,

1541
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:59,880
yeah, the, the bathroom, not the garage door, but that regular door next to the garage door. Like,

1542
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:05,080
and then the watt where we were sitting down and drinking, I had the, I forgot, I had that

1543
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:09,560
marshmallow stuff. The Wasp just like went up to like the second level, just roaming around.

1544
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,920
She's just kind of like leaning against the band. Yeah, they're all just kind of up there,

1545
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,880
like checking in. She walks over, we're like, Hey Wasp, but she's like,

1546
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,520
we're like, yeah, hey, we, we saw, I saw it up close after you left, but when we were sitting down,

1547
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:29,560
we saw the, um, black widow fighting task master and some of these heavies and then black panther

1548
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:36,360
joins in as well. This is kind of a, you know, uh, a character people haven't really, uh,

1549
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:42,360
experienced in the movies yet. Task masters and assassin who has like, can, is like, can learn

1550
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:48,520
anyone's fighting style by looking at them fight and has all the Avengers weapons to some extent.

1551
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:54,760
He has a big kooky skull face in the comics and kind of has a skull face of this, but this is kind

1552
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:59,720
of black widow. They're doing like synergy with the new movie basically. So black widow is coming

1553
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:03,160
out, the movie's coming out. So she fights the villain that she's fighting in the movie.

1554
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,440
Having things that are precursors to things that haven't come out. That's pretty neat.

1555
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:14,440
The stunt fighters were all great. They tried to program. I think they programmed way too many,

1556
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:19,320
like hit sound effects because it was, there was like two fights going on at once and the hits

1557
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:25,480
weren't correct. Like this, the performers were doing great, but they did. There's a thing and I

1558
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,480
missed it because it's, it's hard a little bit to see some of the action, but there was a, there's a,

1559
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:34,760
they do a stunt and when, where one of the goons is like fighting black widow and she like kicks

1560
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:39,880
him or something and they do the like pull back on a rig of some kind where like the performer

1561
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:44,200
like shoots back. And I was like, I didn't even see that live, but I was watching the video of it.

1562
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:49,800
I was like, oh yeah, that's good. Um, so yeah, it's constant, it's constant characters and they're

1563
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:55,720
all there. And in case everyone's star Wars, galaxy's edge, I want all the characters. I want

1564
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:02,360
Ray, Kylo, Finn there, but I also want all other six movies. I'm not like that guy walking around

1565
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:09,560
giant rabbit that was in the comics. Jackson. Yes. He was a Marvel comics exclusive green rabbit

1566
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:14,440
that was in the star Wars universe named Jackson. And he's not Bucky O'Hare. He's not Bucky O'Hare.

1567
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:20,040
He's not this green rabbit is not that green rabbit. Jackson is his name. And I have a figure

1568
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:27,320
of him pre-ordered. Congratulations. Um, yeah, you're saying, yeah, this isn't like, go back to,

1569
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,160
oh, no, I prequels are better. You just, that's everything. Yeah. I know which,

1570
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:35,480
a new character Mandalorian is going to be in there so much as soon as they figure out how to do it.

1571
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:40,440
It's just all bets are off. Like Mandalorian, I feel like just like chased all the weirdness

1572
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:46,360
away. Like here's one we can all agree on. And it'll probably be like we've heard the

1573
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:52,280
rumors in Paris a lot apparently. And yeah. Oh yeah. They have all those costumes from

1574
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:57,080
the hyperspace hoopla and just bring them out. I want those guys in there too. They have like

1575
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:01,400
the figuring Dan and the modal nodes costumes for God's sake. Why aren't, why would you not?

1576
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:07,880
Absolutely. Yeah. Like, like there's just have them around. It's, but two is star Wars heaven.

1577
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:14,680
It's where they all live, whether or not they're dead or alive. It's unclear. Yeah. Just who truly,

1578
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:20,680
who would like the kind of people who would care, like we'll get to do their Twitter rants and like,

1579
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:28,440
all right, you have your fun. I will have the fun of seeing Darth Maul and Kylo like, uh,

1580
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:34,680
Sharon Aranta. But, but what they do really well is like, you're on this planet. This is the

1581
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:40,520
soundscape, the music of this planet. Sure. The soundscape of Avengers campus is like all over

1582
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:46,680
the map. Like I, like, like I said, the first off, I think Spider-Man, when he comes down for

1583
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:53,800
photo ops, we'll talk to people, but so much of the voices are recorded. Like, um, when like

1584
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:59,640
cat Marvel was talking to kids, taking pictures, she was talking, but like a lot of it's like,

1585
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:03,640
you know, they're playing recorded lines and stuff, which is probably,

1586
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:09,960
Hey, you can be in the cheaper union, not that more expensive union, um, for performers. I think

1587
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,840
it's why they're doing Dr. Strange talks. Yeah. Dr. Strange talks. Cause Dr. Strange has like a

1588
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:19,960
legit magic show for you, which is cool. I like, um, but like it's interesting cause Spider-Man is

1589
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:25,080
Tom Holland's voice. The iron man is, as Lindsay kept saying, like sounds like Dr. Evil. He's like,

1590
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:30,760
well, hey there, hey there, pepper is pepper around. Like, like this weird, like trying to,

1591
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:36,440
it might not be that, but it just sounded like a little odd in the land. It's like with Spider-Man,

1592
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:41,000
it's like, it is Tom Holland, which is great, but it almost feels like it'd be fun if, if Spider-Man

1593
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,720
was free to do some crowd work up there. If he was free to do a little, like point out something,

1594
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:53,160
you know, uh, so, but I don't know, that's not good enough to do that note, but, uh, yeah, depending.

1595
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:58,280
Dr. Strange is a legit magician. The guy they have playing him or everyone they have playing

1596
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:06,040
him. But his costume is good. Here's one of the weirdest things I saw, which is the, the ruins

1597
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:11,400
that Dr. Strange performs in. This is really cool. Like mirrored orb and stuff. There's an optical

1598
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,280
illusion. If you take a photo, right, it looks like the ground below you was warping. And then

1599
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:22,920
there's this like little, uh, outdoor standing room, like area where you watch Dr. Strange come

1600
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:29,640
out on a little performance space and there's a plasma, like TV, there's a 4k screen behind

1601
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:36,440
these doors. He comes out of, so we can do like conjuring stuff. Um, yeah. And you see Dormammu,

1602
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:43,560
the bad guy on it. Dormammu is a big like demon character. Okay. Yeah. So I was not, so it's really

1603
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:49,720
intimate and really tight and they did seemingly pack people into that. Uh, I was not going to

1604
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:55,320
venture into that close of crowds, but I was on the outskirts by the big orb and I was like,

1605
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:01,080
Hey, I got a pretty good view of the, you know, pseudo stage from here. Dr. Strange comes out,

1606
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:08,840
his mic is down so low. I can't hear him. I can hear Alan Silvestri's music so loud.

1607
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:14,440
And then I can hear the Spider-Man dialogue and I'm so far away from the Spider-Man,

1608
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:19,800
but I'm so close to Dr. Strange. I can't hear like it's, this is bad. They got a figure.

1609
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:26,200
They got a tweak. They'll tweak that. I'm sure. I didn't, uh, see the Dr. Strange show live because

1610
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,120
we were waiting around for a while and I was like, Spider-Man's happened like two or three times

1611
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:36,280
and I've seen, um, uh, what's the ceremony that the Black Panther guards do called? Do they have

1612
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:40,600
a name for that? I'm not sure if it has a ceremony. Some of this stuff just isn't on the maps.

1613
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:44,760
Like the happening kind of stuff. At the very least, it should be like you, if you ask a cast

1614
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,160
member, they go, well, it's at two 15th. Yeah. It should be like regimented of like it's every

1615
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:54,760
half an hour or it's every once an hour, you know? Um, so, uh, so yeah, I did not see,

1616
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,600
we did not see the Dr. Strange. I watched it on YouTube and I was like, oh, this is cool. Yeah.

1617
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:02,920
This, this works, uh, cause he's doing like a magic show and it's tied into like,

1618
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:09,080
you know, Dr. Strange lore or whatever. Yeah. And he's got the vibe down. He's not trying to do the

1619
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:20,040
American accent. I'm an American doctor named Dr. Strange. I live on the Manhattan Island. I am

1620
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:25,400
from here, America. This is where I'm from. The blue and the red and the white.

1621
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:33,240
Okay. I love America. Uh, yeah. So, so from what I saw and he uses, uh, Dr. Strange does not use

1622
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:37,960
his ridiculous comic book catchphrase in the movies. Am I wrong? Uh, I don't remember it in

1623
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:44,120
the movie, but he comes out screaming. He says the catchphrase three times in the show, at least the

1624
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:49,400
video I saw, which I love. And I'll say it for Scott and will it be true? Was it a real,

1625
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:55,880
am I going to say the real one or am I going to say a fake one? Whoa. Uh, the problem is,

1626
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:01,320
is the real one is too ridiculous to be. I can never remember it. It's so weird. Uh,

1627
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:07,720
it's by the Horry hosts of Hoggeth. That is the catchphrase that Dr. Strange said in the comics.

1628
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:15,720
Real. Uh, it is real. It is real. It is, uh, Stanley is writing at 1 AM and printing has to be done by

1629
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:20,760
two way. There's a lot of, there's a lot of debate about, you know, Stanley and what he did and who

1630
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:26,040
he created and did he take a lot more credit than he deserves? Cause Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko did,

1631
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:30,840
they drew this stuff and they, they probably wrote more than Stan likes to take credit for like,

1632
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:36,360
I did it. He gives it in the later years. He gave more credit to Jack Kirby and, uh,

1633
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:42,760
some of the artists than he did earlier, but the Horry hosts of Hoggeth doesn't sound like anything

1634
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:48,440
more than a Stanley line. That sounds pure. Maybe I'm wrong. It's going to be mad at me. And I've

1635
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:53,320
just, uh, shown that I'm not a true Marvel boy, but it's such a ridiculous phrase, but he says it,

1636
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:59,720
which I like a lot. Yeah, that'll be in a grape. Um, so I like that. And it also, and this is,

1637
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:05,800
this is blue sky and I'm sorry, but Dr. Strange came out and I was like, where's his fucking house?

1638
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,800
Why didn't you build this house? Dr. Strange has a cook. We, we, we did it in the void.

1639
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:17,000
Oh yeah. Oh, that was very cool. Yeah. Secret house and it's magical. Not Rick Santorum,

1640
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,640
the sanctum sanctorum is a Dr. Strange is like magic house. And I was like, just like build that.

1641
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:29,320
Why didn't we build that? Like, this is like all industrial building and Avengers like, yeah, okay.

1642
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:33,960
But like he's got him. He's got a magic house. I really do think they're overthinking it with

1643
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:39,400
all these things. Yeah. Just make the places. Build this fucking house. Yeah. And this is, um,

1644
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:43,480
it's the time of year in Los Angeles where there's a lot of gloomy gray days, whether it's hot or

1645
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:51,880
cold. And, um, the gray of the sky really accented the gray of much of the land. So for a, uh, uh,

1646
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:58,600
movies inspired by like bright colored comics. Um, I just want it more splashes of color. I want

1647
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:04,280
more weird stuff. I mean, I, I think that they're expanding their horizons a little with the Disney

1648
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:10,520
plus shows. Uh, there's a lot of interesting aesthetic stuff in Loki, um, Kamala con,

1649
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:17,240
Ms. Marvel is coming. Moon Knight is coming shows. Uh, Hawkeye, uh, is coming. And, and so like,

1650
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:22,760
if you can get them in there and like fill out the world a little more, uh, that'd be great. Yeah.

1651
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:26,840
And I would say, I think those characters will show up. It's just like, now I'm going to be a

1652
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:31,720
little cranky, like waiting for the next really themed, like we've, we were talking on the

1653
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:36,600
Patreon about the plans, the possible plans that, uh, uh, Disney has for Anaheim where it's like,

1654
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,520
Oh, it seems like they're going to build Wakanda, which would be awesome. Wakanda

1655
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:45,320
looks cool as shit. Like build Wakanda, which obviously is probably like budget wise,

1656
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:52,440
similar to avatar. Like the Wakanda orientation center where we'll get you accustomed to the idea

1657
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:59,000
of Wakanda before you get to live your Wakanda. Like, no, just do the. Yeah. And I, again,

1658
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,640
I'm sure like they, the e-ticket is I think supposed to take you to Wakanda. The idea they

1659
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:07,960
were going to build or there's hopefully fingers crossed are still building like a crazy new ride

1660
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:14,200
system that I even read more about than I knew. Like it's, you start in the Quinn jet, like you're

1661
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,280
on a way to, on the way to Wakanda. Then the thing like opens up, the jet opens up and then like your

1662
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:25,080
cart, like your seats drop out some, and then you each like have a suit up kind of moment

1663
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:30,360
of some kind, like a singular experience where like something happens to you and then you get

1664
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,360
dumped. I think what, like in a three 60 ish, this is my guest based on what I'm reading.

1665
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:39,560
And then on that crazy battle where I think you have a lot of range of motion versus Soren. Um,

1666
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:44,520
Wow. Like that sounds awesome. Yeah. And I think like, if that was open with the land,

1667
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:50,280
people would go, yeah, the land is a little sterile, but man, that ride was unbelievable.

1668
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:56,920
So build up to that. Yeah. But like, it's just, I'm, I'm look, I'm impatient. I'm cranky. Uh,

1669
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:04,200
well, I promoted it like as big as a DCA 2.0, like the refresh there and galaxy's edge.

1670
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:10,680
And even if it's like a half size land like that, it's insanely popular characters and such. And

1671
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:15,640
it's at a time where people are hungry to get out of the house and get back to doing stuff

1672
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:22,200
at places. So there's demand. The demand is there. So I, I don't know that I was,

1673
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:26,200
we were at galaxy edge, Oming day. I remember going to like cars, lamb,

1674
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:32,200
Wayne, a Vista street opening weekend. And, uh, I know the, all the COVID stuff and all the

1675
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:36,440
working out the kinks in the app, but this was the sloppiest of the three openings.

1676
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:42,280
That's undeniable. Yeah. So I'm sure it's going to calm down. And, uh, yeah. I want the ground

1677
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:49,240
chaos members, performers doing a great job, uh, in the land and, and everyone in good spirits and,

1678
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:55,320
and guests seem to be, uh, enjoying themselves. Uh, yeah, sure. And I, yeah, if I was a kid,

1679
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:59,800
all the stuff I, I mentioned, liking, I'm sure every kid is like, holy shit, cause by the way,

1680
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:05,000
it's flying gear. But hopefully this is just the beginning. But this is, yeah, there's just, uh,

1681
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,920
this is just the beginning of Marvel. It's the end of the COVID protocols. Fingers crossed. Uh,

1682
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,440
yeah. Like, yeah, obviously it'll settle down. Cause I think I said, and this is going to sound

1683
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:19,080
like two and so like, if this was just like fantasy fair, that little fantasy fair in Disneyland,

1684
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,800
where they were like, oh yeah, fantasy fair is open. And you're like, oh cool. And you walked

1685
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,800
over, you're like, oh, it's Figaro. Like, oh cool. They did a nice legit, they nice job with this.

1686
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:34,760
Okay. But if it was live your Figaro fantasy hero up brother, hero up. Um, I discovered

1687
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:40,760
this is a little, so I, I, after you guys left, I just kind of wandered around California adventure

1688
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:47,560
a bunch and did anything with a short wait. Um, I did get my legacy pass holder thing fixed. Um,

1689
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:52,280
and I went to the tasting terrace cause it was like the main place you could get a drink and walk in

1690
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:59,000
and like sit for a while. Um, and this is where I learned that Disney, I didn't, I thought this was

1691
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,720
only in like Mario Cuomo's New York, but, uh, I went and I was like, I will have the drop in,

1692
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:12,760
if you dare, um, which is a gin drink that tastes like paint thinner that you add a syringe of

1693
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:20,440
Maraschino cherry mix to, to make it taste, um, you know, sweet and more palatable. Um, but I said,

1694
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:24,760
uh, just the drink please. Uh, no food. She said, what food? And I was like, oh, no food for me.

1695
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:29,080
And they're like, oh, you have to order food to order a drink. So suddenly the,

1696
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:35,480
this is what you're ending the podcast. I suddenly the $16 with an Andy Rooney, like a 16 minute,

1697
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:42,360
what happened? What happened? Perhaps in New York, this kind of thing flies, but there were,

1698
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:47,960
there was, there was a happy ending. I have the menu. I got to keep the menu, but I Jason,

1699
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:51,800
by the way, Andy Rooney is one of his characters and I'm not making a joke. Like he's done a lot.

1700
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,960
Oh, could you do the rest of this in the voice?

1701
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:59,880
Well, I wasn't expecting to eat screaming cauliflower ceviche, but they said it was

1702
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:08,120
the lightest option on the menu. And after eating $3,000 or three thousand calories of Avengers

1703
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:16,440
campus ant man grub, I was a little puffy. So I opted for what turned out to be a soup,

1704
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:22,520
to read full of chopped vegetables and tortilla chips. Not exactly light. I would say,

1705
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:33,320
and my $17 cocktail adling quickly turned into a $31 plus a generous tip.

1706
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:45,240
$40 sit, but on the bright side, I was given the menu to keep and a coaster

1707
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:51,800
and a legacy pass holder magnet. And for some reason, a bamboo straw that is imprinted with

1708
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:56,520
Disney annual pass holder. When did they start making straws out of bamboo?

1709
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:03,960
Oh, I'm throwing the straw right in the garbage. Why do they wrap the straw in plastic? If plastic

1710
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:08,840
is the thing you're not supposed to be using right now. Podcast the ride. We'll be right back.

1711
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:17,720
We started the show with junior samples and ended it with a long deceased, long dormant segment

1712
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:24,840
on a show for old people. But that was delightful. I enjoyed that a lot. I feel like I got to wind

1713
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:30,760
it down. Any closing thoughts? Unless you just want to do an after show. Well, yeah, one where

1714
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:37,800
I leave. No, I guess that's it. I just, yeah, I did like, I mean, I don't want to seem like I'm too

1715
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,760
negative or something. These are just my general thoughts as a, as a Marvel, as a Marvel fan.

1716
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:45,560
I've been doing that a lot. Sorry. The last year I've been cracked. My voice has been cracked.

1717
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:53,080
Yeah. I apologize everyone. Um, as a Marvel fan, I just, I'm hungry for the meat that I know is

1718
01:53:53,080 --> 01:54:01,080
there and there's 70 years of nonsense. And this is just like we built, you know, as I said,

1719
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:05,800
the, we just built main street of Disneyland and you're going to enjoy main street for five years,

1720
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:10,920
like enjoy main street for five years before you get to do anything. Sometimes people come out and

1721
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:15,240
wave from the castle. Can I go through it? Is there anything on the other side? Don't worry about that.

1722
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:20,120
No, nothing else in Disneyland. Your castle experience. It's like main street and the Tiki

1723
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:25,800
room is open. Yeah, that's a good, and you're like, okay, this is fun. And I like the Tiki room better

1724
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:31,400
than I like Spiderman. Um, but yes, it's like, there's one thing and it's a nice experience. And

1725
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:38,280
eventually, eventually you'll get to do like a cool, crazy thing that like lives up to the promise

1726
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:42,920
of some of this nonsense. Um, so yeah, so anyway, but it's, it's a nice time and when everything

1727
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:47,720
settles down, everybody will have a nice cocktail there and you get to see them hurl a dummy through

1728
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:55,240
the air. That's great. I mean, what else do you want? I mean, eventually a ride, but besides that,

1729
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:00,840
I mean, sure. Uh, that, that is, that does sound nice. Oh, and that, that terrorists,

1730
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:05,800
give me to that terrorists. Yeah, I don't know how much longer it's going to be there or what

1731
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:10,760
it's going to be if the legacy pass holders are going away. Can somebody leak some information?

1732
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,160
Like tell us like, is the, is the annual pass coming back or whatever it's called a rewards

1733
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:21,800
program, whatever shape I called it. Yeah. I mean, if it comes back, definitely check out Marvel,

1734
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:27,480
you know, Avengers campus. I would say like, yes, don't, don't run. If you're like,

1735
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:32,680
how should I spend the money right now to do it? It's like, I think let it calm down, let them

1736
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:38,680
work out some kinks. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, COVID protocols in California will change. So

1737
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:44,360
yeah, I would say like when you go, Oh, Disney's like allowing more capacity and there's less

1738
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:48,120
like they can have more people in the land and whatever, like, yeah, it's not something that I

1739
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:52,280
go, you would go, Oh my gosh, you got to go see it tomorrow. But like, yeah, check it out when you

1740
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:57,080
can. And it's comfortable. And yeah, maybe they'll try time timed entries at some point. I always

1741
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:01,480
thought the first couple of months of galaxy's edge, the timed entries worked pretty well,

1742
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:05,000
but like, yeah, I mean, they, they got rid of those within a couple of weeks. I feel like,

1743
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,960
yeah, that's true. But galaxy's edge protocols, galaxy's edge protocol. I mean, you did have to

1744
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:15,480
just try to get into Oga's was hard to get into, but this is like a whole land. That's Oga's. That's

1745
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:22,200
okay. To end the show, Jason and I will list X-Men villains and you will say, is it, are they real or

1746
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:30,520
are they not real? Okay. Okay. The first one is Strife. The fake real, real cables. Glow.

1747
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:41,880
Fabian Cortez. That's real. Yeah. Okay. Set it to confident. Yeah, you did. The next one is arcade.

1748
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:52,440
Fake. Real. Whoa. Mm hmm. Geez. Kang the Conqueror. Fake. Well, technically it's an Avengers villain.

1749
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:57,640
That was a trick. Oh. He's going to be in one of the movies coming up. I forget which one. Yeah.

1750
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:11,000
Eternals maybe? Mojo. Fake. Real. Okay. Geez. There are no fakes. Maybe there are no fakes.

1751
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:17,080
I'm doing this off the top of my head, Jason. He's out of them. No, I'm trying to think. I'm

1752
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:21,800
trying. There's a guy who doesn't have legs, but he has tank treads and I can't remember his name.

1753
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:35,720
G.W. Bridge. He's the president, right? President, like you said 20 years ago. Real. He is real.

1754
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:41,160
He's more of a, I don't know. Are you thinking of Trevor Fitzroy? No, Trevor Fitzroy is different

1755
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:45,880
than G.W. Bridge. No, I mean from the guy with the tank legs. No, not Trevor Fitzroy. No,

1756
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:50,120
Fitzroy is more of an armored guy. Scott Thorson. Scott Thorson.

1757
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:59,240
Real. But not in the Marvel universe. In the candelabra. In the candelabra. And a real person

1758
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:05,560
in this world. When will Disney open up a candelabra themed land? Oh boy. Oh, the opulence.

1759
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:12,280
I don't think they could afford it. Only Liberace himself could pull it off. Man, that's true. He

1760
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:21,400
paved his way one key strike at a time. That's right. So anyway, Kevin Feige, do something with

1761
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:27,880
the Liberace. Do something. Liberace collaborating with intergalactic rock star teleporter Lila

1762
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:37,400
Cheney. How about that? Real. Real. Real. Dazzler. Real. Wow. There's so much to learn. So many

1763
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:42,440
characters I gotta meet. Not to learn. Yeah, yeah. I say so much to learn for other people.

1764
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:50,600
As for me, I'll go get a beer there when it's more chill. And as for you, you survived
