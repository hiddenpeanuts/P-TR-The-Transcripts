1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Here's what I'm proposing going forward when it's just you and I or when Scott is gone.

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,820
We call the episodes Scott Free for two reasons.

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,300
Scott isn't here so it's Scott Free and we get away with anything we're trying to do

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,740
because we're little rascals so we're going to get away with it Scott Free.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,740
Well I like that.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
You get it?

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,740
Yeah I get that.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
Two different meanings.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,780
So going forward that's how we're going to refer to episodes where Jason and I get to

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,060
be little scamps, little rascals, we get to be members of our gang, was that the original

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
little rascals?

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,860
The Naughty Boys, Naughty Boys Unleashed.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,260
Yes right so today is Scott Free, today's episode is Scott Free, my name is Mike Carlson,

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,260
this is Crypt 3 of course, oh no shoot shoot shoot!

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,860
Is there been an episode we've done where I haven't forgotten to do my Halloween name?

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,100
Spiky Snarl Gun?

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,300
Every episode I feel like this month has been ah shit damn it from me because I know the

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,660
first one was because I was just editing it like literally hours ago.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,060
It's your own horror.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,860
Yes, remembering these stupid names is my own horror, I'm upset.

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:34,780
You're like an innocent victim who just saw Art the Clown heading his way.

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,020
Yes I guess I am a lot like that, what year was yours as a skeleton?

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,700
Oh Jackal Skeridan?

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Jackal Skeridan?

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,300
Are you sure?

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Yeah reasonably sure.

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,900
I thought there was skeleton, was that a different year?

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,300
Maybe a different year.

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,340
I swear there was a skeleton.

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,340
I feel like the last couple of years I've stuck to that.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,980
There's no way to find out right now because we're in the middle of this.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,420
We're doing Crypt 3, the topic that you the listener voted on of course, which is the

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
what is it called?

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
The Nightmare Experience?

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:13,180
The Nightmare Experiment in Hong Kong, not the Nightmare Experiment, the sexy burlesque

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:21,220
circus show at Halloween Horror Nights I think in the year 2021 in Orlando.

37
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,420
Right I just by the way now called it the Nightmare Experience.

38
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
That's not what it's called.

39
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
It's called the Nightmare Experiment.

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,820
Nightmare Experiment, Professor JT Woo and his experiments.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,020
Right and this is a thing that was second place last year and has like very handily

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,660
won the poll this year.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,740
So that's like an exciting topic in my mind, something I've wanted to talk about.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,700
Yeah for a while I feel like this come up every year almost in our discussions.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,860
So we will read a message right now from Scott.

46
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,060
He says Dear Crypt 3, Scream Scribers, which is good, sorry for missing another Club 3.

47
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,700
I will also probably miss November's Club 3 episode.

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,300
As such I will be unable to give full attention and care to the current poll incumbent.

49
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,720
Bugmane does whatever he wants.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,160
That's why I am hereby holding the bug option until the November poll or excuse me until

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,940
the December poll.

52
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,340
Let's get five all new episode suggestions and then hopefully sure thing Bugmane takeover

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,040
will skittle scattle to the holidays.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,740
Thank you and mind your P's and Q's.

55
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,820
Sincerely the gear wolf.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,780
So Bugmane is not going to be in the poll next month or as you're hearing this now.

57
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,540
Right but he may be invading your Christmas.

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
That's what it sounds like.

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,700
It sounds like yeah you're going to have a very buggy Christmas so prepare for that.

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
When you wouldn't like that.

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
You thought that sounded weird?

62
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,640
I thought it sounded even worse.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,420
Prepare for that little buggy, a very buggy Christmas.

64
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,500
Skittle scattle under the Christmas tree.

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,500
So that's there's that but let's yeah let's I don't know think about is there any November

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,780
type suggestion you have something you'd like to throw out to the listener to try to put

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
your thumb on the scale a little bit.

68
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,460
Oh hmm well Thanksgiving is obviously I feel like the big holiday.

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,220
It certainly is the big holiday.

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,940
I would go so far as to say it's very notable.

71
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh an election year this year too.

72
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
It is an election year.

73
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,140
It's an election every year but it's a presidential election.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,580
It's a presidential one right so it's a big one so the answer is no you don't have anything

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
to suggest.

76
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
No not really I'm just buying time.

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,580
All right you don't have to buy time I mean we can just move on.

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
I guess not yeah we could just.

79
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,100
You could have said no I was going to say no I don't have a good one.

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
I wasn't even going to try to do.

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Black Friday?

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Is there a Black Friday ride?

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Is there a Black Friday?

84
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,220
There is that Thanksgiving ride that opened it where holiday world yeah which is like

85
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,180
you're going to grandma's house to have turkey and gravy.

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,700
Yes well and there's the gravy boat right roller coaster.

87
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Is that what that is?

88
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Is that up yet?

89
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Are we talking about the same thing?

90
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
I think we're talking about the same thing.

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Okay.

92
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
I thought that was like you were going to grandma's house.

93
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
I think there's a blaster.

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Obviously we don't know enough about it to talk about it.

95
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,020
But yeah so there's that but we haven't been on that I mean I guess we could talk about

96
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,180
it if you really want us to.

97
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,820
But yeah Thanksgiving specials I suppose Disneyland Thanksgiving specials.

98
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,460
We've done a little of it.

99
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,540
But yeah there's not maybe there's some weird Disneyland Thanksgiving thing we've never

100
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,900
seen before.

101
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,900
That's possible.

102
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
But yeah anyway it's up to you really.

103
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,260
I'm not going to suggest there's no Paul Lindha Thanksgiving special as far as I know.

104
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,860
No I don't either.

105
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,940
I can't recommend that because it doesn't exist.

106
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,780
But I mean I guess you could suggest we write a hypothetical Paul Lindha Thanksgiving special

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,700
or something like you could force us to do something like that.

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh okay.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,140
We could create and produce and film a full Paul Lindha Thanksgiving special.

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,620
But anyway yeah up to you.

111
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,780
On to this topic for today's Crypt 3 episode.

112
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,380
The nightmare experiment which was a suggestion from Mark Gannon and here's what Mark says.

113
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,820
I'd like to suggest that in the upcoming spooky season the boys take a look at the one time

114
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,500
that Disney tried to do a Universal Studios Six Flags not style scary event.

115
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,740
Hong Kong Disneyland's the nightmare experiment featuring original character antagonist Professor

116
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
Wu.

117
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,820
A couple of photos of this crazy event are linked below.

118
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,980
Thank you for those photos because I mean it's fairly well documented online but it's

119
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,460
still not like a famous famous thing I feel like.

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,420
I feel like most average average perk-overs don't know that this existed.

121
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,540
You know I in the review time kind of round up videos about these because the nightmare

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,220
experiment specifically went two years but they said that Hong Kong Disneyland had been

123
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,540
doing more Halloween haunt kind of things since 2007.

124
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,060
Yes and I didn't know this.

125
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,700
No I didn't either because there was Graves Academy which was like a spooky boarding school

126
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,420
sort of thing but nightmare experiment is notable for having Disney characters.

127
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,160
Right so they would do these different events that would be you know a lot more like original

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,420
narratives narratives than just you know oogie boogie bash which is like the villains are

129
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,440
out and you're getting candy.

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,860
But they're not like crafting new narratives with new characters necessarily.

131
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,940
I don't think I have not been to one of these recently but I was shocked there's like they

132
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,020
used to do a jungle cruise overlay.

133
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
Yeah.

134
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
You see that.

135
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
That yeah that's wild.

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,300
It was called Curse of the Emerald Trinity.

137
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,340
Yeah.

138
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,140
And it was like a spooky jungle cruise and they would put you know a lot of its lighting

139
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,900
a lot of its lighting and music as far as what the difference would be but it's cool

140
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,860
like it's cool and they would add like I don't know they had some props like skeleton or

141
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,220
skull props or something but then they had new sea backstory.

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,620
Did you read any of this?

143
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
Of the jungle cruise?

144
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Yes.

145
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,140
No I didn't go down that rabbit hole.

146
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,140
Oh well I did.

147
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Okay.

148
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
I scurried right in.

149
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
All right.

150
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,780
Professor Garrett Reed was a disgraced professor kicked out of the Society of Explorers and

151
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,900
Adventurers.

152
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,300
He was an alleged grave robber and thief obtaining artifacts through unsavory means and selling

153
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,980
them on the black market.

154
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,860
He was on the hunt for the Emerald Trinity, a trio of enchanted emeralds said to grant

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,940
men immortality, stealing a boat from the jungle navigation company to travel deep into

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,140
the jungle.

157
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,700
Indiana Jones warned the archaeology community of his nefarious deeds and Lord Henry Mystic

158
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,300
expressed urgency over finding him and stopping him.

159
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Wow.

160
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,420
So this implies that the other members of C are moral and above board.

161
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,100
It does imply that even though they have implied the opposite before.

162
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Yeah.

163
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,820
Certainly Barnabas T. Polingen is a little nefarious.

164
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,140
Oh sure.

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
And others.

166
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,620
Obviously Harrison Hightower, very nefarious, doesn't get more nefarious than him.

167
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Yeah.

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,700
But this guy trying to get all the emeralds for immortality, he went too far.

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Right.

170
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,860
So Professor Garrett Reed is too bad for even the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.

171
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Yeah.

172
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,420
How powerful he is.

173
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,820
So much so that Indiana Jones had to get involved.

174
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Yeah.

175
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,060
That's never a good sign.

176
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,940
Indiana Jones is advising C members also.

177
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,220
Is he in C?

178
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,540
I don't think Indiana Jones is in C, but Jock Lindsay is like C affiliated, I believe.

179
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Yeah.

180
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,020
I don't think Jock is in, but he knows people from C as well.

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Okay.

182
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,700
And if you don't know what we're talking about, which I guess Crypt Three, you have to know

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,060
because you're a big dork like we are.

184
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,060
No offense.

185
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
I mean that in a good way.

186
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,340
C is the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.

187
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,760
We've done an episode on this.

188
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,380
This Disney parks specific narrative involving original parks characters, some that look

189
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:30,460
like Disney Imagineers that are basically like a bunch of old, I guess they're old people.

190
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah.

191
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,260
Turn of the century explorers.

192
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,780
But then also like land barons and colonizers and like there's different types of people

193
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:49,100
like Mary Oceaneer seems good and then like, you know, Barnabas is bad or Henry is bad

194
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,700
or Barnabas is maybe in the middle.

195
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
I don't know.

196
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,820
Barnabas is the man who owns Big Thunder and they keep doing more of this C stuff in the

197
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,780
parks and I think we like it in general, but there's a lot of it if you really want to

198
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,420
enjoy the narrative.

199
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,580
It's really, they're really fleshing it out.

200
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,460
That TV show, they're taking their time on that TV show.

201
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,380
I would love to know how much money they've wasted developing all the parks properties

202
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,300
into movies and TVs and TV shows because it seems like the Big Thunder Mountain being

203
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,220
developed as a TV show 10 years ago doesn't go anywhere.

204
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,140
There's been multiple C projects I think at this point.

205
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
Yeah.

206
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,980
of Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek Next Generation fame.

207
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,180
And that's dead though.

208
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
That's over.

209
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
He's done with that.

210
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
Oh, is he done with it?

211
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
Yeah, not happening.

212
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,580
That show is not happening.

213
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,140
Well, not his version.

214
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
Not his version.

215
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Okay.

216
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,980
Because for all mankind is hitting season four or five, I think.

217
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Oh, I don't know.

218
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't know anything about that.

219
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,220
Well, you got to fire up your Apple TV app.

220
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
I can do it.

221
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,420
I know how to fire up an app, but I maybe I will.

222
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,180
But yeah, that's that's done.

223
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,060
There was that Seth Rogen figment.

224
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
Right.

225
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,340
Where's that been?

226
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
There's no talk of that.

227
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
I forgot about that one.

228
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,260
There's every like there's so many times when there's a big article and then it's like,

229
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
where did it go?

230
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
And the answer is nowhere.

231
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Well, you know, when they get these these brand new focus groups of fans to help consult

232
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,940
on the movies to make sure the fans don't get upset.

233
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,260
I wonder what that looks like.

234
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,740
There was an article today that came out saying that big companies are going to employ fans

235
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:39,500
to watch movies of like IP characters and then tell them, oh, oh, the fans are no.

236
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,180
It says the example I gave is like, oh, if you do this, the fans might retaliate.

237
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
How?

238
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,940
What are they going to do?

239
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,240
They're going to complain on the Internet.

240
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,000
They're going to make a video with the most like unpleasant like Disney.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Brian Reynolds has annoyed Brie Larson again and we'll be back Friday after that.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,960
You know, those just as guys making up shit, you know?

243
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Yeah.

244
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,760
Well, they're scared of those guys.

245
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
I guess so.

246
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
They think that there's a perfect equation.

247
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,040
It really feels like so like I think I think speaking of bug, he has some sort of term

248
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
for this.

249
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
And it's a thought I had at the same time.

250
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,680
I didn't steal it from bug, but it's almost like self A.I. human beings are actually trying

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,480
to think like A.I. before even using the computer in the sense that you're like, all right,

252
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,080
let's just put whatever Spider-Man in the A.I. and it'll tell us what the audience is

253
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
comfortable with.

254
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,760
Isn't that just called having a business degree?

255
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:49,400
Hey, isn't that just called MBAs?

256
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,120
Give that material for later and on a different podcast or a stand up stage on your Netflix

257
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,360
special for my Netflix special.

258
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,760
And I'm going for the record.

259
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm going for seventy five applause breaks.

260
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
Ellen had seventy.

261
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
I want more.

262
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,520
I think you could get ten million dollars to do one of these stand up specials.

263
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
Oh, yeah.

264
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,760
With one of just your MBA jokes alone.

265
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,880
Well, you know, we're about we've been comedy for a long time, Mike.

266
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
We're truth tellers.

267
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
You know?

268
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah, that's true.

269
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,760
We are truth tellers.

270
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,680
I didn't lie at all about Professor Reed.

271
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
I told the truth about him.

272
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
That's right.

273
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
But anyway, yeah.

274
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,880
Well, go and watch a video of this just because there was like an original like piece of story

275
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,040
that was represented through some screens where he like got killed by vines.

276
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,280
Yeah, pretty dark.

277
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,440
But like all this stuff to me, again, I'm jealous.

278
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,960
I've said this a lot this year where I'm like jealous of other parks because this stuff

279
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,120
feels so creative and interesting.

280
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Sure.

281
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
And you just don't get it anymore.

282
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
You don't get it.

283
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,120
You're just not going to get it domestically, you know, not getting it domestically.

284
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
That's right.

285
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
There was also like a headless horseman thing, too, that was a tie in to see.

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
It's like the curse.

287
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I forget.

288
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Curse of the headless horseman or something.

289
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Wow.

290
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,880
But there was so they do so much interesting stuff over there.

291
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,840
And even now, there's like kind of like a Jack Skellington walkthrough.

292
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Is that right?

293
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Is that still going on?

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Or is that over?

295
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,960
Because after Nightmare Experiment, I think they did get complaints that like, oh, this

296
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
is too scary.

297
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
This is too much.

298
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Yes.

299
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,240
So there was a Jack Skellington Nightmare Before Christmas more whimsical kind of walkthrough

300
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
experience.

301
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah.

302
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,680
The thing I'm talking about was called The Revenge of the Headless Horseman, which again

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,800
was Adventures Club stuff.

304
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah.

305
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,240
And Adventures Club was the thing in Pleasure Island and Disney World that is now closed

306
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,680
that was very sea heavy.

307
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,520
Sort of the start of sea, really.

308
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Yeah.

309
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Right?

310
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Yeah.

311
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,600
That I mean, and that was my shit growing up like that was dragging my family to that

312
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
a lot.

313
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,640
My family was very patient with how many times we would hit up the Adventures Club on a trip.

314
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Right.

315
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
And I never went.

316
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Yeah.

317
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
And it's sad.

318
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
It upsets me.

319
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Yeah.

320
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,120
And I just want to sit here with my tears for a good minute if the listener would just

321
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
sit here and indulge.

322
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Okay.

323
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,280
Shocking yourself on the microphone with those tears.

324
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
But yeah.

325
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,800
So all of that stuff is fun.

326
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
And yeah, I don't know.

327
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,320
I don't know if that'll ever translate to a movie or TV show.

328
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,180
I mean, you can make a cool TV show out of anything really, but it's so tied into being

329
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
park specific.

330
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,400
I wonder if it will ever make its way, the sea lore into a movie or TV show.

331
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Yeah.

332
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
That's a good question.

333
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:45,280
I feel like it's either going to end up being Easter eggs or it'll be a standalone thing,

334
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,640
but it'll just get noted to death.

335
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Well, right.

336
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,600
I mean, like in what scenario where you're like, okay, this is a movie about like Barnabas

337
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,520
T. Bullion, an old railroad tycoon, you know, like, all right, well, is it tied to Disneyland?

338
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680
Well, no, no, it's just he owns a railroad.

339
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Yeah.

340
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Okay.

341
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
But what do they do?

342
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,400
They own the things from the Disney parks.

343
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Okay.

344
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
But are the Disney park in the movie?

345
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
No, no.

346
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,680
I mean, I guess you could, you could represent all of it in a real world.

347
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,680
A character points and goes like, oh, they call that big thunder mountain.

348
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Right.

349
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
And that's it.

350
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Like, I guess there's a world where like, it's like globetrotting, but all of the things

351
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,960
from Disneyland would have to be represented in the real world.

352
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,360
I feel like they thought this was going to happen when they adapted League of Extraordinary

353
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Gentlemen.

354
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
What do you mean?

355
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,520
They were like, oh man, if this hits, we might have a new franchise on our hands.

356
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Oh, well, that's true.

357
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Yeah.

358
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Yeah.

359
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,100
But I mean, I don't know that that was more just like, oh, we're going to do a fun, exciting

360
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,240
kind of throwback adventure movie based on all these old characters.

361
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,360
But that's all like the characters, you know, in a club.

362
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Sure.

363
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,400
The comics are very particular.

364
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,680
They're very, Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neil were very much going for like, this would

365
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,360
be a thing from this time, you know?

366
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah.

367
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Yeah.

368
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
I mean, it's, you're right.

369
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
It's a similar thing.

370
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,080
I just, I just mean like from a Disney, like if they're asking the fans, the fans are like,

371
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,640
are they going to want more Marvel or sequels to Pixar movies?

372
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,240
Are they going to want like watching a dusty old man steal money from a train?

373
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,600
Like, oh, that's true.

374
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm just saying, I don't know.

375
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Yeah.

376
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I don't know that the appeal of it.

377
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,640
I feel like the very special appeal of C is that it is just park specific.

378
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,960
It's just that, you know, you know, is a little dork when you're riding big thunder that there's

379
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
a little portrait.

380
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
There's a little connection.

381
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Yeah.

382
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,200
That looks like Tony Baxter in the whatever, the saloon or something.

383
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Sure.

384
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
So it'll be interesting to see.

385
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm not against it.

386
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm for it.

387
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm just wondering.

388
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,080
But yeah, onto the thing we're talking about, which was a scary haunted maze.

389
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Two of them.

390
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Two of them.

391
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Yes.

392
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
There was one and then there was a sequel.

393
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Yes.

394
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,360
A scary haunted maze, which just off, off the bat, in case you didn't know what I would say,

395
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
like this looks awesome.

396
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah.

397
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
It looks really good.

398
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
It looks really good.

399
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,560
The budget seemed to be, I don't know.

400
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,160
I don't know if it was high because it's not like it was, it's a walkthrough.

401
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
So it's not like.

402
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,680
The sets are just so intense.

403
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
Like they're so detailed.

404
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Right.

405
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Yes.

406
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Everything looks really good.

407
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,840
The costumes look really good.

408
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,080
It's characters, you know, but they're like fucked up.

409
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,640
They're like messed up.

410
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Yeah.

411
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:48,560
I was speaking of fucked up, I got to mention, did you know, did these names, Tarrant Hightop

412
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,960
and Nivens McTwisp, did those names mean anything to you?

413
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,640
Tarrant Hightop did not mean anything to me before I started looking at all this stuff

414
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
up yesterday.

415
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Yeah.

416
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
But that popped out to me.

417
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
That is the name of the Mad Hatter?

418
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,200
That is the name of the Mad Hatter, specifically the Johnny Depp Mad Hatter in the Tim Burton,

419
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Alice in Wonderland movies.

420
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
His name is Tarrant Hightop.

421
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Tarrant Hightop.

422
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:21,480
He comes from a long line of hatters, of hat creators and the Mercury drove him crazy.

423
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
The Mercury did?

424
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Mercury used to be used in finishing hats.

425
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Oh.

426
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,600
And that's what Jeremy Piven, that's why he had to pull out of the play because he had

427
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
mercury poisoning.

428
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Well, that's because he ate too much sushi.

429
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
He ate too much sushi.

430
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
He hits too much sushi.

431
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
He got out of that mammoth play by saying he ate too much sushi.

432
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:45,120
The phrase mad as a hatter comes from hat makers used to use mercury and that much exposure

433
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,600
to mercury would drive people a little mad sometimes.

434
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Wow.

435
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I didn't know this.

436
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,440
Do all Mad Hatters, in all of the Alice stories, have they all been driven mad by mercury?

437
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,840
I think that's the implication.

438
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
They all have to make hats.

439
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,040
They're all a little kooky.

440
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:12,720
I don't know that they're all named Tarrant Hightop.

441
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,240
That's two P's at the end.

442
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,480
Yeah.

443
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,720
That's close to Topsy.

444
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,480
It is very, it is close-ish to Topsy.

445
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,600
Now we're really getting way Scott-free because we can talk a little more Topsy.

446
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,120
Should we call for a full Topsy's second gate episode while Scott is away?

447
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, wow.

448
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
I don't know if I'm prepared for that.

449
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,920
Is Topsy original to that movie or is she?

450
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,360
Yeah, I think Topsy is original to that movie, but I could be wrong.

451
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,800
Was she not in a book or something?

452
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
I don't know that she was.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,880
If Topsy is in a book, maybe we do a second gate, but if she's just in the movie, I don't

454
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
know that we need to.

455
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Yeah.

456
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,000
Like I said, I don't think Tarrant Hightop is necessarily the name and other things.

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,960
I certainly don't think the White Rabbit is referred to as, once again, consulting my

458
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,560
notes, Nivens McTwisp.

459
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,800
Nivens McTwisp.

460
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,880
These don't feel like, these feel like human AI.

461
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,800
I need an old-timey name and then the machine spits out Nivens McTwisp.

462
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
They're good.

463
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I mean, they're good.

464
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm not mad at those names, but I was shocked when I was looking through whatever fandom

465
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,240
page and I went, huh?

466
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,200
I've never seen the Johnny Depp Alice movies, even though they've made, what, $10 billion?

467
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,400
Incredibly successful, also very successful in Asia.

468
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,160
And that's why you see more representation of them in those parks sometimes.

469
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,920
But yeah, so they made this maze and there's like kind of just an empty building, what

470
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
is it called?

471
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
The Pavilion or something?

472
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:01,040
The Pavilions and then the next year, they used a different flex space known as Plaza

473
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Grounds.

474
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Right.

475
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,600
And because I was also trying to figure out, is there a spot to even do this in Disneyland?

476
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
I don't think so.

477
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,760
Oh, well, there's sound stages.

478
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
In Disneyland?

479
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
California.

480
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
California Adventure.

481
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Yes.

482
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Sure.

483
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,440
Right now there is where Monsters Inc. is.

484
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,720
They could do that there, you're right.

485
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,240
There's the arcade, the old arcade in Tomorrowland.

486
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,880
That is really only open for rentals and like limited time lounges.

487
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Yeah, that's kind of a tiny space, but I guess you could do something in there.

488
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,800
Horror Nights uses a lot of extended queues.

489
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Yeah.

490
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,400
Yeah, I guess.

491
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,360
I mean, there's a little, look, because I've been looking at that map a lot lately because

492
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,120
of Disneyland Forward and all the stuff and trying to figure out where Avatar is going.

493
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Sure.

494
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,900
So there are spots they could maybe build a little building, but I don't think there's

495
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,440
anything that's just like, oh, that's ready-made other than what you're saying is the sound

496
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,160
stages in California Adventure.

497
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Right.

498
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,560
Yeah, I mean, Epcot has that big pavilion.

499
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,040
Epcot has more flex spaces.

500
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,840
Disney World has tons of flex spaces.

501
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm sure there's, yeah, and Epcot, my God, you could, there's probably so many empty

502
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
buildings you could just move a Halloween maze into.

503
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Even newer buildings.

504
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Sometimes we have to turn the lights on in Spaceship Earth and they're like, oh, shit,

505
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,440
we got to run that today.

506
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Epcot's in such bad shape, sometimes they forget to turn the lights off when you're

507
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
riding Spaceship Earth.

508
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah.

509
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
There's a light switch on the wall.

510
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,760
Disneyland will never be completed.

511
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,080
Epcot is done, though, for Test Track will be redone soon.

512
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,880
That would be so good, though, like, I know there's so much, so much wine and food happening

513
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,160
at Epcot and that's a lot of the money drivers there now, but yeah, you could just take some

514
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,520
of those spaces and turn it into little mazes.

515
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah, you could easily turn the Odyssey.

516
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Right.

517
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,080
Building into a very long maze.

518
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Right.

519
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,680
That's, I mean, Disney does not want it to get into this game.

520
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
They've per, like, they've stayed away.

521
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,800
They've seen what has happened.

522
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,520
They've seen the money you can make, but they have stayed away.

523
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,200
I guess they feel that their Halloween parties are lucrative enough to not do something special

524
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
like this.

525
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Yeah.

526
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,480
And although I, I was shocked to find out that, um, there's not that many nights set

527
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,720
aside for Oogie Boogie Bash.

528
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
You're right.

529
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Yeah.

530
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,520
I really thought it was more like, oh, and then when it gets into October, it's five

531
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
nights a week.

532
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
It's like three, I think.

533
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Right.

534
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,580
It's, it's like, yeah, it's barely like anything.

535
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:51,080
Even hard nights is dark on both coasts, usually Monday and Tuesday night.

536
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Yeah.

537
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I, yeah.

538
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,320
So I guess I don't know if they've crunched numbers and determined it's not worth it to

539
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,280
put the money into building mazes or anything special like this.

540
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,680
But they did it in Hong Kong and kudos to them.

541
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,920
I guess they maybe never will be able to do it again, but they got to do some weird dark

542
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
stuff with these characters.

543
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Yeah.

544
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,920
And there is some, I mean, two years in a row, the man, it's implied the man to Hatter

545
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,520
picks a guest from the crowd and cuts their head off.

546
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,160
It's, um, and it's, yeah, it's not even, I guess it is implied because you don't see

547
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,720
the actual decapitation, but it basically happens and then they pull, like there's a

548
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,920
plant, like, so you'll walk into the maze and you're one of the people there as a plant

549
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,480
is an employee of the park and they're just dressed in plain clothes and they, it's funny

550
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,280
cause I saw a video of it and I'm like, oh, this person's doing a very good job pretending

551
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,920
to just be like a dopey tourist.

552
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Yeah.

553
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,640
And then you go into a place where there's like an asylum and the mad Hatter's in there

554
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,440
and he's wearing white, I guess all white, like he's, yeah, like all white.

555
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,400
The first year it's an asylum, second year it's at the hat shop, right?

556
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:11,300
And he pulls the, the fake, uh, uh, guest in or the plant and takes like pruning shears

557
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,000
or like whatever, I think it's clippers, like a hedge clip, hedge clippers and like the

558
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
edge.

559
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah.

560
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:29,160
So it's really like, he is decapitated somebody.

561
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,500
How they got away with this, I don't know, cause it's not like this was 40 years ago.

562
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,480
This was less than 10 years ago.

563
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,680
This was the mid 2010s.

564
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Right.

565
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,200
Who in Disney approved that?

566
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah.

567
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I don't know.

568
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,640
I guess cause they're overseas, they got some special permission to decapitate.

569
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,880
Well, you know, we talked about before, like when they've expanded the parks internationally,

570
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,320
they've had to adapt some stuff.

571
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,040
Like they do the big one always being Phantom Manor, the Hoenn and Manchin equivalent in

572
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,400
Paris, I feel like Tony Baxter is always saying they get scary, they get funny, they don't

573
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
get scary and funny.

574
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I know.

575
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
And that's something where I'm like, is that true?

576
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,880
I think culturally it's like those mean different things.

577
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,920
But like, um, yeah, they went kind of much more hardcore.

578
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
You're an Hong Kong.

579
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Yeah.

580
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Hardcore is right.

581
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
They went right.

582
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Okay.

583
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Well, let's do like kind of a Halloween maze.

584
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Okay.

585
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,240
Well, let's have the manhatter kill a guy, which is, yeah.

586
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,720
So then in manhatter, like, is he a villain in the Johnny Depp movies?

587
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,880
Well, no, from what I read, he's one of the resistance fighters against the red queen,

588
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
the evil queen.

589
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Right.

590
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
That's a big thing too.

591
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,080
You're like, oh, you've taken kind of at least an anti-hero in some ways and turned him into

592
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
a murderer.

593
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Yeah.

594
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
That's a extra shock.

595
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
That's a big swing.

596
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Yeah.

597
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Right.

598
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
Cause like, oh, evil queen or Maleficent tries to kill someone.

599
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Sure.

600
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
They were doing that in the movies.

601
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Yeah.

602
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,760
But the, my friend, the manhatter, what happened to him?

603
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Terrence?

604
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Terrence?

605
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
What happened to him?

606
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I don't know.

607
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Yeah.

608
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,480
It's like, I mean, imagine like, uh, like happy from the seven dwarves was in the room

609
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,520
and they like pulled an audience member out and he like stabbed him with an ice pick.

610
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Sure.

611
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Happy's a murderer.

612
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Like that would shock anyone.

613
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Yeah.

614
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
My friend, Happy's killing a guy?

615
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Yeah.

616
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Get out of here.

617
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,120
Now I'm, I'm haunted for the rest of my life.

618
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,720
I'd expect that from, uh, uh, Doc or Grumpy.

619
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Grumpy.

620
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Yeah.

621
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
It was a fit of rage.

622
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Yeah.

623
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,520
One of the seven dwarves, I was looking this up lately or recently, I should say, um, Disney

624
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,600
the dwarves in the like original Snow White, but because like those names were not in the

625
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
original story.

626
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Oh, okay.

627
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,200
So like Dopey is not in the public domain for another decade, I think, or whenever Snow

628
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
White came out.

629
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah.

630
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Over a decade.

631
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Then Snow White came out.

632
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Okay.

633
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Cause he's kind of, that's an original character.

634
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Right.

635
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,920
So you could, if you wanted to do Jason shared and presents Snow White and the seven dwarves,

636
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,640
you could rename the dwarves.

637
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Oh.

638
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,960
Or you'd have to right now, but tomorrow you could go into production on Jason shared and

639
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,240
presents Snow White and the seven dwarves and you could have one called rage.

640
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,000
You could have one called apathetic apathy, maybe apathy.

641
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay.

642
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

643
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,520
Getting into inside out to territory, which I have not gotten around to either Disney plus

644
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,000
haven't gotten to it yet.

645
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,240
Uh, you could call them one horny, I guess.

646
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah.

647
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,160
Um, cause generally, I mean, the way that the Disney version, I guess they all just

648
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,080
have names based on their personalities.

649
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,680
I think personalities and what was easy to animate personalities that could be communicated

650
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,520
simply and visually.

651
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Right.

652
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Smoke coming out of ears.

653
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Yeah.

654
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,720
That shows anger, which is another inside out thing.

655
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Oh yeah.

656
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,800
So it looks like really stealing from Snow White in a lot of ways.

657
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,480
Is there any sort of one of those when you read like a fan theory where it's like, did

658
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,200
you know actually Snow White does not hang out with any dwarves.

659
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,320
Those are just seven facets of her personality.

660
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,120
Oh, that she's imagining them.

661
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Yeah.

662
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,920
That would kind of annoying things like a Tyler Durden thing.

663
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Yeah.

664
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,120
Cause like I saw one recently where it was like Donnie and the big Lebowski is not real.

665
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,040
And then somebody's like, no, they talk to him.

666
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,480
Like they do talk to him and he influences things that happened in the movie.

667
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,840
But like people like to make up fan theories is what I'm saying.

668
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,440
Well, if the focus groups, you know, suggest this, I hope it'll make its way into, you

669
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
know.

670
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,360
We should focus group this podcast.

671
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,280
Oh, that sounds great.

672
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Yeah.

673
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
We should find out.

674
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean, I guess that's what club three is really.

675
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

676
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,760
It's kind of like, what do you want to hear?

677
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
But everyone's kind of divided.

678
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
It's true.

679
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,000
It's like the country a lot of, in a lot of ways.

680
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh yeah.

681
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Club three is divided.

682
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Very divided.

683
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,800
So yeah, that that's in the middle of the first maze is when Mad Hatter kills a guy.

684
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
But yes, it starts.

685
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,360
So there is an original character, which you talked about professor Wu.

686
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,540
And his assistant.

687
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
And is it, what's the name of his?

688
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,400
I don't know if his assistant has it.

689
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,680
I didn't see a name, but it might be somewhere.

690
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:23,240
And it's like his, his lab and he's researching a phantasmagoria and different phenomena.

691
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,760
Is he evil necessarily, or is he just sort of like in over his head?

692
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:36,640
I think it's one of those like, yeah, he's trying to explore and discover and maybe he

693
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
pushes it too far.

694
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Yes.

695
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,640
He certainly pushes it too far because you go through like, and then you go through like,

696
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
what is it?

697
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
A chamber door.

698
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
You go like through a portal.

699
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
It is basically.

700
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:58,880
It's very similar to the, I think of the Poseidon's fury kind of locking rotating chamber door.

701
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Apparently this is like a little Easter egg is like, oh, this is a nod to the map of Hong

702
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Kong Disneyland.

703
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Oh, okay.

704
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah.

705
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,440
So then you kind of go through this and then that's when the maze really starts.

706
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,560
This is like kind of an intro area where you get, you understand the narrative that's happening.

707
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Yeah.

708
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,160
You see Dr. Facilier, I think that's the first room.

709
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,520
That's the first one.

710
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,320
Dr. Facilier and his like shadow.

711
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
And his shadow, yes.

712
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,520
His creepy shadow helps him like disappear.

713
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Right.

714
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,280
And then he's like on a little stage and then he gets like pulled, he gets like killed.

715
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,280
That's the character from Princess and the Frog.

716
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,640
And he gets like pulled into like hell?

717
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah.

718
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Oh, was it?

719
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Yeah.

720
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh, was it?

721
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Some sort of nether world?

722
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,920
I guess he is kind of like the spirits are kind of like, get him.

723
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Right.

724
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,480
So like right there, at least you go, okay, there's a villain.

725
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,960
I guess what I'm saying is like, I'm comfortable at this point.

726
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,760
I'm like, okay, it's a villain and he seems, something's bad happening to the villain of

727
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,320
the piece of Princess and the Frog.

728
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,240
Well you're like the Hayes coat.

729
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,160
You like still the movie rating coat from back in the day.

730
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Oh, yeah.

731
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,960
You like the villain always needs to get his comeuppance.

732
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Right.

733
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Yes.

734
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,840
This was an old rule where old movies, you would have to see a person that did something

735
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:27,920
bad be punished for that action because you didn't want to teach people bad morality.

736
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Right.

737
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Right.

738
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
So yes, I, that is, you're right.

739
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,440
I am kind of assessing the different rooms based on that.

740
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,720
Now modern like horror mazes and Halloween horror nights, that's not necessarily true.

741
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,400
That doesn't happen a lot where you see the villain get, get his or hers at the end.

742
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,560
Sure.

743
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,680
Partly sometimes because they just want to keep making insidiouses.

744
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,720
Well, sure.

745
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
There's a lot.

746
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,280
Did you know that James Wan and Patrick Wilson are both associated with the conjuring and

747
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
insidious?

748
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I did not know that.

749
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,720
I did not know this.

750
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,040
I did not know that.

751
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I don't know that.

752
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,240
Is that, was there something particularly interesting about that or you just didn't know?

753
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,680
No, I just, it's just a thing I've learned about reading up on a Halloween stuff this

754
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
year.

755
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Okay.

756
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
All right.

757
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I didn't know.

758
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I don't know.

759
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I didn't have anything to say about that.

760
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,360
Patrick Wilson directed one of the later insidious movies.

761
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,800
You're hitting me with information that I didn't know, that I'm not sure I care about

762
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,080
at all.

763
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,360
And no offense to either James Wan or Patrick Wilson, who I enjoy the work, their work in

764
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
different ways.

765
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Yeah.

766
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,960
But no, I don't, I don't know that, that information doesn't inspire anything from me.

767
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
And it's no offense to these men.

768
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm just surprised that you're excited about it.

769
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:53,920
I just thought it was, it was, they were notable, like big horror franchises, insidious at horror

770
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,280
nights, conjuring at Six Flags this year.

771
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,680
I was like, oh, Patrick Wilson is in both of these.

772
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,840
So were there Patrick Wilson character walk around?

773
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
Like, are they in those mazes?

774
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
I don't know.

775
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
I don't know either.

776
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,040
Cause conjuring is conjuring universe.

777
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,720
So you got the nun, you got the Annabelle, you know.

778
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,800
Do you watch these movies?

779
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,680
I've just been reading about them.

780
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,760
I have not, I was just reading up on them cause I was trying to get background for all

781
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
our haunt talk.

782
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,480
Are you going to watch the movies?

783
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,840
I, I'm thinking about it.

784
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,400
They're very available.

785
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,240
Are you considering it very strongly?

786
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm considering it.

787
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm looking into it.

788
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm hearing about it more and more.

789
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,920
Well that's, now I have to say that cause I am hearing about it more and more from you

790
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
mostly.

791
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Yeah.

792
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,760
We're hearing about it more and more from Jason.

793
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
From Jason.

794
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Yeah.

795
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,000
These multi-billion dollar series, I'm finally getting around to them.

796
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,320
Well but this doesn't sound like you are.

797
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,320
You sound like you're thinking about, you sound like you're thinking about getting.

798
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Around to them slowly.

799
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
I don't know.

800
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
It seems like it's not for sure that you're going to watch them.

801
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,880
I'm dipping my little toesies in.

802
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
You're dipping your toesies in the Wikipedia.

803
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Yeah.

804
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Well it's a start.

805
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,680
I guess it's a start.

806
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,880
I can't argue with that.

807
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
So okay.

808
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,640
In this room, and I couldn't tell because of the video and yeah, was it review time

809
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,440
is the YouTube channel that has a really good video of this, that's what I watched.

810
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,280
Review time had videos on both of them.

811
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
It's review and then T-H-Y-M-E.

812
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
Someone went.

813
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,600
I watched someone actually go through them.

814
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,680
But they said that Jack, a skeleton of Jack Sparrow then comes into the room.

815
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
I didn't see that.

816
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,600
I couldn't see it in the video either.

817
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,400
It gets very dark in some of these videos.

818
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Right.

819
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
So I couldn't tell if that was just a projection on the wall or, because I was hoping like

820
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,320
a man in a skeleton costume with like a bandana on his head came in and like kind of Keith

821
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,160
Richards is way through, but that didn't happen.

822
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
No, I didn't see that.

823
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,960
It seemed like it was just a projection on the wall.

824
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,000
Low light cameras have gotten a lot better even just in the last few years.

825
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, that's true.

826
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,400
Even watching her nice videos, I'm like, well, it's like crystal clear.

827
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Some of these mazes.

828
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
That's true.

829
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Yeah.

830
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,120
But yeah, I was like, oh, there's, so there's two, I mean, there's two Johnny Depp's in

831
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:16,240
this maze, two different Johnny Depp's no low, no tanto as far as I could tell.

832
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
But that wasn't a hit.

833
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
And I guess it was a hit.

834
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,400
Maybe you would see a tanto in a maze like this.

835
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,080
But maybe not in the year 20, whatever.

836
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
What's the year 2024?

837
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,080
So yeah, I didn't, I couldn't tell what that was.

838
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,180
But there is like a skeleton Jack Sparrow in the Shanghai Pirates ride that comes to

839
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
life essentially.

840
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Oh, okay.

841
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
He starts out as a skeleton.

842
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,760
It's sort of similar to that Beauty and the Beast effect on the Tokyo Beauty and the Beast

843
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,880
ride that everyone goes nuts for because you can't tell how it's done.

844
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Sure.

845
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Sure.

846
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,840
And it's a similar thing where he like turns or he's like a skeleton or something turns

847
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
around.

848
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,120
He's like turns into Johnny Depp.

849
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Okay.

850
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,760
This is mostly skeleton like jail cells.

851
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,680
I think in the fort from the movies or the fort you see the the pirates trying to get

852
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,640
the key from the dog.

853
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Right.

854
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
It's it's skeleton pirates.

855
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,200
And this is kind of quick.

856
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
This one.

857
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Yes.

858
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
And this is just a bridge.

859
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes.

860
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,560
I don't have a lot to say about it because then that's on the way to the CID room.

861
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,280
Which is horrifying.

862
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,360
So yes, CID, which I didn't realize CID, the bad guy who's really kind of misunderstood.

863
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah.

864
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
CID from Toy Story.

865
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,200
His name is CID Phillips.

866
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
I didn't remember his last name.

867
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
I didn't know his last name was Phillips either.

868
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,600
So we're learning a lot of last names on the show today.

869
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,160
But his name is CID Phillips and he was a kid who was kind of like, you know, a troubled

870
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
bad.

871
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,200
I wouldn't say bad kid, maybe a little troubled.

872
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,560
And people pointed this out online, like CID would pull the heads off dolls and put them

873
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,860
on bodies of a different doll or a different toy.

874
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,480
And then, of course, all those toys, like, were kind of messed up.

875
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,600
But they were they were misunderstood toys because they just looked a little scary.

876
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
But they were fine.

877
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
They were nice.

878
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,080
And then they kind of like attack CID at the end.

879
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,520
But people were like, how did CID know that these toys were alive?

880
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,640
Yeah, that's a good point.

881
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,480
Like you feel bad for the toys.

882
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,040
But CID was just a kid.

883
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
He didn't know they were alive.

884
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Yeah.

885
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,640
So like, why are we mad at this kid?

886
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,080
But in this house, they're really alive.

887
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Right.

888
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,160
So like, they've done this where CID is like a bad guy on some of the different events

889
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,020
in the domestic parks in Disneyland.

890
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
And it's still like, well, what is it?

891
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
What is the crime?

892
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,680
What crime did this kid commit?

893
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Yeah.

894
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
What did he do?

895
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,320
What, his parents aren't home and they're not paying attention to him?

896
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,700
That's not his fault.

897
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,160
He's a sinner because he's a latchkey kid.

898
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Right.

899
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
That is kind of what his sin is.

900
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
That is kind of, yeah.

901
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,280
That's the Hays Code interpretation.

902
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Right.

903
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
The television raised this kid.

904
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Who knows?

905
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,960
Do we ever see CID's parents in Toy Story?

906
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
I can't, I don't think so.

907
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,600
I don't know that we do.

908
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,520
We also don't see CID.

909
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,360
CID's like doing like putting toys, like taking them apart, putting them together weird.

910
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,280
He's not killing like small animals or anything.

911
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
No.

912
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,440
So yeah, how would he know they're alive?

913
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Right.

914
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,480
So how, so why should we be mad at him?

915
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah.

916
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
That is what I'm saying.

917
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Okay.

918
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,400
But he is represented as a villain in this maze on some level because he's created these

919
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,680
mutants which they are represented.

920
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,040
You see this like little room of like CID's playroom.

921
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,000
Also it seems like some of CID's like house is falling apart.

922
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,160
You've almost painted a picture now of a troubled kid whose parents, I don't know, parents have

923
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,680
let the house kind of decay to some degree.

924
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,280
We really should feel bad for CID or at least just have some sympathy.

925
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,120
Kind of a sympathetic character.

926
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Yes.

927
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,560
We should feel bad now watching that movie.

928
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,200
Andy's kind of a little spoiled brat.

929
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
He doesn't know how good he has him.

930
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
CID?

931
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
No, Andy.

932
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Oh, Andy.

933
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Yes.

934
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Andy.

935
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Well, we don't know.

936
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I thought you were almost jealous of CID.

937
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Oh, of his freedom.

938
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Of his freedom.

939
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Yeah.

940
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Of his freedom to create life.

941
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Well, he is a creative guy.

942
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,320
He's kind of a Professor Wu kind of figure.

943
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,560
Yes he is.

944
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,760
So we go into this room of CID's and it's everything is represented now in large scale

945
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,520
because CID obviously is toy, they were small, relatively small.

946
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah.

947
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,780
But in the room in this maze, they're giants.

948
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,880
They are massive.

949
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,260
So you see like kind of that weird baby and it's not big baby from Toy Story 3.

950
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,680
It's that other like weird baby head thing that's in the original Toy Story.

951
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,560
And then you meet a character who I think is an original named character who was played

952
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:48,760
by a person named Babyface, a baby doll that wants to be played with.

953
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,360
With all the arms?

954
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
How many arms?

955
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Like six.

956
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,840
It was the human performer that comes up.

957
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
Is that what you're talking about?

958
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Yeah.

959
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Yeah.

960
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Okay.

961
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Then that's it.

962
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Babyface has six arms.

963
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
And wants to play with you.

964
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Like he's laughing with the crowd.

965
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Is like jumping in the crowd.

966
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
And this is scary.

967
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah.

968
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This is a little scary.

969
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Now, let me ask you this.

970
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Yeah.

971
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Somebody who hates going through a maze because of scare, because you're scared.

972
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
That's not a surprise.

973
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm not shaming you.

974
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,420
That's just, that's the facts.

975
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,400
So would this be too much up to this point or would you do this maze?

976
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,080
I would do this maze.

977
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,640
Babyface seems nice.

978
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,240
Wait, I have it just called six arms doll.

979
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,520
Is Babyface the rotating head?

980
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,680
The giant rotating head?

981
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,320
I would have to go back and watch the review time because I believe he referred to the

982
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,520
character as Babyface who runs up.

983
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Okay.

984
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,120
But I don't know if that's wrong and maybe you saw something different.

985
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,280
But yeah, would you, I'm just saying, would this be too much for you?

986
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,560
Because that is like basically what happens in horror nights.

987
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Somebody pops out in a scary looking costume and kind of runs up to you.

988
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,160
I think the six arm baby looks sweet.

989
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,320
I think it looks misunderstood.

990
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,280
It is misunderstood, but don't you think some of the other characters from the horror nights

991
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,520
mazes would be misunderstood?

992
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,160
And Chucky is funny too.

993
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,960
Oh, Chucky is funny.

994
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Chucky is funny.

995
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
The murderous little doll.

996
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,840
I wish they would let Chucky cut loose a little more in that late night show.

997
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
That's another episode.

998
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,520
I guess we've talked about it already at this point, depending on when this comes out.

999
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,760
But yes, I, there's some issues with that Chucky show.

1000
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
We haven't.

1001
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Sure.

1002
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,880
We'll have talked about it or we'd-

1003
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,000
They canceled, they just canceled this TV show on Peacock.

1004
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Right.

1005
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,280
But I'm just saying like, if you went through a horror nights maze with the 15 Chucky, however

1006
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,000
many Chuckies there are, you like Chucky, but would that help you get through the maze

1007
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
scare wise?

1008
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Who?

1009
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You know what I'm saying?

1010
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1011
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

1012
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,240
Is it, Chucky is more my size.

1013
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Is that better?

1014
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
You are bigger than-

1015
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Like Leatherface and Mike Myers are cute.

1016
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
You are bigger than Chucky.

1017
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
I am bigger than Chucky.

1018
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Chucky is a doll.

1019
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,680
He is a doll.

1020
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,200
Some listeners might think Jason is doll sized from the way-

1021
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,360
I am not doll sized.

1022
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,680
He talks, but he's not doll sized.

1023
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,160
Uh, so, so you're not sure.

1024
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Yeah.

1025
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,080
I will see if you'll be pushing my ass in a wheelchair through these mazes next year.

1026
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,640
Oh, or is that, is that on the table?

1027
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,840
That would add a new level of fright for everyone.

1028
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,840
I feel like.

1029
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
You think that's a possibility?

1030
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I think it's possible.

1031
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
I, I would consider maybe-

1032
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Oh, interesting.

1033
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Yeah.

1034
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,720
I thought you were just going to not do it, but okay, all right, I'm, I'm, I'm on board

1035
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
if you want to do it.

1036
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Cause I don't really want to try to hobble through with a kid.

1037
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
No, no.

1038
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,440
Cause then if I get startled, I'll be like Charlie Brown getting the baseball through,

1039
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,400
I'll spin in the air.

1040
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,280
You will get startled and you'll fall through part of the set, I'm sure.

1041
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I will, yeah.

1042
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
That is not what we need.

1043
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,120
I will fall into the lunch room.

1044
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:56,720
Okay, well, we look now that, you know, Scott has had his second child and he's now saying

1045
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,320
next year will be the year.

1046
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,920
Oh, is he taking the first one?

1047
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
What do you mean?

1048
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
No, no, no.

1049
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Next year he's going to take his first born to these mazes?

1050
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
No, no, I'm sorry.

1051
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
That's horrible.

1052
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,680
I'm just setting it up to explain why he didn't do this year.

1053
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
No, no, you're right.

1054
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,400
He's not, he is not taking his first born who is not that old through a fright fast maze.

1055
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,720
This is apparently a thing though, in the discourse about horror nights sometimes.

1056
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,640
People are like, there's a kid there in a stroller and it's like, what the fuck?

1057
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,560
We talked about this, Gio and I talked about this last year at the Fright Fest, we go,

1058
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,160
Gio counted the amount of strollers or the amount of different things.

1059
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Oh, I forgot.

1060
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
It was over 10.

1061
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
And we were like, my goodness.

1063
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Yeah.

1064
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
So, okay.

1065
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
That's it.

1066
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
If all four of us went to Fright Fest next year at the very least.

1067
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,160
The three of us and a five-year-old, you mean?

1068
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
No, four of us.

1069
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
Oh, oh, us and Gio.

1070
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Okay.

1071
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
Yeah.

1072
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
I mean, if the kids can come with, I guess.

1073
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,120
It's a lot of elevation.

1074
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,480
You guys are going to be pushing that wheelchair out that hill.

1075
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,280
No, believe me, as soon as I said Fright Fest, I went, oh, that's going to be a lot of pushing

1076
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
uphill.

1077
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Yeah.

1078
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I'm going to have to train for that.

1079
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
Yeah.

1080
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Or you just get one of the-

1081
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Start with horror nights.

1082
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,640
Yeah, horror nights are a little easier.

1083
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,240
And we could, have you used the elevator to get down in the lower lot?

1084
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Yeah, it sucks.

1085
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
Okay.

1086
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
It sucks.

1087
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,080
It doesn't go, do you know how it works?

1088
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,120
I don't think I do.

1089
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,240
It doesn't go all the way to lower lot.

1090
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:28,960
It goes halfway down and then you get in like a minibus or a pass van and that puts you

1091
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,960
out-

1092
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Oh, we have talked about this.

1093
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Oh, yeah.

1094
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Behind Transformers.

1095
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Oh, yeah.

1096
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
That sucks.

1097
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,040
They are literally, team members have been very polite.

1098
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,000
They're like, look, if you can get out, you will get down to the lower lot much faster

1099
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,400
if you get out of the wheelchair and use the cane and take the escalators.

1100
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Wow.

1101
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,560
Because it sucks.

1102
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:55,040
It is very odd that the, that elevator is there, but it doesn't go all the way.

1103
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,560
They should let, I mean, this is, I, we've, that's not happening, but they should have

1104
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,760
had a thing where the roller coaster that they're building would take you to the lower

1105
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
lot.

1106
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
Oh, that'd be great.

1107
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
And that literally could work.

1108
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah.

1109
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
That would be faster than-

1110
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
That would be faster.

1111
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
What you're describing.

1112
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
Yeah.

1113
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,760
All right.

1114
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,800
Well, that's interesting that maybe you'll be at a haunt next year.

1115
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah.

1116
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Wow.

1117
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,320
But would you do Fright Fest or you'd rather do horror nights, you think?

1118
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Yeah.

1119
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
We'll see.

1120
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Interesting.

1121
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
I think whatever is funnier.

1122
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,440
Well, Fright Fest generally is funnier.

1123
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Yeah.

1124
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,960
You could go through the Sewer of Souls.

1125
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
That's true.

1126
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
I could see the big shit.

1127
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,640
It's been running for many years.

1128
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,840
It doesn't seem like there's any end in sight for that maze.

1129
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,840
No.

1130
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,440
Because it's been going as long as Gio and I, the first time Gio and I went many years

1131
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,440
ago.

1132
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm curious if they're going to get all the license mazes they got this year.

1133
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah.

1134
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And they had all these.

1135
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah.

1136
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Well, we'll find out next year.

1137
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah.

1138
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,760
You like this scary baby.

1139
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
You like baby face.

1140
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
I think, yeah, I think it's nice.

1141
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,160
It's nice.

1142
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,360
Maybe all the arms remind me of when Spider-Man has extra arms.

1143
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,760
No, I like that too, but he's scary when he's got extra arms because he's got like the

1144
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
spider face.

1145
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Yeah.

1146
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
You like it.

1147
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Okay.

1148
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Well, maybe there'll be a Spider-Man.

1149
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,200
No, because Disney has it.

1150
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,280
I was going to say they would do a Spider-Man maze with his six arms, but they won't.

1151
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,240
So yeah, after this area where you see Sid's like playroom essentially, that's when you

1152
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,720
get to this Manhattan room and it's kind of like a long hallway and this will happen

1153
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,120
on a lot of horror type mazes is that there's like a big set that's inside another room

1154
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,320
and you just look in and then sometimes you'll have the performer pop out and that's what

1155
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,320
this is.

1156
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,760
And it's a very cool, elaborate, scary, sterile looking set.

1157
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
That's very white.

1158
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,520
They have one of the Queen's guards.

1159
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Yes.

1160
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:48,760
What I saw listed is armored cards and I thought that was a play on the word armored cars and

1161
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,640
Jane thought it was a play on the word armed guards.

1162
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,120
So I guess sound off if you think it's armored cars or armed guards.

1163
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,680
Well, wouldn't it be guards because they're actual guards?

1164
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah, but it's one letter off from armored cars.

1165
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,280
But why would it be a plan?

1166
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,280
Cars are not a car.

1167
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,880
It's like imposing like armor, like a Brinks truck, but they're not a car.

1168
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,240
Yeah, we had literally a god of this.

1169
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,440
We talked about this.

1170
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:24,640
She and I yesterday for a few minutes where I'm like, I think it's like a take on armored

1171
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
cars.

1172
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,840
She's like, I think it's a take on armed guards.

1173
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,160
But they are guards.

1174
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,720
They are guards.

1175
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,720
So how would it be?

1176
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,240
Look, I'm happy to let the listeners sound off on what they think it is, but I just don't

1177
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,680
know in what scenario.

1178
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,680
It's cars.

1179
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,840
They're not cars.

1180
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
It's not Lightning McQueen.

1181
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,720
It's just because it's one letter off.

1182
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,720
It was bothering me.

1183
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,720
Okay.

1184
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,400
Well, if it bothers you, I get that.

1185
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,320
Are there any armored cars in the Cars universe?

1186
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,920
There must be, right?

1187
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,920
Must be.

1188
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,480
But yeah, there's got to be a spy car in that second Cars.

1189
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,480
I've seen it, but I don't remember.

1190
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,800
Is there like a James Bond car with like a gun in it?

1191
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,680
Well, that would probably be Holly Shiftwell, wouldn't it?

1192
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,480
Does she have a gun in her nose?

1193
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,640
I don't know if she is armed.

1194
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,160
How many guns are...

1195
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,160
How many...

1196
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Did they develop guns in the Cars world?

1197
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,520
How many characters in Cars have a gun in the glove compartment?

1198
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,640
Yeah.

1199
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,160
That's my question.

1200
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,600
And is the glove compartment represented in the movies?

1201
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
I don't know.

1202
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,360
These are the questions that keep us up at night.

1203
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,360
That could be.

1204
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,720
If they kept doing these horror mazes in Hong Kong, then maybe they would have done like

1205
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
an Evil Cars.

1206
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,720
Yeah.

1207
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,480
Like an Evil Cars room or something.

1208
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,040
So yeah, they take the fake cast member, Mad Hatter kills a guy.

1209
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Mad Hatter kills a guy in front of everyone.

1210
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Tarrant has blood on his hands.

1211
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Yes.

1212
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,160
And it is scary.

1213
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,480
And yeah, I don't know what kids would make of it if you brought your kid into this.

1214
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,800
They would be freaked.

1215
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Yeah.

1216
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,720
I would have been freaked.

1217
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,320
And what's interesting too is I was like, oh, surely they shut this maze stuff down

1218
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
that year.

1219
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
But no, they did do one more.

1220
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Yeah.

1221
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,680
Because I thought, okay, this room is why it's gone.

1222
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Yeah.

1223
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,680
There's no doubt.

1224
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,560
But no, they did this room again.

1225
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560
Right.

1226
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,560
Just changed the room.

1227
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,840
Because I was like, oh yeah, surely like Bob Iger was like looking at review time or something

1228
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,320
on his phone one night and he went, what?

1229
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,600
The Mad Hatter's killing a guy?

1230
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,920
This has got to stop.

1231
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,200
I've got to get to sleep.

1232
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,200
I have to be up at four in the morning to run on a treadmill for some reason.

1233
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Well, and do you think it was a two-shower day, right?

1234
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,120
That's a good day.

1235
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,120
You got a two-shower day.

1236
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,120
That's a good day for him.

1237
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,480
He'd shower in the morning and then before going to an event, he would shower again because

1238
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,280
he had the shower in his office or has the shower in his office.

1239
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
Sure.

1240
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
Yeah.

1241
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
And he lived, what was the phrase?

1242
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
He lived for those two-shower days.

1243
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,040
Lived for the two-shower.

1244
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,280
That seems like, honestly, is that a quote from Bob Iger's book or is that a quote from

1245
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,840
Jason Sheridan from an episode of podcast The Ride?

1246
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,920
Just you saying like wistfully, I love, I longed for those two-shower days.

1247
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,920
I'm not saying you like showers, but it sounds like a folksy.

1248
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
That's more like an convenience for me.

1249
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,760
I'd take two showers in one day.

1250
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
It just sounds like-

1251
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,040
I mean that I got like goo on myself or something.

1252
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,040
Well, do you think Bob Iger got a lot of goo on himself?

1253
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,200
I don't know what the rich get up to, Michael.

1254
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,200
It's not my business.

1255
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Goo play?

1256
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,480
They're into some weird goo stuff and you're not talking about semen, I don't think.

1257
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,320
No, I'm not talking about that goo.

1258
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
Right.

1259
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,440
No, I'm just talking about like rich people.

1260
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,560
Rich people goo.

1261
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Rich people goo.

1262
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,760
Gold flecked, like Goldschlager.

1263
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,520
They're always playing around a Goldschlager.

1264
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,240
Okay, and that's why you would have taken their shower.

1265
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,600
Maybe he just wanted to be fresh though when he went to a premiere or something.

1266
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,800
I suppose that's true.

1267
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,480
Yeah, he wanted to be Spiggins Pan for the Lone Ranger premiere.

1268
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,640
I'm sure Lone Ranger premiere day was a two-shower day for Bob Iger.

1269
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,200
There's no way it wasn't.

1270
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Sure.

1271
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,080
I wonder if you could find photos of him doing something earlier in that day with a different

1272
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,800
outfit on and then see what outfit he was wearing at the premiere.

1273
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
You probably could.

1274
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
Yeah.

1275
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,480
This sounds like a Len Testo thing.

1276
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,440
Was that a Tuxedo premiere or was that a more casual premiere?

1277
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,000
Was Bob dressed as Tonto for that premiere.

1278
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,840
Oh, that'd be great.

1279
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
You know what?

1280
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,840
I forgot to say this up top.

1281
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:44,680
Last Club 3, we were talking about Kingdom Keepers and we were talking about Sunny Eclipse

1282
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,760
Cosmic Rays selling a turkey burger.

1283
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:56,040
I was skeptical that in 2006 that you could get a turkey burger from Cosmic Rays in Disney

1284
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,040
World.

1285
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Okay.

1286
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
You said yes.

1287
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Yeah.

1288
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
That was the healthy choice.

1289
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,720
I said, I know that, but I don't think that was available in 2006.

1290
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,840
I texted Len Testa.

1291
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:16,080
I said, Len, how can I find out what the menu was for Cosmic Rays in 2006?

1292
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,760
And Len texted back one second.

1293
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,480
And it was very quick that he pulled up, and I got to find it.

1294
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Hold on.

1295
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
Forgive me here.

1296
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,720
He pulled up the menu on a website of Cosmic Rays in 2006.

1297
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,060
First I think he accidentally sent me the wrong, he sent me Pecos Bills and there was

1298
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,100
There's no turkey burger on there.

1299
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:48,740
And here it is, Cosmic Rays September 2006 menu right here from web.archive.org.

1300
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,500
And I think it's from, it was from all ears.net.

1301
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
That's right.

1302
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,820
They have the actual menus.

1303
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,780
And if you look, there is not a turkey burger to be found.

1304
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,020
There is a turkey bacon wrap sandwich you can get.

1305
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:09,660
Now to be fair to you, there was a veggie burger sold, but it was not turkey.

1306
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:16,980
Obviously it was not turkey because it's not veggie, but here is the full menu, 2006.

1307
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,340
Where did Maybach find all that ground turkey meat?

1308
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,540
Now, here's also what Len found.

1309
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:30,260
He found a place in Disney World in 2006 where you could get a turkey burger.

1310
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
Okay.

1311
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,940
Under Fountain at the Dolphin Hotel.

1312
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,940
Okay.

1313
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,700
Now, that's not quick service in the parks.

1314
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,700
No.

1315
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,140
So I still think I come out on top in this argument.

1316
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,700
Not that it was a big argument, but you can get, it's under Fountain Specialties.

1317
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:52,780
You could get an Ahi tuna burger, a turkey burger, and a vegetarian sloppy joe.

1318
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,060
That's under the specialties.

1319
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,300
You can get other stuff too, but that was at the Dolphin Hotel.

1320
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:04,180
So Len has come through yet again to help save an argument I was making, I guess, is

1321
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,780
what I'm saying.

1322
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,780
So yeah.

1323
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,300
So what was I saying I'm going to text Len about just now?

1324
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,980
Well, the bigger question was why do the holograms need to eat?

1325
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,420
Oh, well, that's from Kingdom Keepers.

1326
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,420
That is a good question.

1327
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,900
I don't know if Len can answer that question.

1328
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,340
So maybe in later installments I'll find out.

1329
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,940
Yeah, but right there.

1330
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,940
That's interesting.

1331
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:31,620
There's an episode into just looking through the menus for Disney World quick service restaurants.

1332
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,620
I mean, there is.

1333
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,620
Let's be honest, there is.

1334
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,620
Yeah.

1335
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:39,580
Especially now that we have a resource, we have, we know where to look, but yeah.

1336
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:45,740
There was no turkey burger at Pecos Bills, Tall Tale Inn in, this is 2004.

1337
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:51,500
You could get a chicken wrap, half pound bacon double cheeseburger, a quarter pound cheeseburger,

1338
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,980
a quarter pound hot dog, or a chicken salad at Pecos Bills.

1339
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,980
Okay.

1340
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,420
So thank you, Len, for adding clarity there.

1341
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,540
Len really, if Len could just be like our fact checker, if Len could move out to Los

1342
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:11,140
Angeles and just sit in the room and go, Len, what do you think Lowe's like, he's like the

1343
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,700
Joe Rogan guy.

1344
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,700
What's that guy's name?

1345
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,100
I do not know Joe Rogan's guy.

1346
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,220
He always goes, oh, it's like, shoot.

1347
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,100
That's a funny reference, I suppose, if I know it, but he always goes, oh, bring that

1348
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,300
up, whatever his name is.

1349
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,580
And then the guy like brings up, it's usually the guy that brings up something that completely

1350
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:30,860
contradicts a long thing that Joe just said, where he goes, yeah, there were aliens at

1351
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,500
the White House in 1975.

1352
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,580
There are pictures, like you have to see, you have to see, oh, bring it up, bring it

1353
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,580
up.

1354
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,580
Whoever that is.

1355
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,580
And then they go, Joe, that was a hoax.

1356
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,580
That's like a Photoshop.

1357
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,260
And he goes, oh man, well, they looked real.

1358
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,180
That's like usually how the exchange goes.

1359
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,180
Sure.

1360
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,260
Anyway, that Len should do that for us.

1361
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,700
So let's go back to the maze.

1362
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,260
So that was pretty much the end of the first maze.

1363
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,460
Well, there was a, yeah, there were little clips of like Chernobog and stuff at the end.

1364
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,980
Chernobog and there's footage from the cartoons and there's, they say, like, get out of here.

1365
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,020
There's a fire.

1366
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,020
Right.

1367
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,940
So, so you got like a little wrap up.

1368
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,740
It's almost like the end of Great Movie Ride, where you go, and the greatest hits.

1369
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,740
Yeah.

1370
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,820
And a couple more villains on screens.

1371
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,820
And it's kind of short.

1372
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:21,420
I mean, the mazes in general at theme parks are kind of short, but I think I'm giving

1373
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:27,180
it, I'm grading it on a curve, certainly because it's Disney and they don't do these, but yeah,

1374
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,180
it's a little short.

1375
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,460
I think I would have wanted another couple of rooms.

1376
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,580
What do you think about Maze of Madness the second year they did it?

1377
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:40,100
Is that, did you find that longer or was it about the same?

1378
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,700
Yeah, it might have been a little longer, a little longer.

1379
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,540
And maybe it wasn't, maybe it's just watching it through YouTube.

1380
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,540
Yeah.

1381
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:53,100
It's like the video, the video is long, is basically as long as a video walkthrough at

1382
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,780
Horror Nights or something.

1383
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,780
But maybe I was expecting a bigger, maybe I'm really just looking for the bigger finale.

1384
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,780
Yeah.

1385
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,860
Because it felt like, oh, the finale is just screens.

1386
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,180
And it felt like you wanted like a big, oftentimes at Horror Nights or not, the finale will be

1387
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,500
like a big like puppet or animatronic or something that like scares you.

1388
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,300
This is, well, okay, let's talk about the, I'm all over the place.

1389
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,500
Let's talk about the next one before I start going off into different tandems.

1390
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,320
So Maze of Madness starts much the same way.

1391
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:33,260
You go into the professor's library office, but then the very friend, and it's implied

1392
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:38,580
that the professor is not there, he's missing.

1393
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:44,780
The first scene you go to is a terrifying Pinocchio.

1394
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,780
Yes.

1395
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,180
This is so freaky.

1396
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,740
This might be the scary, this might be the most upsetting thing in any of these.

1397
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,740
Well, it's, yes.

1398
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:00,060
And it's, it's very freaky because of a similar thing with The Mad Hatter where Pinocchio

1399
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,060
should be your friend.

1400
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,500
He's your guy.

1401
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Yeah.

1402
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,580
He's your little wooden guy.

1403
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:14,380
He is now a human performer with prosthetics and makeup on and looks haunted.

1404
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,380
He looks like haunted Robert the doll.

1405
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,980
He is chained up.

1406
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,980
He's chained up.

1407
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,180
The implication seems to be he never got out of Stromboli's carnival.

1408
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,180
Right.

1409
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,820
He's been performing forever, ever since he's been kidnapped.

1410
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,620
And they're playing a haunting version of I've got no strings on me.

1411
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,180
Which is, I wonder if it's like similar to the age of Ultron trailer.

1412
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,260
You remember they were, there's a haunting version of got no strings on me in the Avengers

1413
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,580
age of Ultron trailer.

1414
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:49,620
But his skin looks like it's melt, it's supposed to be wood, but his skin looks like it's melting.

1415
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,780
And he's just, he wants you to help him essentially.

1416
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:59,220
He doesn't murder someone like Mad Hatter, but seeing this character in this way would

1417
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,660
have freaked the shit out of me.

1418
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:05,860
Is this just how Scott perceives Pinocchio in any instance?

1419
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,860
I think so.

1420
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:12,780
I think that this is how he, yeah, we see cute little Pinocchio from the original movie.

1421
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:21,940
He sees a human being dressed up with wooden skin, chained to like a dirty carnival, trying

1422
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,420
to get free.

1423
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,780
So I mean, it's a good thing I guess he's not here today because yeah, this is an adult

1424
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:37,460
wearing little shorts or little suspenders with wood skin and chains.

1425
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:42,380
And there's another one where if Bob Iger's sitting at home and he's looking on his iPhone,

1426
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,340
he's checking out review time, one of his favorite theme park channels.

1427
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,540
He's going to go, wait, we did what?

1428
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,660
What did we approve here?

1429
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,540
And it's also, here's the thing about Pinocchio's outfit.

1430
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,940
It's dirty.

1431
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,940
It's dirty.

1432
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,140
He's tall.

1433
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,140
He's tall Pinocchio.

1434
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,420
Human-sized Pinocchio, like I said, and his outfit is dirty.

1435
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,820
Like the white, like part of his big collar, he's got big blue bow tie and it looks like

1436
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,620
almost like he had makeup on.

1437
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,180
It's like when you wear like some sort of makeup on your neck and maybe you were on

1438
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,760
a white shirt or something and it gets on there.

1439
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,660
This looks like it just, he sweated it all off.

1440
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:25,660
It says on the fan page, he's been a slave performing.

1441
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,140
There's also dirty puppets all over the-

1442
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,340
There are dirty ass puppets all over the wall.

1443
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,340
Yeah.

1444
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,620
This is wild that they would approve this.

1445
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,660
I don't even know that this is what I would want.

1446
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,140
That's even how disturbed I am by it is like, if I was dreaming up a maze, I don't know

1447
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,740
that I want to see dirty Pinocchio and his dirty puppet friends.

1448
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:54,220
At least this version, like I feel like I watched a video about the Halloween stuff.

1449
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:01,980
Pushcartons Williamsburg, the carpet bagger went, that's a YouTuber.

1450
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:08,180
He's been doing it a while and he goes everywhere, I feel like, but there is a fairy tale themed

1451
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,980
like scare zone kind of thing.

1452
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,420
I'm for like twisted fairy tales in general.

1453
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:21,180
I'm just saying from Disney, this is maybe too much to see my friend, my version of Pinocchio

1454
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,180
like this.

1455
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:25,660
The CG one was bad enough.

1456
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,220
Now that's a good idea.

1457
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:31,980
We see the CG one chained up and dirty.

1458
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,220
That's good.

1459
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:37,220
And he has like makeup all over and wooden skin.

1460
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,580
And then I'm comfortable with it because he's not my friend.

1461
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,220
No offense to him.

1462
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:45,140
He's just not my friend from childhood, like the original Pinocchio.

1463
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,140
He's more of an acquaintance.

1464
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,580
Knew him in passing.

1465
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:52,500
So yes, this is right off the bat.

1466
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,540
This one I think wins for scariness because I'm like genuinely upset by it.

1467
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,460
Then you get a little Monsters Inc.

1468
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,140
And this is more along the lines of what I think they would do even if they did a maze

1469
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,340
in the domestic parks where you see like the hazmat suit characters and it's like a moody

1470
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,860
hallway with some lights.

1471
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,900
Yeah, just changing the lighting and sound and stuff.

1472
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,180
It's like, oh yeah, hazmat suit is creepy.

1473
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,380
That's our movie thing.

1474
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,660
Even though these guys are like comic relief in the Monsters Inc. movie.

1475
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,660
So like in this scene, like this is a little kind of transitional scene.

1476
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:35,700
This is kind of a fun thing that I could see them doing now even because nothing so nefarious

1477
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,700
happens.

1478
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Ra's.

1479
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,700
There's some Ra's.

1480
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,700
You get a little Ra's voice.

1481
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,700
Yes, that's true.

1482
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,220
The character from Monsters Inc.

1483
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:46,580
And then we get to the Mad Hatter.

1484
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:50,080
The big, other than not just the Mad Hatter.

1485
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:55,460
And Jason, forgive me, what's the name of the White Rabbit, the real name?

1486
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,220
The White Rabbit or the Mad Hatter?

1487
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,420
Well, you know what?

1488
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,420
Hit me with both.

1489
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,420
Terrence.

1490
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,420
Terrence.

1491
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,420
No, not Terrence.

1492
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,420
Damn it.

1493
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,940
Terrence Hightop and Nivens McTwisp.

1494
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,220
Nivens McTwisp.

1495
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,420
So you come and see these two characters.

1496
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,460
It feels like someone's like, what's the most British name you could just make up off the

1497
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,460
top of your head?

1498
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,460
I don't know.

1499
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,300
Like Nivens McTwisp, great.

1500
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
Right at that.

1501
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,300
Nivens McTwisp.

1502
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,300
Yeah.

1503
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:30,020
So you see them and they are very Tim Burton'd out.

1504
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,300
For some reason, more so to me than the last year, even though that's not true.

1505
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,660
But they are scary, but fun.

1506
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,660
But fun.

1507
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,060
I will say they are fun.

1508
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,020
This is all façade, like a fake storefront.

1509
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,020
Yes.

1510
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:52,300
And they have a whole sort of façade that looks like a nocturne alley in Diagon Alley.

1511
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Sure.

1512
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Whatever it's called.

1513
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,300
That little dark area.

1514
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,300
The spooky alley.

1515
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,300
Yeah.

1516
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:05,020
So it looks like the, you know, it looks like a narrow British street from 150 years ago.

1517
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,020
And it looks great.

1518
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,020
This looks great.

1519
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:13,100
That hatter exterior of his haberdashery looks very good.

1520
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:18,940
With all this head cutting off, you'd think he was more like Johnny Depp's Sweeney Todd

1521
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,980
than Johnny Depp's Tarrant Hightop.

1522
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,380
Oh man.

1523
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,140
Your Netflix special is going to be packed.

1524
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,540
It's going to be packed with all, either you're going to make like an Amber Heard comment

1525
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,020
or something about poop in the bed.

1526
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,020
Oh no.

1527
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,060
But that's a whole nother.

1528
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,060
Oh yeah.

1529
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,660
Didn't Johnny Depp refer to, whoever pooped in Johnny Depp's bed, didn't he refer to it

1530
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,860
as taking a grumpy?

1531
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:43,860
I believe.

1532
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,340
I think that is right.

1533
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:50,360
I'll edit this out if it's not correct, but I'm almost positive that he said like dropping

1534
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,900
a grumpy or taking a grumpy when he was referring to poop.

1535
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,220
I think.

1536
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,380
Pretty sure.

1537
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,180
I don't know that from anywhere else other than Johnny Depp.

1538
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,500
So I think that memory is correct.

1539
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:10,060
There's no poop in this, but this is very Sweeney Todd, this section.

1540
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:15,100
It's not a barber shop, but it's like a blade and it looks like an old timey, it could have

1541
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,660
been an old timey barber shop.

1542
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,580
But this is cool.

1543
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,340
I want to see this.

1544
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:25,060
I mean, I know Scott would be upset by this and some of the pictures like this, look,

1545
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,280
look at this.

1546
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,280
This is scary.

1547
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,280
Yeah.

1548
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,980
And they look very, especially white rabbit, cause it's an animal, but look very Zoobilly

1549
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:32,460
Zoo.

1550
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,460
Yes.

1551
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:39,460
Which is a terrifying show I watched as a kid, but was fascinated with.

1552
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:42,620
But yeah, this scene, I think this scene is even better than the first year.

1553
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,660
I think I like the scene better.

1554
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,660
Yeah.

1555
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,660
What do you think?

1556
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,660
I think so.

1557
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:54,800
Cause I think the first year they were kind of going for more of like an old timey asylum

1558
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,800
sort of thing.

1559
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Yeah.

1560
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,280
And it looked good too, but this like, there's more depth to this and there's like, it really

1561
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,640
like looks, it looks permanent, I guess is what I'm saying.

1562
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,640
Yeah.

1563
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,240
It looks like it wasn't just a temporary maze.

1564
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,240
Yeah.

1565
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,960
So much of this stuff looks so expensive.

1566
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,440
Yes.

1567
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,560
And I liked the interaction between the two characters.

1568
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,960
Then is next Beast Castle.

1569
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,960
Is that the next room?

1570
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,360
Yeah, Beast Castle.

1571
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,480
And then Hades is the end.

1572
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Right.

1573
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
And then Hades is at the end.

1574
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,720
And there's not a good video of Hades, did I miss that?

1575
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,440
I didn't find good videos of either of these.

1576
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Yeah.

1577
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,480
Cause the review time, they don't have the video section of that.

1578
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:39,560
Then like Hades goes, like there's other demons and they go to hell and stuff or something.

1579
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:44,280
And that makes it again, those are the villains of the, I assume Gaston is in there.

1580
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,240
No, I think it's just like a suit of armor, isn't it?

1581
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,240
Oh, okay.

1582
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,560
Cause I didn't see, I didn't see what happens cause they, they, he puts pictures in that

1583
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,560
walkthrough.

1584
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,560
Yeah.

1585
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,040
Do you have it written down?

1586
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,040
No.

1587
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,840
I just had the fandom page open.

1588
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:06,560
You hear the, the voice narrating the top of the story.

1589
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,560
Suit of armor comes alive at the end.

1590
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:19,360
I think that he was the one who caught Professor Wu to punish him for what he did.

1591
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,040
So very Hays code coded.

1592
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,640
Wait, what did he do though?

1593
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,640
Yeah.

1594
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,200
He opened up the barriers between all these realms.

1595
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
I think.

1596
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,120
Oh, and Hades is upset by that.

1597
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,120
I guess so.

1598
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
He loves chaos.

1599
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,120
Why would he be mad?

1600
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,080
You know, that's a good point.

1601
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
That doesn't make sense to me.

1602
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,760
I mean, I think that's what happens in the maze.

1603
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,440
I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to me from a narrative perspective.

1604
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,160
It's like, wouldn't he be thrilled?

1605
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,160
Yeah.

1606
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:51,080
I think it starts to lose some of the heat at the end of this maze, you know, like trying

1607
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,640
to justify, like, wouldn't like Peter Pan be mad at him?

1608
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,360
Like, what did you do?

1609
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,600
The barrier between worlds has been, it's been destroyed.

1610
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,280
That's really not Peter's area of interest though.

1611
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,680
It's not his interest, but if he has to rise to the occasion, he will.

1612
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,680
Okay.

1613
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,040
Well, I feel like rising to the occasion is more grown up coded.

1614
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
Yes.

1615
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,040
And he doesn't want to grow up.

1616
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,800
But don't you think Peter rises to the occasion in Peter Pan?

1617
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,680
I suppose he does.

1618
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,120
He saves the day.

1619
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,120
He saves the day.

1620
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:30,040
You don't think, you don't think he would, like, if he had to fight aliens or fight inter-dimensional

1621
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,400
beings, like he wouldn't rise to the occasion?

1622
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,600
Oh, now this is, this is intriguing me.

1623
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,560
I've never thought about Peter Pan fighting aliens or inter-dimensional beings.

1624
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,920
Well, think about it.

1625
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
It should be one of these mazes.

1626
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,520
If aliens invaded Neverland, oh, we got to sell this.

1627
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,760
We, I think that's public domain too.

1628
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
Yeah.

1629
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,720
Well, it's like, quite frankly, it was my idea, so I don't know.

1630
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
We're not selling anything.

1631
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,720
Well, okay.

1632
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
I'm going to sell it tomorrow.

1633
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
You weren't going to do anything with it.

1634
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,400
You're doing Jason Snow White and I'm doing Michael's alien Peter Pan.

1635
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,400
Okay.

1636
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,880
Peter Pan and the saucer men from Mars.

1637
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,800
And we both got these focus groups that are breathing down our necks.

1638
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Right.

1639
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,880
The, so I'm just thinking, like, wouldn't it be, it wouldn't have been like a hero to

1640
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,880
stop it.

1641
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,720
But I guess Hades, I mean, maybe Hades is mad that like the, because Hades is, you know,

1642
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,840
hell is his territory.

1643
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,160
So maybe like some of his hell friends got out.

1644
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,440
Maybe that's true.

1645
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,440
Yeah.

1646
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,560
So maybe it's something like that.

1647
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,960
I mean, obviously some villains don't all have to be friends with each other.

1648
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,960
They could have competing interests.

1649
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,560
Once Hades persuades the guests that the professor is guilty for what he did, he transforms into

1650
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,360
a demon.

1651
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,360
Yeah.

1652
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:49,560
The narrative kind of, uh, I mean, it's not so important to know.

1653
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:56,200
But yes, it's, uh, like, I get, like, I guess it was there a walk around Hades or do they

1654
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,720
sort of say, ah, Hades grabbed him and see you later.

1655
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,720
Oh, that's good question.

1656
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,180
I would assume there is a Hades, but I didn't see any pictures because if there is a walk

1657
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,840
around Hades that okay boogie this year.

1658
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
Yeah.

1659
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,560
I've seen that like, obviously they have the suit, but I didn't see like any of the promotional

1660
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,000
material with Hades, which feels like that would have been, that would have been like

1661
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:23,720
a priority to be like, well, we've got to show Hades because he's such a, a fun bad

1662
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,720
guy.

1663
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,720
Yeah.

1664
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,840
Um, I'm sure it played well.

1665
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,080
It does feel like both mazes, the, the Mad Hatter was the main event.

1666
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Yeah.

1667
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,960
It feels like that was where the most money was spent, but it is, yeah, it is an interesting

1668
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:47,400
what if, if Disney were to go down this rabbit hole, uh, this, um, what's the McTwisp hole?

1669
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
Nivens McTwisp?

1670
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Nivens McTwisp hole.

1671
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,040
I don't know why I can't remember anything today.

1672
01:13:52,040 --> 01:14:00,840
Um, but yeah, I, I, I'm like seeing all these photos, like, like this is Dr. Woo photo and

1673
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,360
like I wonder, like maybe ultimately because kids are coming, it just doesn't make sense

1674
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
to do it.

1675
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
It just doesn't.

1676
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:13,780
That seemed to be the review time takeaway of like even in Hong Kong, they're like, uh.

1677
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,780
Because there's a larger, I know this is, this is interesting because, you know, from

1678
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:25,380
the time they did Alien Encounter onwards, the debate of how intense are we allowed to

1679
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:31,620
make a Disney experience because obviously there's adults that want something a little

1680
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:36,820
more intense and now Disney owns a bunch of properties that are scary.

1681
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,820
Oh yeah.

1682
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:43,260
They always have had some scary, right, aliens, predator, planet of the apes.

1683
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,740
Where does that fit into Disney parks?

1684
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,740
Does it fit?

1685
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:49,740
Yeah.

1686
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,660
Cause it's like, man, that would be cool.

1687
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,140
And now obviously they're doing a Villains Land, but I bet they are doing so much focus

1688
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:03,500
grouping trying to make sure that it's Villains Land, but it's not too scary.

1689
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
Like it's, I'm sure.

1690
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,660
Like there's not just going to be a xenomorph greeting you as you go into Villains Land.

1691
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:12,260
I would love it if there was a xenomorph in Villains Land in Disney World.

1692
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,300
I don't think there's going to be.

1693
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,300
Sure.

1694
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,340
I don't think Predator is going to be roaming Disney World.

1695
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,820
No, that would be great if the Predator ruined the Villains Land.

1696
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:28,380
If they said we're draining the rivers of America and the Predator would roam in the

1697
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,380
ditch.

1698
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:36,300
We're draining the Villains of America as we are trying to catch the camouflaged Predator.

1699
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:42,020
Or they just announced Predator is now camouflaged and roaming Disney World in Magic Kingdoms

1700
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,020
specifically.

1701
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:49,740
Instead of being the grand marshal of the parade, one lucky family will be abducted

1702
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,620
by the Predator.

1703
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,620
Right.

1704
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:58,340
I guess, I mean, we want Predator in the Disney parks.

1705
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,300
That is for sure.

1706
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,860
We all agree Predator belongs in the parks, but is it ever going to happen?

1707
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,580
Because it has to be a separate park, right?

1708
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,180
Like you can't do Predator in an existing park.

1709
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:16,780
I guess they essentially need some sort of adventure park, some sort of islands of adventure

1710
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
park.

1711
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,780
It does feel like that.

1712
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,780
It does.

1713
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,900
And it feels like you could put something like this in a park like that.

1714
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:28,500
But I don't know that money wise they'll ever think that it makes enough sense to do it.

1715
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:33,380
But yeah, you could put a whole, you could make it a, yeah.

1716
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,180
You could put Springfield next to Kohog.

1717
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,180
That's right.

1718
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,180
To where that would go to.

1719
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,180
To the Nostromo?

1720
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,180
Yeah.

1721
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,180
Foxland.

1722
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,180
Right.

1723
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,900
It would go in Foxland, but I don't think Foxland is going to come.

1724
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:51,620
So I don't think, I don't think we'll ever get, I mean, you could do a safer version

1725
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,140
of this.

1726
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:58,380
You could do like a sea narrative with like characters like that and then use the Disney

1727
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,580
characters and then they don't have to kill anybody, but it could be a walkthrough.

1728
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:07,140
They do like a cabaret show, like on the cruise ship.

1729
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,500
Like a sexy show?

1730
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Yeah.

1731
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Well, that's a whole other.

1732
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Like a musical show.

1733
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,500
Okay.

1734
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,500
Is it sexy though?

1735
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
No, it's very chaste.

1736
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,500
It's a family program.

1737
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Okay.

1738
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,500
As long as it's chaste.

1739
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,060
On a Disney cruise ship.

1740
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,180
This was a thing that I was thinking like even, and Universal is going to do it soon.

1741
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,780
I think that's what they're doing with this fan, whatever this fan event that I can't

1742
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,620
think of the name of where they're having Star Trek and Ghostbuster representation

1743
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,740
in March.

1744
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,860
They're doing like a non-horror ticketed event.

1745
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,860
Right.

1746
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:38,860
Coming up, which I'm very excited.

1747
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,540
I don't think I've said this on the show.

1748
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,740
They're going to recreate the Enterprise-D.

1749
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,420
Good.

1750
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,260
And this is just because I was stupid and didn't go and see the Star Trek experience

1751
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,340
in Vegas.

1752
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,340
This is my dream.

1753
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,340
Yeah.

1754
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:56,180
To live, I think even, and no offense to the X-Men's mansion, living on the Enterprise-D

1755
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,140
is all I wanted to do as a kid.

1756
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,100
Well, I just, I sent it to you.

1757
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:04,900
I only learned about the X-Men event.

1758
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:11,740
Is it in Chicago or Milwaukee where like they rent a mansion and there's panels and they

1759
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:16,180
essentially convert this mansion into the Xavier school for a weekend.

1760
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,140
We should send you, at least you get sent there next year maybe.

1761
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,140
Yeah.

1762
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:24,940
Because it, I mean you got Chris Claremont walking around, you got Gail Simone, the current

1763
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,380
writer of Uncanny X-Men was there recently I think.

1764
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:33,140
I am interested in it, yeah, but my point just basically was just like, okay, like non-horror

1765
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:39,100
mazes, themed environments, walkthroughs, which Haunted Mansion was almost a walkthrough.

1766
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,020
That was the initial idea in Disney.

1767
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:45,780
And then it's easier to get people in and out by putting them in a little vehicle.

1768
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:51,560
But obviously walkthroughs work fine because haunts have been making tons of money forever.

1769
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:57,300
It's interesting though to see it like in another non-horror genre.

1770
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,300
Yes.

1771
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,100
Like how will these be well received enough?

1772
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:09,860
Could this be the testing of like, would this, could this hold a full attraction?

1773
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,180
You mean universal or are you talking about this Disney thing?

1774
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,980
No, the universal thing.

1775
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,980
Like a year round walkthrough.

1776
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,300
A year round, yeah, walkthrough.

1777
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:23,100
I bet the thought is, and this is based on nothing but my speculation, I bet the thought

1778
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:29,540
is well, these ticketed events make a lot of money and we have these spaces and I know

1779
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,260
they start disassembling and assembling for Horror Nights next year as soon as the haunt

1780
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,260
is over.

1781
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,980
But I wonder if they've sort of crunched some numbers and figured things out and like, well,

1782
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:44,740
what if we put a bunch of other stuff in those buildings for a few months and charge an extra

1783
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,780
amount of money and see if it works?

1784
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:53,380
So I'm sure they're testing that out and they could do a full fledged version of it in Florida

1785
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,140
if it works.

1786
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:01,500
It would be interesting down the line to see if anything from one of these short run events

1787
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:09,700
get promoted, you know, because they did do the Walking Dead maze for a number of years.

1788
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:16,660
That was year round until they're like, oh, this costs a lot of money to put up, it costs

1789
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:20,500
a lot of actors even if it's mostly sound and lighting, you know.

1790
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:27,100
And that's now basically, I think that space is just Horror Nights permanently, I think,

1791
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,780
because it's over by where the mystery machine is always hanging out.

1792
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,540
But there's a maze right there too.

1793
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,500
There is just a full Horror Nights maze.

1794
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,260
It's a Quiet Place maze this year.

1795
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,260
Oh, okay.

1796
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:46,120
Which, but yeah, so like, I think that this type of experience, because like we did Delusion

1797
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,600
a couple years ago, which is this, basically they do it every year.

1798
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,960
It's like a very immersive 30 minute-ish thing.

1799
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,600
You walk through and there's big sets and performers and you're involved in the narrative.

1800
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:04,600
And I was like, this to me felt like something they should do as the finale of the star cruiser,

1801
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,520
the galactic star cruiser, where like you give somebody like a 25 minute immersive walkthrough

1802
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,520
maze type thing.

1803
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:17,200
And that's not, it doesn't have to be horror, but like, I do think there's a lot of value

1804
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,480
in doing stuff like this.

1805
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,280
And I don't think, and Disney has just not done it, and I guess money-wise it doesn't

1806
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,280
make sense for them.

1807
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,820
But they're cool.

1808
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,180
All that to say they're cool.

1809
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,720
And I feel like they could do it in a lot of different ways.

1810
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,260
Like even using the star cruiser building as a walkthrough maze thing that's like an

1811
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:43,740
hour long, where you run into human performers and maybe new animatronics and lighting effects

1812
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,780
and like all that stuff is so cool.

1813
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:51,340
And I feel like Disney does not do it enough.

1814
01:21:51,340 --> 01:22:00,060
An immersive thing like Delusion or Sleep No More trend for many years in New York with

1815
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,260
a Disney budget would really be something.

1816
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,260
Right.

1817
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,260
Yes.

1818
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:10,460
Like Horror Nights, I'm sure it's expensive to make all these new mazes, but Horror Nights

1819
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,900
I feel like sometimes I feel like it does not, does the Knott's mazes look better than

1820
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:14,900
Horror Nights?

1821
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,980
Do they have a bigger budget or are they just like able to work like better because they

1822
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,980
don't have a big.

1823
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,420
I think it's just doing less with more maybe.

1824
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:27,460
Because I suspect, and maybe this is wrong, doing more with less, excuse me.

1825
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:31,140
I suspect sometimes with the Horror Nights mazes that it's like the exact same layout

1826
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,140
as the year before and as the sort of the same like dead spaces and they just like fill

1827
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,140
up the rooms.

1828
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,140
Sure.

1829
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:42,180
That could be wrong, but it feels right to me because sometimes it feels very same-y

1830
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,180
in there.

1831
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:47,220
I think they repeat a lot more Knott's.

1832
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,460
Well absolutely they do.

1833
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:55,420
So mazes come back a lot and I feel like there's only two usually new, two new a year at Knott's.

1834
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:58,500
There's an expectation with Horror Nights.

1835
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:05,220
That is fair that Horror Nights is putting new stuff in so that it's more work to do.

1836
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:12,220
But yes, all that to say is that if Disney had like these little spots to do like new

1837
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:18,380
mazes and new kind of immersive experiences like they could just sort of plug and play

1838
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,620
things in there.

1839
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,780
But that's not the reality.

1840
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:29,380
That's not the reality we live in and we can't always get what we want, sadly.

1841
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,060
But this was cool.

1842
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,980
They have stopped doing it.

1843
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,820
But now I want to really keep an eye on like Hong Kong like because there's other stuff

1844
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:38,820
too that I was in.

1845
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,940
There's like a shield thing that happened in Hong Kong.

1846
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,180
Oh, a Marvel thing.

1847
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:46,080
Yeah, I learned about that.

1848
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,900
I came across that doing this.

1849
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,500
It was called Marvel's mission, Dimension of Danger.

1850
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:56,460
Excuse me, Dimensions of Danger.

1851
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,220
And I just, yeah, I just learned about it.

1852
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,580
It was in, as we said, the pavilion.

1853
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:05,460
You would help Doctor Strange recover the portal Nexus before Hydra does.

1854
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:09,380
Along the way, you'll battle the forces of evil alongside Black Widow and Hawkeye.

1855
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:13,380
Join forces with the mighty Thor Odinson in Odin's vault.

1856
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:16,500
Lend Star-Lord a hand in the collector's museum.

1857
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,540
So it was like a walkthrough maze thing with like a little narrative, like an immersive

1858
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,540
thing.

1859
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,980
So, yeah, come on.

1860
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:25,980
Come on.

1861
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:26,980
Let's see it.

1862
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,980
Let's do it.

1863
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,660
Is there, I mean, like having a Deadpool walkthrough would be great.

1864
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,180
There's so much you could do.

1865
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,420
There's so much you could do.

1866
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,220
Is there one property you want to be immersed in?

1867
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:40,940
That has to be Disney or Universal?

1868
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:41,940
Disney.

1869
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,220
Because we're, I'm lamenting the lack of Disney stuff here.

1870
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,220
Yeah.

1871
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:51,260
But is there one you would want like, obviously Marvel, but you have to remember that the

1872
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,220
Marvel is not the Marvel of Marvel Superhero Island.

1873
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,220
No, right.

1874
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:59,620
It is the MCU aesthetic, reality based.

1875
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,180
It's not comic book style.

1876
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:04,260
I think the world, I think WALL-E.

1877
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,540
You want to be immersed in WALL-E in the garbage planet?

1878
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:10,540
Like all the robots, like all the robots in the hover chairs and stuff.

1879
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,540
Oh, later on in the movie.

1880
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,540
Not on the trash planet.

1881
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,540
Yeah, later on in the movie.

1882
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:21,060
I mean, if you are helping WALL-E and Eva clean up Earth, that could be fun.

1883
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:26,260
If you meet creatures and other things.

1884
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,180
Here's what I think would be fun to do.

1885
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:33,060
If you could, and there's no space for it, at least in Disneyland.

1886
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:39,940
If you, like hypothetically, you could build a little building behind pirates somewhere

1887
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:43,300
and you could get off pirates and then you could go through this immersive thing where

1888
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:49,380
you walked through, as we showed, as they portrayed in the other maze, the pirate jail.

1889
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,380
Okay.

1890
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:53,180
And you could sort of walk through the back of the ride.

1891
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:55,340
They obviously wouldn't actually be the ride.

1892
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,340
Yeah.

1893
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,260
But you could like portray different parts of the pirate's ride.

1894
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,980
Oh, you could see other scenes.

1895
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,980
Yes.

1896
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,780
And you could do the same with the Haunted Mansion.

1897
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,780
That's good.

1898
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:05,780
Mansion would probably be.

1899
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:06,780
Yeah.

1900
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,220
Maybe that one makes even more sense because then you could go through different rooms

1901
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,740
And then like one of the windows looks out into, you know, not the stretching room, but

1902
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,780
looks into the like dining room.

1903
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,700
So you could see it from different vantage points.

1904
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:22,340
And maybe it's just a projection or obviously it's not, again, you couldn't make it actually

1905
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,340
in the ride.

1906
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,940
I mean, they should do that with the store they're building next to Mansion.

1907
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,620
Well, that's pretty small though.

1908
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,620
Yeah.

1909
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,260
But if you do projection and stuff.

1910
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,260
Oh, well that's, yeah, yeah.

1911
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,260
Something like that.

1912
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,980
Like screens, almost as if it was a shed.

1913
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,980
It was a dirty shed.

1914
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:38,980
Dirty shed.

1915
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,980
Yeah.

1916
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,460
You could look into the mansion.

1917
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,700
You could peep into the mansion.

1918
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,420
You could creep on the mansion.

1919
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,420
Sure.

1920
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:50,300
But like stuff like that, people would go wild and that would, they would pay a lot of

1921
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,300
money for that.

1922
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,300
Sure.

1923
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:58,940
But yeah, to see like the famous, to go into Barnabas T. Bullion's desk, you go into his

1924
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,220
office and see his desk.

1925
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:04,060
Root around in there, try to find some of his personal effects.

1926
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,540
Find his gun in his desk because you know, he had a gun.

1927
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,700
Oh yeah.

1928
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:12,780
So yeah, that's a good question for listeners too, EF.

1929
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:19,940
Other than just suggesting next month's Club 3, is there a maze, a Disney property maze

1930
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:20,940
that you would want to see?

1931
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,940
Sure.

1932
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:25,660
Because I, yeah, there's a lot of stuff they could do and yeah, like Star Wars, I think

1933
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:29,060
truly you could do a really crazy maze.

1934
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,060
Yeah.

1935
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,820
I think that's easy.

1936
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:37,940
And certainly with that giant empty galactic star cruiser, like yeah, make it a theatrical

1937
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:38,940
show.

1938
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:39,940
Right.

1939
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:47,340
Make it a theatrical show and have it, what's the, Skeleton Crew is the new one I think

1940
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,140
coming soon.

1941
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,140
That's about the kids.

1942
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,140
That's like Amblin, Star Wars.

1943
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,140
Oh, that's the Stranger Things.

1944
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:57,380
And that's, and that's where people have put together online that boy, some of these characters

1945
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:00,460
look like Captain EO characters.

1946
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:04,780
So put them in there too, is what I'm saying.

1947
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:09,340
Anyway, you've survived Podcast The Ride Crypt 3.

1948
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,340
Thank you for listening.

1949
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,860
Jason, do you have any other thoughts on your way out?

1950
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:13,860
No.

1951
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:14,860
No.

1952
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,860
I made a note.

1953
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:18,420
I was telling you, oh man, I have so much stuff to do before.

1954
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,420
Yeah.

1955
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,420
So much stuff to get to.

1956
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,940
And you immediately forgot your Halloween name.

1957
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,140
Well, I forgot my, that wasn't even a thing I was like worried I was going to, I wasn't

1958
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,140
even thinking about that.

1959
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,140
That's why I forgot it.

1960
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:32,020
I definitely wrote right before we started Cosmic Ray Burger, because I wanted to make

1961
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:38,220
sure that I got to the Cosmic Ray, because on the last, this is only for subscribed,

1962
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:42,980
the elite subscribers to know this about the menu at Cosmic Ray's.

1963
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,860
Well, finally they've gotten some closure.

1964
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,700
Finally they've gotten some closure.

1965
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:53,140
And don't tell anybody on the other tier or on the main free feed about this.

1966
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,300
Because we'll know.

1967
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,060
Because we'll know if you do.

1968
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,780
But anyway, take care.

1969
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,580
Happy hauntings.
