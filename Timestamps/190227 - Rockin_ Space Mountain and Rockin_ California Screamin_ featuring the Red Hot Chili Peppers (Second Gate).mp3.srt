1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:29,156
To RHCP at DLR on PTR 2G.

3
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:33,196
That's right, today you didn't ask for it.

4
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:37,616
Today we are talking about the red hot chili peppers

5
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:40,396
takeover of Disneyland.

6
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:47,156
You remember it in the spring of 2007, right?

7
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,496
For four months.

8
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,836
Well look, my name is Mike Carlson here.

9
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:52,836
Podcast right here.

10
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:53,296
Oh, I didn't introduce yourself.

11
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,316
Yeah, I'm big SG.

12
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:56,436
Yeah, and I'm a.

13
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:57,836
King of the space rockers.

14
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:00,216
Little, I'm a tall MC.

15
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:01,956
The other space rocker.

16
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,416
I'm Jason Sheridan, and I don't believe I asked

17
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,216
for this either.

18
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,076
Yeah, well, yeah, why this?

19
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,976
Why are we doing this?

20
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,716
Why are we talking about the red hot chili peppers

21
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:15,796
being the soundtrack of two rides at Disneyland?

22
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:19,096
Well, because I was at Disneyland a couple days ago,

23
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,396
and I was in a crowd, and somebody behind me

24
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,316
was talking about it, and I remembered,

25
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:25,876
because of that, that it happened and was funny,

26
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,276
and I texted you guys, and now we're doing it.

27
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:31,036
Wait, yeah, I think we were both immediately on board.

28
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:34,356
Thanks to that person for reminding me

29
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,636
of the Celestrius affair.

30
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,396
Yeah, this is very much in our wheelhouse.

31
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,096
Oh yeah.

32
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,656
Yeah, limited run option.

33
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,356
Limited run magic that's also a little odd.

34
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,716
A little confusing.

35
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:51,476
And pop culture mashing up with theme park culture

36
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:54,656
in a strange way, which this certainly is.

37
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:59,636
My first time going on Screamin' and Space Mountain

38
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,876
was soundtracked by the red hot chili peppers.

39
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,176
No kidding, wow.

40
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:06,656
Well, then I'm so glad we brought, wow, you'd never,

41
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,036
I mean, you've done it in Florida, obviously,

42
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,636
but not your first Disneyland taste.

43
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,136
Right, because I didn't go to Disneyland

44
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:13,076
until I moved out here in 2007.

45
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:14,656
No kidding, wow.

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,056
So yeah, it's wild.

47
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,976
So in your mind, the proper version.

48
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,776
Yeah, the real version of Space Mountain

49
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,316
is with the red hot chili peppers

50
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:24,276
playing on the space stage.

51
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:27,456
Playing on, they're setting up on the space stage.

52
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:31,596
This is one where the explanation of the topic

53
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:35,756
is pretty fast, as I said, in the spring of 2007,

54
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:39,156
a limited Disney promotion that was actually called

55
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,956
Rockin' Both Parks, that's the name.

56
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:45,036
Everything about this is so lazy.

57
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:50,236
And like a generic ass looking like billboard too.

58
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:51,376
That was like.

59
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:53,576
Mickey's ears, but they're like subwoofers.

60
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,816
Right, and it doesn't say what,

61
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,656
it does say, well, it says red hot chili peppers,

62
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,736
but it's in like the most boring font.

63
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:03,616
Well, and I found a map that also has the branding

64
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,036
for Year of a Million Dreams on it,

65
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:10,236
which was a thing they did, I think for longer than a year,

66
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,276
but like lots of different,

67
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,316
like maybe you'll get a free pair of,

68
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:16,456
I think I got a free pair of mouse ears one day

69
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,636
when I walked in the park,

70
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:21,136
and other people got to stay in the dream suites.

71
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:22,616
Like.

72
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,776
Maybe not as good.

73
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:24,536
Not as good.

74
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:30,356
This is like 2007 is like they're giving annual passes away.

75
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:31,736
Yeah, true.

76
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:32,876
Yeah, much cheaper.

77
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,936
I wonder how much cheaper if you go back.

78
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,116
Oh, you can find it online.

79
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,776
Yeah, I mean, I was shocked.

80
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:38,676
I think one of the things,

81
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:40,856
because I didn't know, I didn't even consider,

82
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:41,936
I've said this before on the show,

83
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,576
like I didn't consider the idea that you would have a pass

84
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,876
and you could go all the time.

85
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:46,616
It was like.

86
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:47,236
I didn't either.

87
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:49,856
I don't know that I really did it,

88
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,796
maybe until a couple years ago.

89
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:52,176
Yeah.

90
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,276
I did it in 2008.

91
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,056
I had been living out here about a year.

92
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,776
My dad and brother came out to visit

93
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,076
and stayed down at the Grand Californian,

94
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,756
and I think I had a three or four day park hopper,

95
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:04,976
and at the front desk, they're like, oh, you're local.

96
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:08,536
You can convert this to an annual pass when it's done.

97
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,976
And you credit to it, and I think at the time,

98
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,076
I did not have to give a lot of money

99
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,756
for a decent annual pass.

100
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,096
Lindsay says, and I don't know,

101
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,616
this seems like it's insane,

102
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,716
but you could get a free ticket on your birthday to go in

103
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,496
and then use the free ticket

104
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,516
to take a piece of the price out.

105
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,096
I think that's right.

106
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:26,456
For the annual pass.

107
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,716
Because we were gonna do that.

108
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,276
We were in an improv class together,

109
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:32,336
we were gonna go down after it once.

110
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:33,436
Yeah, because I think,

111
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,336
either the first or second time I went down,

112
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,876
it was just like, oh yeah, you can get this

113
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:41,976
and it's $200 and you can go 280 days out of the year,

114
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:45,796
and it's a lot of, maybe a few Saturdays in the summer,

115
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,776
I guess one of the tiers is now.

116
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,476
And yeah, it's $200, and I was like, what?

117
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:51,996
Like, whoa, whoa, whoa?

118
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,236
I can't believe that this is a thing.

119
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:57,096
So that's obviously, that really re-kickstarts

120
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,596
my obsession with all this stuff.

121
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,776
Yeah, this is after the 50th anniversary,

122
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:04,116
but before California Adventure getting redone.

123
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:05,196
Not good, yeah.

124
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:05,556
Right.

125
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,376
So it's like, it's kind of a,

126
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:10,316
I think it's a lull in park history.

127
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:14,536
It's a, I don't wanna say it's a,

128
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:15,216
like a mark on the.

129
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,236
Well, nothing great had been added for a while.

130
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,456
Like, especially to Disneyland proper.

131
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,496
So they're trying to find ways to.

132
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:25,116
How are we gonna make everyone come to the park?

133
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:26,876
What are we going to do?

134
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,816
You know, I remember coming the first time

135
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:31,656
in like the end of August, 2006,

136
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,696
I did a semester in LA for college.

137
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,156
The second or third day I was here,

138
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,816
like one of the guys who I was living with,

139
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,336
their girlfriend was visiting for a few days

140
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,716
before she started school back in Ithaca.

141
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,116
And she, he's like, well, we all wanna go to Disneyland.

142
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,656
I'm like, yeah, let's, yeah, let's do that.

143
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,996
And I had been in Orlando that summer

144
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:57,916
and the Magic Kingdom was in not great shape

145
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,736
in the summer of 2006 when I was there.

146
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,156
It was looking a little beat up.

147
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,056
The Disneyland park, summer of 2006,

148
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:07,636
still pretty fresh off that anniversary.

149
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,476
Everything had just been painted.

150
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,956
Everything looked really nice.

151
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,856
Everything was running really well.

152
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,536
So I was, I was very impressed.

153
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,136
Oh, and also the food, because the food,

154
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:24,676
maybe even still like Anaheim has better food.

155
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,356
Better, oh, certainly.

156
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,776
The quick service especially.

157
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:28,616
That specifically.

158
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,896
Especially in the recent past.

159
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,436
Yeah, they're stepping it up.

160
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:35,576
But yeah, oh, well, this pristine, beautiful park.

161
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,336
What better to do with it than to trash it

162
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:44,576
like a hotel room with the help of the ultimate

163
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,196
rap scallions.

164
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:47,476
Yeah, interestingly.

165
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:51,136
2007's most popular rock group.

166
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:52,636
Hell yeah.

167
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,616
2007. When was the last album?

168
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:55,816
When was the last Chili Peppers album?

169
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,676
In 2007 or recently, I mean.

170
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:59,756
One in like 2005 or 2006.

171
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,056
Before this, yeah, they had a Stadium Arcadium.

172
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:03,676
Right.

173
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,796
Which was a double album, which came out

174
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:08,096
when I was in my last year of college.

175
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,616
Or second to last year of college.

176
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:13,036
So yeah, like 2005, 2006.

177
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,076
Double the bass slap.

178
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,896
And the hit, they had a hit on that.

179
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,196
The hit on that is Danny, California.

180
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:19,956
Yeah.

181
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,836
Which sounds like Last Dance with Mary Jane by Tom Patty.

182
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,156
Oh yeah, so it does.

183
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,856
But it's in a very familiar chorus about California.

184
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:29,856
That's a theme they sing about a lot.

185
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,916
Californication was on an earlier album.

186
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:32,696
2009.

187
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,916
On the album entitled Californication.

188
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:36,736
Which I think, believe on the podcast,

189
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,416
one of my favorite moments is you realizing

190
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,996
what Californication meant.

191
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,236
Yes, that it has the word fornication in it.

192
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,316
Oh, because we talked about this for a sec.

193
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,256
This must have spurred that conversation.

194
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:51,456
So I think maybe I mentioned this then.

195
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:54,316
I think it's crystallized a little more for me now.

196
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,076
My relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers

197
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,896
is they were just ubiquitous when I was a kid.

198
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,696
They were ubiquitous.

199
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:06,736
I have never paid any money for an album, a t-shirt,

200
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,256
anything, but I have somehow absorbed them,

201
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,336
but not processed them.

202
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:14,196
Because reading about these two songs,

203
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:16,176
reading the lyrics to these two songs,

204
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,856
the Red Hot Chili Peppers might be one of the main bands

205
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,756
where when I read the lyrics, I go,

206
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:22,656
that's what they were saying?

207
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,196
That's what that lyric was in that?

208
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:26,936
Because to us, it's just,

209
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,656
umbo-dee-ba-dum-ba-dub-busky-bo.

210
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,156
Pretty much, yeah.

211
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:31,196
Yeah.

212
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,876
Yeah, no, I don't really like them.

213
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:35,076
I don't dislike them.

214
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:36,736
They're one of those, hey, they're around,

215
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:37,996
you guys do your thing.

216
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:42,956
I have no objections to anything that they do or wanna do.

217
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:44,936
It's just not what I listen to.

218
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:48,396
I was way into Red Hot Chili Peppers.

219
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,876
I think that a lot of things, I came to them late.

220
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,476
I wasn't listening to popular music

221
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,516
until I was 16 or something.

222
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:56,596
Yeah, same, yeah.

223
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,896
I knew Sugar Sugar by the Archies.

224
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:03,836
I could sing Leaning on a Lamp Post by Herman's Hermits, sure,

225
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,896
but I didn't know the popular music of the day

226
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:09,376
until I started listening to Q101 in Chicago.

227
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:13,456
So I think the first album of theirs I liked

228
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:14,696
was Californication.

229
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,976
And then, very famously to tie it back to Disney,

230
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,756
I bought their classic Blood Sugar Sex Magic

231
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:23,936
at the Virgin Megastore in downtown Disney.

232
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:24,496
I see.

233
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:27,436
In a trip that happened very soon after that.

234
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,516
So I got way into the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

235
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,916
Their follow-up, By the Way, I was obsessed with.

236
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:36,316
I was listening to By the Way in preparation for this

237
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:38,236
and going, some of these songs are good.

238
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:42,636
I was like reliving my, whatever, 2003.

239
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:45,376
I like that, I like By the Way, I like Californication.

240
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,596
There's a couple songs on By the Way.

241
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,436
I was like, is By the Way the best album?

242
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,476
I feel like I'm gonna, after you guys leave,

243
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,976
I will make a Red Hot Chili Peppers playlist.

244
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,436
I will put all the hits in my mind

245
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,676
and I'll share it with the listeners.

246
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:01,336
Oh, maybe I can make it only Patreon exclusive.

247
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,656
You can, but it's next post in Patreon.

248
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,976
What's gonna happen is people are gonna be sharing the link

249
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:08,676
because people are gonna be so wanting to see

250
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,636
what I pick as some of my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs.

251
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:13,916
They're gonna go re-viral with your curation.

252
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,676
It's gonna kick off, like when a band gets a song

253
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:20,296
in a big movie, it's gonna be a big deal for RHCP

254
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,616
to have the MC stamp.

255
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,436
So I was way into them.

256
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:29,916
I think I had the What Hits album as well,

257
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,676
which had some of the older songs,

258
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,556
some of the pre-Blood Sugar Sex Magic songs.

259
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:38,156
And I saw them a couple times in kind.

260
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:40,716
I saw them at Lollapalooza one year.

261
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,916
They were on the Simpsons episode, right?

262
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,896
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:48,856
No, they were there in Krusty's last episode.

264
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,576
Oh, oh, Dancer Under Underwear.

265
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:55,256
Yeah, they're with Johnny Carson and Bette Midler.

266
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:59,856
Yeah, yeah, and it's kind of a nod to the doors

267
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:02,136
where Krusty comes in and tries to get him

268
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,276
to change their lyrics to something nice

269
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:05,556
and they can see to it.

270
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,056
What you got, I gotta get him, put it in you,

271
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:10,136
change to what I want is I wanna love and hug

272
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,656
and kiss you or something, is that the one?

273
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:12,076
Yeah.

274
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:15,076
And then he goes, the other line that's really good

275
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,596
in that episode is when he goes,

276
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,096
look at him dancing around in underwear,

277
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,536
so demeaning or something, and they go,

278
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:22,836
Krusty, five minutes to your little stinker sketch.

279
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,536
And he goes, I want a bigger lolly.

280
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,316
And they give him a giant lollipop.

281
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:31,596
I love in that episode when they all come into Moe's naked

282
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:35,496
and all say hi to Moe and then there's the big, hey Moe!

283
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:40,516
That's a very funny animation, a funny performance.

284
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,816
I also remember the Californication music video,

285
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,776
was he jumping through a video game level?

286
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:48,616
Well, it looked like Crazy Taxi or something.

287
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:49,096
Yes.

288
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,036
That was the music video for that.

289
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,956
That was the third single, I believe,

290
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,436
on Californication after.

291
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:54,916
Which is interesting,

292
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,216
because Crazy Taxi was a lot of offspring.

293
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:59,076
Well, it was only offspring.

294
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:00,076
It was only offspring.

295
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:03,836
I believe that first Crazy Taxi just played that one,

296
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:08,056
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, for many hours and levels.

297
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,696
I think there are other songs

298
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,876
and I think they put out a soundtrack for it.

299
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,596
I think it is largely offspring.

300
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,836
That's a good question.

301
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:15,416
All I watch is the name of it?

302
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,356
You can get it on your phone now for free.

303
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:21,176
So, I would, that was a thing I remember as a kid,

304
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,456
going to Sears' video game sections

305
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,596
when my mom was shopping and just playing

306
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:28,176
the Crazy Taxi demo again and again.

307
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:32,196
Yeah, so I was way into them.

308
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,436
In college, when I started getting into the cooler stuff,

309
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,596
I still got Stadium Arcadium.

310
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:42,336
And I was like, I like four or five of these songs,

311
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,356
but it was starting to wane a little bit.

312
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,836
And then I kind of fell off with them.

313
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,316
I've heard the singles,

314
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,116
and I was listening to some singles earlier.

315
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,636
I was like, no, okay.

316
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,636
But there's, I would argue that there's at least,

317
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,996
like Flea is such a good bassist.

318
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,356
And like, if you like music at all,

319
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,176
you'd be like, I can listen to this bass line

320
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,536
independent of any dumb sex lyric

321
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,176
that's in these songs and go,

322
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,876
well, that's a really cool bass line.

323
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,556
Like that's.

324
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,276
Yeah, I think they're all amazing musicians

325
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,656
and the various guitarists who've been part of it

326
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:12,376
are all fantastic.

327
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,296
And I love John Fuschanti,

328
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,916
who was the guitarist for many of these albums.

329
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,036
And he's got weird solo albums.

330
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:20,056
He's not in the band anymore.

331
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,816
He does a cover of How Deep Is Your Love,

332
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,356
that's on YouTube, that is so great.

333
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,076
Like he's got such a weird,

334
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,136
he has like the high parts on all the songs,

335
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,196
but he's a fascinating character

336
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,096
that I'm very intrigued by.

337
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:34,536
So anyway.

338
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,396
I've set my piece on the road.

339
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,736
That's a lot more than the two.

340
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,396
Mike has enough like of them for the two of us.

341
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:41,796
Yes.

342
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:42,536
That's true.

343
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,396
And then some.

344
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:47,056
But I think the main thing is what in 2007,

345
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,536
I don't know, I guess it wasn't that insane.

346
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,336
And you need like a name band.

347
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,916
Look, like giving a roller coaster to Aerosmith.

348
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:57,756
I think it's hard for Disney to have a relationship

349
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,976
with a rock band and to do something that's not,

350
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,936
to do something that's name, but actually current.

351
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:05,256
And I don't know.

352
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:05,756
For sure.

353
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:10,456
I think it's clearly doing the rock and roller coaster model.

354
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:11,076
Yeah.

355
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,936
Like it's, they're just trying to go,

356
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:16,016
all right, we'll just make it a radio station.

357
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,316
And like, that's sort of the lead up to the ride.

358
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,736
And what band like Aerosmith is there?

359
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,636
And I think I said this on the rock and roller coaster

360
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,356
episode that I feel like Aerosmith and the red

361
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,696
and chili peppers are very similar in some ways.

362
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,156
Like these bawdy, dirty lyrics,

363
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:34,516
like pseudo-rappy kind of vocals in a lot of songs.

364
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:34,916
I don't know.

365
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:37,756
They're both sleazy bands in a lot of ways.

366
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:40,096
So like, it feels right.

367
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,576
I feel like that's, even though it's like 10 years later.

368
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,316
Yeah, man, they'll wear like a top hat

369
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,936
and a feather boa and stick their tongue out.

370
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,996
These guys are fucking wild.

371
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,076
They're so crazy.

372
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,536
So yeah, it feels like somebody going,

373
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,616
well, let's just do the rock and roller coaster here.

374
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,716
And maybe it's a whole,

375
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,676
because they were talking about actually doing

376
00:14:57,676 --> 00:15:00,356
a rock and roller coaster here and it got canned.

377
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:01,196
With no doubt.

378
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:01,956
With no doubt.

379
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,676
Which is interesting then.

380
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,676
That's a great idea.

381
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:07,416
Why didn't they just do no doubt then?

382
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,416
Yeah, and you get a second roller coaster

383
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,276
in California Adventure.

384
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,356
I mean, money is the answer, probably.

385
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,996
But yeah, so this was this like temporary overlay

386
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:19,896
just to sort of a gimmick to get people in.

387
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,516
Did anyone specifically go for this only?

388
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,176
Oh, it's a good question, isn't it?

389
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,636
Did anyone not have an annual pass and I need to go?

390
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:29,836
Gotta be some chili pepper fans who went.

391
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:31,576
I texted before we started this,

392
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,676
I texted Doug Jones,

393
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,776
who is a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.

394
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,496
And I was just like, hey, we're doing this episode

395
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,596
about the Red Hot Chili Pepper overlay on these rides.

396
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,396
And Doug's obviously a huge Disneyland fan too.

397
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,976
I go, do you have any memories of that?

398
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:47,516
And like, Doug is very into the music scene and you know,

399
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,356
he knows stuff about all this.

400
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:49,636
Music scene.

401
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,076
I said it like an old man, like sure.

402
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,836
He's, he knows what the kids like.

403
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,956
And Doug said, I should just read what he said.

404
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,096
He, hold on one second.

405
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:01,756
Where do I have it?

406
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:04,736
It's, this is a podcasting.

407
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:07,856
Get all those phonographs out of the way, Mr. Music.

408
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:12,396
I said, Doug said, I was not aware of that

409
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:13,376
while it was going on.

410
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,996
I only learned about it afterwards

411
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,456
and I've only read what's online.

412
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:17,876
I don't really have any insight.

413
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:19,756
I'm a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan,

414
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:21,896
but it seems out of place to have their music at Disney.

415
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,896
So Doug didn't even know.

416
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:27,116
And didn't know and doesn't like the sound of it now.

417
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:31,336
Yeah, he's a hardcore Disney and Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.

418
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,616
Wasn't even on his radar.

419
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,036
Maybe the exact audience for this.

420
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:38,516
That's why I was like, oh, I'm gonna text Doug.

421
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,196
I know Doug will know something about this

422
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,836
or at least be like, yeah, I remember that.

423
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,456
And we went down and we were so excited.

424
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,536
No, he was there at the time.

425
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,376
Didn't even know what was happening.

426
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:50,316
I texted Nick Mundy about this,

427
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,656
not cause I just unrelatedly.

428
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,736
And together we came upon a Chili Peppers determination

429
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,236
that we wish we could have seen.

430
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:02,136
I wish I could go to a concert by the animated band

431
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:05,496
that they voice essentially in Beavis and Butthead

432
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:06,336
do America.

433
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:10,556
Cause they're these like lounge lizard sleaze bags,

434
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:14,476
these retro 70s men, but who sing like the Chili Peppers.

435
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,156
If I could put like Gorillaz style,

436
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,076
see the Beavis and Butthead version of them live.

437
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,176
If it was 10 years later,

438
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:23,916
you may have been able to do that

439
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,916
cause they did figure out like how do Gorillaz shows work.

440
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,396
And the answer early on was they play in silhouette

441
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:32,256
and there's a lot of original animation.

442
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:34,196
Nowadays, I don't know if they even bother

443
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:34,916
with the silhouettes.

444
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,016
They haven't done that in a while.

445
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,536
That's my plus up for the idea of the Gorillaz in general

446
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,976
is that the opening act should have always been.

447
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,056
Cartoon Chili Peppers.

448
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:46,176
Here's my plus up, just put blur back together

449
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,896
with the band I like.

450
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:48,596
Decent plus up.

451
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:49,496
You don't like Gorillaz?

452
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:51,436
No, I do like Gorillaz.

453
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:56,696
But I think Damon Albert usually tempered,

454
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,356
tempered by Graham, by his blur counterpart, Graham.

455
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:01,156
Oh, I see.

456
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,016
The thing about the music scene too,

457
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:06,136
don't sell yourself short on the music scene.

458
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:06,496
I like the music stuff.

459
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:10,256
I like the Brit Pop, 90s Brit Pop,

460
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,996
the less popular one of the two.

461
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,056
I think there's a couple of years

462
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:19,196
where you're like really into like new pornographers

463
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:22,496
and you're like, there's a college rock zone

464
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,476
where you live in.

465
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:23,576
You know what it was?

466
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:26,296
It was like the golden age of MP3 blogs.

467
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:30,396
When blogs would, every entry would be about a new MP3

468
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,416
and then at the bottom of the blog entry,

469
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,916
you could just steal the MP3.

470
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,956
You could just have the MP3.

471
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:41,156
You know, Gorilla versus Shark, Flux Blog,

472
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:44,576
like all of those things.

473
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,976
Yeah, me, I don't go for the SoundCloud rap.

474
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:49,316
I'm more of a LimeWire rap guy.

475
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,256
Oh sure.

476
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,216
I like Kazaa.

477
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:54,456
Yeah, they call me when it's Kazaa again.

478
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:58,396
I'll do an Audio Galaxy rap any day.

479
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,976
This was clearly we're veering from this being

480
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:04,096
a quick episode.

481
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,876
There's not a lot of records of this.

482
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:08,356
No, not really.

483
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,336
I was literally spent 10 minutes going like,

484
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,096
I know there's a Yesterland page about this

485
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:15,316
where I can at least start and there's not.

486
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,976
Even Yesterland is not really cataloged.

487
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,216
There's not a lot of info.

488
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:21,956
So here, I'm gonna go in reverse order

489
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:23,996
of how much there is to talk about

490
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,736
so here's what happened.

491
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:30,276
They put a song on the biggest roller coaster

492
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:33,116
in Disneyland and California Adventure.

493
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,516
In California Adventure, that is what is now

494
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,956
the Incredicoaster, the time was California Screaming

495
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:44,056
and that, wait, the song is Around the World.

496
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:44,676
Yes, correct.

497
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,116
Just kind of slapped on.

498
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,036
Yes.

499
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,336
Not really set up.

500
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,256
Well, no.

501
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:52,896
They did re-record, I mean, they recorded new stuff for it.

502
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,276
They remixed it.

503
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,836
Recorded new stuff?

504
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:56,476
Yes.

505
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:58,356
Yeah, hang on.

506
00:19:58,536 --> 00:19:59,116
Hold on a second.

507
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,516
The lyrics, they kind of recut,

508
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,976
so it skips a couple lyrics for the length.

509
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,336
I cannot find good documentation of this.

510
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:10,096
There are guitar solos in this version

511
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:12,376
that do not appear on the album version.

512
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:15,756
There is a whole outro jam that appears

513
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,036
in the roller coaster that is not on the album.

514
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:19,876
Huh, well, that's interesting.

515
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,796
I know they remixed it and also,

516
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:25,136
there are, they change up verses.

517
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:26,956
First of all, there's some dirty lyrics on the song.

518
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,176
They cut and paste, the first verse on the roller coaster

519
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,956
is a combination of all three verses.

520
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,096
They have chopped up the lyrics.

521
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:35,696
Wow.

522
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,416
In different ways, just, I guess,

523
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:39,536
probably to get rid of anything that's suggestive.

524
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:41,136
So they took Krusty's advice.

525
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,376
So they did take Krusty's advice to the roller coaster,

526
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,296
but I think from the sound of it,

527
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:47,096
unless they had just leftover takes from,

528
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:50,036
maybe they tried stuff on, in the studio,

529
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:54,056
there's for sure new stuff in the version of

530
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,396
Around the World on California Screamin'.

531
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:57,516
No kidding, wow.

532
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,656
Well, I really like the idea of an alternate mix

533
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,936
of a song that I like that you can only experience

534
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:05,136
by going on a roller coaster.

535
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:08,716
That is a fantastic idea that more people should deploy.

536
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,296
In this case, I'm going in this order

537
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,636
because Space Mountain had,

538
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:17,536
the Space Mountain version had 10% more to talk about.

539
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,996
This essentially is the same ride,

540
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,376
but with a new soundtrack.

541
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,176
Some might say much like the Incredicoaster.

542
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,616
Yeah, fair enough.

543
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,656
It's so, that's not true.

544
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:29,096
I like all the tunnels and everything.

545
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:33,976
And obviously we figured out that a rock song

546
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,856
is not the optimal soundtrack to that ride.

547
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,896
It was always meant to be a woman searching for her infant.

548
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:42,816
There's no other way to experience those specific

549
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:44,656
dips and loops. Of course.

550
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:49,716
So, and unlike Space Mountain, there's just, there's no,

551
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:51,156
we'll get into Space Mountain,

552
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,016
and like just, you know, lighting effects or whatever.

553
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,056
And the kind of this intro as you go up the hill.

554
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:56,856
This is just sort of the song plays.

555
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,296
Fine, innocuous, whatever.

556
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,276
Cool, I don't know.

557
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,236
I don't know if I like the song so much.

558
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:06,876
I'll say that.

559
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:08,916
I don't know.

560
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,436
Doesn't this one feel to you?

561
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,456
Do you like the song or,

562
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,756
because to me it's like being just casually aware of them.

563
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:16,936
I'm like, it's kind of their tricks.

564
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,856
Dibba, dabba, da, dabba, dabba, da, da.

565
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:21,256
I cannot sing it in my head right now.

566
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:22,596
I'm staring at the lyrics.

567
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:22,856
I can't produce this.

568
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,736
We're talking about Around the World.

569
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:24,436
Yes. Yeah.

570
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:25,456
I can sing it.

571
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:26,276
Yeah, if you want me to.

572
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,676
I'm not going, I mean, all around the world

573
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,316
we can make time roughing and a-stomping

574
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,236
because I'm in my prime, born in the North,

575
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:33,576
just want to entertain ya,

576
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,596
cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania.

577
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:38,136
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya

578
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:41,576
about the motherfucking govern California.

579
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,936
Alabama baby say hallelujah.

580
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,236
Good God girl.

581
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:49,416
Wish I knew ya, I think is the first verse.

582
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:51,516
So I do know it pretty well.

583
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,136
It's not, it's not one of my favorites though.

584
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:55,896
I will say that.

585
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:59,856
I do think when you take off on the, in the launch,

586
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:02,676
I think that part is cool with the,

587
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:05,596
like that intro part is cool.

588
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:07,476
But then I don't think it makes any sense

589
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:10,236
for the roller coaster to have that boom, boom, boom, boom.

590
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:12,776
Like it loses its propulsion at that point.

591
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,756
Yeah. They're pretty unrelated.

592
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,416
It's a weird, it's a weird choice for that.

593
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:18,316
So I don't know.

594
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:19,116
Yes, Jason.

595
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:21,676
So I think one thing about the Chili Pepper,

596
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:25,276
I feel like I never know the names of their songs.

597
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:28,656
I think the songs are called whatever the chorus was.

598
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:32,036
So this song, I feel like I mentally refer to

599
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:34,276
as I know for sure.

600
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,816
Sure. Sure.

601
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,016
I know for sure.

602
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:44,516
This song also has one of the most problematic outros,

603
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,656
I think, and they don't have it on the ride,

604
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:53,636
is where Anthony Kiedis sings in fake Asian Chinese,

605
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,916
where he goes ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dang,

606
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,616
dong, dong, ding, dang.

607
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:00,976
Oh yeah, he does.

608
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,096
Yeah, it's bizarre.

609
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:06,136
Certainly, I think that probably holds up less well

610
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:09,536
than almost any other terrible dirty thing in the songs.

611
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:10,476
That's probably not true.

612
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,716
We probably could comb through it

613
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,076
and find more problematic stuff.

614
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:16,216
Yeah, not one of my favorite songs,

615
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:19,296
but I do kind of like that intro part

616
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:21,736
where it's like fast up the launch.

617
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,116
Sure, that part seemed to pair decent.

618
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:25,016
But it's a bizarre choice.

619
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,656
I don't know why this is the choice.

620
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,936
They have faster songs.

621
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,196
This wasn't even that big of a hit, I don't think.

622
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,776
So I don't even see them justifying it going like,

623
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,136
well, Around the World was such a big hit.

624
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,436
People are gonna clearly wanna hear them do that song.

625
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:41,436
I don't know.

626
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:42,156
I don't know.

627
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,876
And in my head, I was like,

628
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:49,096
I didn't go on California Screamin',

629
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,416
but I was like, well, it must be,

630
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:54,836
they must, I assume they are using Love Roller Coaster.

631
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:55,856
And they were not.

632
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:56,996
It's wild.

633
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,216
Yeah, it's right there.

634
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,556
Someone has to explain why they didn't do

635
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:01,696
Love Roller Coaster.

636
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:03,276
Clearance, because it's a cover.

637
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,656
I guess, but who is it though?

638
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:07,036
Who does the real players?

639
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:10,136
The Ohio players have been holding out for more money.

640
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,976
I mean, or whatever.

641
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,716
Higher ground is Stevie Wonder.

642
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:15,276
Sure.

643
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:16,456
How did they clear that?

644
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:19,176
Well, he's always playing at their Christmas specials.

645
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,876
So they had a good relationship with Stevie.

646
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:21,516
That's a good point.

647
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:22,496
Ohio players.

648
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,076
Also, maybe some shyster stole the copyright

649
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,156
of the Ohio players.

650
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:27,716
That's possible.

651
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:28,576
It happens to a lot of those bands.

652
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:31,756
It is, unless, if I look at the lyrics

653
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:33,836
to Love Roller Coaster, it's just so filthy.

654
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:34,796
Yeah.

655
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:37,916
But Ohio players, they were writing dirty stuff, right?

656
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,636
Roller Coaster of Love, I guess is that-

657
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,776
You could have just essentially made it,

658
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:45,716
and maybe that maybe writing someone that you love

659
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,176
is too dicey for Disney.

660
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:49,316
Yeah, maybe.

661
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:50,136
It's just that notion.

662
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,816
Like, I have the lyrics to Roller Coaster.

663
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:54,676
Roller Coaster of Love, say what?

664
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:55,836
Roller Coaster.

665
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:57,736
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Roller Coaster.

666
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,836
Oh baby, you know what I'm talking about of love.

667
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:03,756
Roller Coaster, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

668
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,336
Like, whatever, that's fine.

669
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,356
I don't know, your love is like a roller coaster baby.

670
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,176
I wanna ride.

671
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:10,396
I guess that's it.

672
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:11,176
Yeah.

673
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,136
I guess it's like-

674
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:12,956
Maybe it's a problem.

675
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,596
Ride, but then they like used loving

676
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:17,716
and loving a roller coaster for Aerosmith.

677
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,476
Well, that's ridiculous, that concept.

678
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:22,356
And they play pink outside.

679
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,516
We know what that means.

680
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:32,856
And Steven Tyler was doing sex gesture for many decades.

681
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:36,596
So I don't know, I guess they thought

682
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,756
around the world was less problematic.

683
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:42,216
I don't know, well, let's go across the esplanade.

684
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:43,856
Let's rock across the esplanade.

685
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:44,896
Let's rock our way.

686
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:51,956
Let's do a rockin' park hop and talk about Space Mountain.

687
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,936
Or as it became known, well, we should,

688
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:58,196
it was rockin' California Screamin', not California rockin'.

689
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:02,476
And then across the way was rockin' Space Mountain.

690
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,796
Lazy, so lazy.

691
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:04,736
Really lazy.

692
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:05,796
I'm glad we're covering this now

693
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,016
because we can take this out

694
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,696
of our eventual Space Mountain episode.

695
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:12,736
We've just freed up 20 minutes of Tangent.

696
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:14,416
So real estate cleared.

697
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:22,756
So this thing, this worked better, I think, right?

698
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:24,396
And over here you get the cover

699
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:27,096
of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground, as he said.

700
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:32,276
I should say, with songs from like 89 or something,

701
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:33,536
Mother's Milk is the album.

702
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:34,996
It's one of the first recordings

703
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,796
with John Franchante and Chad Smith.

704
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:42,736
So this is early, the classic lineup of the band.

705
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:47,056
And I hope that made me sound like a musicologist

706
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,776
or something to have even looked that up.

707
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:53,196
And here you got a little more going on

708
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:57,356
because there is a premise here.

709
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:02,416
And the premise is that, well, what is it?

710
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:08,096
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are due to perform

711
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,976
on the space stage.

712
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,356
So lazy, it's bad, frankly.

713
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:17,276
Every now and then when I make my notes for these episodes,

714
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:21,436
I will get so mad, I'll just write the phrase,

715
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,476
oh, fuck off, next to a note.

716
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:27,696
And the space, I think the Red Hot Chili Peppers

717
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,456
are about in the space stage.

718
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:33,096
There is a come on, fuck you, next to that.

719
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:34,456
There's not much there.

720
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,356
I like imagining though what it is.

721
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,176
So I just, I just imagine a floating platform.

722
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:45,336
I imagine them having like 60s cartoon,

723
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:50,136
just sort of that like scoop, like deep sea diver,

724
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:53,436
yeah, fishbowl helmet on with like a little air tube

725
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,296
in a backpack and they have the instruments.

726
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:56,876
They're probably naked too.

727
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,336
They have socks on their dicks or whatever.

728
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,416
They have dick shaped helmets.

729
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:02,676
Dick shaped helmets as well.

730
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,136
But they're on just like a floating stage in space.

731
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:05,656
And I don't know.

732
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:06,456
Yeah, that sounds cool.

733
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:10,016
They don't have time to explain what it is though.

734
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:11,596
I don't know, it's a long lift till I think

735
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:12,256
they could have fit that.

736
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:15,236
And now the space stage, keep in mind is,

737
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:17,796
so they've got a helmet on there.

738
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:19,736
Remember, no ins and outs.

739
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,716
You know what, they do that on Rock and Roller Coaster

740
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:24,176
because they go, wow, check out Steven Tyler's new hat.

741
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,216
So like they could have been like, look at,

742
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,916
the Red Hot Chili Peppers have socks on their dicks.

743
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,416
Like they could have said that.

744
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:33,096
There's a precedent for rock themed roller coasters

745
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:35,956
pointing out the clothing of the band.

746
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:37,756
So no excuse.

747
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,156
Just a reminder, if you think you're coming backstage,

748
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:42,796
you need the wristband and the lamby.

749
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:46,156
Just one of those won't get you very far.

750
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:50,996
How bad do you wanna fuck flea?

751
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:53,636


752
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:56,136
Um.

753
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:56,296
Um.

754
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,196
You mostly know him from his acting work.

755
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:01,156
That's gonna be the weirdest one I've heard all day.

756
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:05,196
I don't buy that for a second.

757
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:11,796
So, and this is narrated by the way by Uncle Joe.

758
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:12,496
Uncle Joe.

759
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:19,236
Uncle Joe is a DJ for 95.5 KLOS here in Los Angeles,

760
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,036
apparently owned by Disney.

761
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:21,876
Yeah.

762
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:22,476
Oh.

763
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:23,276
Synergy.

764
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:27,856
Yep, Uncle Joe Benson, who's on Twitter.

765
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,796
We should say hi to him and say he did a great job

766
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:34,256
and see if he writes us back.

767
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:38,596
So, and if he has any fun memories of recording this

768
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:41,896
over the course of four minutes.

769
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,576
He knocked it out in a session.

770
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,176
Over a decade ago.

771
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:51,316
So, well the other important point is that on the space stage

772
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:55,356
you don't broadcast, you broad blast.

773
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:56,316
Oh yeah.

774
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:59,256
The chili peppers will be broad blasting live.

775
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,656
I like that more, less lazy than space stage.

776
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:04,556
I'll give them that.

777
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:06,376
Yeah, that's good.

778
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,276
And what now, what does that mean?

779
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,336
Is somehow the kinetic energy of you on the rocket

780
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:16,016
like kind of shoving the radio waves into lights.

781
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:20,116
Are you like on the rocket carrying the sound waves

782
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:22,036
faster than the speed of sound?

783
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:25,256
Yeah, I think that it has to indicate that it's faster

784
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,796
than a normal radio wave.

785
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:28,496
So, it would have to be.

786
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:29,656
Well yeah, but broad blasting.

787
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:30,796
It's so much faster.

788
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,356
I like that a lot, yeah.

789
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:37,656
And then you hear some tune up and you hear a guy go like,

790
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,776
how about some of that bass?

791
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:41,656
Boom, do, do, do, do, do, do.

792
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:46,256
I can't tell, I can't, I wonder if that's Flea

793
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,096
or that's like another guy.

794
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,576
That's generic.

795
00:31:49,696 --> 00:31:50,856
It's probably generic.

796
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:54,096
I think their participation was as minimal

797
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:55,156
as humanly possible.

798
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:57,876
As evidenced by the fact that they didn't do a press event,

799
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,456
they didn't play a concert, they didn't broad blast live

800
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,356
from Disneyland.

801
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:03,716
There was no photo.

802
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:08,476
I was on the mice chat message boards from 2007

803
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:10,296
and there was a rumor.

804
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,496
Bound in a book, in a leather band.

805
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:15,096
There was a rumor that they were gonna play

806
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:16,596
because someone goes, did you hear the rumor

807
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,556
that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are gonna play Disneyland?

808
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:20,216
And people are like, I have not heard that.

809
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,276
So, they did not turn up.

810
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:22,396
Probably they were trying to set it up

811
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,376
and then literally anything else came up

812
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,596
and they did that instead.

813
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:26,396
Yes.

814
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:29,556
I will say as far as their involvement,

815
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:31,496
I forget the guy's name.

816
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,656
I did find the guy who remixed the song.

817
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:35,116
Oh.

818
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,196
Who was like a major music producer.

819
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:38,596
I should look it up.

820
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,696
It's not Rick Rubin, their long-time producer.

821
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,896
Okay, but like maybe the actual producer,

822
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,016
mixer of the thing.

823
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,516
I think Rick Rubin did Californication though initially.

824
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:52,296
I was, you know, to this, on this topic,

825
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:55,536
I was trying to find if there was any other association

826
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,436
between the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Disneyland.

827
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,976
In Googling this, I found several results.

828
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:08,536
Anthony Kiedis in describing his adolescent life

829
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,596
full of drug use as a teenager,

830
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:14,436
he said that he described his life back then

831
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:17,036
on the Sunset Strip as being like an adult Disneyland.

832
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,616
So, there's one.

833
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:23,096
It's a negative thing more than anything.

834
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:26,576
I love that you're reading this out like a 60 minutes anchor.

835
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:30,256
And he described it as an adult Disneyland.

836
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:34,076
Also just side note is describing,

837
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,696
elaborating on why it's an adult Disneyland.

838
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:41,776
At some point, a naked share crawled into bed with him

839
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,116
when he was in the eighth grade.

840
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,196
Oh yeah, I've heard that story.

841
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:45,796
Wow.

842
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:47,676
Yeah, that's inappropriate.

843
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:49,716
Yeah, not great.

844
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:51,776
I don't wanna say it, cause it's just too weird.

845
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:55,596
There's a lot of like very problematic stuff

846
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,136
in his autobiography.

847
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,256
Uh oh.

848
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:58,796
Oh no.

849
00:33:58,956 --> 00:33:59,556
That's all I'll say.

850
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:02,196
All right, I'll stay away from that then.

851
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:04,356
He's a rock star, man.

852
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:05,296
That's all he knows.

853
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:09,616
They had trouble keeping his autobiography in bookstores,

854
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:09,956
right?

855
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,096
Because it's titled, Give it Away, Give it Away,

856
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:12,956
Give it Away Now.

857
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:14,776
Man.

858
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:17,096
I don't even know.

859
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,276
I don't even know how we can continue after that.

860
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,236
We set a price.

861
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:22,896
Why aren't people paying the price?

862
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,016
What's the title?

863
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:26,556
Why does everyone want some sort of deep discount?

864
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:31,736
I Googled some other members of the band

865
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,936
to see if they have any fond Disneyland memories.

866
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,476
And I did find that in 1955,

867
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,776
when the castle was first built,

868
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:44,436
that it ended up being infested by a number of feral cats.

869
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:48,076
And the feral cats were carrying on them many fleas.

870
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:48,716
Uh huh.

871
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:49,316
Sure.

872
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:50,516
Um.

873
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:51,636
Oh, okay.

874
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:53,156
So stretch but true.

875
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,436
I don't know how we can continue after that.

876
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,076
I don't know how we can continue after that.

877
00:34:57,176 --> 00:35:00,596
Also, Walt's solution side track

878
00:35:00,596 --> 00:35:04,696
to finding a bunch of flea cats in the castle

879
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:08,296
was to be very kind and give them out to the employees.

880
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:10,676
And when somebody told him,

881
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:12,976
maybe you shouldn't give all your employees fleas,

882
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,196
he then, they decided, oh, let's keep them around

883
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,876
and have them be the natural scavengers and hunters

884
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:21,056
of the rats that might end up in Disneyland,

885
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:22,676
which they are still to this day.

886
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:24,976
So those cats showed up, apparently,

887
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:28,216
that tradition goes back to before the park even opened.

888
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:28,716
Wow.

889
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,216
So there's your flea fact.

890
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:32,776
And hey, one more thing.

891
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:39,976
The Anaheim pepper is a red chili pepper

892
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:42,516
that is grown in Anaheim.

893
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,416
But it is mild.

894
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:47,156
You wouldn't call it a red hot chili pepper.

895
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:49,656
Why, if you consult the Scoville scale,

896
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:52,796
which of course measures the pungency of spicy foods,

897
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:54,636
you'll find that the Anaheim pepper

898
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,936
is eight times milder than a jalapeno.

899
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:57,816
Wow. Okay.

900
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:59,456
And those are all my results

901
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,016
of Googling red hot chili peppers.

902
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:03,816
That was the most wholesome content of the show.

903
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:08,056
There's not even a picture of Anthony Kiedis on the,

904
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:10,456
like there's a famous picture of Billy Corgan

905
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:11,816
on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad

906
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:14,196
from a couple of years ago looking very unhappy,

907
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,876
which he looks in general all the time, but.

908
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,516
He ought to go to the,

909
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,596
he shouldn't go to Universal Studios

910
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,776
on the Despicable Me rag

911
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:24,496
because he'd get mistaken for Gru.

912
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,556
Well, that's his place of business.

913
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:30,936
You're joking, but he looks a lot like Gru now.

914
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,156
Yeah, and I was never heard of me before.

915
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:34,156
Wow, that's crazy.

916
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,856
Wasn't he working for Impact Wrestling for a while?

917
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:37,596
Did he own it?

918
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:41,476
Well, no, he's certainly, he bought NWA Wrestling now.

919
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:43,796
So that's his new, but he did work for Impact for a while,

920
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:47,076
but now he is a full on like owner of NWA Wrestling.

921
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:47,956
Oh, okay.

922
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:51,196
And the reason supposedly that Darcy claims

923
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:52,916
that the Pumpkins went back on tour

924
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,196
with at least two of the three originals

925
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:59,456
is because he lost so much money investing it in wrestling.

926
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:02,916
She has a smart business to get into.

927
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:05,156
So he's back with the Pumpkins because he needs that money

928
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,156
and he's playing the hits.

929
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:09,136
And keeping his right wing views quiet.

930
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:11,356
And kind of.

931
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:12,716
Yeah.

932
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:15,076
Right now that picture pops up on the internet.

933
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,776
It's like, is that Billy Corrigan next to Alex Jones?

934
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:20,036
Yeah, you know, the globalists.

935
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,156
Anyway, Ryan Hewitt is the record producer

936
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:25,876
who was the record producer on Stadium Arcadium.

937
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:26,616
I see.

938
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,176
So he was just around and they were like,

939
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:29,936
we need to do this fucking Disney thing.

940
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,756
Which maybe, yeah, maybe he just went through

941
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:33,936
like what they were demoing.

942
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:36,056
And then some alt takes or whatever.

943
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:38,916
So let's get back on the lift hill

944
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,976
where we're preparing for the broad blast.

945
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:44,516
The Wikipedia that I read had this great description.

946
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:48,196
Finally, once riders crest the lift, the sun explodes.

947
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,176
Which I kind of on the way up, there's sort of like,

948
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:57,096
you know, instead of the typical space mountain patterns,

949
00:37:57,296 --> 00:38:01,636
it's kind of like psychedelic lava lamp patterns.

950
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:03,856
I think the videos are not so good on this.

951
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:06,016
So it's hard to say exactly.

952
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:12,396
So this song I thought was either called People

953
00:38:12,396 --> 00:38:17,056
or Power, because I misheard for many years.

954
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:19,316
I thought that first line was power

955
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,716
is people keep on learning.

956
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,396
This song I'm a little more familiar with

957
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:27,156
because the Power Rangers skydive to it

958
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:28,856
in Power Rangers is the movie.

959
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:32,296
Yeah, that is a hundred percent a soundtrack I owned

960
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:35,636
on cassette and has a, they might be giant song

961
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:37,496
called Sense Around that I really like.

962
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,156
Well, I miss that train.

963
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:40,596
You know, I had every other day.

964
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:41,276
Yeah, weird.

965
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,536
Yeah, weird.

966
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:43,096
I miss that.

967
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:44,896
Oh, I gotta play that for you after this.

968
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:47,576
Yeah, that Power Rangers album.

969
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,336
What was that other big song on that?

970
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:51,916
Well, it was Trouble, I believe is the name of it.

971
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,956
By like an Australian teen girl group or something.

972
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:58,536
Like it was like, uh-oh, we're in trouble.

973
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:00,136
Trouble, someones going around

974
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,736
and they burst our bubble, yeah, yeah.

975
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:04,236
That's right, I recall that.

976
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:04,876
I didn't like that.

977
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,916
I didn't not like it, but I, oh, you know what?

978
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:08,916
Also, that's the first time I ever heard

979
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:12,516
one of my favorite Van Halen songs, Dream, Dreams,

980
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:16,976
excuse me, of a Hagar song, which I really liked too.

981
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:17,936
It's been a lot of money on the music

982
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,016
for the Power Rangers really.

983
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,076
But that wasn't for the movie though,

984
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:22,756
but I bet they licensed it.

985
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:25,056
Yeah, I don't know, Dreams probably was not.

986
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:28,316
Not inspired specifically by the Power Rangers.

987
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:30,816
They didn't write it thinking about.

988
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:34,336
Like man, they're all separate beings

989
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,096
that all unite into a greater whole.

990
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,176
Just like us.

991
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:41,396
And their skydiving jumpsuits match which color Rangers are.

992
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,256
Damn, good point, Alex.

993
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:44,036
Yeah.

994
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:44,596
Van Halen.

995
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:49,696
I think Dreams has some of the dumbest lyrics in any song,

996
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:50,916
but I love it.

997
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,536
I was gonna say, oh, I didn't know,

998
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,696
I don't think I heard the Stevie Wonder version

999
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:56,956
of Higher Ground for years.

1000
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:57,676
Yeah, yeah.

1001
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,796
You were surprised. I'm sure I knew.

1002
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,776
I was like, oh, huh, Stevie Wonder covered

1003
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:01,996
the Red Chili Peppers song.

1004
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,296
Huh, that's cool.

1005
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:05,216
He must be into cool music like I am.

1006
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,296
Well, I think that this song is a better,

1007
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:12,876
I think it delivers on the promise of the Chili Peppers

1008
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:18,216
being this mashup of 80s Grammy rock and funk.

1009
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,096
P-funk, yeah.

1010
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,036
Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,656
It's pretty good.

1012
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:25,256
This is about as quality of a rock track

1013
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,236
as you're gonna hear it on a Disney ride.

1014
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:30,716
Yeah, I think this is a good pick for this.

1015
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:32,296
I mean, obviously not as good as Roller Coaster,

1016
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:36,216
love Roller Coaster, but yeah, this is a high energy song.

1017
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:38,616
It's fun probably to listen to while you're zooming around.

1018
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:41,536
And the lighting, like they made it look like

1019
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:43,976
there were spotlights and stuff, stadium lighting.

1020
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,376
I will say I would not mind like after nine o'clock,

1021
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:49,596
it's Rock and Space Mountain

1022
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,336
and they cycle songs in and out.

1023
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:52,336
I would not.

1024
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:53,996
That was the plan.

1025
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:54,896
Yes, you're right.

1026
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:55,776
Yeah, yeah.

1027
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:56,056
Yeah, sad.

1028
00:40:56,556 --> 00:41:01,856
Well, yeah, because the setup for this,

1029
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:04,556
before they hatched the Chili Peppers plan,

1030
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:06,836
they were set up to do all of this

1031
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:08,636
and had put in screens and such

1032
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:12,756
because they auditioned this idea at Grad Night 2006

1033
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:15,676
in which they were kind of half-heartedly calling it

1034
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,996
Rock It Mountain, like Rock It Mountain.

1035
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,636
So the Giacchino song, pretty new.

1036
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:25,776
And that was what I read was that there is a collection

1037
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:30,976
of soundtrack of the park and it labels the Giacchino

1038
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:34,176
Space Mountain song as like daytime theme.

1039
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,276
Oh, oh, so they were gonna regularly maybe.

1040
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:39,896
So they were gonna like at night,

1041
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,736
it was gonna switch over.

1042
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:45,796
This was on Disney.fandom.com, the entry for,

1043
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,456
that actually did have an entry for Rock and Space Mountain.

1044
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:53,936
I'll say though, the screen made my mouse

1045
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:56,276
turn into a little Mickey hand,

1046
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,436
specifically a little Mickey pointy finger.

1047
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:02,476
Not wild about that, it's what he died to.

1048
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:06,816
Calm down, disney.fandom.com.

1049
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:10,196
Yeah, first time, not necessary anymore.

1050
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:11,676
So, but they were gonna, yeah,

1051
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:14,516
they were thinking at some point like,

1052
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:16,236
all right, it'll be spacey in the day

1053
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:17,616
and it'll be rock and roll at night.

1054
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:21,256
Now, I know because Jason and I sidebarred,

1055
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:24,696
I know that we know what was played

1056
00:42:24,696 --> 00:42:26,416
during Grad Night 2006.

1057
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:27,596
Do you know this fact?

1058
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,056
I don't.

1059
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,236
This is what we were hoping for.

1060
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:31,396
Hit me.

1061
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:35,736
The first rock song ever played on Space Mountain.

1062
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:36,456
Hit me, baby.

1063
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,576
Play it and then announce it.

1064
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,356
Without, oh, okay, all right.

1065
00:42:40,896 --> 00:42:41,836
Strap on the headphones.

1066
00:42:41,836 --> 00:42:43,216
I'm ready, I'm ready for this, I'm excited.

1067
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:47,416
You'll know it right away because it's an iconic track.

1068
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,660
And that's all I have.

1069
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,520
What the hell is that?

1070
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,580
Why, of course, Michael, that was everyone's favorite band of the 2000s.

1071
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,660
Huba Stank.

1072
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,400
Oh, wow, it's not even a hit.

1073
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,180
Let it Out by Huba Stank.

1074
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1075
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,300
I don't know, sorry, Huba Stank.

1076
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,100
According to something I saw, that was like a number two song.

1077
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,560
Was?

1078
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,240
But how? And that version I just played was from the live DVD Let It Out.

1079
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,240
So they liked that song enough to name the DVD after it.

1080
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,560
But why Huba Stank?

1081
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,260
Not a pleasant performance to watch.

1082
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,280
I was like, well, Huba Stank, their hit was...

1083
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,700
What was I? Wrote it down.

1084
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,280
The reason. Their hit was the reason.

1085
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, we all shed many tears to the reason.

1086
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,220
The reason is you.

1087
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,180
The music video for that.

1088
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,560
Folks, go find it. It's bonkers.

1089
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,420
It starts with a woman being hit by a car.

1090
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:09,440
And then you think it's about a guy regretting what he has done with the car.

1091
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,600
And it turns out that it is a setup for an elaborate jewelry heist.

1092
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,180
And she is fine.

1093
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,400
It is bizarre.

1094
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,920
It is so strange.

1095
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,780
So, yes, the first this was ever attempted.

1096
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Friggin Huba Stank, dude.

1097
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,300
Wow.

1098
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,400
And I am a little upset because I was at Grad Night 2005.

1099
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,380
Because I made my little sister take me.

1100
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,380
One year away.

1101
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,960
I had a second Grad Night.

1102
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,500
And yeah, if I was only one year off, I could have seen this pioneering rock moment.

1103
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,240
It would haunt me.

1104
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1105
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,600
Also, this one, I had the idea of a DJ setting up the space stage.

1106
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,520
Well, not the space stage, but it was introduced by a DJ who was referred to himself as Cosmic Ray.

1107
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,260
Now, is this the same Cosmic Ray who runs the Starlight Cafe that Sonny Eclipse performs in?

1108
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,500
I'll say yes.

1109
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,180
I think so.

1110
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,560
I think that establishes him as like a music fan.

1111
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,200
And he likes everything from a lounge lizard like Sonny Eclipse all the way to the hardest rock like Huba Stank.

1112
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,800
And is Sonny Eclipse and Cosmic Ray, are they in C?

1113
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,700
The Society of Explorers and Adventurers.

1114
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,760
They're probably in a more cosmic version of it.

1115
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,780
Space.

1116
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,680
What's their organization?

1117
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:31,480
Society of...

1118
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,500
Let's see.

1119
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:33,640
Can we see?

1120
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,500
There's a lot of letters.

1121
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,400
Explorers and Xenomorphs?

1122
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,380
Planetary, Astro...

1123
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,640
Planetary, Astronomical.

1124
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,080
I'm too exhausted.

1125
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,140
All right, we'll figure that out.

1126
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,900
Fill it in later.

1127
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,980
But DJ Rex is in it and Halix is in it.

1128
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,500
Oh yeah.

1129
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,720
And Halix 2.0.

1130
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,020
Man, we just created this.

1131
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,100
This is real now.

1132
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,500
This is real now.

1133
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,660
This is a space drill building.

1134
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,600
So we will declare the full space.

1135
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,460
I like this so much more than C.

1136
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,200
This is way up my alley.

1137
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,280
Let's tie all the rock shit together.

1138
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,440
When we get Rodeon, we gotta pitch him this.

1139
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,040
Yeah, let's make this official.

1140
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,380
They need their own oars put up in restaurants as well.

1141
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,260
Space oars.

1142
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,760
They're space oars.

1143
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,500
And Huba Stank's into.

1144
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,160
Huba Stank is the first band in space.

1145
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,160
So you're in.

1146
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:34,060
But the aesthetic has to be the 2000s curved metal aesthetic that I'm so fond of.

1147
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,420
The...

1148
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,340
Where everything had a lot of loose, like palm fronds.

1149
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,700
Yeah, loose fronds.

1150
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,080
Like a lot of inflatable neon furniture about.

1151
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,660
Then repurposed for high art exhibits.

1152
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,180
I was showing my co-hosts this.

1153
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,060
My new favorite Twitter account is called the Y2K Aesthetics Institute.

1154
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,440
And it catalogs a lot of this.

1155
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:07,560
Weird Timex watches that had tie-ins with the Tomb Raider video.

1156
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,820
You could buy this watch and Lara Croft, Polygon Lara Croft had the watch in the game.

1157
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:14,380
Oh, wow.

1158
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,600
Like the Tomb Raider.

1159
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,680
No, I gotta get this.

1160
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,880
I gotta subscribe to that Twitter.

1161
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,040
I don't...

1162
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,720
Jason, you were talking about inability to remember the song around the world.

1163
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,200
That's how I couldn't remember the name.

1164
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,540
The last couple of days, I'm like, what's this song called?

1165
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,900
Like, Work Me Up?

1166
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,720
Jam Me Off?

1167
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,920
I could not remember.

1168
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,240
And we just listened to it.

1169
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,620
And in my head, like, give me a poison.

1170
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,220
Marry me.

1171
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,280
I've got tears for you to say.

1172
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,320
I don't...

1173
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,700
My brain cannot retain.

1174
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,900
How did this band ever work?

1175
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,380
That is not a band.

1176
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,780
I liked a lot of mainstream stuff, but that is starting to get into the mainstream rock

1177
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,700
where I was just like, what is this?

1178
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,180
Well, Three Doors Down.

1179
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,500
I guess I liked Superman okay when it came out.

1180
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,600
But then once they started getting into the...

1181
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,240
What's the one?

1182
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,200
Being the only band going to play with Trump.

1183
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,280
Oh, yeah.

1184
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,520
Hold Me When I'm Going, like that stuff.

1185
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,680
I was like, this is...

1186
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:15,900
Oh, yeah.

1187
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,480
That's an awesome song.

1188
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,140
I can only assume...

1189
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,960
I'm gone.

1190
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,680
Any alien ant farm that is not the cover of a song you like already, it's probably pretty rough.

1191
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,920
Yeah, I don't...

1192
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,640
But I don't know.

1193
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,200
Movies?

1194
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,860
Maybe I would love Alien Ant Farm.

1195
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,540
I feel like maybe I liked movies when it came out.

1196
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,680
Which was not as big of a hit as Smooth Criminal was.

1197
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,660
It was at all.

1198
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,520
You don't know movies?

1199
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Movies is...

1200
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,380
I'm not going to say it might be pretty good because I haven't heard it in a long time when

1201
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,300
we play it and I'm like, oh, I'm embarrassed now.

1202
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,160
Look, it was never used on a roller coaster.

1203
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,000
That's kind of how I judge if a song is good or not.

1204
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,120
They should have had it in Hollywoodland at California Adventure because it was about movies.

1205
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,400
Missed opportunity.

1206
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,580
So, Hoobastank.

1207
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,340
But without Hoobastank, you don't get Rockin' Space Mountain.

1208
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,940
Now, who cares about that?

1209
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,340
I guess maybe you shouldn't.

1210
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,340
But remember, without Rockin' Space Mountain, you don't get Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.

1211
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:12,760
Right.

1212
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,640
Because all of the projection and the extra shit was put in before that.

1213
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,520
So, Rockin' Space Mountain, a not beloved thing, led to another thing that is...

1214
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,900
It's there.

1215
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,780
I don't know.

1216
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:28,840
People like it.

1217
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,000
I think it could use an upgrade.

1218
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,580
I think it takes more into people like it than don't.

1219
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,940
Yes, I think so.

1220
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,020
People love Star Wars too.

1221
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,100
They like hyperspace.

1222
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,640
A lot of people really into that.

1223
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,580
Hyperspace Mountain.

1224
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,380
So, Hyperspace Mountain...

1225
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,460
The Admiral Ackbar doesn't join the Space Mountain Fund unless Admiral Hoobastank

1226
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,040
Paves the way.

1227
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,140
Sharts the spaceship first.

1228
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,580
Sure.

1229
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,080
So, this is a very important pioneering ride, obviously.

1230
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,800
And it makes us think that they have missed a lot of opportunities to

1231
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,100
continue to include the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the park.

1232
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,880
Of course.

1233
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,700
Why hasn't this been done more?

1234
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,960
Everybody gets their lists.

1235
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:20,020
So, pull out your pre-written material because we are going to discuss ways to inject the

1236
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,520
Red Hot Chili Peppers into the park.

1237
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,960
You bring it up and I don't want to be rude and try to jump the line, but I feel like

1238
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,340
mine is the obvious one.

1239
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,340
I'm worried it's going to get done.

1240
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:30,900
I don't know.

1241
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,600
Mine could be too.

1242
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,480
Maybe we're all classics.

1243
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,440
I told Mike's already.

1244
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,000
I see.

1245
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,340
I see.

1246
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,140
Well, I told you the other day.

1247
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,260
Yours isn't that obvious.

1248
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,940
I bet Scott doesn't have it, but I could be wrong.

1249
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:40,740
Let's hear it.

1250
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,700
I'll just go.

1251
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,540
I mean, we're saying it's right there.

1252
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,320
It's crazy they didn't use the rollercoaster song on the rollercoaster song.

1253
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,720
I think you have to use the Zephyr song on Golden Zephyr.

1254
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,820
It's right.

1255
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,860
It's right.

1256
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,360
It's like sitting there.

1257
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,560
I mean, as the ride is starting up, you know, you're all buckled in and it starts to

1258
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,100
slowly go around in a circle before it goes medium around in a circle.

1259
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,520
Just hearing.

1260
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,020
Can you imagine hearing?

1261
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,900
Can I get your hand to write on just a piece of leg to bite on?

1262
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,820
What a night to fly my kite on.

1263
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,380
Do you want to flash your light on?

1264
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:26,920
And then as you get to the highest point and you're in this retro throwback rocket

1265
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:34,580
ship design like the pulps of the 1920s, which is how they justify the existence of this ride.

1266
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:41,380
Just hearing as you're zooming around Paradise Gardens Park,

1267
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,440
fly away on my Zephyr.

1268
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,240
I feel it more than ever.

1269
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,800
And in this perfect weather, we'll find a place together.

1270
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,340
And then you come back down to Earth, man.

1271
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,480
Right.

1272
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,800
I and you know what?

1273
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,800
That's actually I just went on the Golden Zephyr for the first time and it is oddly still.

1274
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,140
It was kind of nice.

1275
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,560
It's a fun to swing out over that.

1276
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,100
Lake and I like the design.

1277
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,120
And like I like I think it's a neat throwback thing.

1278
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,380
It's it's so crazy.

1279
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,420
It's still there.

1280
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,220
Yeah, crazy.

1281
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,160
It's still there.

1282
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,640
Barely.

1283
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,780
It's it's a sign of our crowd at the park is that they're operating it.

1284
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:23,040
But I actually think genuinely I think I really do think put the song in.

1285
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,360
Sure.

1286
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,120
Put the song in.

1287
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,120
Also, interesting fact about that ride.

1288
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,660
If it's a little too windy, they can't operate it.

1289
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,400
And certainly if the weather turns inclement, but like, yeah, winds.

1290
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,360
It's kind of susceptible to winds.

1291
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,540
Besides that stalwart ride.

1292
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah.

1293
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,540
All right.

1294
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,560
Zephyr song on Golden Zephyr.

1295
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,040
Mike, thoughts or I can.

1296
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,540
Well, I mean, I got I got a couple things here.

1297
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,160
I'll do one of my less interesting one.

1298
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:57,360
I mean, I think they're red hot chili peppers, famous song, snow, hey, oh, you know that?

1299
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,020
Of course.

1300
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:58,480
Yes.

1301
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,220
Let's put it on the Matterhorn.

1302
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,740
OK.

1303
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,280
Oh, yeah.

1304
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,580
It's got snow all over.

1305
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,880
I'm talking snow.

1306
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,200
Listen when I say, oh, I mean, that's fun.

1307
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,540
That's going to give it a different mood because really what you're trying to do

1308
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,920
with these overlays is give it a different feel.

1309
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,000
What is that song called?

1310
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,360
Snow, hey, oh, I just always thought it was just called, hey, oh,

1311
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,920
I think there's a parentheses in it.

1312
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,460
Let me look at it.

1313
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,440
Let me look it up for sure.

1314
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,220
I don't want to be inaccurate here.

1315
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:31,340
Snow, hey, oh, yes, snow parentheses, hey, oh, is what the name of the song is.

1316
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,780
So I think, you know, that's on the Matterhorn.

1317
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,480
I think now it's a fun experience.

1318
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,020
And maybe you know, you're on a snowy mountain, right?

1319
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,760
And an abominable snowman, maybe instead of he's reaching at you.

1320
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,140
I think in the last time when we did Matterhorn, I said he's giving you an ice cream cone.

1321
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,720
This time he's just giving you like the rock and roll symbol on your way up.

1322
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,380
He's just rocking out.

1323
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah, he loves snow parentheses.

1324
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:59,340
Hey, oh, he says, hey, oh, hey, oh, that's great.

1325
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:04,900
And then where there's that all the garbage and stuff, it's just a guitar.

1326
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,160
There's a guitar there.

1327
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,800
He stole a guitar.

1328
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,020
It's a kind of a throwback to the laziness.

1329
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,820
Yeah, I don't want any new robots.

1330
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,360
Just a broken guitar now added to the Skyway cab.

1331
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,240
Throw it on the pile.

1332
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,660
Yep.

1333
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,180
Great.

1334
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:18,580
Great.

1335
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,840
Love it.

1336
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,440
Okay.

1337
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:30,880
Well, I think that the Chili Peppers have been the soundtrack for some of the most

1338
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,420
thrilling attractions on the property.

1339
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:33,980
Yes.

1340
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,200
And they, you know, they proved their metal with that.

1341
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,900
But I think it's time for them to score the most thrilling attraction in the whole Anaheim

1342
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,160
Resort, which is of course the Bodine Sourdough Bakery.

1343
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,980
I think it's time for the Rockin' Bakery.

1344
00:54:53,560 --> 00:55:00,080
It's time for the Chili Peppers to set up shop in the home of the Motherdough and Papa Steve

1345
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,480
and all the iconic parts of the attraction that we know.

1346
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,620
You know, where there's rock lighting in the people making the bread have to do it under

1347
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,700
flashing rock lights.

1348
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,740
Also, they all take their clothes off and bake with just socks on.

1349
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,160
And obviously there's gotta be Chili Peppers blasting loud.

1350
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:28,920
Now for my full notion of it, they are going to have to do a custom song, but I was nice

1351
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,700
enough to do the demo for them.

1352
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,940
Oh, wow.

1353
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,340
And so I'd like to do that.

1354
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,860
All right, please.

1355
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,780
Present it to them now.

1356
00:55:43,412 --> 00:55:45,812
Every piece of dough comes from the mama.

1357
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:48,312
It's a process that was mastered by the papa.

1358
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:50,872
Steve always uses the sourdough starter.

1359
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:53,692
He takes a little flour and he mix it with water.

1360
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:56,532
Colin Mockery wears an orange polo.

1361
00:55:56,772 --> 00:55:58,932
Colin Mockery mocking Rosie's info.

1362
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:01,372
People ignore bakers in the window.

1363
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:04,092
How come everybody just wanna get the sample?

1364
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,892
Give it a bake, give it a bake, give it a bake now.

1365
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:09,452
Give it a bake, give it a bake, give it a bake now.

1366
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:11,912
Give it a bake, give it a bake, give it a bake now.

1367
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:14,632
Boat Dean knows how to bake a solid bread bowl.

1368
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,252
All right.

1369
00:56:17,652 --> 00:56:20,732
So that should save them some trouble.

1370
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,952
They could just use that as the guide and lay it down.

1371
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:25,612
And I think that's gonna,

1372
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:27,352
I think that's a great idea.

1373
00:56:27,372 --> 00:56:30,712
Maybe increase traffic to the sourdough factory a little bit.

1374
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:32,692
Rock, is there, what did you say a name already?

1375
00:56:32,812 --> 00:56:34,492
Is it Rockin' Sourdough?

1376
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:35,832
Like, what is the ad?

1377
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,032
What are the ads gonna look like?

1378
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:38,552
Yeah, I guess Rockin' Dough.

1379
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:39,672
Rockin' Dough?

1380
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:40,372
Rockin' the Dough?

1381
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:44,452
Rockin' the Dough, give it a bakery.

1382
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:46,512
The Rockin' Dough, give it a bakery.

1383
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:47,812
Right. Yeah, great.

1384
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:49,132
I think, yeah, use that one,

1385
00:56:49,132 --> 00:56:51,112
or just like use Roller Coaster on that,

1386
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,352
because you were subverting expectations.

1387
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:55,212
Yeah, not on the roller coasters.

1388
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:56,532
Use it in the bakery tour.

1389
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:58,092
Just in every bathroom.

1390
00:56:58,092 --> 00:56:58,672
Either way.

1391
00:56:58,872 --> 00:57:00,692
That's part of the thing, every bathroom.

1392
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:04,512
And obviously you're gonna have to, easy one,

1393
00:57:04,732 --> 00:57:09,132
bring back the Starcade and call it Stadium Starcadium.

1394
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,192
Well, that's good, I mean, that's just good.

1395
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:14,092
So there's a ton of ways to get it.

1396
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:16,592
Well, my other ones, they're not gonna pale

1397
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,092
in comparison to the original song.

1398
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:20,692
I just feel like there's two classic songs

1399
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:22,152
from Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic

1400
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:24,392
that could be applied to a couple dark rides.

1401
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:27,232
I'm talking about the song Suck My Kiss

1402
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:29,152
that should be placed on Little Mermaid.

1403
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:33,832
Oh yeah, she kinda sucks, well, she sucks the voice.

1404
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:35,872
Right, but she's looking for a kiss,

1405
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,712
true love from the prince.

1406
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:41,012
So Sebastian should be like, suck my kid,

1407
00:57:41,152 --> 00:57:42,672
like he should be doing that.

1408
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:44,272
And it's just talking about kissing,

1409
00:57:44,412 --> 00:57:45,312
it's not anything else dirty.

1410
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:48,912
And you could get like an aquatic animal,

1411
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:53,632
I don't know what's, I guess they've already got a,

1412
00:57:53,752 --> 00:57:55,432
the base is like an octopus.

1413
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,632
So you just make like a sea turtle that looks like Flea

1414
00:57:58,632 --> 00:58:01,152
with the head down kinda slapping that thing.

1415
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:02,472
And the famous line,

1416
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,772
come to me sweet sacred bliss,

1417
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:08,512
your mouth was made to suck my kiss,

1418
00:58:08,712 --> 00:58:11,452
sung by some, please come to me.

1419
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,952
It's somewhere like in a pizza man, but whatever.

1420
00:58:15,052 --> 00:58:16,752
I was gonna say it's like a vampire a little bit.

1421
00:58:16,752 --> 00:58:18,592
I can't hear these headphones, that's why.

1422
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:21,092
That's it, but you could calibrate your Jamaican.

1423
00:58:21,092 --> 00:58:23,692
Yeah, and then the song from Blood, Sugar, Sex,

1424
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:26,912
on the same album, a song called I Could Have Lied,

1425
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:28,812
obviously on Pinocchio.

1426
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:30,392
Sure.

1427
00:58:31,352 --> 00:58:34,112
That was my, the thought in general is that Pinocchio

1428
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:38,572
as this sort of, Pleasure Island is this broken wasteland.

1429
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:40,772
You could almost, hey, how about this?

1430
00:58:41,012 --> 00:58:45,892
Why don't we slow Pinocchio's Daring Journey down a lot.

1431
00:58:46,012 --> 00:58:46,632
Okay, yeah.

1432
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:49,312
Like make it like 10 times as slow

1433
00:58:49,312 --> 00:58:51,612
and make it kind of this crawl through

1434
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:54,312
where you like kind of address Ketis' past.

1435
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,052
Oh, interesting.

1436
00:58:55,052 --> 00:58:57,072
And like show, and like instead of them

1437
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:58,452
just turning into donkeys,

1438
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:00,892
like they're strung out on heroin

1439
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:02,512
lying around Pleasure Island.

1440
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:03,332
Yeah.

1441
00:59:03,372 --> 00:59:05,592
It could be a perfect, like,

1442
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:08,032
because the Chili Peppers deal with some themes too,

1443
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,132
and it's, this is a theme park,

1444
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:12,732
and I think it's time to, you know, why not?

1445
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,932
That ride's kind of a guilt trip anyway,

1446
00:59:14,932 --> 00:59:18,872
so let's teach kids about the dangers of drug use

1447
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:20,112
and of playing too much billiards.

1448
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:20,672
Sure.

1449
00:59:21,612 --> 00:59:23,972
Then that's also, I think, if we're gonna go that route,

1450
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:28,212
which I am all for, I think that there needs to be

1451
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:31,352
one addition to the Pleasure Island section of the ride.

1452
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:34,272
I think you need to build the bridge

1453
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:36,372
from the song Under the Bridge.

1454
00:59:37,692 --> 00:59:39,732
So, which is the, you know what I'm talking about,

1455
00:59:40,132 --> 00:59:41,812
that's the famous song, Under the Bridge.

1456
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:44,732
Take me to a place I love.

1457
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:47,292
Jason knows it is take me to the place I love.

1458
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:48,892
That's why I was trying to get to the chorus

1459
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:49,972
and I couldn't think of it for a second.

1460
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:52,892
So you build that bridge, you put it up in there,

1461
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:55,052
and then when you go in and slowly through the vehicle,

1462
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,212
you go under the bridge like in the song.

1463
00:59:57,352 --> 00:59:58,292
Hmm, yeah.

1464
00:59:58,452 --> 00:59:59,512
So. Yeah.

1465
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:01,232
Pretty simple there.

1466
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:02,792
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:08,952
And you move the hell section of Mr. Toad

1468
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:09,952
to the end of that.

1469
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:11,012
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1470
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:14,232
It's a sad song, so you die in this one.

1471
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:15,712
It's called Under the Bridge.

1472
01:00:16,832 --> 01:00:17,592
The song's called Under the Bridge, yeah.

1473
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:18,552
I really didn't think it was called

1474
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:19,972
Take me to the place I love.

1475
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:21,272
Once again.

1476
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:23,292
Sometimes I feel like I don't.

1477
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:25,912
That's probably the biggest song they've had, actually.

1478
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:28,712
So music recommendations for the end of this episode.

1479
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,392
Take me to the place I love.

1480
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,412
Power. Power.

1481
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:35,572
Parentheses people, keep on learning.

1482
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:40,372
And the Australian song about the Power Rangers.

1483
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:41,692
Trouble. Trouble, yeah.

1484
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:43,972
Well, we got a lot of great music picks.

1485
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:45,832
And of course, and of course, Who Bustank?

1486
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:49,692
The name of the song, which was called Live It On.

1487
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:50,892
Let it out.

1488
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,172
Okay, close enough.

1489
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:53,252
I almost got there.

1490
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:54,812
Parentheses, hey-o.

1491
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:56,732
Live it out.

1492
01:00:57,052 --> 01:00:57,392
Prevent.

1493
01:00:58,352 --> 01:00:59,372
We're tired.

1494
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:02,372
Check out the Reason music video.

1495
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,952
Be sure to watch the Reason music video.

1496
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,392
I'll post my, but I will make a Chili Peppers playlist

1497
01:01:08,392 --> 01:01:09,172
tonight, I promise.

1498
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:11,472
But before I go to bed, I'll fall asleep doing it.

1499
01:01:11,612 --> 01:01:15,012
Even though the audience won't hear this right now.

1500
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:16,812
No, they won't, but I want it ready now

1501
01:01:16,812 --> 01:01:18,912
before I lose the interest in it.

1502
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:20,712
How could you?

1503
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:22,592
Clearly what Disney's teaching us

1504
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:24,132
is to keep the spirit of the Chili Peppers

1505
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:26,832
in our lives 365, or at least for four months

1506
01:01:26,832 --> 01:01:29,052
until the licensing agreement ends.

1507
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:33,352
Right, and let's get some retro Chili Peppers merch

1508
01:01:33,352 --> 01:01:34,272
in Disney.

1509
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:38,352
Let's get a yesteryear shirt.

1510
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:41,092
Jason's holding his head in his hands when I say that.

1511
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:43,392
There was some debate real quick.

1512
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,892
The last thing I have to say is that I was looking online,

1513
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:48,272
there's a lot of debate of why Disney wasn't doing

1514
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,492
a ton of marketing with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1515
01:01:50,592 --> 01:01:52,892
And there was a debate whether it was just something

1516
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:54,332
that was kind of limited time,

1517
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:56,832
or there was a possible dispute

1518
01:01:56,832 --> 01:01:57,992
with the Red Hot Chili Peppers

1519
01:01:57,992 --> 01:02:00,852
that they didn't want to actually be used in advertising.

1520
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:04,432
And that they just licensed the music for the rides,

1521
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,432
but not, they didn't want to appear in the ads.

1522
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:06,892
Interesting.

1523
01:02:06,912 --> 01:02:08,852
Because the commercials that you find online

1524
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:11,492
don't make any mention of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1525
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:13,792
It just goes rockin', space mountain,

1526
01:02:13,892 --> 01:02:16,472
and it doesn't say what the song is,

1527
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:18,112
it doesn't make a big deal out of it.

1528
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:20,152
It doesn't even have rock music, I think,

1529
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:22,632
in the commercial or anything that's actually that cool.

1530
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:24,972
Rock music in general.

1531
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:26,972
Yeah, so it's confusing.

1532
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:29,432
There's debate about exactly what was going on.

1533
01:02:29,452 --> 01:02:32,832
And that's the last very interesting tidbit

1534
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,772
I had in my head.

1535
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:34,592
All right.

1536
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:36,332
You know, I missed one quote,

1537
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:41,352
and maybe we can end with this one as a final note,

1538
01:02:41,352 --> 01:02:43,532
and you survived podcast ride the second,

1539
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:48,472
wait, you survived RHCP at DLR on PTR2G,

1540
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:50,412
which I'd like to catch on in general,

1541
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:52,172
that the second gate is PTR2G.

1542
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:55,972
But in the immortal words of Uncle Joe,

1543
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:58,712
no matter which planet you're from,

1544
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:01,392
it doesn't work, it's at the end.

1545
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:04,112
What I'm saying is you go out into that,

1546
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:08,072
as you start your day or whatever you're heading off to do

1547
01:03:08,072 --> 01:03:09,332
as you finish this episode,

1548
01:03:09,592 --> 01:03:11,252
no matter what planet you're from,

1549
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,032
we're about to rock your world.

1550
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:15,272
This works great.

1551
01:03:15,552 --> 01:03:20,792
And it's all gonna happen in five, four, three, two,

1552
01:03:20,832 --> 01:03:22,612
rock and roll.

1553
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:24,092
Bye.

1554
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:25,232
Goodbye. Bye.
