1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Warning, the following podcast contains inaccurate cartoon drinks, the horrors of front-facing

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,400
Homer, bodies slamming into hard plastic, and a very rare instance of some men in their 30s

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,000
talking about what Simpsons jokes they like.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
All that plus, Henry Gilbert and Bob Mackie join us to talk the Simpsons ride on today's

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
podcast, Le Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three proud Martin Princes.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,320
My name is Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,200
Joining me as always, Martin Prince number two, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
That's right.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah, I every now and then I think we're going to run out of like accurate semi roasts of

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,120
ourselves and no, not the case.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,800
No, because it also could be well, let's bring in Martin Prince number three, Scott Gardner

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,760
real quick because there's other options too with the Simpsons, I think.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,400
But I Martin Prince to me is the is the most fun.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,720
Yeah, it could be.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm happy to not be a Ralph Wiggin.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,040
Yeah, or I mean, I mean, what guy you could say because sometimes we're like salty about

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
things.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,520
He's more he's more toxic than us.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
But that's true. Yeah.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,760
I the original toxic fan.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,800
We say our whole world is coming, but guys with like a smile, we have a smile when we're

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,880
trashing things and that's not what comic book guy would do.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,400
He sort of you like things sometimes.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure when the comic book guy, even his appreciation has an air of malice to it.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,840
Right. So I think if we really got in depth with this, we could also like combine things

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,480
like Jason's a Martin Prince and like an Abe Simpson.

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
You could combine two.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,120
But that was too long for the intro.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,680
So I didn't want to waste more time because, you know, we have a big topic today.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,640
Let's bring our guests in. Maybe they have maybe they have ideas about what we should

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,160
be as far as like Simpson mashups.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,560
What they themselves are. I'd be curious to see.

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
So, yeah, profiled.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,440
You know them from Talking Simpsons and what a cartoon.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,760
Those two great podcasts.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,480
It's Henry Gilbert and Bob Mackie.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,160
Hey, happy to be here, everybody.

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,600
I want to call myself the Langdon Alger of this podcast.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Very good.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,040
And and I, Henry Gilbert, I think, you know, at first I thought Milhouse or Martin,

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
but I think I'm more of a database.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
That's that's my that's my guy.

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,640
Oh, nice. Very good.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,440
Yeah, that's those are two, I would say, like obscure, but not real.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Like for like, if you're still toys.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
Yeah, exactly. But there's toys of everything.

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
I guess that's a good point. There are toys of everything.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,320
So we all have our identities, our Simpson identities.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,640
We are talking about the Simpsons ride at Universal Studios today.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,080
We have the experts on.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,160
I don't know. I just realized I put a lot of pressure on you by calling you experts.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,160
Would you say what would you say?

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,320
You know what? I'll take it. I am sure.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh, great. Yeah, I think riding it twice qualifies you as an expert.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,240
Yeah. Authorities, maybe. Sure.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Oh, I like that. Yeah, that's like very official.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,560
We know all the context for the ride, which is the most important part. Right.

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
And you guys have you guys have seen every Simpson episode,

63
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,920
every piece of Simpson media, would you say?

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Well, actually, well, for me, there is like a decade of the show

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,960
I have not watched, but same here an entire decades.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Wow. About a third of it.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,040
But I mean, we're making our way through the entire run of the show.

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,160
And currently we're in starting season 13 pretty soon.

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
I got you.

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,200
But all pre 9-11 Simpsons, we know it better than, I'd say,

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
pretty much anybody, anybody with a podcast.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll say that. But yeah.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
The what's the biggest blank spot?

74
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,520
Like if you defined the the edges of what you don't know so much.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,360
You know, I think it's all the stuff right before the movie.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,240
That is my least watched stuff.

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,040
And then I came back from the movie.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,840
And then every now and then after the movie, I'd check in and like,

79
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,160
oh, I heard this episode is good or that episode is good.

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,480
And then the last like four seasons, I actually have watched kind of regularly.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,520
But yeah, so it's I'd say the 17 through 20.

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,080
Pretty, pretty blank for me.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
For me, I think it's 19 through late 20s.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,120
So I think the late aughts to the late teens.

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,600
And when we started doing this podcast, I felt obligated to watch more of the new stuff.

86
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Gotcha. So, yeah, your sweet spot is what we're like a lot of our sweet spots

87
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,040
for the Simpsons lies.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,640
I mean, we're very similar to you guys in just about every.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
It's why I love podcasts arrived, because we are also anxious nerds

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,040
who were scared of roller coasters and like the theme.

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.

92
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,920
So, yeah. So you so you both been on the Simpsons ride at this point. Mm hmm.

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,040
I've I've written it in both coasts.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,400
Bob, Bob, just Hollywood. But.

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,480
Gotcha. OK.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,080
And would you say like, like your theme park people to you,

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,680
you like theming and you like nonsense like we do.

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,640
So would you say like your first time going on it was it like this is all

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,760
I would ever imagine from a Simpsons thing experience.

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,880
I had a. Oh, interesting. Oh, OK.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
I had I had some mixed opinions.

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm sure we'll get into them. But I don't know.

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,640
Yeah. Up front, about a six out of 10 in terms of an experience.

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,600
I didn't. Interesting.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,960
I'd give the ride itself like a B, B minus, but I've been surrounding

107
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,040
Springfield area like that. I give like a day like I love.

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I love Springfield and I like the Simpsons ride.

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
OK, that's interesting.

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,120
Well, and it's only grown on both coasts.

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,960
So, boy, I guess when there wasn't that, you'd rank it all lower.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,640
But it like, yeah, I love that that Springfield keeps expanding.

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,840
And yeah, that I don't know it like it.

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,800
I feel like it took over some kind of generic areas of Universal

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,440
and imbued them instead with really specific things that people love

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,160
and areas full of Easter eggs and some of the food is all right.

117
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Am I am I wrong?

118
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,640
Well, especially compared to in Florida.

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,960
I believe it was a food court called the International Food and Film Festival.

120
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,440
And that was one of the grimest

121
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,720
theme park culinary destinations you could hit.

122
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,640
Was it like it was kind of just a giant room, like like like an indoor food court?

123
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,000
That's what I recall, that they made more festive with flags,

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,880
like country flags, flags and movie posters.

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,720
And now it's, you know, the the fast food boulevard kind of food court.

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
But yeah, I think the the fried chicken and the Krusty Burger food,

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,520
Cletus's chicken, Shack Chicken and Krusty Burger is pretty solid, pretty reliable.

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
Yeah, I would agree. Yeah.

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
I like the Duff.

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,040
It's it's just meant to be like a Budweiser.

131
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
You know, yeah, that's true.

132
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Yeah, there's there's harder Duffs, I think.

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,800
They've there's been there's there's a variety that I tend to like.

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,920
And well, and then you got those you got the doughnut

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
neck of the woods, too, right?

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,640
Yeah, I mean, which I haven't actually tried.

137
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
Yeah, I know you're into it. Yeah.

138
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,720
Some big disappointments for me, though, were I really wanted to go

139
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,640
to the Frying Dutchman, but it's not in the California location.

140
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
So that was a huge disappointment for me.

141
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,960
And if you want to start talking about Moe's, I feel like

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,920
there's so much opportunity there that is missed.

143
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,800
There are some parts there that are really, really cool in the Moe's

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,440
restaurant location.

145
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,280
But after visiting the Star Wars Cantina bar, whatever that's called,

146
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,760
I feel like it should be that style of experience where you're seated.

147
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,400
You can get two drinks and then you leave and there are no children.

148
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,480
And they could add a lot more to the atmosphere that's missing.

149
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
The dank is missing.

150
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,120
And the one, yes, the all important dank is not there.

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Got no dank.

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,240
It's a good point. That's pretty true.

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,160
It kind of is because at least in Hollywood, I don't know the Orlando

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,560
restaurant situation at all.

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,160
Hollywood. Yeah, they're all just like connected by an open door.

156
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
So there's kind of just like one flow through all of the rooms.

157
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,160
So they get a little samey.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,880
Now, I like the area upstairs, which has a lot of Easter eggs

159
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
and display cases and everything.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,560
But yeah, I know what you mean, where Moe's just is the same as

161
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Krusty Perger a little bit, except that, you know, it's

162
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,520
at least is it is themed and you got your

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,600
and you got your phone, you got the phone that you can pick up and hear.

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,640
But it's not Bart prank calls, right?

165
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
What's am I making this up?

166
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
There's something weird with the phone.

167
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,000
That phone doesn't do nothing. I picked up that phone.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,520
It doesn't say anything like there's an outdoor outside of the quickie mart.

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,440
There's a payphone that that has like jokes that come out of it.

170
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
But I I swear I've never heard anything about it, but it does have the love tester.

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Like the love test is fun. That's a good reference.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
That's good. Yeah.

173
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
And you can quickie mark phone.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't know. I don't know what's on the quickie mark phone.

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,360
Oh, if you pick up, if the phone rings outside the quickie mark,

176
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,240
this might just be in Orlando, but

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
by the Millhouse bench, there's a payphone.

178
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,080
And if it rings and you pick it up like, say,

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
Professor Frank will say, hey, there's an escaped monkey.

180
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
Can you guys help us find it or something like that?

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
Like you'll you'll get a phone call from local Springfieldian.

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,520
It's like original dialogue recorded for the place, which I always thought was cool.

183
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
That's really cool.

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,240
And particularly because like the you know, these actors,

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
they don't come cheap and they're like and in his area's case, he's such a big name.

186
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
So it's kind of crazy that he recorded jokes that are only if you know, to pick up a phone

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
is one part of the theme park.

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
I am pretty impressed by that.

189
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
I guess we I don't know if we've mentioned that yet, if we haven't been on this ride.

191
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,680
Most of the Simpsons voice cast does their characters

192
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,680
with the glaring exception of Harry Shearer.

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,360
Yes. Yeah.

194
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
None of his characters appear.

195
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,600
According to a of all things TMZ article,

196
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,960
it was due to scheduling conflicts and availability.

197
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,320
Lies.

198
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,560
Well, I don't believe that for a second.

199
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,440
Yeah, I don't.

200
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't.

201
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,680
Maybe he wanted them to call it lay ride and they're like, no, Harry, no, no, no.

202
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,280
I was coming in with the little a little less show edge as well.

203
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,320
I that's I think I find it so funny.

204
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,200
And if you don't know all this, like Harry Shearer's level of removal

205
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,760
from the Simpsons is a lot higher than the rest of the cast.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,640
I think like probably the most visible,

207
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,160
you know, way of conveying that is his lack of participation on the ride.

208
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,960
But I really like that he, you know, because he's famous,

209
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,680
he was famously difficult on Saturday Night Live and probably in other capacities.

210
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,280
And I like that he has one thing that's his pure thing.

211
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,120
This is Harry.

212
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,200
There's only there's one piece of true Harry art.

213
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,800
And has anyone heard it?

214
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Has anyone ever made that mistake?

215
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
Clip of like a clip.

216
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,520
I like if I like Harry, I like the Simpsons.

217
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm sure I would like a show.

218
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,920
And then, oh, boy, oh, boy.

219
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,360
Bob, Henry, are you thinking about a show podcast?

220
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,440
Perhaps would you go to a podcast?

221
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, a podcast, perhaps.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
I had the same experience and actually I didn't encounter the show

223
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,920
until the George W.

224
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,440
Bush administration and somebody posted a clip of a music video

225
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,000
he made called Waterboarding USA.

226
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,640
So, Scott, there's a Beach Boys parody you can listen to.

227
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,080
And it's Harry Shearer playing all the Beach Boys

228
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,680
in a song about waterboarding.

229
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,040
And it was it was sort of like a wait, wait, don't tell me style of humor.

230
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,880
It was, you know, edgy subject material, but very gentle.

231
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,480
Right. Do you know that he I guess not a lot has changed

232
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
since that particular administration, because he put out an entire album

233
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,840
of Trump songs and it's him as Trump.

234
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
And but his Trump is like

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm trying to think there's always a song that's just like, like Son in Law.

236
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,800
I love my son in law.

237
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,080
And like, I didn't know Trump was so nasal.

238
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,480
I didn't know Trump sounded so much like Ned Flanders.

239
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Was that a Dunk of Shane parody?

240
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,640
Don't think that's kind of what I sang, isn't it?

241
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,320
I think I think there are no parodies.

242
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,000
I think it's all original melodies so that he can, you know,

243
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
doesn't have to pay money to the original artist.

244
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,360
But not only that, but all of his thing now also is mocap.

245
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,480
So he does like Polar Express style.

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
He is playing Trump.

247
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,400
So there's some studio somewhere where he's covered in dots and ping

248
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,880
pong balls and physicalizing Trump to make these like

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,120
very upsetting looking music videos that have a thousand views.

250
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,400
Where do those go? Just on YouTube?

251
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,280
I think maybe my damn channel.

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,200
I recall him having a heavy partnership with my damn channel.

253
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
If anyone recalls those three words.

254
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Just like a Manchurian candidate activation phrase.

255
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,800
I forgot about my damn channel.

256
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Jason stomping out of the room.

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't know what he's going to do.

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
Something bad.

259
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,760
His eyes went red. What's in that guitar case?

260
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Well, not up to the 2020 election last year.

261
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,040
Sorry, in 2020, Matt Garaning started a YouTube channel.

262
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,000
He posted one video and it was a short he commissioned.

263
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,480
About Trump and Dan Castellaneta is singing a song as Trump.

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,360
And I love Dan, but his Trump is not that great.

265
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,800
And to date, that's the only thing that's ever been posted on Mac

266
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Garaning's YouTube channel.

267
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
Well, you know, to be fair, we all had a lot of grand plans

268
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
at the start of the pandemic.

269
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,640
You know, I went and got a video capture card.

270
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm like, maybe I'm going to Twitch stream now.

271
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,480
And I did like three and I was like, this is a lot of work.

272
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,200
I think with Shira, it's just he's such like a jerk, like even

273
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,680
the other spinal, even the other spinal tap guys in interviews

274
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,080
are just like, yeah, he's a jerk.

275
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,640
Like I have the time.

276
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,880
We're not speaking to each other.

277
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,680
We're the other half time. We make stuff.

278
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,440
I even I remember his WTF, Shira, and he admits like,

279
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,360
yeah, I can be a tough guy to work with.

280
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,280
But then he would say stuff of like when I worked on SNL,

281
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,640
I told Lauren to his face, he was a fraud.

282
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,360
And I was like, you know, that's cool.

283
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
I'm cool with that. But.

284
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,680
And he famously has never been that happy with the Simpsons.

285
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,400
If you listen to the commentaries, he has been on the record

286
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,280
hating episodes everyone loves, even back to the early 90s.

287
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,040
Like he was a vocal detractor of Homer at the Bat

288
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,960
and thing and Cape Fear as well.

289
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,240
And he's been in the press publicly saying, oh, yeah, the show has really lost it.

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
Like multiple times throughout history.

291
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
Yeah, there's a week in one of our research things for the

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,280
Lady Bouvier's Lover, which is like that's such a classic.

293
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
That's the one with McGaggy's birthday.

294
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,840
All that like there's there was a I think, let's say, L.A.

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,000
times, but that type of profile like the writers room.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,560
Here's how they write the episode.

297
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,280
And then here's how they record it.

298
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,840
And they're talking to Shira and he's like, yeah, season four kind of sucked.

299
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,000
This seems a little better, I guess.

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,160
And he's just like that was that was in the salad days of Simpsons.

301
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,760
He's just shitting all over it in the press on the record.

302
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,760
Wow. I remember getting the I'm sorry.

303
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,360
I remember getting the audio commentary when the DVDs came out.

304
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,240
I started looking forward to those audio commentaries so much.

305
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,520
They're so fantastic, as I'm sure you guys know.

306
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,200
And one of my favorite episodes has always been two bad neighbors.

307
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,720
The George not W Bush, the George Bush episode removes in across the street.

308
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,560
And like, I can't wait to hear that one just always blew up my brain as a kid.

309
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
I can't wait to hear the making of it.

310
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,320
And I was so shocked when everybody who worked on it said, well, a certain actor

311
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,800
had a certain problem with what he thought was the what he called the worst satire

312
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
he's ever seen in his life.

313
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
And they're kind of like it, but it's not satire.

314
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
It's like a funny thing.

315
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,040
Like if George Bush was a crotchety guy and he's Mr.

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,240
Wilson on Dennis, the menace,

317
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,160
I could not believe that that didn't pass most of it.

318
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
That classic episode.

319
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,000
I have a feeling it had to be Shira who said that there's no way like it.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,160
His area was so shitting.

321
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,120
Yeah. And he had to do the voice, which he did very well.

322
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,760
Boy, are the voices great.

323
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,960
Well, I mean, not some of these other ones we're talking about, but.

324
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,880
Yeah. Classic voices.

325
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,000
He just wanted a return to frosty chocolate milkshakes.

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,840
He's like, we got to get back to the core of the show.

328
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,520
It's not just his voice that's missing.

329
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,800
I think someone had to point this out to Henry and myself.

330
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,480
His characters aren't there as well, except for scratchy.

331
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
There's no skinner or Ned or Burns.

332
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,320
And it was very conspicuous because there is a movie poster

333
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,360
in the Springfield area of Universal that should be Rainier Wolf Castle.

334
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,040
But it's a Rainier Wolf Castle like figure.

335
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,600
So I don't I don't know if they're doing that to spite him

336
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,920
or if he had control over his characters or what.

337
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
That's yeah, that's interesting.

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,280
I feel like he couldn't have control.

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
It feels like Spite. Right.

340
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Yeah. It's also the ride implies that there is a second nuclear reactor

341
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,360
in Springfield at the theme park, in addition to the one

342
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,960
that Homer works at.

343
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,760
Yeah, I'd feel. Yeah.

344
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,880
Did they like get a contract from the power plant

345
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,960
for the power plant to install the equipment?

346
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,920
It like like somehow everything is powered by just a glowing green room

347
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
at the theme park.

348
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,920
I assume that Krusty got, you know, just he worked with Burns

349
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,440
off the record on it to get the power for it.

350
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,680
That's that's I mean, I wish I feel like Burns should be the villain of this.

351
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
But it's still I think it's a great ride for story purposes, a great ride.

352
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,680
But it's like Burns is the ultimate villain of Simpsons to me.

353
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,960
And he should be the ride villain more than even Sideshow Bob, I think.

354
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,120
But yeah, instead of just quickly passing by in a balloon with Smithers,

355
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,880
who is also very sure who it is also also does not talk that that is there.

356
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,360
It is the briefest, glorious appearance of two major characters in the show.

357
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,360
And just like no Ned Flanders presence at all in the entire area.

358
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,760
Like, that's just a bummer, you know.

359
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,960
But it's like I'm usually the first couple of times I went to there.

360
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
I was so just like giddy of like, look, it's that and look, it's that.

361
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,520
And I'm just telling I'm explaining every reference to either my mother

362
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,400
or my husband going there.

363
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,200
But but then once I notice no Harry Shearer characters there,

364
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
that's the spell is over.

365
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm like, oh, yeah, they're Ned should be there.

366
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,240
Or Smithers should be there, whoever.

367
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,680
Like they're lucky that he doesn't or Kent Brockman. No, Kent Brockman.

368
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
I want a picture with Lenny.

369
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting.

370
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,840
Yeah, it's it's something I don't even think I noticed immediately

371
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,400
because I was like, side show Bob has been like portrayed as a super villain

372
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,800
many times.

373
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,880
So I think it like take it took me like a couple trips to go, wait a minute.

374
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,320
Something something's missing here.

375
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,360
But you know what I will say was something I recall was that the

376
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,960
the movie had no side show Bob element

377
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,120
and not that they're they're needed to be.

378
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,080
But there's something cinematic about him and his appearances.

379
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,840
Like they were always nodding to to films like Cape Fear.

380
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
And he was like a once a season character.

381
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,040
So such a Bob, they've managed to make feel a little special

382
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,560
and almost felt like he could have been in the movie somewhere.

383
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,360
And then I remember being excited, hearing that he was a big part of the ride

384
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,160
and that the the makers of the show said they kind of saved him for the ride.

385
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
I think that is like a big piece that I'm glad they they held on to.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
And, you know, that may make does make him more special.

387
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,880
Yeah. I mean, I was just going to say that I don't want to get too much Simpson.

388
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,080
I don't want to critique.

389
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
But like I also like Albert Brooks is in the movie.

390
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
But like, why wasn't that character Hank Scorpio?

391
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,200
We have literally asked that to Mike Scully and he's like, he can't remember.

392
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,560
And yeah, we have our theories.

393
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,560
We I'm I'm pretty sure.

394
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,840
It's one producer on the show or the movie in particular

395
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,120
did not want to have to dense a reference because they wanted it to not be a two

396
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,480
insular movie and they wanted it to be more for like they for podcast

397
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,600
or for podcast, right?

398
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,120
I think they cut an autopia joke from the movie because they're like,

399
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,880
no, who knows what autopia is?

400
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,000
That's too deep a reference to do it.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So they cut it.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,200
So really, I have a feeling to that, like, well, I think in some drafts

403
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,920
it was Hank Scorpio and then they decided this is too inside.

404
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,120
They changed that villain so much.

405
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,320
He had a different toy made of him, right?

406
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,720
Yeah, the Burger King toys, different toy for.

407
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,480
Yeah. Man, that's it makes sense that that would have been a thought at some point.

408
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,400
But yeah, there's a similar thing to where, again, a Rainier Wolf Castle thing,

409
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,640
where Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the movie and not Rainier Wolf Castle,

410
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,400
which is very odd because like, how do you have both?

411
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,600
How does the Simpsons universe include?

412
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,440
How is there a fully functioning major movie star, Rainier Wolf Castle,

413
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,520
who is in the same world as our Arnold Schwarzenegger?

414
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
I think I think it was cowardice on their part.

415
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
They were scared people wouldn't know who McBain was.

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,840
And they're like, no, just make it make it, Arnold.

417
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,360
No, let's not have the parody thing.

418
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,240
Just make it, Arnold.

419
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,920
Obvious for the the big stupid dummies who go to see this movie.

420
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,040
You know, I feel like all that is a bit of an overthink.

421
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,560
Like, I think so being that it does feel like every human being

422
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,320
has come across the Simpsons at some point.

423
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
Maybe they were forgetting that.

424
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,000
Maybe someone at the studio was not sure enough of that.

425
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,080
But I feel like these characters are, you know, in the fabric of the culture

426
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
at this point, and it's not just the family.

427
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,800
It's like the entire, you know, 12 to 20 biggest supporting characters, too.

428
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
They want to change Wiggum because they're like, folks don't know

429
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,560
Edward G. Robinson and they're going to be so lost.

430
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,800
We need to change him.

431
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,240
We've talked about the movie a lot on other people's podcasts,

432
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,800
but it's so strange that for a show that famously receives no notes

433
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,640
because that was the edict from the beginning, the movie was focus group to death.

434
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,520
They really relied on focus groups and screenings to guide the writing,

435
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,520
to change the characters, to get rid of jokes that didn't work.

436
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,400
It's very strange for them to have no confidence when they famously

437
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,720
marched forth without any guidance from the network.

438
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah. On the commentary, they because they recorded the commentary

439
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,680
like right as the film was debuting.

440
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,560
And on the DVD commentary, they say, like, well, Arizona like this,

441
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
but Seattle didn't like that.

442
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,480
And if Seattle didn't laugh really hard at this joke, we wouldn't.

443
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
We were about to cut it.

444
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
I was like, I it just was a shocking lack of confidence

445
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,600
from like the most successful sitcom ever.

446
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,880
Like from and from all these people, I just yeah, it's it's I wish.

447
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,080
I feel like now after this, how much everybody watches it on Disney Plus

448
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,760
and it's been mean so much and the Internet shows the love of all the esoteric stuff.

449
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,600
I'd like to hope that a second Simpsons movie, they have at least

450
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,240
have a little more confidence for like deeper references. Right. Yeah.

451
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,880
In in terms of life imitating art, though,

452
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,040
I saw this going around Twitter because of a news story.

453
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,040
There's that bit in the movie where it's Tom.

454
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,440
Tom Hanks walks on screen and he says

455
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,520
the the federal government, the US government has lost its credibility.

456
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
So it's borrowing some of mine.

457
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
And the Biden administration is putting out a commercial

458
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,480
about its first year accomplishments narrated by Tom Hanks.

459
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,600
So in the realm of Simpsons did it like that never that never stops being true, I guess.

460
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Now they they did it again. Yeah.

461
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,720
Yeah. By by by making up what would be

462
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,680
it's very silly thing to happen, that every just living in life

463
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,680
catches up to it over and over and over again. Yeah.

464
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,280
Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,200
Do we know did people end up enjoying the movie more than not?

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,920
Like I at least recall my first experience.

467
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,840
Maybe there was just something about big screen and they look elevated

468
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,800
and there's a there's a like kind of thicker score to it,

469
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,640
like more orchestra going on.

470
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,440
I like I can't say that I like rewatched the movie a ton of times,

471
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,040
but I I at least recall it being a successful first view to me.

472
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
It was fun.

473
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,120
It was fun for like it was fun to feel like Simpsons mania again.

474
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,200
The 7-elevens theme. Yeah.

475
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,920
There was a feeling in the air of like it's Simpsons.

476
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,080
Like remember when we all like that, I guess the early 90s

477
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,560
is when it was like truly like Simpsons mania.

478
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,680
So it did. It was a real fun.

479
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,840
It was like my first or second year in L.A.

480
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,480
There was a real fun feeling around of like, oh, we love the Simpsons again.

481
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,400
And yeah, and I also like to look, Scott, if you're getting at the Green Day

482
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,240
did the Simpsons theme and you were excited by that,

483
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,640
I felt that too. That was exciting as well.

484
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,920
I think I must have let now I'm going to be a churian candidate.

485
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
Well, Green Day dies.

486
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,800
His eyes went white. Green Day dies at the start of the movie.

487
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,360
So, you know, you have your cake and eat it.

488
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,400
Oh, that's a good way. Yeah, that's right.

489
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,680
I would. Yeah. Why did I love the movie so much?

490
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,320
Well, that is one of Scott's picks, one of the 10 greatest films ever made.

491
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,160
It was like this magical time.

492
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,120
Oh, seven or eight of like this new Simpsons mania, because like it was

493
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,680
it was the movie and the video game.

494
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,360
And then this ride was coming to and it was like all at once.

495
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Like on one of our podcasts, we had on a pal of your guys's.

496
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I believe Tim Calpac is who talked about working at Gracie then

497
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,960
and how it was just like the Simpsons factory was like every

498
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,880
blasting on every cylinder.

499
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,880
They're like, we are making eight things at once that are all giant projects.

500
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,040
It wasn't just one video game.

501
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,160
It was a game on every available platform.

502
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,400
So I think there were technically four, three or four different games. Right.

503
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Released. But with all writing by the staff, I mean, they were spread

504
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
so thin in that time period.

505
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
Yeah, that was it feels like that.

506
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,040
It feels like now because like nothing ever stops like this.

507
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Maybe we will get like in like 10 more years, then it'll be another

508
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,880
like Simpsons mania time.

509
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,360
Like there'll be a Disney Simpsons ride.

510
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,400
There'll be a new movie like little comes in.

511
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
It'll come in like 20 or waves, maybe.

512
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,160
I mean, I think I think Disney's got some real plans for the Simpsons.

513
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,120
But it's a very specific like I think they're waiting for

514
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,120
a lot of contracts to end and then they really assault us with the Simpsons.

515
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,720
Just they're pulling back and then boom, we're going to get hit with it.

516
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,520
Yeah, I can see a big new rollout when the new voice cast is announced.

517
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah, the next generation, the next group of people who will do it for 30 years.

518
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,880
There's a bit.

519
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh, Scott, can I tell the bit that you had an idea for seven years ago?

520
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
Is that? Yeah, yeah.

521
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,280
I don't even remember exactly. But yeah, Scott, you had a bit idea

522
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,280
to just like fake announce like a reboot of the Simpsons

523
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,240
that was happening with a new cast.

524
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,440
But concurrently with the old Simpsons is not going away.

525
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,960
It's just the Simpsons are back coming 2023.

526
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,280
The Simpsons. Right.

527
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,680
And I don't think they look different.

528
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't think they even say maybe it's new people doing it,

529
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,000
but they sound kind of sound alike.

530
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,280
So the first show that could be rebooted without doing anything

531
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
to affect the original.

532
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,200
So, yeah, I think that might be in Disney's plans at a certain point.

533
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,280
But, you know, we'll talk about future Simpsons

534
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,080
after we talk more about the ride and the land, I think, because, yeah,

535
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,560
as you're saying, contracts are running out.

536
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,520
Disney owns them.

537
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:02,320
And supposedly there's expansions coming eventually for at least Disneyland.

538
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,280
I don't know. Disney World a little slower.

539
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,520
If I can point something out.

540
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,920
So the Simpsons ride opened in 2008

541
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,440
pretty close to get like right around the same weeks in May of 2008.

542
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,280
At this point, the Simpsons ride

543
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,600
is almost has been open almost as long as the Back to the Future ride

544
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,880
was open when they closed it. Wow.

545
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,320
Like we're coming up. Really?

546
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,000
We're coming up on like, oh, they will have been open the same amount of time.

547
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,360
That's madness. Yeah. Right.

548
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,240
You're right. And she's again, well, the pandemic, like

549
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,160
makes timelines feel so bizarre.

550
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,000
OK, yeah. So I haven't I haven't been on this ride in forever.

551
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Kind of for that reason.

552
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,240
I mean, I've been to Universal, but like this is it's a bit claustrophobic.

553
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,600
And there it's not one of my top choices to go on there currently. Yeah.

554
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,800
But yes, so it was a handoff from Back to the Future.

555
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,080
That's probably a thing to talk about.

556
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,640
And how I remember the relief, I remember hearing

557
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,080
that Back to the Future was closing and being bummed out about that.

558
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,200
And there being two options when rumors on the table,

559
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,120
one being Simpsons and one being Fast and the Furious.

560
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,240
And me thinking, please let it be Simpsons,

561
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,160
because I don't and I don't know what like, you know,

562
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,720
I don't doubt that there's a good Fast and the Furious ride somewhere out there,

563
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,760
but they haven't built it yet.

564
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,000
So and I really don't think they would have done it in 2008

565
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,680
as a screen ride then.

566
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,240
So I was so relieved that if they were going to take away a ride

567
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,600
based on one of my favorite things, that they would replace it with a ride

568
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
based on one of my other favorite things.

569
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,440
What are the what are the odds of that?

570
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,120
Yeah, that that did help Back to the Future going away.

571
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,600
It eased the pain. Made it better.

572
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah. How many times have we heard like something's going away

573
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,440
and being replaced by something that doesn't sound so exciting?

574
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,600
Yeah. Or by nothing at all.

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,680
Or I don't remember.

576
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,040
In 2008, Fast and the Furious was in a very transitional time period.

577
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,600
Now it's like the second biggest thing in the world.

578
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,840
Now it is the Simpsons. Yeah.

579
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,040
I think I think oddly like now they could.

580
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,160
If maybe Epic Universe or something,

581
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,160
like if they could build a ride that is cars.

582
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,520
Yeah. Not whatever this dumb party bus

583
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,400
diesel helicopter thing.

584
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,560
Tiny Vin on giant helicopter.

585
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,680
Yeah, because Fast and the Furious now they've done heists.

586
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
They've been spies.

587
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
They've been the Avengers with cars.

588
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
They've worked for S.H.I.E.L.D.

589
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,080
basically like they can just do anything like, hey, John Cena's here now.

590
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,120
Hell, Miran's here now.

591
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,360
Whatever you want. They're here.

592
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,320
The flying car at the end of the last movie in space,

593
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,160
like that would work perfectly in the mechanics of the back to the future ride.

594
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,680
If we're just if it's just another reskin, like that would work great.

595
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,640
And so, yeah, maybe that's what the when the contract runs out.

596
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Maybe it is the flying Fast and Furious car.

597
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm sorry. I don't keep up with there's a flying car in space in these movies.

598
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,480
I didn't see this. Yep.

599
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah, they go into space in the last one, which honestly,

600
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,280
it felt like they were pressured like it was a meme.

601
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
That's like they're going to go into space someday.

602
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,160
And so in the end of this one, it feels like they had to go like, fine,

603
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,840
we'll launch a car into space, but we're not happy about it.

604
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,120
It's a joke. It's not the actual like end of the movie or whatever.

605
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,320
Yeah. OK.

606
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,440
I mean, in the previous one, like cars had raced a submarine in the Arctic,

607
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,920
I think, if I'm recalling correctly.

608
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,720
I believe also recognized as one of the weaker of the installments.

609
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,520
But going back to back to the future,

610
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,600
I think it's interesting that in terms of IP back to the future

611
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,840
and the Simpsons are polar opposites where back to the future

612
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,800
is not being rebooted.

613
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,520
Zemeckis and Gale said it ends here.

614
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,280
There's going to be a cartoon series and a ride and that's it.

615
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,440
And then like 15 years later, there's a video game.

616
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,400
But the Simpsons, even though voice actors are dying, it will not end.

617
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Like it will be continuing past our lifetimes.

618
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,600
These characters will persist.

619
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,000
But in terms of back to the future, maybe when Zemeckis and Gale pass away,

620
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,040
there will be a new movie in the 2030s or whatever.

621
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,400
But they were able to keep a lid on it.

622
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,240
Right. I have a theory, which is when Zemeckis passes away, Gale.

623
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,320
I don't know. I'm looking at you, Gale.

624
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,600
He's the one who would dive in on whatever Gale's Gale's around.

625
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,720
He's down. There's already the they have that musical that's already happening.

626
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,520
Musical. Yeah. Yeah.

627
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,240
There's issues and issues of a comic book series, some of which written by Bob Gale.

628
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,960
And then I tell tell game the story game.

629
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,880
Yeah, I it made me so sad at first that the Simpsons had to kill back to the future.

630
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,400
Like that's how it felt to me at first is because I so I grew up in Florida

631
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,320
and I I was a kid who was not that excited to go to Disney World.

632
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,400
I really wanted to ride the movies, though.

633
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,600
And I think it's because I watch Nickelodeon all of the time and it advertised it so well to me.

634
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,440
And when I could finally convince my parents to take me in like 93 or four

635
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,720
Universal, like back to the future was my favorite ride.

636
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,840
And I just loved it so, so much.

637
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,000
And to know that it was going away and replaced by the Simpsons.

638
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,600
And then like that was why I was so disappointed when it first showed up

639
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,880
and why I didn't want to ride it until like a few years after it debuted,

640
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,960
because I just saw like, oh, they painted over the Institute of Future Technology

641
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,760
and they put a bunch of carnival games out front.

642
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,560
That does not say Simpsons to me so much.

643
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,520
So then once they built up the Springfield around it, that's when I was like,

644
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,560
OK, this was worth killing back to the future for.

645
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,280
Yeah, it's interesting because then you get your locate,

646
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,960
you get your Krusty Burger and your Mo's and your Quickie Mart.

647
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,320
Now, like Springfield is in a theme park as opposed to what is clearly

648
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,120
like a World's Fair Expo kind of building with glass bricks and stuff.

649
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,760
They put a plastic Krusty in front of it and it didn't feel like fully formed.

650
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah, I mean, that's yeah, obviously made it feel like a full land,

651
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,800
not not as big as some like adventure land or frontier land or something in Disney,

652
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,280
but like a land where you were actually feeling more immersed.

653
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,320
But I also say like the ride itself,

654
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,200
they they definitely want the extra mile to even make that feel like a new,

655
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
fresh part of the universe.

656
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,080
And they and they went, of course, in the pre show, they hand off.

657
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,720
There's this narrative reason for why the back to the future ride has changed

658
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,640
because they have Christopher Lloyd, B.

659
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,000
Doc Brown and basically what he signs the deed over for the Institute of Future

660
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,160
Technology. And he's about to he's like, oh, yes, yes.

661
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,480
Forcibly, I

662
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,720
Frank sees what happens.

663
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,800
Professor Frank is going to visit his friend, Doc Brown.

664
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,680
What have they done? Why is this Krusty land now?

665
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,880
He gets in a DeLorean to stop it from happening and ends up at the exact moment

666
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,520
that Doc Brown signing something that will protect the Institute.

667
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,240
The lawyer who is oddly named Mr.

668
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,640
Friedman, I don't know the significance of that.

669
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,720
Thank you, Mr. Friedman.

670
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,200
And he gets hit by the DeLorean that appears out of thin air,

671
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,680
thus damning the Institute to turn into Krusty land.

672
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,040
But Krusty shows up and Doc is immediately kind of a supplicant

673
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,440
to like immediately kissing up to him and calling him his boss.

674
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,000
So Doc accepts it really quickly.

675
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,680
Yeah, it's I think one of the strengths of this ride and

676
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,400
it is a ride that stands alone and functions like well as a ride,

677
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,640
but also commenting on a lot of theme park tropes and like

678
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,040
features and stuff in a way that's more cutting than when like Disney

679
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,120
kind of pokes fun at itself, you know?

680
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,760
Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, they go.

681
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,200
And when I was about to say something really dumb, they go hard

682
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
making fun of Disney.

683
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,720
And it's like, that's funny.

684
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,160
Where's his back?

685
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,960
Yeah, that's not really that was the way I was about to say something

686
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
like really stupid sounding.

687
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But no, they they go harder, I suppose, if you're if everything's relative.

688
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah. And I and you have to think that has to do with in general that

689
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,640
the Universal team seems to have figured out the ride mechanics

690
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,400
and the fun, you know, like trickery of it.

691
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,120
Like clearly they brought to the table while a ride can do this.

692
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,240
And this and this.

693
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,720
But the writers ultimately were responsible for it,

694
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,680
including Matt Warburton, who we got to talk to.

695
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,800
He told us great stories.

696
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,840
Yeah, that was great. So from about a year ago.

697
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,320
Yeah, yeah, I that was that was nice because we I think we were pretty sure

698
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,960
he was heavily involved in it.

699
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,120
And then while we're talking to him, oh, clearly he like maybe like

700
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,240
uncredited a little bit super oversaw it.

701
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,000
And seemingly the premise came from him is what he was implying.

702
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,160
Like the at least the notion that you are on a ride

703
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,320
that is that has been hijacked and is falling apart while you're writing it.

704
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,720
Well, you got to give him a lot of credit for that, because that's a lot of fun.

705
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,440
Yeah, it really does have like the Simpsons touch of the Simpsons

706
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,000
satirizes blank kind of thing in this.

707
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,480
And even though the show has already by the time the ride happened,

708
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,360
they've done so many great jokes about like specifically Disneyland,

709
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,880
just mocking Disneyland.

710
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,960
Even with all that, they still like they can make fun of

711
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,760
they make fun of the kiddie ride and they make it the happy little elves,

712
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,000
which I love that it was like they could have used any like dumb kiddie ride,

713
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,520
but they used like a season one thing of the happy little elves

714
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
and brought them back.

715
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,760
And then they get to make fun of like pirates of the Caribbean, too.

716
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,280
Like it's all I and I think it also helps that like they're in Universal.

717
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,200
So I would think Universal bigwigs are like, oh, you want to make fun of Disney?

718
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
Yeah, let's go over. Go right out.

719
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,880
We're not. Yeah, yeah.

720
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,040
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

721
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,760
Universal. Oh, it kind of like very early on was like, well, we're the old

722
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,920
for the older audience that were little body or a great line.

723
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,040
They definitely said the word body for sure.

724
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,720
For sure. So many, many times because people do say body.

725
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,520
Everyone says everyone. Yeah, that word. It's a common word.

726
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,640
But I mean, there there are some very like good

727
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,560
jokes about like

728
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,160
at the very like start of the ride itself.

729
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,960
Like Lisa says, I'm scared and Homer says, sweetie, they won't kill you

730
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,440
in an amusement park as long as you have a dime left in your pocket.

731
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
That's pretty good.

732
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Like pretty dark, pretty dark.

733
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,040
And they're right.

734
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,360
Also, like anyone every now and then someone asks, like, will I be like

735
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,120
if I go to Disney alone, will I get on a list or will I be tracked?

736
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,840
And I'm like, no, as long as you have it, that is the answer.

737
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,960
As long as you have a dime in your pocket, you're fine.

738
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Yeah. Well, you know, it's Jason, you're just saying that to yourself

739
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,040
to relieve the feeling of being alone in the park.

740
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh, I don't care. No, I have never cared.

741
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm a wild man.

742
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,120
There's there's so many great jokes in it about like, yeah, I mean,

743
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,880
jokes about Dale Churros.

744
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,200
They have squeaky voice.

745
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,840
Team does a joke about not being allowed to have facial hair is like an old

746
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,320
Disneyland like employee rule.

747
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
Like there's there's some.

748
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
That's pretty deep. Yeah.

749
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,360
It's fun. It's fun to be walking through a satire of a bad place.

750
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,000
But they still have to, you know, get you to have fun and spend money.

751
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,280
So you can eat a Krusty burger.

752
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,280
But based on the show, Krusty burger is disgusting.

753
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
Krusty won't even eat any of his own food.

754
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,080
You don't want chicken that's handled by Cletus, but you're going to spend

755
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,200
$14 on chicken fingers there.

756
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,800
Yeah. Oh, and Mo's is disgusting. Yeah.

757
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,240
It seems like real bad news.

758
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,160
So it's funny that now they just have people earnestly lining up for Mo's.

759
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,600
And while you're sitting there eating the Mo's food, you're surrounded by TV

760
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
showing you clips about like gross food jokes they did on the show.

761
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,680
Yes, that's I mean, the line, the queue and everything like the clips

762
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,120
and then the new clips really like I think the first time I went on it,

763
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,960
I would have been happy just going through the line and watching the highlight reel.

764
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,000
We're just like, yeah, that's a pleasure.

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
This one's good.

766
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,600
Like this is this is what I was like in the line for the first couple of years.

767
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,760
I was like, oh, yeah, remember this one? This is funny, isn't it?

768
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,960
It was pretty frinky.

769
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,520
I couldn't just dial them up whenever you wanted on your phone.

770
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,120
Right. Yes.

771
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,240
No, I know Scott is a line hater, but I love that the hang on.

772
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,840
That's not exactly right.

773
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,960
I guess there's some nuance to that.

774
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,360
But but it's one of my favorite line experiences being in that line,

775
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,400
because, you know, it's it's so simple that it's just like, yeah,

776
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,680
look at every reference all over here and and just watch clips of Simpsons

777
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,480
with other people.

778
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,560
But I do feel a kind of connection of if I see the other people,

779
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,720
there's the people in the line who are just like just still looking at their phones.

780
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,520
But if I see another person looking up who cannot resist looking at the screen,

781
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm like, yeah, that's you're my friend.

782
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,560
We're going to laugh at this Captain McAllister joke together.

783
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,200
I have had a similar feeling of like a lot of these people

784
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,600
aren't even watching the screen. What's wrong with them?

785
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,440
This is the situation in Scratchyland.

786
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,480
This is I mean, you got to love that about it, that it's especially for us,

787
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,360
for all of us, I think that they have curated not just a bunch of great

788
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,320
Simpsons clips, but Simpsons material about theme parks,

789
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,040
which they like, you know, so much of not just the great Itchy

790
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,800
and Scratchyland episode, which I think they show most of.

791
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,360
But there's Duff Gardens and Mount Splashmore.

792
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,840
Like in those early years, there was so much theme park and theme park

793
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,520
adjacent stuff.

794
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
So seeing it all collected and mixed with new stuff, it's really funny.

795
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,960
It's just such a strong block of material. Yeah.

796
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,400
I was one of the things I think Imagineers have talked about a lot.

797
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,160
And I'm sure we've talked.

798
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,120
Yeah, we've talked about it a lot is like, you know, there's budget

799
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,800
concerns for things, people in the blue sky phases when everybody has these grand

800
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,080
plans for things.

801
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,400
And often I think Tony Baxter was saying like the audience never knows

802
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,120
like what we wanted to do.

803
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,040
They only see what we have, like what they're actually experiencing.

804
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,680
I would I feel like the Simpsons might be the only thing or the only ride

805
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,280
experience that you can see because they have it on a map.

806
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,120
What they would do with the money,

807
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,480
like they've crammed actually more ideas and shown you like, hey,

808
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,280
if we had the money, we would have tried to make this a whole park.

809
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,960
Like you don't see that in Star Wars.

810
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,240
There's not like maps of the banter ride that we didn't get.

811
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,680
Like, you know, like I don't I can't think of another example of like,

812
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,960
oh, man, can you imagine if they had like the room to do this Crustyland map?

813
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,640
Like I like that even helps, I think.

814
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,320
And I think probably you don't want people like disappointed.

815
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,520
But that does actually help my experience to make me feel like,

816
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,560
oh, man, Crustyland, that would be cool.

817
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,240
I guess I'm in Crustyland.

818
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,480
This is a bigger universe I'm in.

819
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,200
And then you get to explore the whole giant ambitious idea in the ride itself.

820
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,320
Now, I I've had the thought in the line they have one of the one of the new jokes

821
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,200
that they animated for it is it's Cletus and all of his kids.

822
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,520
And he's giving you tips on how to sneak food into the park

823
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,200
and eat the meat it there.

824
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,040
I was like, I no way, even if they're like most risque,

825
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,640
would Disney allow a joke about like, hey, let's have a tell people

826
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,960
how to steal sneak food in here and not pay for food.

827
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,880
You know? Yeah.

828
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,800
I think that Disney policy, they still have.

829
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,320
I don't I feel like that's a let correct me if I'm wrong.

830
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,320
So I feel like you can bring food in, but it's not heavily ever.

831
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,960
It's not recommended.

832
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,920
Yeah, I think if you're bringing coolers worth of food,

833
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,680
there's that picnic area outside the entrance of the park

834
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,440
where they'd really prefer you.

835
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,920
But if you can fit stuff in a backpack, but but yeah, yeah.

836
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,080
So you're not bringing in a knife to spread the cheese with.

837
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,440
I think, OK, to Henry's point, though, it's not like there's a

838
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,400
Disney commercial and Mickey at the end is like, make sure to bring a sandwich.

839
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,360
So you can save some money.

840
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, yeah, that's never even they can't even suggest that.

841
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,680
It's just like if you read the fine print, it's like,

842
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,240
oh, we could actually bring a meal in, huh? OK.

843
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,440
No, they're certainly not thinking about that.

844
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,600
I mean, I just saw a story that like

845
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,840
Iger and Chaypec salaries almost doubled last year as like at the start of this year,

846
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,320
like all food went up 50 cents to a dollar in Florida.

847
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,960
And it's like, oh, man, you guys aren't even trying to hide this shit anymore.

848
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,200
Like mask off down at Disneyland or Disney World.

849
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,080
Well, that's it's always literally mask off.

850
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,400
You do not wear a mask at Disney World. That's the world.

851
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,880
OK, I think that with with stuff like this, with kind of undercutting

852
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,720
what theme parks are in general and these specific digs at a lot.

853
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,320
I mean, largely Disney, but there's little universal digs to self digs.

854
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,560
I think that this ride doesn't come out the same way under Disney.

855
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,520
And it kind of scares me to think that this could be.

856
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,480
I mean, if this goes, whatever, we've all had a chance to do it.

857
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,040
I like it, but I've done it.

858
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,600
But were there to be Simpson's stuff in the Disney parks?

859
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,720
I don't know. I think they're not quite because you can already like,

860
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,920
let's be honest here, these Disney plus shorts are.

861
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,360
Yeah, I mean, right.

862
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,160
Like, I'm a little scared about this combo in general.

863
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,360
I think a Disney,

864
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,880
Simpsons ride in a Disney park would be the Simpsons advertising Disney properties,

865
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,480
which is basically why they bought these characters.

866
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,240
I think they're just promotional tools for new programs and movies.

867
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,840
The teeth are a little, you know, the teeth get removed a bit more.

868
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,640
And Homer is like, I mean, they'll make jokes about, hey,

869
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,840
we have to suck up to Mickey Mouse.

870
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,400
But actually, we're literally sucking up to Mickey Mouse right now.

871
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,240
As you're watching it, what if Hans Mollmann was one of the seven dwarves?

872
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,480
Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,200
Easier stuff. I mean, yeah, we all saw Plusiversary.

874
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,040
We know we know what it's going to be like.

875
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,160
Yeah, I couldn't bring myself to watch.

876
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,400
I saw like three frames of it and just like that.

877
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,360
I think that tells me what I need to know.

878
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,920
OK, I think they are.

879
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,640
The Simpsons are like now brand ambassadors, essentially.

880
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,800
So, yeah, yeah, they wave there.

881
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,760
I mean, that's that is a funny thing about like for a show that is really subversive

882
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,600
and that probably took all of our young minds

883
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,840
in into places that were more like liberal and progressive and free thinking.

884
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,080
I think, you know, because it has ideas in it that affect

885
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,880
at least in the 90s.

886
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,920
It is funny that it's now it's just as with like the unironic food locations.

887
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,480
It's funny that like come visit the Simpsons, give the Simpsons a hug.

888
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,920
And like and you see them on the banner when you're leaving the park.

889
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,880
And like nothing else in the banners

890
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,040
as you're leaving Universal is subversive in the least.

891
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,760
I don't think Optimus Prime and the Minions like there's nothing else

892
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,320
that is a show that has like really cutting and weird stuff.

893
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Yeah, it's like I'm trying to think like the clothes,

894
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,280
like if there were characters even in the park now, I guess Chewbacca

895
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,640
I saw refuse a hug and a picture with somebody in Star Wars land,

896
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,000
which thrilled me to death because that's so much fun.

897
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,760
But I do think I've seen like the villains

898
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,560
like at Disneyland have a little more sass to them.

899
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,400
That's true.

900
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,880
Yeah, they can.

901
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
They can be like Loki can be like get away from me, Kovner,

902
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,440
or whatever, some bullshit like that.

903
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,880
But like they but they can't.

904
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,880
But like the Loki can talk like the homer you meet can't talk.

905
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,960
He's just going to wave at you.

906
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,680
But like, no, I mean, there's like there's so there's good,

907
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,640
mean stuff in the ride or in the the waiting line

908
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,680
that I just could not imagine Disney with.

909
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,520
I mean, also with Disney, I keep waiting for the day.

910
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,360
It hasn't happened yet.

911
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,320
It was the first thing I looked up on Disney Plus.

912
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm like, OK, is the joke that Roger Meyers

913
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,360
Sr. made a film called Nazi Superman or our superiors?

914
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,960
Is that joke still in here?

915
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,720
And it still is. They haven't cut it yet.

916
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,240
But I'm waiting for that day. Me too.

917
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,280
Yeah, I it's it.

918
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,640
Yeah, I think most things are still up, but it does feel like there's

919
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,480
from what's the what's the one they censored in Disney Plus?

920
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,840
Is it who's Michael Jackson episode?

921
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,520
So that one. But I'm talking about

922
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,800
the nice was a splash or something they censored.

923
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,360
Oh, the bottom. Yes.

924
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,000
The bottom and splash is all smeary.

925
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,160
And I think they censored Adventures in Babysitting as well.

926
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,600
They took out an F word in that movie. OK.

927
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,680
Yeah, like I feel like even the like towards the end of the ride

928
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,000
when Kang and Koda show up and say foolish earthlings, don't you know,

929
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,120
all rides must end near the gift shop. That's too far.

930
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,880
That's true. We cannot have that in the same way.

931
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,560
Like if Disney started producing more of the like being more hands

932
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,720
on with the episodes, it's like, OK, Homer has to be shown to be a good father,

933
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,600
not at the 20 minute mark, but at the six minute mark.

934
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,520
You know, yes, it's the only thing.

935
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,920
Oh, sorry. Oh, no, I was just going to say like Boba Fett is the spoiler.

936
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,640
Lerp Boba Fett's a really good guy, by the way. Now.

937
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,080
So I just so yeah, I could see you're rude for it.

938
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,160
Yeah, you're rude for them.

939
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,080
And I think, yeah, Homer, they may have to retcon all the times.

940
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,840
Homer's been an awful husband and an awful father.

941
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,240
I'm so. Perpetual child abuser.

942
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,080
Yeah, so comic effect for many years.

943
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,280
So fucking mad about Boba Fett.

944
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,720
I cannot. I am not.

945
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,560
I'm not one of those Star Wars fans.

946
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,200
I don't even care about like the bounty hunters, but Boba Fett

947
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,640
just constantly going like, hey, we can all be friends, can't we?

948
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,040
Let's all get along. I was like, oh, I found out you don't have to watch it.

949
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,440
Someone told me.

950
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,560
I said.

951
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,960
I feel like that's an applicable quote for so much stuff.

952
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,680
I haven't heard anyone talking besides an occasional complaint.

953
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,520
And so like I, I am never up on TV.

954
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,560
Like I am halfway through both Midnight Mass and White Lotus.

955
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,960
And that's like five or six discourse cycles ago.

956
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,040
So, yeah, I don't know what's going on with Boba Fett.

957
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,160
I know there was like greasers

958
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,680
or there was like American graffiti s youths.

959
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,520
I don't know. Yeah, people were upset about that, but I'll say this.

960
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,880
They fit right in with like a Dexter Jets, there's a static for that space

961
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,920
diner, so I can't be upset about like, yeah, that was pretty plainly wrong.

962
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,840
That was very frequently that thing.

963
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,320
Very frequently. So, yeah, I can't be mad at that.

964
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,040
I'm fine with those guys.

965
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,720
And plus, they got Stu the Meat Man from Strangers of Candy is a major character.

966
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,280
Oh, yes. Pesquase is in the show.

967
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Yeah, there's great.

968
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,680
Yeah, I'm just I'm just commenting on the idea that like, yes, Disney,

969
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,600
it seems to really want to make sure everybody's a good guy.

970
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,040
And explain why he's got like baggy black fabric

971
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,080
instead of baggy baby blue fabric is that explained at some point?

972
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,880
Yeah, Boba Fett.

973
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,560
Mm hmm. That's a good question.

974
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,160
I don't know. Well, so of course, after he was fished out of the

975
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,800
every escaping the Sarlacc pit, he's taken by the Jawas

976
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,000
who steal his armor from him.

977
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,560
And then he is adopted by the Tuscan Raider group,

978
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,640
who then retrains him over a period of months, if not years.

979
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,320
They get kind of fuzzy, the timeline.

980
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,480
And then he takes on the black cloak of the Tuscan Raider.

981
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,920
So perhaps that's why he changed his undergarments.

982
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,520
So kind of like working with what you got. All right.

983
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,360
It's possible the Sarlacc, the juices in the Sarlacc stomach

984
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,960
like made that material like degraded that because he was in there for so long.

985
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,040
Like the armor itself held up because it was strong enough.

986
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,320
So we had to get a different.

987
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,600
Descar doesn't melt. Yeah. Right.

988
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,360
So anyway, is that does anybody want to talk more about this?

989
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,160
I did read a

990
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,040
short interview with the guy who originally designed the outfit.

991
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,600
And his vibe was like, yeah, we just kind of had to make it look cool and alien.

992
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,480
Didn't have a lot of money. Did what we could.

993
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,080
That's what so much stuff is.

994
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,320
Some guy made it within theme parks and and Star Wars and everything.

995
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,320
I don't know. We did it. We banged it together.

996
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,120
Yeah. All you nerds are think there was meaning behind every little button.

997
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,720
I want to go back to Krustyland, just the title Krustyland,

998
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,920
because that location did not exist in the show before it existed in Universal,

999
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,800
because we had a mention of Euro Krustyland, which exploded.

1000
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,880
We had Duff Gardens and itchy and scratchy land.

1001
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,800
So in the arcade game, there was a Krustyland that is level two.

1002
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,160
But in the show, it did not exist until after this theme park attraction happened.

1003
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,720
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,800
And I think it's funny that they with the invention of this, like there's,

1005
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,160
you know, you have major theme parks in the world already with itchy and scratchy

1006
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,120
land. And now to so now to add Krustyland on top of it.

1007
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,120
And like, I'm not sure where itchy and scratchy land is.

1008
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,280
I guess that's far away.

1009
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,920
But other but Krustyland's next to Springfield or in Springfield.

1010
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,520
And I was like, what are the other?

1011
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,120
OK, we got to gardens. We got Krustyland.

1012
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,920
These are all parks that I believe are in Springfield.

1013
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,280
I don't think they're even adjacent.

1014
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,160
All throughout the history of the show,

1015
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,840
there's something called Blocko land, but also there's Lego land in this world.

1016
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,080
So both of them land and Lego land.

1017
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,840
There's a little park where Lisa decides to become a vegetarian

1018
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,080
called Storyland Village.

1019
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,680
There's a Santa's Village.

1020
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,480
Storyland Village turns into Praise Land.

1021
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
Ned Flanders religious theme park.

1022
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,480
There is a park called Disneyland that is not affiliated with Disneyland.

1023
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,040
That's separate from all of these.

1024
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,320
There's the water park, Mount Splashmore, a different water park called

1025
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,680
Chlorine Dreams, indoor water park.

1026
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,520
There's the discount Lion Safari, a whole other theme park called Plaster Mountain.

1027
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,200
And that's pretty good, right?

1028
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,360
Yeah, I get with our big rocks.

1029
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,760
There's something called Wet and Wacky World.

1030
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,040
There's an abandoned park called Six Flags Over Krusty.

1031
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,840
In the future, there is something called Cretaceous Park.

1032
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,840
That's in a future episode that I think is like Jurassic Park.

1033
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,920
And then there is I think this world includes both Epcot,

1034
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,000
the real Epcot and F-Cot.

1035
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,200
And I don't know what the F stands for.

1036
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,000
So these are all theme parks servicing the Springfield area.

1037
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,880
The most theme park rich city in the history of man.

1038
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,360
Boy, I wish I could live in Springfield.

1039
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,200
No, I think that you can tell the writers love theme parks so much

1040
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,160
and get so much like energy out of it.

1041
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,680
Like we also like Jeff Martin.

1042
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,200
This was something that we in one of our interviews, we chat with him.

1043
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,160
He's like in season two guy.

1044
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,960
And he he wrote the the Duff the

1045
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,960
the Small World parody song.

1046
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,800
And he mentioned us.

1047
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,080
He had also written another song for that same episode in season four

1048
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,160
that was going to be parodying of Pirates of the Caribbean.

1049
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,360
And it was about how on PC the whole ride was.

1050
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,200
But he he they apparently the song had the word rape in it

1051
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,600
about how they rape in pillage.

1052
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,640
And they're like, you know what?

1053
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,120
No, not using that song.

1054
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,280
They decided back back in 1993.

1055
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,000
Wow. Fascinating.

1056
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,760
And kind of before the PC uproar a little bit.

1057
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,280
So he was like calling out the oddity of it.

1058
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,160
Well, that's fascinating.

1059
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,480
Wow. So they were trying to go even deeper because that episode as a time

1060
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,560
even before it changed scratchy land, they hit its small world jokes

1061
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,720
and Hall of Presidents jokes and Main Street Electrical Parade jokes.

1062
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,800
Yeah, those are casual theme park going jokes.

1063
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,760
Those are people that know what they're talking about.

1064
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,080
One. What was it?

1065
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,080
I always forget the episode, but Al Jean, like, said he wrote it

1066
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,280
like season 11 or 10 episode while waiting in a line at Disney.

1067
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,560
It was a mom and pop art was written in line at Disneyland, right?

1068
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,040
Probably in several lines.

1069
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,280
Wow. Wow. And not about theme parks.

1070
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,000
Huh? Huh. Strange. Interesting.

1071
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,320
Hey, we've all tried to do a little work at the theme park.

1072
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,120
You know, we've all tried to write some scripts at the theme park.

1073
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,240
Escape. Clear your mind.

1074
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,040
To that end, in terms of obscure jokes and boy,

1075
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,120
what I love to I mean, hopefully we get to talk to him again.

1076
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,240
I'd love to know, like just to throw out things to Matt Warburton.

1077
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,480
And like, was this one of yours?

1078
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,400
Because I feel like the more specific it is, that seems likely.

1079
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,040
And this one is so this isn't even a Disney thing.

1080
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,520
This is like the just theme parks in general, especially like middle America.

1081
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,240
This joke in the line, the crusty says, for those of you who like the latest music,

1082
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,240
we've got the 1950s do up review

1083
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,360
of the original Platters.

1084
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,400
Starring distant cousins of the original Platters.

1085
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,120
That is so boy, that's everything.

1086
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,320
There's that kind of thing in Hershey Park,

1087
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,520
Kenny Wood and Dolly.

1088
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,880
Like, there's so much 50s in theme parks.

1089
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,560
Boy, is that right on. That is such a deep cut.

1090
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,800
Yeah, I really like the joke about a crusty

1091
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,640
wearing sports jacket made out of Lincoln's diary.

1092
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,520
Yeah, it's a good one.

1093
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1094
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,480
I mean, I also like that when crusty even tells you like,

1095
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,160
hey, you made it here, like when you get into the last room

1096
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,440
before you get to get on the ride, then crusty says,

1097
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,960
hey, you made it here.

1098
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,280
Only 45 minutes left in the line.

1099
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,520
I'm just kidding.

1100
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,680
I have no idea how much longer you're going to be in this line.

1101
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,200
Yeah, there's about an episode's worth of original animation in the line.

1102
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,880
And when you get to the safety video, I mean, a lot of the stuff is kind of risque

1103
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,280
for just a general line audience watching TVs.

1104
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,800
But I thought the itchy and scratchy stuff was genuinely shockingly violent.

1105
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,480
I mean, his skin is torn off in that safety video.

1106
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Like Echo is one of the most

1107
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,240
horrific shorts when his skin is torn off by the escalator.

1108
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,000
There's not as much blood, but still, I was surprised to see that.

1109
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,120
Yeah, it's a very good point that there is no I don't know

1110
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,640
if there's any other safety video in the history of theme parks

1111
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,240
that shows you what might happen to you in a deadly way when you go on the ride.

1112
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,400
That is totally crazy.

1113
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,680
A hand coming clean off like they do depict things that could

1114
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,600
and in some cases have happened.

1115
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,800
Yeah, not on this ride, but in other rides.

1116
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,160
Right. No, no, no.

1117
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,240
And if you keep following the sequence of videos,

1118
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,240
Sideshow Bob points a hand like a full ass handgun

1119
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,080
at the Simpsons for like a while.

1120
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,600
Yeah, I couldn't believe it was a realistic gun and not like a joke gun,

1121
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,640
like a harpoon or gun or something, you know, something that

1122
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,400
is not an imitatable act.

1123
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,880
But it's like, no, it sounds like a nine millimeter just right.

1124
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,840
It said that he tried to kill a baby.

1125
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,160
They point that out like and the baby, even the baby.

1126
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,400
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,840
This is all stuff that maybe Universal maybe would have pulled a little back on

1128
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,920
like right now. I wonder if it like if it would be the exact

1129
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,160
they would let all the same stuff happen today.

1130
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,680
Well, anything happens at horror nights.

1131
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,200
Well, that's a different thing.

1132
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,160
Oh, you know, that's another of my favorite modern Simpsons episodes.

1133
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,640
And I think now it's like eight years old.

1134
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,920
But there's an episode called Halloween of Horror

1135
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,040
that is the first time they did a regular Halloween episode

1136
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,480
that is not a treehouse.

1137
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,720
And it's about they take Bart and Lisa to the a Halloween

1138
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,120
Horror Nights type thing.

1139
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,400
Lisa says she's not scared.

1140
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,680
But the second she gets there, she freaks out and has a panic attack

1141
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,320
because it's so scary.

1142
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,480
And they have to like help her get over that the whole rest of the episode.

1143
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,560
And as a teen, as a youngster who was terrified of Halloween Horror Nights

1144
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,760
and still hasn't gone because it still I feel like that root fear.

1145
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,560
I love that episode.

1146
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,600
Like that's that's like my favorite modern Simpsons episode.

1147
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,880
Oh, wow. I got to watch that one.

1148
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,720
Yeah, I forget that we have this in common that you have the

1149
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,480
afraid of stuff.

1150
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,000
As you reminded us at the beginning of the episode,

1151
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,560
it extends to roller coasters and stuff to what's your level, Henry?

1152
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,800
I have gotten better at it.

1153
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,560
And I really like so like five years ago when I first rode

1154
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,880
the Guardians of the Galaxy ride, which I only did because I'm a Marvel fan.

1155
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,760
It scared me. But I was like, I have to ride this.

1156
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,360
So that one really screwed me up.

1157
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,640
But then I did the Incredicoaster like two years ago or three years ago.

1158
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,120
And it kind of reset me.

1159
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,880
And I actually can take a hard ride now.

1160
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,840
I had a similar journey.

1161
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
The Incredicoaster is my max.

1162
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,640
And I was afraid to do it, but someone pressured me into it.

1163
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,480
And I had fun.

1164
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,360
I will say the Guardians of the Galaxy ride makes me think I'm going to die.

1165
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,360
Not as fun as the Incredicoaster.

1166
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,320
But unlike Mike, I can't take the journey to overcome my fear of haunts.

1167
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,520
I just can't go with you on that.

1168
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,760
But I respect you for overcoming that.

1169
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,040
It's something that I can never do. Thank you.

1170
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,840
I appreciate that. I will say, though, I mean, I'm not pressuring you

1171
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,160
to do anything, but I will say if you ever do, I would say horror nights

1172
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,000
is the easiest one to do because they're really just like

1173
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,840
you're motoring through those things so fast.

1174
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,360
That if you ever feel the inclination to try something

1175
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,440
and a lot of a lot of haunted house fans, I think don't like it for this reason.

1176
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,960
But you're in like just a steady stream of people.

1177
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,560
And that is not as scary as like getting thrown in a room

1178
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,280
or just somebody telling you that there's a Minotaur waiting for you

1179
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,240
in an escape room.

1180
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,680
Like that's a lot different than just like walking by

1181
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,800
and seeing a bunch of other people get like a fairly obvious

1182
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,640
scare that's about to happen. So in the horror nights.

1183
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,720
Also has a polish, like a level of polish

1184
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,160
that independent haunts or haunted hayrides or even knots.

1185
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,160
I feel like try to one up themselves a lot or just go

1186
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,320
give the scare actors a little more freedom.

1187
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,600
There's more freedom. Yeah.

1188
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,200
Universal kind of pulls back a little.

1189
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,360
And after a couple horror nights, houses, you will actually get the rhythm

1190
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,760
of how it works.

1191
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,800
Other like knots and other things are done different.

1192
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,480
Like houses are different knots, but kind of with the horror nights,

1193
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,400
you're like, oh, OK, I see there's a I can see in the blackness.

1194
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,280
There's a person about to jump out.

1195
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,680
Like you can see you can kind of feel at a certain point.

1196
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,640
But that's look, I'm just saying in the future, I'm not saying you have to go

1197
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,960
do it. But yeah, that's that would be my recommendation starting there.

1198
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,560
I have another like childhood

1199
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,400
parks thing that like is about how much I don't like roller coasters

1200
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,720
or didn't as a kid like I.

1201
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,680
So I grew up in Florida and a couple of years like the like fifth grade

1202
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,080
or sixth grade class trip was like, we'll take you to theme park.

1203
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,280
And so because I live like Jacksonville, Florida,

1204
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,480
like three hours from from Orlando.

1205
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:22,120
And so one year we went to Epcot and I hated it because I was like,

1206
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,600
I've never been to Magic Kingdom and you're taking me to Epcot.

1207
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,320
Like I I wasn't ready to appreciate Epcot.

1208
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,400
I thought it was the boring like learn something place.

1209
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,480
And then the next year we were finally going to go to Magic Kingdom.

1210
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,640
But then some do good or Baptist

1211
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,520
asshole at the school, like their parent learned

1212
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,280
that on the day we had planned was the unofficial gay day

1213
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,880
at Magic Kingdom, where the gays show up in their red shirts.

1214
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,960
And, you know, and now Disney is super embraced it.

1215
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,520
But back then it was, you know, just this thing like parents were like,

1216
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,280
did you hear us? OK, we're going to I'm not sending my kid there.

1217
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,440
That day. And so we had to go to Busch Gardens, which for a person

1218
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,240
who likes theming and doesn't like roller coasters was I hated it so much.

1219
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,960
Could not stand Busch Gardens.

1220
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,760
So, yeah, that's a rumor.

1221
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,800
So then how would you fill the day?

1222
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,080
Were you trying to hide in?

1223
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,600
I told my friends like, I'll write it later.

1224
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,760
You guys go without me.

1225
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,960
And then I would like just I guess Busch Gardens is a zoo.

1226
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,560
So you can hang around like zoo things a little bit.

1227
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,600
But yeah, it's like Busch Gardens.

1228
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,040
If you don't like roller coasters and you can't drink yet, like what the hell?

1229
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,760
Good is it? Yeah, it's easier.

1230
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,440
Yeah, at least it's easy.

1231
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,120
At least they have the zoo.

1232
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,880
It's easier to fake than six flags when I would like if I went one up

1233
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,160
when I was a teenager and I would just be like, oh, yeah, you got.

1234
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,440
Yeah, you guys do this.

1235
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,280
And I think I'm going to do the next one.

1236
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,680
I think like that's when I'll you said to like lie your way through the day.

1237
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,080
Like, I'll do this like I'll do the I'll do the Ferris or the carousel.

1238
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,840
I'll do the yeah.

1239
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,960
Was this going to be the next one?

1240
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,040
If this technically is the next one, I.

1241
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,560
Well, it's a bummer. It's not a roller coaster.

1242
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,640
But, you know, I did say next one.

1243
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,400
I'm a man of my word.

1244
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,800
Oh, why don't we take a photo with Mrs. Taz?

1245
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,520
It's like I can do a log flume.

1246
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,320
Do you want to do that?

1247
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,720
Let's just do the log flume again.

1248
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,720
I can take one drop. Yeah.

1249
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,480
That was so good.

1250
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,480
And there's not much of a line.

1251
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,440
We should go on it again.

1252
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,080
Because I just yeah, I when we would go to like Hershey Park or something,

1253
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,520
people just wanted to hang out and like maybe do one or two rides.

1254
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,240
And I'm like, we do this at the mall every weekend.

1255
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,320
I know we're not supposed to go off alone, but I am. Good day.

1256
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,080
I want to ride the coasters.

1257
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,600
You would have screamed at me.

1258
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,440
You would have been like 12 years old and you would have been like screaming at me.

1259
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,840
We are doing these coasters.

1260
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,200
I will leave you alone.

1261
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,840
Or you would say like you sit on the bench and I'm on the bench at the exit.

1262
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,920
Yeah. You sit by the Dippin Dots card.

1263
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,200
Right. I'll meet you there.

1264
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,120
This is still the case.

1265
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:01,560
I describe going on one ride and otherwise just having a couple of glasses of wine.

1266
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,960
You're like, what?

1267
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,960
No, I like that now, especially with how much legwork you have to do

1268
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,000
to go to Disneyland nowadays.

1269
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,520
So I think once you're over 30, you could just play the My Back Hurts

1270
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,160
wild card because most people will believe you.

1271
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,280
My back's killing me today.

1272
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,440
It's going to really mess me up.

1273
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,480
Yeah, that's a good.

1274
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,040
That's a good little hack.

1275
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah, true.

1276
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,320
Can we have to plant the story beforehand to get this?

1277
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,640
Oh, it's it's sprung up. I don't know.

1278
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,720
Could we look at this Crustyland map, which I really, really like?

1279
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Which and this is pure Matt Warbird and we found out, right?

1280
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,960
He said he had these frames.

1281
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,440
This is like this is completely.

1282
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,520
I'm sure there's jokes in here.

1283
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,560
I don't know.

1284
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,400
It's a little and I can read.

1285
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,080
We can read them. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1286
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,640
Oh, yeah. I don't know any of these.

1287
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,440
No, yeah. Yeah.

1288
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,960
This is a pretty sprainy stuff.

1289
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,560
Yeah. This is what I was saying when I was like,

1290
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,480
was saying this suggests a larger sort of theme park.

1291
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,160
And I could imagine what like a Matt Warbird would have wanted to build

1292
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,480
had they had like an insane budget.

1293
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,880
But yeah, there's Crustyland main entrance.

1294
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,920
There's Crustyland Main Street, Mount Crustmore,

1295
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,160
which is, I think, this right here, right?

1296
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,040
This crusty sort of stone face.

1297
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,200
Oh, well, that's in the ride.

1298
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,680
Some of this factors into the ride.

1299
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,480
Yeah, a lot of it does.

1300
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,080
The journey into Crusty's mouth.

1301
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,480
And then, as Scott, you were talking about earlier,

1302
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,160
there's there is an itchy and scratchy land entrance listed here.

1303
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,120
Number four. What?

1304
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,720
Oh, so this is adjacent to that.

1305
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,720
This is funny. That's my question.

1306
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,280
Yeah. Is it is it the idea that Crustyland was then built up

1307
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,400
like a California adventure next to itching and scratchy land?

1308
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,000
Which I should be.

1309
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,720
It should be on an island.

1310
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,520
Right. Like it's scratchy land.

1311
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,840
Because, yeah, as Jason was saying, there's a different this is a different

1312
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,280
power plant over here.

1313
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,240
Or it's the same. Yeah.

1314
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,480
No, that's this.

1315
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,200
I think that's the Springfield power plant.

1316
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,120
But that well, you know, you meant that there's a second source

1317
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,120
of nuclear power, which is the theme part.

1318
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,400
Yes, that that you see like, you know, Grandpa and Maggie next to.

1319
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,920
And that's how Maggie gets big.

1320
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,560
It also might just be like, oh, we want to have big Maggie.

1321
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,880
This is the simplest, you know, explanation.

1322
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,240
Yes. And we know in The Simpsons, there's many episodes where like

1323
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,840
the geography is very different from episode to episode.

1324
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,240
Well, yes. Yeah.

1325
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,400
I may have the list of jokes in this is so great.

1326
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,440
Like the.

1327
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,080
Can you go back over? Yeah.

1328
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,800
And the no, they bring in some of the stuff that's in like,

1329
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,680
yeah, Captain Dinosaur's pirate ripoff.

1330
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,600
Like that's in the ride, too, which I just love the gazebo.

1331
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,960
Just north north of the Dragon Boat ride.

1332
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,560
That's a good. That's a good one.

1333
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,600
Just even original log ride.

1334
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,000
That's really funny. Yeah.

1335
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,880
That is most of the icebergs right there.

1336
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,000
The change loser is one of the right joke.

1337
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,240
Very joke.

1338
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,080
Oh, that's great. Crusty Lou Studios is based there.

1339
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,400
So they film crusty as well.

1340
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,640
That's from the show that he called it in a like universal.

1341
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,240
It's adjacent to wow.

1342
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,200
Right. So many.

1343
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,360
There's so many jokes on 40 jokes here.

1344
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,800
And the tooth chipper, which is a reference, an old reference

1345
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,600
to an old episode.

1346
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,240
Oh, right. Right.

1347
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,040
Which I forget, is it Duff Gardens or is it Ditching Scratchyland?

1348
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,520
I think it's Duff Gardens.

1349
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,840
No, it's at the carnival.

1350
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,080
Yeah, it's in the part of the Bar Carni with the old Jim Varney in it.

1351
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,080
Yeah, right. There's it because it's the it's the roller coaster

1352
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,160
where literally it stops and everyone hits their teeth on the rail

1353
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,560
for the restraint, which that's I don't want to make you guys scared

1354
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,000
to go on the Incredicoaster again.

1355
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,840
But I said a few weeks ago that literally happened to some poor kid.

1356
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,400
I was waiting to get on it and then a kid burst out my tooth.

1357
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,320
It does have that hard stop at the end.

1358
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,800
It kind of is a tooth chipper.

1359
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,280
Oh, there's two more I love.

1360
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,720
I've never I have forgotten these, the Screamatorium of Dr.

1361
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,360
Frightmare Stine, that's another one from the show of like it was a crappy

1362
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,520
carnival ride that Bart and Lisa are so disappointed by.

1363
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,080
Oh, yes. Where it doesn't that is like a spring that is empty.

1364
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,400
Yeah, like it springs out, but then there's no monster on it.

1365
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,320
And I also like Radioactive Man the Ride, which is like their Spider-Man

1366
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,880
or Batman the Ride for for this, like in their universe.

1367
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,160
And that's good. Yeah.

1368
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,400
And then at the very end, get probed by King and Code.

1369
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,080
So, yeah, it's just so like so much where you're standing in line.

1370
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,320
And if you're paying attention and you're not on your phone,

1371
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,880
you would see exactly what they might do with the full Simpsons land,

1372
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,560
which is awesome. Well, this reminded me of something.

1373
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,160
And Henry, you might have more info on this.

1374
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,360
I'm just vaguely remembering there was a Simpsons attraction

1375
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,040
at a theme park in Australia.

1376
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,760
And within that attraction, you can watch these videos online.

1377
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,080
There is a sequel to Bart versus Australia.

1378
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,600
You see a follow up with Tobias's family.

1379
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,520
The Simpsons visit them and there's more jokes and stuff.

1380
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,880
I think it was made in 1999. Yeah.

1381
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:54,040
Yeah. So there was this like half-assed Fox tried to do their own universal,

1382
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,760
but in Australia.

1383
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,120
And and so it's like, yeah, it's the Fox studio.

1384
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,040
But they never had any real ride.

1385
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:04,200
And so the Simpson ride there was it started with the story of

1386
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,600
of, you know, them sent back to Australia to apologize.

1387
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,280
But it's not the old animation.

1388
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,520
They did a whole new animation for the entire thing, but with the same

1389
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,080
a lot of the same jokes.

1390
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,800
And if you watch the video on YouTube of like the video of the ride,

1391
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,880
there is like about two minutes of just a background with music.

1392
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,840
It is blank.

1393
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,080
That's because it because it was one of those, oh, you're in the movie type rides

1394
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,720
of like they pick out two people from the audience and say, OK,

1395
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,160
say you're lying in front of this blue screen and we'll put you in the Simpsons.

1396
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,480
And I think it lasted like tops five years before it went away.

1397
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,680
And like I remember when that video first hit online, like Bill

1398
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,080
Oakley and Josh Weinstein, Weinstein, who wrote the episode,

1399
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,760
they didn't know it existed.

1400
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,200
They're like, what the hell?

1401
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,560
Oh, yeah. Wow.

1402
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,600
That's amazing. Jeez. Man.

1403
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,640
That's if you learn, yeah, you're there was more canon to what you created

1404
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,840
that you had nothing to do with Tobias of the Australian family

1405
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,080
who Bart Pranks does ending him up in an Australian trial.

1406
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,280
That's weird. What else do they do with them?

1407
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,240
What? Why do they have to go back?

1408
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,280
Or no, it's or it's just like stuff we didn't see.

1409
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,160
It pretends that it's the same plot of the episode.

1410
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:21,440
And it's just a retelling of it. Not a not a sequel. Yeah.

1411
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,320
I recall a lot of is them hanging out in the living room of that family.

1412
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,480
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1413
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,360
Weird. I remember knowing vaguely about this, though.

1414
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,280
I had no idea there was new stuff or that you were in it or whatever.

1415
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,120
But I remember hearing about it and like, well, it makes sense.

1416
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,280
It's an Australian theme park.

1417
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,400
And they'd like do something with the Australian episode.

1418
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,960
Except that the Australian episode portrays Australia

1419
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,280
as like a miserable nation of thieves and inbreds.

1420
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,600
It's like it is very mean to Australia.

1421
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,680
I will say the half dozen Australians I've met only like that episode.

1422
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,160
Yeah, we're not insulted by it.

1423
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,760
I think Australia really embraced it.

1424
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,560
Brazil got mad at the Simpsons, but Australia is like, yes, give us hell, Simpsons.

1425
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,760
Well, I guess, yeah, I guess they were great.

1426
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,200
That's why they embraced that episode.

1427
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,280
Can can I say two little things about the line?

1428
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,240
And even before you get into really the pre show room,

1429
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,400
one is you go through Krusty's head.

1430
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:25,280
But when you look up, when you go in there and his uvula is up there

1431
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,200
and it's a bit is a punching bag, which is fun to go hit.

1432
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,200
And I had the fun of like my my son is little and he's not old enough to go

1433
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,720
on the ride. But I but I was like, oh, he's going to love that uvula.

1434
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,720
And he he hit the hell out of it.

1435
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,560
It was great.

1436
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,960
And so that's a lot of fun.

1437
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,840
Something to do even if you can't go on it.

1438
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,600
And then like, am I insane that I why do I like

1439
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,480
that near that map that you were showing us, Mike,

1440
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:57,080
that there is just a sign printed out with the Gracie Films logo?

1441
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,120
Am I a maniac for thinking it's kind of neat that I guess

1442
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,680
I just like production company logos in general.

1443
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,360
But it's like, it's funny that we've seen this our whole lives

1444
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:10,080
on episodes of the show, the shush and then the little jingle.

1445
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,600
And it's funny that now it's enough.

1446
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,320
It's on a physical build.

1447
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,360
A production company logo is on a building.

1448
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,120
Your brain was forming at a certain point and you were surged with dopamine

1449
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,320
from a Simpson episode in the right formative time.

1450
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,880
So that goes on now.

1451
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,520
Anything at the end, any visual at the end.

1452
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,600
Yeah. Anything like it could be the most disturbing image possible.

1453
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,600
It could be like some awful, collegial nightmare.

1454
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,200
Yeah.

1455
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,600
I think a mountain of rotting animals and you're like, wow,

1456
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,120
it has the same effect on me.

1457
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,320
And that's why I was furious when you watch those new shorts.

1458
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,120
They insert Mickey into the Gracie Films audience.

1459
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,400
They know.

1460
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,280
Really? Yes.

1461
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,560
Watch to the end, you'll see the Gracie logo has Mickey sitting next

1462
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,000
to the shushing lady now.

1463
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,600
It's true. No, no.

1464
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,760
Get out of there, Mickey.

1465
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,640
It feels sacrilegious. Yeah.

1466
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,400
Oh, that's sort of like

1467
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,480
whenever WWE nowadays makes a WWE produced documentary

1468
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,280
and everyone is talking about like, well, back in 1991,

1469
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,320
the thing you have to remember about WWE, like they're using

1470
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,760
the current corporate branding and you.

1471
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,080
But they don't have enough budget to sometimes people go WWF.

1472
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,640
I mean, WWE, like

1473
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,040
it's just so bizarre.

1474
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,120
You can tell everyone's struggling with it.

1475
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,280
And it's like, to what end are you doing this?

1476
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,120
Besides pleasing a 76 year old lunatic?

1477
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,800
Well, it's to reshape the narrative of all these corporations are just.

1478
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,440
Yeah, like in 50 years, you'll be like, well, Mickey always owned the Simpsons

1479
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,600
and he's always been sitting in that audience.

1480
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,120
And of course, even when Disney made Home Alone in 1990,

1481
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,760
they really understood how popular Macaulay Culkin would be.

1482
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,160
It paved the way for the new Home Alone, of course, that we all know and love.

1483
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,240
Who would have ever guessed that Home Alone would have exceeded

1484
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,760
the popularity of the original?

1485
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,040
And that that kid, I don't need to say his name, we all know it,

1486
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,120
but he's 10 times more popular than McAllie.

1487
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,800
Well, did you know the brother of the actor who plays Roman

1488
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,280
in succession was actually an actor, too?

1489
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,360
Pretty interesting.

1490
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,720
When George Lucas pitched Star Wars to Walt Disney, he knew.

1491
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,640
Yeah, it's all going to blur together.

1492
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,880
Have you guys watched that Star Tours doc that's on the Disney Plus?

1493
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,880
The rides that made us whatever type of attraction, fun attraction thing.

1494
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,840
Yeah, that's I didn't know that Lucas went to Disneyland on day two,

1495
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,920
like that he wasn't there day one, but that he went there on day two.

1496
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,960
That was a fun, fun bit of info to learn.

1497
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,400
But yeah, that's great. Yeah.

1498
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,880
If you care about Tony Baxter there, like as a kid, like he I don't know

1499
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,800
if I forget when he started working there, but that feels familiar to me

1500
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,880
that he might have been there on day two to like that.

1501
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,080
So that a young Lucas and a Baxter way pre making his ride

1502
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,800
and even working there at all.

1503
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,720
That's pretty neat.

1504
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,000
Though I hate that thing.

1505
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,400
It's like you get 20 minutes of learning about real Star Tours

1506
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,160
and even just Star Tours at all.

1507
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,920
And then at like minute 24, they're like, and you know what?

1508
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,040
Star Tours really influenced us when designing galaxies

1509
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,200
as in the Zesta Galaxy's Edge commercial.

1510
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,520
The rest of the special. Yeah.

1511
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,600
Yes. Yeah, we want more.

1512
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,320
Though we still are waiting for like

1513
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,120
five hour deep dive documentaries on these rides,

1514
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,960
which I don't know what the audience is.

1515
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,080
I mean, I guess it's this podcast audience.

1516
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,200
But we like I don't know if that's big enough for Disney,

1517
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,520
Disney plus to do like exhaustive documentaries on these rides,

1518
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,520
which is what we want.

1519
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,840
Like Alex Gibney level.

1520
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:44,160
Yeah, Ken Burns, Ken Burns, 12 part series on start

1521
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,680
just Star Tours on the scope.

1522
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,880
Well, and they went and like get back where it's just unbroken footage.

1523
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,520
Don't stop it. Don't narrate it.

1524
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,200
Just show me raw. If they're mumbling, I don't care.

1525
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,360
We'll try to read lips.

1526
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,600
I just want to watch people working on Peter Jackson.

1527
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,120
He's the come in and like up as all the footage

1528
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,680
and then painstakingly try to recreate conversations to make it seamless.

1529
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,400
Just debating on like what color eyes Rex should have.

1530
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,360
Oh, you know, Scott, would you be more likely to give Book of Boba Fett a try?

1531
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,280
If I told you there is a Rex in it, there's a Rex model droid.

1532
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,520
It's not the Rex. Yeah, there is a Rex. Yeah.

1533
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,480
Yeah, I think our audience has noticed this.

1534
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,040
I've been mean enough to put it on.

1535
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,960
You know, there's another that saves a lot for me.

1536
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,800
Again, without watching it, I love the show.

1537
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,280
The other perfect show.

1538
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,120
Really, if there is this thing on Disney Plus, Scott,

1539
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,160
where you could just watch the scenes in that like bar cantina,

1540
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,280
because in that scene as well, spoiler alert,

1541
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,120
Max Rebo is teamed up with maybe Figurine Dan.

1542
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,040
They're in a band together in that.

1543
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,720
Yes. And they're in there.

1544
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,920
Yeah. So like that those scenes.

1545
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,400
Yeah, you could should just watch for that reason.

1546
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,240
Yeah, I want only the I want only bar and music.

1547
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,840
That's really that's how I feel about the original movies, though.

1548
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,960
You're never going to please me.

1549
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,160
I'm the most unpleasable.

1550
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,040
They have. You couldn't even call me a Star Wars fan at that level.

1551
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,240
They have. I guess. Well, we know the name of the music.

1552
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,960
I'm a Jizz fan is what I am.

1553
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,200
We know it's hard.

1554
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,400
It can be hard to please a Jizz fan.

1555
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Amen.

1556
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,600
You know, me and Bob have talked about this before.

1557
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,600
Bob, I think I rode the ride with him the his first time riding the ride.

1558
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,200
We went to their together on an L.A.

1559
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,720
podcast trip. But I do wish it's too bad.

1560
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,880
It's in 3D. But I know why they got to do it.

1561
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,280
But me and Bob were both just like, well, I wish this was 2D.

1562
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,760
But there's that would have cost them like 18 times as much money, I'm sure.

1563
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,280
It's like all the perspective shifts you have to do.

1564
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,800
And it would have like there's a reason even the Hanna

1565
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,320
Barbera ride is like it's 2D guys

1566
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,280
drawn on shitty 3D models bouncing around, like because it's just all the perspective

1567
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,160
change, it just it's almost impossible to do in 2D and it would cost way more money.

1568
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:03,880
But yeah, it would have to be like a more traditional, I think, 3D

1569
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:09,120
with glasses then to make the 2D look more like 2D.

1570
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,320
Am I wrong? Maybe I'm crazy. But something like that.

1571
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,000
And scaling to IMAX level. Right. Right. Right.

1572
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,920
Portions is much more difficult.

1573
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,080
I think a lot of it.

1574
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,800
The ride is kind of a strange proposition because you're going to it as a Simpsons fan

1575
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,520
and you're watching all the clips in line and it's the Simpsons that you know and love.

1576
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,720
When you get on the ride, it's a Simpsons, as you've seen them in maybe five minutes

1577
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,880
of the show in total, like the the Homer and 3D Halloween special.

1578
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,280
So it is kind of strange to me that, I mean, I understand why they did it.

1579
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,400
But it's just like this is not the version of the characters I ever see or ever will see.

1580
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,280
Yeah. Yeah. The limitations of just that.

1581
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,720
Yeah. Using that back to the future like structure or excuse me, the infrastructure.

1582
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:55,840
I think the only way I can justify it is that I do like when as with the movie,

1583
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:02,400
I thought the movie was elevated a little bit visually and at least there's a I don't know.

1584
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,680
You know, there's that there's there's mood to it that they're rendered in this way.

1585
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,560
And you only see them in this way, in this place.

1586
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,040
It's still odd to me, but that's kind of how I justify it is that, well,

1587
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,040
at least it's like a a special one time only

1588
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,200
look at these characters we like in this format.

1589
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,160
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it helps sell some of the big moment,

1590
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,000
like when you think you're upside down or when you're going down a rollercoaster.

1591
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,840
I think that's probably easier to combine the, you know, visual footage with the

1592
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,960
you know, motion base.

1593
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,840
Yeah. With the 3D footage.

1594
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,720
There's probably I'm sure there's like a and I haven't been on it yet,

1595
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,640
but like a runaway railway style like Mickey Minnie's that new ride

1596
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,200
at at the Hollywood Studios where it feels a little bit more like the cartoon.

1597
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:57,000
But I will say when I I don't know if I consciously thought this,

1598
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,480
but I was very into that Homer in 3D when he went in.

1599
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,840
I was like blown away as a child that Homer was in 3D.

1600
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,880
Like, and I don't know what year would you guys should like?

1601
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,600
What year was that season seven?

1602
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,240
So 96 or no, it was the fourth Toy Story came out.

1603
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,280
Yeah, it was 95.

1604
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,080
A year before Toy Story.

1605
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,720
Because that felt like that and then months before Toy Story,

1606
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,080
like seeing pictures of Mario 64.

1607
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,520
I was like, everything's going to look like this soon.

1608
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,960
Yeah. Like this is the future, which it kind of is, but not fully.

1609
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,200
I didn't realize I'd be fighting against that now as a kid.

1610
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,440
I thought like you, Mike, like everything needs to be like this.

1611
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,840
This is the future of all entertainment.

1612
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,480
And now I'm craving anything to be because it's just so rare.

1613
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,880
I wouldn't want when they did the first like new Mario to decide scroller.

1614
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,760
I went, you can do that.

1615
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,240
You can go back.

1616
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,920
What's like it really was was embarrassing to think about now that I was like,

1617
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,000
well, they're of course abandoned to the games.

1618
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,600
Why would you?

1619
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,760
Well, you know, the The Simpsons movie,

1620
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,880
they did a whole trailer beforehand about how like this isn't a 3D

1621
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,720
like bullshit cute bunny thing.

1622
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,560
This is in 2D like they advertise Simpsons movie and then Moe's head pops out

1623
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,280
like in 2D.

1624
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,440
But but this ride.

1625
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,360
Yeah, it is 3D.

1626
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:15,800
I mean, it does make me fear that like if they were to do a second Simpsons movie,

1627
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,840
Disney wouldn't finance it unless it's 3D.

1628
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,400
Like, I mean, that Bob's Burgers movie isn't 2D,

1629
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,480
but that was under the Fox regime that they did it.

1630
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,280
That wasn't a Disney choice.

1631
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,360
They recently did a Toy Story parody with much better CG than what's in the right.

1632
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,720
I mean, it's 14 years later, 13 years later,

1633
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,120
but I could see that being an option for the future.

1634
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,400
I mean, there's now a CGI SpongeBob show.

1635
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,120
Yeah.

1636
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,400
Yeah.

1637
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,400
And that was oh, yeah, that was written by our pal Julia Prescott was.

1638
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,000
Yeah.

1639
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:44,360
Yeah.

1640
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,520
Oh, good.

1641
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,360
But but yeah, that's that's what's a problem, though, with the ride making a 3D

1642
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:55,080
is like it was cutting edge in 2008 and 14 years later, 3D looks all right.

1643
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,840
It looks good.

1644
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,720
Yeah.

1645
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,360
It's always tricky, too, with The Simpsons.

1646
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,320
The way The Simpsons are drawn and I we were talking before we started a little

1647
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,600
bit about toys, it's always just a little odd seeing these character designs

1648
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,640
in three dimensions.

1649
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,640
And there's two per seven.

1650
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,920
This company is making new Simpsons toys and I'm excited to see how they look.

1651
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,920
But it was it always looks a little wrong seeing them 3D.

1652
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,000
And I guess, yeah, that's why there's so many memes about front facing Simpsons

1653
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,160
because outside of the in-betweens when they're turning around,

1654
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:28,880
they rarely ever look directly at the camera because it's just so freakish.

1655
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,960
And you think about what that would be in real life if you're staring

1656
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,440
at someone who's shaped like that.

1657
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,640
Yes, exactly. It's often so scary.

1658
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,040
But Bart and Lisa, especially is it in the itchy and scratchy

1659
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,480
that they look up disappointed at Marge?

1660
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,560
I don't know what it's about.

1661
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,120
Oh, yeah. She's saying they're going to go to a bird sanctuary

1662
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,480
and for the family vacation.

1663
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,960
Oh, yeah. It is the theme park.

1664
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,720
Yeah. That view, which is very funny.

1665
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,520
It's like hilarious and purposefully.

1666
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:57,280
So this scary, weird front facing view of disappointed Bart and Lisa.

1667
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,080
But yeah, mostly it's yeah, it's all and the suited characters

1668
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,720
are kind of upsetting.

1669
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:08,880
I'm not like dying to get photos with the universal walk around.

1670
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,360
You know, Crusty and Crusty and Bob are my favorites to get the photo with

1671
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,240
because they already look like freakish anyway.

1672
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,720
But there's something about having a Bart that's as tall as me,

1673
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,520
like doesn't feel right.

1674
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,560
You know, that's the that's the one that feels the most wrong to me.

1675
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,120
If you're if we're talking freakish, here's something funny.

1676
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,120
I was curious about any information about the the opening of these rides

1677
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,240
on either coast.

1678
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,720
And there wasn't anything too interesting about Hollywood.

1679
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,040
But Florida got a little sillier and went went kind of all out.

1680
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,280
And so here's a couple like funny opening day

1681
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:53,120
only dimensions of three D Simpsons, I guess you could say.

1682
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,440
So they did sort of a flash mobby thing where they handed everybody

1683
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:03,680
Marge Wigs were looking at a group of like 40 Marge Wigs

1684
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,360
and like there's a laundry hamper of somebody passing out more,

1685
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,920
which is sort of, you know, like if you're a fan of the show,

1686
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,200
you're like, I don't care about that.

1687
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,720
I wouldn't be excited to like, oh, I got a Marge Wig.

1688
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,200
But then the the then president of the Universal Orlando is introduced

1689
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:23,920
and then he walks out wearing one takes it off about five seconds later.

1690
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,520
But that's enough time for him to say, God, I can't believe they got me to wear this.

1691
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,880
Most you're easily embarrassed to dad thing you've ever seen.

1692
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,080
But then right below is the funniest thing.

1693
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,480
You might see it in the background of this photo that there's a little

1694
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,960
like chamber orchestra and they play the Simpsons theme

1695
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,360
when the confetti goes off and the rides officially open.

1696
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,480
Look how they dressed the conductor of the orchestra.

1697
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,480
Oh, my God.

1698
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,880
It really reminds me of how on the Today show, when they dressed up as peanuts

1699
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,560
characters, it's just as ghoulish and disturbing. Oh, God.

1700
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,680
This is just to say for the listener, this is a like a conductor in a suit.

1701
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:09,760
And he is he looks like Krusty and it's not a cartoon Krusty head.

1702
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,440
His face is painted entirely white.

1703
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,200
And then he's got a headpiece with the three puffs.

1704
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,560
I mean, it's kind of like this is something I always wondered as a kid

1705
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,920
with there being the Flintstones movie.

1706
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,800
Was there any possibility of a live action Simpsons movie done like this?

1707
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,600
Practically where they're painting everybody yellow or in this case, white.

1708
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,720
But this is this is one of the scariest things ever.

1709
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,600
I mean, I guess I got the clown thing.

1710
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,640
I guess it ties into that. But like, true.

1711
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:41,320
Dear God, this guy, like I mean, otherwise, he's probably a good man.

1712
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,640
But if this was a creature who roams the earth looking like this,

1713
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,480
he needs to be shot in the head.

1714
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,560
This is this is right out of a not the Simpsons porn parody.

1715
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,520
Yes, yes.

1716
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,840
One of the only other real world reasons that there's been people

1717
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,480
painted head to toe, yeah, nightmarish.

1718
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,120
And need I remind everyone there is a music

1719
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,720
teacher character in The Simpsons, not featured very often.

1720
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,320
But like, no, but in every opening, he's

1721
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,320
usually in the very sheer, though.

1722
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,680
So maybe he can't appear.

1723
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,400
Didn't want him.

1724
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,520
Yeah, this reminds me that within the past few years, we learned that there was

1725
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,240
a live action crusty show in development and Dan Casanetta was going to play

1726
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
crusty and live action.

1727
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,080
I don't think there were any makeup tests, but that could have happened.

1728
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,680
But Fox had a a circus themed show that had already failed.

1729
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,280
So they did not greenlight the show.

1730
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,040
It wasn't old. It wasn't TV.

1731
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,960
Funhouse was the original TV.

1732
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,160
Funhouse where Smigel played a terrifying clown man.

1733
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,040
Oh, no, it was like, God, what was the name of that shitty clown show?

1734
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,800
It was just called Circus Circus.

1735
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,880
Yeah. And that's where like Greg Daniels came from.

1736
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,040
And that's why he joined The Simpsons writing staff and a few other writers.

1737
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:53,720
Wow.

1738
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,720
Was well, I've never heard of this.

1739
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,960
Well, what other was there a Phil Hartman, Troy McClure show as well?

1740
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,600
Or was that just talked about as an idea?

1741
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,760
He always said he wanted to do it there.

1742
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,000
They say that he said he would do a live action thing with it.

1743
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,080
And I mean, if he was alive in the last 20 years,

1744
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,680
he probably would have done it like five times over for Internet videos.

1745
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,520
We'd be tired of it. We'd be like, all right, Phil Hartman.

1746
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,440
Yeah.

1747
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,880
Even though now I'd kill to see him in that.

1748
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,480
To be tired of Phil Hartman. What a luxury.

1749
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,720
We should be so lucky.

1750
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,760
I mean, he would have for sure been either Sterling or Cooper in Mad Men.

1751
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,520
He would have been one of the ad agency directors.

1752
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,800
That would have had to happen.

1753
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Sure.

1754
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,440
The other one similar to this, the rare crossover into live action.

1755
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,600
I remember it always getting said and you guys probably know

1756
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,880
and I can't remember the name, but the King of the Hill,

1757
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,040
that crazy priest action show that they'd watch.

1758
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,000
Yes. Monsignor Martinez and the pilot for that just surfaced

1759
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,520
within the past like six to eight months.

1760
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,840
Wow. No way. Really?

1761
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,160
Yeah. Oh, I'd love to see that.

1762
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,320
Oh, my God. Did that exist somewhere that's viewable?

1763
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,080
Yeah, it's on. It was on YouTube.

1764
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,400
We were seeing it around because we we'd set it on our podcast

1765
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,400
a bunch of times like, oh, I want to see that pilot someday.

1766
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,040
And then the second it was on YouTube, someone on our discord was like,

1767
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,640
guys, it's finally here.

1768
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,480
Like, oh, great.

1769
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,440
Geez, I asked the right people. Oh, my God.

1770
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,040
I will check that out ASAP.

1771
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,040
But since that crusty show failed, then Jean and Reese,

1772
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,480
for they just were like, well, what about the critic?

1773
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,280
That's like a TV show. We can do that.

1774
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,560
So that that's how the critic was born. But, oh, I think, you know,

1775
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,200
if I can say another thing, I wish was a little better in the ride.

1776
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,080
I think that there's they were too.

1777
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,400
There's too many jokes.

1778
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,760
I hate to play. There's too many jokes.

1779
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,800
But it's like they could have they could have silence just a couple times.

1780
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,360
And there's so many good jokes in it that sometimes and Homer goes like,

1781
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:50,560
come on, Bob, we're both ball big and round and didn't finish high school.

1782
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,240
I was like, Homer could just be yelling here as he runs toward it.

1783
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,640
And I didn't need another joke.

1784
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,320
It diminished the previous joke.

1785
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
That's the one for me, I have to admit.

1786
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,960
That is that like, you know, last round of rewrite.

1787
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,160
We need something.

1788
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,000
And then they talk about this in the commentaries, how like the pressure of

1789
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,560
we've seen this 40 times, I'm sick of this joke.

1790
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,400
Let's put a new one in.

1791
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:15,480
And then you put in one that's maybe not as good as the one that you got sick of.

1792
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,640
And that's the one.

1793
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,240
And there's probably another one in there where I feel similar, like,

1794
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,800
yeah, that's a little like rewritey, I feel.

1795
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,640
Yeah. I mean, that's the problem with rewriting in general.

1796
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,600
It's like, oh, we've heard this so many times.

1797
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,200
Like, oh, you know, who hasn't heard this? The audience.

1798
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,600
Yeah. It's also just like

1799
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,440
it's hard to catch them all.

1800
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,880
Even just like I like there's stuff all like pick up on.

1801
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,560
Yeah, like the 10th time writing it, because there's just so much flying.

1802
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,200
Like you're going through so many different scenarios

1803
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,040
and there's so many lines flying.

1804
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,560
It's like, yeah, you could have gotten away with like

1805
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,760
like a quarter of these, probably.

1806
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,320
Mm hmm. Even even some of the maybe.

1807
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:59,200
But at least like and well, I think I may have said this before.

1808
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,720
Let's just pose it to me.

1809
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,240
Despite I totally agree, Henry, that there's certain lines

1810
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,680
that like I could stand and never hear that again or we could.

1811
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,000
There could be less.

1812
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,800
But I like this probably not as successful of an attempt in theme parks

1813
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:21,200
at hard comedy in a ride that is meant to be funny more than once.

1814
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,280
It's pretty tough not to mention that most, you know,

1815
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,960
there's not rides of the office or whatever.

1816
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,800
Like usually it's not yet a sit. There's no sign.

1817
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,280
Yeah, this is all coming for sure.

1818
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:35,440
But there's not a Seinfeld ride, you know, most sitcoms or comedy

1819
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,240
don't land that lend themselves to the medium, but animation does.

1820
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,320
So it's a tricky thing.

1821
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,800
And I do think it like, boy, you need that Simpsons level of like 20 people

1822
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,000
all like really throwing their best at it because other things in theme parks

1823
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,200
that are meant to be funny.

1824
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,000
Oh, boy. Yeah, that's a graveyard.

1825
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,160
It's actually funny.

1826
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,560
It's not just funny for theme park funny.

1827
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:03,920
Now, it's like way funnier than, like, say, the Kung Fu Panda or Shrek 4D.

1828
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,680
Like I, I think it's way funnier than those comedy rides.

1829
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,680
Yeah, you could tell people affiliated with the show wrote it.

1830
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:14,400
It's not just people brought in who kind of know the show and sense of humor.

1831
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,800
Well, I'll contradict my own argument I just made by saying also

1832
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,040
the things that I've noticed over the years I've liked are like

1833
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,400
your Pirates of the Caribbean or even the new Secret Life of Pets

1834
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,360
that has so much going on.

1835
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,880
Obviously, those are animatronic based and there's there's

1836
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,240
you can look all around you.

1837
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,120
But that has tons of those both those rides have tons of gags

1838
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:37,080
and lines of dialogue you miss, which does like reward

1839
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:40,160
riding again and again and feeling like you're getting like a

1840
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,360
maybe a new thing every time you ride.

1841
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,720
Yeah. The difference is with Simpsons, this is all one focus on the screen.

1842
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,800
So they are kind of trying to do the same thing.

1843
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,720
I if I think about it, those man, the screen like

1844
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,520
this is the case for most regular movie theaters nowadays, too.

1845
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,160
But it's like, yeah, you got to do something with that projector

1846
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,360
or maybe it's the bulbs or like I it could be crisper.

1847
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,520
Like, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1848
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,680
It was very dim all the times I wrote it.

1849
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1850
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,840
Yeah. No, I you know, the last time I wrote it was

1851
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:21,200
my husband, I flew down like in August of last year when I was like, hey,

1852
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,440
it's back open. We can just fly down for a day.

1853
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,240
Let's finally do it.

1854
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,680
And so maybe this was June.

1855
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,440
But anyway, we it was we got to ride it like private.

1856
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:35,240
It was just the two of us on the ride, thanks to the social distancing rules.

1857
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,800
And so that was that was a fun and special experience.

1858
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,080
But it was also I the ride is herky jerky a little bit.

1859
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,640
But this is the first time in the ride where I actually felt like it

1860
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,560
like moved me forward and like my back slammed against the thing.

1861
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,560
And I was like, oh, my back really like hurt

1862
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,320
to the rest of the day from just like, wham, right against it on the ride.

1863
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,400
Yeah, because there's certain levels of maintenance with theme park stuff

1864
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,680
where it's like we have to do maintenance on this because the structure is falling

1865
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,640
apart. And then there's just like upkeep level maintenance.

1866
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,880
And that's usually what falls to the back of the line in terms of like

1867
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:15,280
allocating budgets, because when they this when they switched over, they did.

1868
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,600
It was Oceaneering International, the company that

1869
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,560
fixed the Jaws ride took over like the mechanic,

1870
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,920
like redid the mechanics from back to the future.

1871
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,840
So while it is the same sort of setup, it was a new system.

1872
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,960
But again, that was a long time ago at this point.

1873
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,960
Yeah. And it's also and this is I'll speak for myself, like as I get older,

1874
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:44,000
sometimes I especially going on these rides a lot, sometimes I'll just focus

1875
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,680
like on Transformers or Simpsons.

1876
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,800
I would just focus on like, let me really feel how this is like jerking my body

1877
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,400
around. Sometimes on Transformers, like if I'm kind of more like in tune

1878
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,720
with my I'm kind of just thinking about the physical experience, I go like,

1879
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,680
man, I'm getting like fucked up on this.

1880
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,240
Like I'm getting thrown around like in a context without the fun of seeing

1881
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,360
Optimus Prime. I would you'd be like, what is this?

1882
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,680
Why am I throwing me into this piece of hard plastic over and over again?

1883
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,520
But we love it, folks. Yeah.

1884
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,120
Why? Oh, no, sorry.

1885
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:23,000
I was just saying, yeah, it's it's like, you know, I do have to admit,

1886
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,600
like there's a lot that I could that I could praise about this direction.

1887
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,080
And I do. And I remember it like feeling like it came out of the gate

1888
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,840
so strong and didn't disappoint me who didn't want back to the future to go away.

1889
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,800
But at least it was replaced by a strong thing.

1890
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:38,160
The repeatability does get somewhere between the dimness of it.

1891
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,360
I do know all the comedy.

1892
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,840
It's it does jerk you around a lot.

1893
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,400
And then unpleasant things like that electric shock sort of like the

1894
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,560
the buzzer thing at the end, like all of it does.

1895
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And that like even that line will sneak up on you.

1896
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,200
Like it'll say a low amount and then you will end up waiting to load.

1897
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,040
You'll end up stuck in some room for a while.

1898
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,040
And even though I like the clips, like there's something about the experience

1899
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:10,200
that just makes it a it's like a once every couple of years, maybe.

1900
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,120
And not certainly not in every time.

1901
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,760
What do you guys think about getting?

1902
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,680
Well, sucked off by Maggie.

1903
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,640
What what do you guys think?

1904
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,200
I I usually like little sense,

1905
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,560
but that baby powder said I just don't care for.

1906
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,360
No, I like the baby powder sense.

1907
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,720
For some reason, I think it's because it's unique.

1908
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,640
I expected a spray of water the first time I wrote it.

1909
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,360
And I was like, yeah, because it's universal.

1910
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,480
There's going to be a little spritz.

1911
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,080
But yeah, the baby.

1912
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,120
But I also like I always have a disconnect there of like, well,

1913
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,520
do the insides of a baby's mouth smell like baby powder?

1914
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,480
Like, no. Yeah.

1915
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,120
Yes, being near a baby, maybe.

1916
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,560
Although, you know, like I'm already out of the baby phase with my kid

1917
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,440
and baby powder was never around.

1918
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,960
This smell has not been in my house once.

1919
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,720
I'm not even sure why baby powder is it for rashes and diapers?

1920
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,080
So, yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

1921
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,560
It smelled like a milk burp or whatever.

1922
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,720
That'd be like disgusting.

1923
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,240
I don't want that peeing a strange peas or whatever.

1924
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,440
Like whatever you would feed

1925
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,040
a little smushed up apples like applesauce.

1926
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,480
That wouldn't be bad.

1927
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,680
OK, I guess not.

1928
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,840
Those don't seem that familiar to me as the I guess the quintessential

1929
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,040
baby smells aren't good. Right.

1930
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,840
General is like sure to be avoided.

1931
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,640
Mostly that. Yes.

1932
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,760
I want to go back to back to the future.

1933
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,920
Scott was mentioning it earlier.

1934
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,400
I think this is a good replacement, but I don't think it feels as special

1935
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,840
as that ride, because when this ride came out, there were maybe 400

1936
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,240
episodes of the show. Now there's a close to 800 or possibly more.

1937
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:55,040
On that back to the future ride, it felt like it was an epilogue to the movies.

1938
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,800
And there is not a whole lot of extra

1939
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,200
Christopher Lloyd is Doc Brown material out there.

1940
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,040
This is before he was appearing on talk shows and whatnot and in like

1941
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,000
Geico commercials. Yeah. So, yeah.

1942
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,240
But yeah, it did feel more special because there's just

1943
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:11,720
so little back to the future content that it was just like,

1944
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,720
oh, here's one more thing I can see of this world.

1945
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,680
The Simpsons. There is no shortage.

1946
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,560
And 14 years later, there continues to be no shortage of content.

1947
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,200
Yeah, that's a very good point. Yeah, totally.

1948
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,160
Like it is one of the only places that maybe will ever exist to see these

1949
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:28,920
these characters as opposed to like, boy, yeah, we've never stopped being.

1950
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,440
Simpsons inundated.

1951
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,600
But I do like that the ride, you know, like back to the future is about,

1952
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,200
you know, of course, Biff has to come and mess it all up

1953
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,800
and just the same here, it's like, well, sideshow Bob shows up

1954
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,040
to Krusty land and takes it over.

1955
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:47,120
So and I always I always love that when a

1956
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,480
watch the ride kind of thing starts with like, well,

1957
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,800
this is going to be a very normal thing for you guys.

1958
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,320
And then and then you find out, no, this won't be normal at all.

1959
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,280
Someone changed it.

1960
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,840
Yes, for sure.

1961
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,280
I want I think we met Matt Morbren talked about this where

1962
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,320
it was sort of almost a little late in the in the development

1963
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,520
where they were like, we got to fly through Springfield.

1964
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,280
Like we can't just. Oh, yeah, yes.

1965
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:16,080
That he was like he would have been more than happy to keep flushing out

1966
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,800
the fictional theme park, because clearly he did thoroughly.

1967
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,560
Yes, ma'am.

1968
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,240
But that some on a basic level, I don't know if it was a graining

1969
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,480
or a James L. Brooks, but somebody's like, if there's going to be

1970
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,840
one Simpsons ride ever, you probably need to go to the. Yeah.

1971
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,760
And that's true. That is good.

1972
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,400
And that it's funny.

1973
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:38,720
And he his attitude, as I recall, was kind of like, oh, yeah, yeah.

1974
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,520
Right. Yeah. Right. Well, yeah.

1975
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,120
Are you that it's like on Star Wars?

1976
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,360
Yeah, the original I as a kid as a Star Wars nerd was like the Death Star

1977
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,520
blew up already. This isn't that what they build a third Death Star.

1978
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:54,400
But but I mean, you need to do the trench run if you're going to do it.

1979
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:59,640
Do the same with like if you're on the Simpsons ride, a couch gag should end it.

1980
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,440
Like that is it just makes sense.

1981
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:06,360
You know, thematically for the Simpsons ride, you need a couch gag. Yeah.

1982
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,840
And which which doesn't seem obvious either that you could like get

1983
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:17,240
manipulate a vehicle into into a space to make a live couch gag happen.

1984
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,920
It's pretty clever.

1985
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,720
I remember it like I didn't see that coming. Yeah.

1986
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,760
Yeah, that's real fun.

1987
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,160
What's the game?

1988
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:28,800
The first sort of like walk around Springfield game, is it like around 2000

1989
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,920
computer? You mean virtual Springfield?

1990
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,520
I think so. Yeah. Whenever we got that, I was like,

1991
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,440
all I want to do is live here.

1992
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,840
Yeah, like walking around.

1993
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,280
And it was not it didn't quite live up to the promise of it,

1994
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,520
but it was still pretty close to like what you would imagine as a kid, because

1995
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,320
any game that would get close to like where you could be inside the place

1996
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,240
you like the start like there was a Super Nintendo Star Trek,

1997
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,200
the next generation game.

1998
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,200
And it was like, I want to walk around and I want to like sleep in the bed

1999
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,200
in like the captain, like Captain Picard's bed.

2000
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,320
That's what I want is a game.

2001
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,320
And then the Simpsons.

2002
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,520
Yeah, the Simpsons, that game came closer to something like that.

2003
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,000
Yeah, the park fulfills part of that dream, which is why I wish more

2004
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,600
of the buildings weren't just facades.

2005
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,880
Like I want to go into the Androids dungeon or the Quickie Mart.

2006
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,320
That's the one that hurts the most. The Androids dungeon.

2007
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,520
It's like, you know, especially because it's a store.

2008
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,520
It's in the world. It's a store.

2009
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,520
I let me go in a store and buy stuff.

2010
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,800
I'll spend the money if you make another store there.

2011
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,080
I'll spend money in there.

2012
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:33,080
They had so many tables for that taste of Universal Food Festival.

2013
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:38,760
We realized like, oh, we can, you know, it was like right after we vaccinated.

2014
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,120
And we're like still they were spacing everyone out so much.

2015
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:45,680
It's like, oh, my God, there's hidden tables back here behind the Androids

2016
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,320
dungeon facade.

2017
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,360
Yeah, it does.

2018
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:53,400
Yeah, you imagine what else would you want to do in Springfield?

2019
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,440
Because everything is bad.

2020
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,560
That's the funny thing is that every all the stores are bad.

2021
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:03,960
But I guess I have I have some plus ups written down to plus it on my.

2022
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,040
Yes. Well, for one thing in Hollywood, they have an Aztec theater,

2023
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:13,200
but it's just a facade like why can't that be the Main Street cinema of

2024
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:17,160
Springfield? And you go in there and just like episodes are playing like six

2025
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,280
episodes at once all around you, just like in the Main Street cinema.

2026
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,080
Like, yeah.

2027
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,680
And and also, I mean, Androids dungeon, too.

2028
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:31,400
And then another thing is I I wish Luigi's pizza wasn't just cafeteria pizza.

2029
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,800
Like I wish it was just some just slightly better, just a little better than

2030
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,640
that pizza for Luigi's.

2031
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,280
Yeah, that's yeah, that's a good point.

2032
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,800
I was trying to think of food wise.

2033
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,400
We were talking about how all the food on the show is supposed to be bad.

2034
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:47,880
Is there like a fun way to lean into the food being better?

2035
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,000
Would that just confuse most guests?

2036
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,480
Like the like the package it comes in looks worse.

2037
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:58,160
It's you know, they have you know, they have like chocolate covered bacon

2038
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,160
they sell there. They should have more like disgusting, like extra

2039
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,440
like the morning burger should be there.

2040
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,560
Like the worst grossest stuff.

2041
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,560
Oh, yeah. Clav Kavash, the weird food.

2042
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,760
Crab juice. Crab juice.

2043
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,520
Crab juice.

2044
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:16,120
Mechelada is like that's what like in Canada, they're meat.

2045
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:20,400
They make mecheladas with Clamato, the tomato juice that is clam of Caesar.

2046
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,680
That's what it's called. Yeah. Right.

2047
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,320
That would be good.

2048
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:26,560
Like, is there a way, you know, in Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge,

2049
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,480
Doc Gondar is like sort of hanging out in the back,

2050
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,120
but everybody else is doing the actual transact like humans are doing

2051
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,800
transactions for the gift shop.

2052
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,120
Could there be like a Moe character that's like kind of over by the bar

2053
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:41,200
doing something or he's like smuggling the panda in the back?

2054
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:45,160
Like a more like a robot or a person in a suit

2055
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,080
where you can get a little bit more of that feeling

2056
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,960
as opposed to like people being nice to you.

2057
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:52,240
You want to people you also wanted to be like Ed DeBevix or something

2058
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,320
where people are mean at Moe's.

2059
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,520
I mean, I think the one thing they could do at Moe's and we even mentioned it yet.

2060
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,240
The flaming Moe is the wrong color.

2061
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,520
I know. It's not flaming.

2062
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,160
Make me sign a waiver saying, you know, this fire is going to be near you.

2063
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,400
You're liable for any damages to yourself and other people.

2064
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,280
I just want to see it happen in front of me.

2065
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:14,480
Yeah. Even even a fake out kind of a thing where they have a little display

2066
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,760
for the flaming Moe, where you would put like the glass behind it

2067
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,000
and a little show would pop up that you can make it like safe.

2068
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,440
Maybe you wouldn't actually see your glass be on fire.

2069
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,520
I mean, I guess you could.

2070
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,320
But even even just some sort of like pageantry

2071
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,080
to make it seem like your your glass was going on fire would go a long way.

2072
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:37,200
If if it was just purple and had a hint of grape like that.

2073
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,600
And I mean, I'm also like it doesn't I get they want to.

2074
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,800
I figure they want to make it non-alcoholic so the kids can be like,

2075
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,480
I want to drink a flaming Moe to dad and they can let you.

2076
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,680
But I mean, I wish they gave you the alcoholic choice there.

2077
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,120
It's like, you know, we're not in Disneyland. I can drink here.

2078
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:59,960
Just let me I would like an actual mixed drink, just a purple well drink

2079
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:03,480
and just say, oh, it used to be on fire. Here you go.

2080
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,440
And even just drink that even if they want a kid's drink,

2081
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,280
like put a squishy machine in Moe's.

2082
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,080
I understand that's maybe not canon, but like even something like that

2083
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,720
to give the kids an option.

2084
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,560
Oh, how did they not do squishy?

2085
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,160
No, they do have squishies. They do have squishies.

2086
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:20,840
Yeah. At Krusty Burger, you can buy a squishy.

2087
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,320
And I mean, it's just a slushy.

2088
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,600
It's just like nothing special about it.

2089
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,080
They should sell milkshakes and label them.

2090
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,080
What's the full term? You guys must know partially.

2091
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,640
Partially gelatinated gum based beverages. Yes. Yeah.

2092
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,320
Yeah. That'd be great.

2093
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,160
Yeah, that would be great.

2094
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:42,360
I guess I guess a lot of this logistically, they're like the audience

2095
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,280
or people, your average tourist is not going to know what that is.

2096
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,200
Like we can't control them. Yeah.

2097
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:53,480
But a really good flaming Moe would have, I think, a butter beer effect

2098
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,520
if they hold it off.

2099
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,520
Maybe they weren't like primed yet to be, although this food stuff came later.

2100
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,440
This came post butter beer.

2101
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:05,680
I bet you know, they must have tried like, hey, maybe that butter beer is made by

2102
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:10,240
there. There's like a committed universal chef who's very good.

2103
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:15,320
And like, like truly like like delves into how do I make this flavor

2104
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,160
from a movie and does research?

2105
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:20,960
And so if they have that person, there's no way they didn't make a go

2106
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,960
at a really good flaming.

2107
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:25,560
Yeah. But like I think maybe what you were saying, I agree with, too.

2108
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:29,560
It's like when all this stuff gets built, it's like this gets built

2109
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,080
around the same time as Harry Potter.

2110
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,920
But obviously, they're not putting the resources from Harry Potter into it.

2111
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,080
And then Star Wars is like a few years later.

2112
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,920
If it had happened a little later and universal own the property,

2113
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,280
would we have gotten like even extra plus ups

2114
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,320
and then continuing to plus up?

2115
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,520
Because now, obviously, they're like the contract is up, I believe, in 2028.

2116
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,200
I think I'd heard that rumor too.

2117
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,880
Yeah, it was a 20 year contract.

2118
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,480
Yeah, that's when universe. Oh, so what?

2119
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,280
So that's what so we write that.

2120
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:59,480
So people don't know what that happens.

2121
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:03,040
But I'm saying like even anything we're saying now, even if a universal

2122
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,080
creative person was like, yeah, we really should do something universal,

2123
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,080
probably not going to put money into something like that at this point.

2124
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:13,840
Disney wouldn't want to renegotiate it and let them make a better

2125
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,680
if the Disney's long term plan is we'll we take back Simpsons

2126
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,360
and we'll make a better Simpsons ride.

2127
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,640
They don't want universals to get better.

2128
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,840
You know, they want to get worse.

2129
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,920
And I don't believe it.

2130
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,320
Yeah, I don't think it's the situation like with Marvel in Florida,

2131
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:31,520
where Disney actually has like Disney can't get universals

2132
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,920
like they can't get Marvel rights until Universal gets rid of theirs.

2133
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:38,080
So they would have to negotiate something or universal would have to scrap the land.

2134
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:41,240
I think the Simpsons is like a hard set contract

2135
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,120
that like if Disney doesn't make a deal with them,

2136
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,480
Universal just has to get rid of it.

2137
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,160
No, Marvel was in bankruptcy preceded.

2138
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:54,320
Like, that's why they made like such a universal got such a good deal on like.

2139
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:59,880
And also this contract is forever, as long as you don't make it look like shit,

2140
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,640
as long as you keep it up.

2141
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:03,960
And I love it's bordering the Mississippi.

2142
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,960
It's like on this side of the Mississippi, you guys get Spider-Man

2143
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,000
on the other side of the Mississippi.

2144
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,800
We we can have Spider-Man in Disneyland.

2145
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,560
Yeah, they should go all the way up.

2146
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,160
They could build along the bank of the Mississippi,

2147
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:20,760
not on the other side, which is like there's legal precedent

2148
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,160
that is like been used before.

2149
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,760
But it is so funny and old fashioned to say.

2150
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,000
But when people talk like now on this side of the Mississippi,

2151
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,600
this will be the law.

2152
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,840
We're on this side.

2153
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,040
No, Tony Stark on the east side of the Mississippi.

2154
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,640
West side it goes.

2155
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,920
Yes, he's fine.

2156
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,360
I'll say one thing that I don't want to forget about,

2157
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,560
that I wanted to pay this ride a compliment.

2158
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,640
The simplicity of just calling it the Simpsons ride,

2159
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,480
which is what most park guests would probably just call it anyway,

2160
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,320
even if it was called like the Simpsons, Colin journey to Krustyland or whatever.

2161
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,960
Everyone just say, oh, let's just do let's go on the Simpsons ride.

2162
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,200
Let's do Star Wars.

2163
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,000
Yeah.

2164
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,960
The branding at the time was the Simpsons ride, the Simpsons movie,

2165
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,000
the Simpsons game.

2166
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,080
They were all on the same page with all that stuff.

2167
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:07,680
That per yeah, that's perfect.

2168
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:10,440
I'm I'm glad they went on the simplicity instead of like

2169
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,920
whatever the full name of Web, a Spider-Man adventure is or whatever.

2170
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:20,000
Like, yeah, yeah, it's Web slingers, but then even Web stands for something.

2171
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,160
And well, the Worldwide Engineering Brigade, of course.

2172
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,560
You know, of course.

2173
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:29,040
No. Well, if I have two big compliments, I want to give to them, though,

2174
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,520
for the detail they get at, especially the Hollywood one,

2175
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,240
that VIP Krusty room is the greatest.

2176
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,960
Like, I love it so much.

2177
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,080
And it's only in Hollywood.

2178
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,040
It's not in Orlando.

2179
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,720
That's why Hollywood's the best, because like that,

2180
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,680
because the other areas to sit around in, like the clearest area is fine.

2181
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,720
Fun. And the Krusty burger feels like a crappy Krusty burger.

2182
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,880
Like, so it's well done.

2183
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,400
But that VIP room, like there's a life size Gabbo.

2184
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:59,400
There's pictures from Krusty when he was a kid, like as a Jewish clown.

2185
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:03,600
There's and the best part is there are original drawings

2186
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,960
of Simpson caricatures all over the walls,

2187
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:09,400
and they are signed by the artist who did them, because

2188
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:13,880
thanks to a rule in Simpson's licensing from day one,

2189
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:17,840
any drawing of the Simpsons has to have Matt Groening's name next to it.

2190
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,560
And it was for a good reason, because he's like he knew

2191
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,920
guys like Jack Kirby got fucked over.

2192
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,160
And he's like, no, everybody has to know Matt Groening made the Simpsons.

2193
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,280
I'm the creator. You're not taking that away from me.

2194
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,240
But an unfortunate downside to that is artists,

2195
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:34,280
when they draw a drawing of the Simpsons, that's official.

2196
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:37,160
Matt Groening's name has to be next to it and not their signature.

2197
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,080
But in the Krusty VIP room, when you're in that room,

2198
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,480
you know Mike B.

2199
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:46,320
Anderson drew that drawing or there's a drawing of Mindy by David Silverman.

2200
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:50,000
Or David Silverman's drawing of Krusty with a cigar is so great.

2201
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,840
They're all they're all the artists own style, not the house style of Simpsons.

2202
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:59,040
And like I've spent a whole hour in there just like looking at every drawing

2203
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,760
and going, oh, that artist, they came out in season five

2204
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,320
and now they finally got to draw this.

2205
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:06,320
Like it's it's just amazing. I love that room.

2206
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,080
It feels like Disney would not allow that.

2207
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,280
You know, running the park.

2208
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,600
That is, those are off brand.

2209
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,640
Those are not the figures you can buy and, you know, the things you grew up with.

2210
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,600
These are just different.

2211
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,240
Yeah, that's cool.

2212
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:20,440
I mean, all the stuff in that room, including those sketches and stuff,

2213
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,280
I like I want to own.

2214
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,800
Like, yeah, like I like the get that Gabbo doll, the original art.

2215
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,600
Like it's a dream like a collector's dream in that room.

2216
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:38,560
I had heard a story that one of the artists who had their art displayed in there,

2217
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,920
like it when she saw it debuted, they they were in tears of just like,

2218
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,360
my name is never appear next to the Simpsons art.

2219
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:50,000
I'm so happy. Like, yeah, this is a tale I had heard.

2220
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,520
But incredible.

2221
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:52,360
That's great.

2222
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:55,760
Speaking of Matt, sorry, Mike mentioned wanting to buy Gabbo.

2223
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,040
I was not impressed by the gift shop.

2224
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,280
It felt like all the Simpsons stuff you could buy at Target,

2225
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,520
with the exception of like, of course, you're going to buy the board license play.

2226
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,680
It's one of the best jokes ever written for television.

2227
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:08,000
I bought one. I think, Henry, you bought three in your lifetime.

2228
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,960
They break every time.

2229
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,640
I mean, they they're not they're not the toughest of of keychains.

2230
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:17,120
But I should be able to buy a Gabbo, a Gabbo doll or something like

2231
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:19,200
there needs to be better exclusive merchandise.

2232
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,320
It's just I mean, frankly, no offense to your teacher, Henry.

2233
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:23,720
The teacher designs need some work. Sure, sure.

2234
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,640
Well, then the other shirts they got there just like they don't have

2235
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,000
the universal logo on them.

2236
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,360
They don't scream universal Simpson shirt.

2237
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,080
It's like, what's the shirt with Homer on it?

2238
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,400
I could buy that at like Target.

2239
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,760
Like, what's what makes it special? Yeah.

2240
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,360
The donut, the big donut is good.

2241
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,320
It was not until I heard your episode, guys, that I realized they were actually made

2242
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,640
there and they're fresh, right? They are delicious.

2243
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:46,520
I love I love the one I go all Homer.

2244
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,320
The last time I was there, went full Homer and was like, no,

2245
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,560
I need the one with bacon on it.

2246
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,520
The maple bacon variant.

2247
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:53,320
Oh, wow. I haven't tried that.

2248
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,040
How is that? Yeah.

2249
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:59,400
And back to this, I guess, my same point, I think also with the merch

2250
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:06,840
like Harry Potter and then Star Wars have sort of like set a new bar for merch, too.

2251
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,880
So like Simpsons feels like it's stuck in old theme park merch.

2252
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:15,000
And I guess Simpsons in general, like there hasn't been anything that crazy obscure.

2253
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,960
We were talking about a little bit about the toys, like there's itchy

2254
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,320
and scratchy robots from itch and scratchy land toys coming out

2255
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:22,880
from a company called Super 7.

2256
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,760
But like that's starting to get hardcore for like the stuff we would all want.

2257
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:34,160
I mean, I complement who I salute, whatever person at Universal

2258
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:37,480
got them to do the board license plates there to like to sell.

2259
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,960
Because if you didn't give a shit like everybody was like, well, yeah,

2260
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,720
why we sell the name board on this?

2261
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,560
It's like a joke. One person knows probably who cares.

2262
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,120
But like it was made.

2263
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,960
The decision was made clearly by some fan who would know

2264
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:54,600
if we are selling things with people's names on them, there has to be a board

2265
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,960
to there and you will sell more of those than any normal name you have. Yeah.

2266
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:04,200
Yeah, I think with the release of those kind of obscure figures

2267
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,960
like Pucci and the robots, I feel like we're at least five years away

2268
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,840
from figures based on memes.

2269
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,840
Like you can buy the Homer disappearing to the bushes playset.

2270
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,600
You can buy the actual luncheon between Skinner and Chalmers

2271
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,080
with a plate of steamed hams.

2272
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,800
I feel like they're going in that direction.

2273
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:24,000
They realize because SpongeBob figures, you can buy the images that have been me.

2274
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,920
You can buy the figures based on those images.

2275
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,280
Yes, that that'll happen soon. Yeah.

2276
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:32,760
Yeah, because they they sell a Wolverine action figure now looking

2277
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:36,120
lying on a bed in his full outfit, looking at a photo.

2278
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,840
Yes, they need the all the weird scramblings of the dud.

2279
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,200
Every like

2280
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,400
of the man and meme dud.

2281
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,560
Yeah, good.

2282
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,840
I feel like some of this too, the merch quality is

2283
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:55,200
one of the things in theme parks like food is like cyclical where it like,

2284
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,760
oh, it gets fine for a lot.

2285
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,160
Like I was down at Disney World in the fall and there was some great

2286
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,920
throwback stuff for the anniversary, but otherwise,

2287
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:08,520
a lot of the merch offerings were looking pretty stale.

2288
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,680
They're pretty same.

2289
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,040
So and then a few years later that switches and they get really specific

2290
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,320
and interesting in the Quickie Mart gift shop.

2291
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,920
They have like, oh, this is, you know, a bunch of toys on the shelf.

2292
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:26,440
But then on the design on the shelf on the side is a picture of Ham Ahoy,

2293
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,600
the food Homer bought in the store.

2294
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,960
I was like, OK, you know the reference, a ham ahoy.

2295
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:33,440
The next step is to sell me ham ahoy.

2296
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,120
Like you need to actually sell me.

2297
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:36,840
But I want Jesus H Rice.

2298
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,440
Yeah. A big bag.

2299
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:42,400
I would for sure buy tub to know whatever is in tub

2300
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,960
with like a bunch of bees, if I recall correctly.

2301
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,640
I'm trying to I mean, like

2302
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:53,320
it just occurred to me what I would buy if anybody has a like this would be

2303
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:54,720
my ultimate Simpsons thing.

2304
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:57,320
And this isn't well, it's not ultimate because it's so simple.

2305
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:01,520
But if I saw it in a theme park for even like for like two expensive theme park

2306
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,480
prizes, I would definitely buy an inanimate carbon rod.

2307
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:06,800
Oh, yeah.

2308
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,360
I want to the park triumphantly holding just this green stick.

2309
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,920
I'd be really, yeah, stupidly proud of myself.

2310
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,240
Yeah, for sure. I mean, the new that's new Super 7

2311
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:18,520
Homer's toy has the carbon rod with it.

2312
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,720
Oh, that's cool.

2313
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:22,880
So like they know what they're doing as far as we want.

2314
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,240
But that is it would be a great idea and a simple cheap thing.

2315
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,000
Yeah, they could just bang those out.

2316
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,760
It's like making drumsticks or something.

2317
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,720
Yeah, that that seems easy.

2318
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:37,240
You know, another deep reference I like in the Springfield they built is the like

2319
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,280
they didn't they make it across the land, not Duff Gardens,

2320
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:44,120
but there's a Duff Gardens section and you do their topiaries,

2321
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:48,680
but they have the seven Duffs, like including ones they had to make up

2322
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,880
because they don't name seven in the episode.

2323
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,800
I was wondering that last time I was there, that thought occurred to me.

2324
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:56,400
Like, wait, these these are theme park original, aren't they?

2325
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,240
Yeah. And the Florida one next to the water.

2326
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,880
Very nice. Nice to hang out by. Yeah.

2327
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:06,600
And and they have they have a Dumbo rip off Kodos ride, which is like,

2328
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,160
it's fine. It's good.

2329
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,720
I I like having Kodos like yelling at me as I'm on a Dumbo ride.

2330
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:13,960
And is there custom audio for that? I never, never.

2331
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2332
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:19,000
And also the the just like on the Simpsons ride,

2333
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:23,000
this the safety direction of things by Nancy Cartwright,

2334
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,480
which she's doing like a very, you know,

2335
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:29,000
a plain voice on it that I really like.

2336
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,400
She's great in that.

2337
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:35,400
Like, yeah, that kind of so nice, it's sinister voice over that covers the

2338
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:39,040
because again, well, in both cases, you don't have scratchy

2339
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,720
and you don't have King.

2340
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,480
Both are Harry Shearer.

2341
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:45,360
But some of the only characters who are visually depicted,

2342
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,280
but you don't hear them.

2343
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,800
So you got to do something else with the audio.

2344
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,800
And Nancy Cartwright did a great why assume on the other one.

2345
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,480
But yeah, I dig that voice a lot.

2346
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:57,440
And also, you know, when you're in that waiting room watching the video screen,

2347
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:01,480
there's there's crusty memorabilia or like photos on the wall.

2348
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:05,160
Like you can see there's even one like crusty with Mac graining.

2349
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,840
That's just like an extra deep reference you can find.

2350
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,120
I don't think it's in every room.

2351
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,560
It's just like in a few of them.

2352
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,960
But I saw an Easter egg that I I've I've not stared at it.

2353
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,360
So this is right before we started.

2354
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,040
So I can't confirm it.

2355
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:23,200
But I saw that apparently waiting in line

2356
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:26,840
for Captain Dinosaur's pirate ripoff.

2357
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,520
When you burst into that room, you could see people waiting to get on the ride.

2358
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,920
And then one of those people is Steven Spielberg.

2359
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:35,360
So, oh, wow, I didn't know that.

2360
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,320
Yeah, apparently.

2361
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,320
But I didn't somebody straight.

2362
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,640
I didn't notice somebody kind of playing out.

2363
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,680
But and I thought, I wonder if that's anybody.

2364
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,040
And apparently Spielberg.

2365
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,560
So but I haven't I haven't looked at it enough to know.

2366
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:50,640
Interesting. And I like the sign gag in the ride, too, where it says like,

2367
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:55,400
send money to Universal Studios, like just this extra just like

2368
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,960
send them some extra money.

2369
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,280
I haven't given them enough today.

2370
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:58,840
Like, yeah.

2371
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,120
And then they get away with a bare ass in the ride, too.

2372
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:06,040
Well, not during the ride, but beforehand in the waiting room line

2373
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:10,760
where Barney's told to take off his scratchy costume and he's nude underneath.

2374
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,560
And so you see his butt and he's like, hey, no, put it back on.

2375
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:19,480
Like that was again, would Disney allow a butt, even Barney's cartoon, but no,

2376
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:23,120
they don't think so. They were like Darryl Hannes.

2377
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:27,560
Yeah. For theme park, it's it's subversive.

2378
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,640
And I guess that well, we we touched on a little bit.

2379
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:33,280
Truly, what what does anyone think happens in twenty twenty eight?

2380
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:36,000
Like because we're in the world.

2381
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,400
Do we get a Disney Simpsons ride?

2382
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,400
Do we get the demolition of this or is everyone too lazy to

2383
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,360
actually make any of that happen?

2384
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,360
Cinderella Man, the ride, Universal's dream finally comes true.

2385
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,600
I think it's gone.

2386
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,920
Yeah, I think it's I think I think it's time is short.

2387
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,840
So and if they have to get rid of it by twenty twenty eight,

2388
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:00,960
then it'll have to go to at least two years before.

2389
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:02,440
Maybe they get the jump on it.

2390
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:03,280
It would happen. I mean, it would.

2391
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,720
Yeah, I guess you could completely just shut it down in twenty twenty eight.

2392
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:09,200
But I would think if they want something to replace that, it could be.

2393
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:11,200
Yeah, they could they could start getting rid of it.

2394
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:14,200
What is it? What year? The twenty twenty in three years, three or four years.

2395
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,120
These. Yeah.

2396
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:19,040
When I was watching the clips of the animation you see in line,

2397
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:22,480
I was thinking what I'm watching here was in 2008.

2398
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:26,680
Fourteen years ago, 14 years before 2008 was 1994.

2399
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,520
We were in like season five of The Simpsons.

2400
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:32,520
So watching these 2008 clips makes you think this is a different era of the show.

2401
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,160
The show doesn't look like this anymore.

2402
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:36,080
None of the actors sound like this anymore.

2403
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,680
They wouldn't do some of these jokes anymore.

2404
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,640
So already it feels kind of out of date.

2405
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,360
Just just the 2D footage in line and, you know, the 3D footage is different.

2406
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:46,880
But I feel like they can't make new footage.

2407
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:51,160
So I don't see it sticking around past the expiration date. Yeah.

2408
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:55,000
You know, the theory I had, the only way I could

2409
02:00:56,280 --> 02:01:00,600
imagine that they'd get to keep it or that Disney would be if like Disney decided,

2410
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:05,120
well, this wouldn't make as much money or it doesn't fit in Disneyland or whatever.

2411
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:10,400
Or if it was like some trade they make with with Universal, like, OK, you know what?

2412
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,200
If you give us back Orlando Spider-Man,

2413
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:16,000
you can keep Simpsons for another decade or something.

2414
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:17,720
Oh, no way. No way.

2415
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:20,440
Spider-Man, Spider-Man has a much higher

2416
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,160
favorability rating, I think, compared to this.

2417
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:26,800
Yeah. Or that or Jason, you're just mad that that even the suggestion.

2418
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,280
I'm also mad at that.

2419
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,560
Don't even say it out loud.

2420
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,760
But I think it's like if you burrow down and you read about guest satisfaction,

2421
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,720
that is like in the top five.

2422
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,720
I think the deal, though, what you're saying deal wise.

2423
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:43,360
Yes, Henry, that's probably that would be the only way is if Disney

2424
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:47,760
could figure out what they felt was valuable enough to allow them to continue.

2425
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,920
So like, I guess that, yeah, that is possible.

2426
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,440
They could trade.

2427
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:55,800
Al, who who's the equivalent of like Al Michaels, who got traded for Oswald?

2428
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:57,400
The lucky. Right.

2429
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:01,120
Like Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, like if Hoda gets.

2430
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:05,880
Yeah, Hoda gets traded to Disney or so, like maybe they'll allow.

2431
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:09,520
Yeah. Hoda on Good Morning America would elevate that.

2432
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,960
Like those would both be gets for Good Morning America.

2433
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,600
They're still pumping out George Stephanopoulos content.

2434
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:20,000
So, right. But you know, you know where I would stick Springfield in a Disney

2435
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,800
if they took it back is like the in DCA,

2436
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:30,240
where the right by the Guardians ride is just nothing, just nothing.

2437
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:33,920
And like, yes, Springfield could fit there.

2438
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:39,160
And I bet Disney, I think 10 years ago when they built the Springfield,

2439
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:43,200
like nine years ago, that was as good as they could do it.

2440
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,280
Then they did a great job.

2441
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:47,400
I feel like Disney, if they cared, could do it better.

2442
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,760
And I would like to see what they would do. Oh, yeah.

2443
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,880
And that's great.

2444
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:57,280
And DCA would fit too, because like you can't have a no beer Simpsons land.

2445
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,080
Right. And and I don't see them doing

2446
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:03,720
breaking the Disneyland beer rule a second time for Simpsons

2447
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,800
that they already did in Star Wars.

2448
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,360
Yeah, I would. It's a good question.

2449
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,720
It's a good point.

2450
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:10,920
Maybe even because if you look at that Disneyland forward,

2451
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,960
which is their proposal, like there would be like a bridge

2452
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:17,320
and that would lead to more California adventure even to if they

2453
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,600
ended up doing like something over there, maybe

2454
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,240
entirely new Springfield next to Pandora would be so funny.

2455
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,560
That's a great theme park. Yeah.

2456
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:29,200
I don't care about the blend.

2457
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,840
Just throw them together.

2458
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:32,200
Those are both great.

2459
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,760
What are you doing, Disney World?

2460
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,520
Because I think that's a really good point about the beer.

2461
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:41,120
And I don't think Epcot makes sense, but you can't put all the new shit into

2462
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,200
Hollywood Studios.

2463
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:42,920
It's Hollywood Studios.

2464
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:46,880
Hollywood Studios can't be entirely lines with 70 minute waits

2465
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,360
with no small things to do. Yeah.

2466
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:50,520
They're running out of room there.

2467
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,640
It's got to be there, though.

2468
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:54,400
Yeah. Maybe you like, do you keep going?

2469
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:58,800
Do you build into a parking lot where like past Rock and Roller,

2470
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:04,080
where Lightning McQueen show is now just like entirely new stuff?

2471
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:06,480
Or they demolish Indiana Jones.

2472
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:07,720
But I guess they own that.

2473
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:09,320
And stars and Star Tours.

2474
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,360
I don't know that they're I don't know.

2475
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:13,360
Thankfully, nobody's dying to get Star Tours out of anywhere.

2476
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:15,200
Right. If they don't like it.

2477
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,520
I guess Star Tours is a theater.

2478
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,200
Star Tours is a theater.

2479
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,880
They could rescan if they just wanted to make Simpsons

2480
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,600
another rescan instead of a new ride.

2481
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,040
Just throw the same video in it.

2482
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,680
Yeah. Well, that's the thing.

2483
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,560
Like we you can blue sky it.

2484
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:32,520
But I think the issue with it ever being in Disney is that like,

2485
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,480
we know what they're doing lately.

2486
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:38,320
Like there's now we're getting and post the covid and everything.

2487
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:40,920
It's like there's going to be one amazing ride, I think,

2488
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,480
once every five years again.

2489
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,320
Yeah, I don't think that they're going to like go all out.

2490
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:47,840
I think at best you get a reskin.

2491
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,080
Yeah. I mean, so they do anything.

2492
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,280
Like, let's talk like real quick.

2493
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:51,800
Talk about this.

2494
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:54,320
Like I and I think I mentioned what probably my vote is, like,

2495
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,720
if you were building the ride now, I think from what I know about

2496
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:01,480
Runaway Railway, that's probably the way to go with.

2497
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,720
Oh, yes. True.

2498
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:06,160
To try to get to try to make it feel like you're immersed in the actual cartoon.

2499
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,880
Because like, even though I would like robots,

2500
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,280
I think you still run into the problem that the 3D models never quite look right.

2501
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,480
And I can't imagine that robots

2502
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:18,320
would look correct either in like a large scale.

2503
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,360
But maybe I don't know.

2504
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:24,600
Unless like summer robots, if it was a blend, because how great would it be to see

2505
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,920
if you could think of a reason to have the robotic itchy and scratchy

2506
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:32,920
going haywire like some itchy and scratchy land stuff would definitely

2507
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,840
make me more OK with a new thing.

2508
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:38,840
I'd say anything from that episode. I'd be so excited.

2509
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:43,240
They could make it like a horror ride through itchy and scratchy land

2510
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,960
as the robots go nuts.

2511
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,480
I mean, that would be amazing.

2512
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:49,880
And then they got to do the characters have to do all the stuff

2513
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:53,360
they do in the video game, like Marge has to attack robots.

2514
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,360
That's a good idea.

2515
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:58,960
I want all that original arcade stuff to be physicalized.

2516
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,720
Yeah, that's a great idea.

2517
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,760
And that's also a great idea for toys.

2518
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,680
Have Marge, they all have to have their weapons.

2519
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,200
Video game. Yeah, totally.

2520
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:11,800
Yeah, so that would be a really great video game is the the old Simpsons

2521
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:15,680
arcade game versus the old Ninja Turtles arcade game.

2522
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,080
Well, sure. I don't know why the Ninja Turtles.

2523
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,920
Why are the 90s Ninja Turtles and the Simpsons fighting?

2524
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,520
I don't know. I don't care.

2525
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:23,440
Yeah, make it happen.

2526
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,640
And Scott, you know, it's great.

2527
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:26,600
It does not matter.

2528
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:29,880
No, yeah, nobody gives no just a care.

2529
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,560
Oh, he loses power plant runoff.

2530
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:34,160
Same thing.

2531
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:36,840
They're blinking. Yeah, there you go.

2532
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:38,240
Perfect. Yeah.

2533
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,680
Hit him with the hit.

2534
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:41,880
Lisa with swords.

2535
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:46,680
I you know, I mean, also, I want I would like

2536
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:50,480
thing I love about it moving to Disney is that I

2537
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:53,880
I love the Springfield, but it doesn't match with like

2538
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:58,040
the carnival games thing that they picked as the first aesthetic for it.

2539
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:01,600
Like I I wish it was a full like, no, this is just

2540
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:04,360
Springfield or just Krustyland.

2541
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:08,960
And also, I always felt the carnival rides feel kind of like cheap, honestly.

2542
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,000
Like they just feel like a little like.

2543
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:15,440
But I love the toys you get at them because like they may

2544
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,760
they give away a dancing Homer toy I got at one of those, which like

2545
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:22,400
they don't sell us stuff to dance in Homer from the season two episode.

2546
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:26,400
Just about anywhere like they they actually get kind of obscure

2547
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:29,440
with like you can get an isotopes baseball hat, which is like

2548
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,560
they don't sell those normally or like

2549
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,800
a radioactive man, giant stuffed guy.

2550
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:35,880
They have that there too.

2551
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,360
And Blinky, they there's deep references in the toys you can get there.

2552
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,520
But I also would just like to tell Mike, here's forty dollars.

2553
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:45,680
Don't make me play the the knock over the cans game.

2554
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,960
Like I'll just give you forty dollars, please.

2555
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,720
Yeah, they don't they don't do that.

2556
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:54,520
Yeah, I would even like this wouldn't work or even like you go up to the thing

2557
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,800
and it would be confusing, but you're like, here's forty dollars.

2558
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,920
I want that. Now let me play the game.

2559
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:02,400
Yeah, everyone gets everything they want.

2560
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,800
Exactly. Like you can get the obscure thing you want.

2561
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,760
You pay them as much money as they want.

2562
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:11,160
And then you get to pretend pretend it's a bribe, like in the Carney episode.

2563
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,560
Yes. Perfect. Yes. Perfect.

2564
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,560
Yes, that would be better.

2565
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:19,480
If you say the line from the episode about like, I'm looking for my friend

2566
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,120
Mr. Bride and they like, OK, you've unlocked the secret menu here.

2567
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:25,720
There's you. Just give me forty dollars and here's the thing.

2568
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:27,880
Great. Yeah, perfect. That's right.

2569
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:30,240
They should reward deep fandom.

2570
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:33,080
Don't hide from deep fandom.

2571
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:36,040
And you guys would get rewarded most of all.

2572
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:40,480
Thank you for sharing your deep fandom and your Simpsons

2573
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,760
ride opinions with us. Hey, Bob Mackey and Henry Gilbert.

2574
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:45,400
You survived podcast the ride. Yeah.

2575
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:48,200
So we did this. So glad you can join us here.

2576
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:53,040
And stupid humans, don't you know all rides end in the gift shop?

2577
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,920
Let's let's exit through there.

2578
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,880
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2579
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,320
Oh, sure. Of course, we're on the Talking Simpsons podcast.

2580
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:00,680
We're in our seventh year of doing it.

2581
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:04,680
And currently we're on the verge of doing both seasons three and 13

2582
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:07,160
at the same time, flipping back and forth between those.

2583
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,840
You can find that all at Talking Simpsons podcast dot com and

2584
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:13,440
or look for Talking Simpsons wherever you get your podcast.

2585
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:16,080
It's that easy. And we got a lot of other stuff going on there, too.

2586
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:18,720
Yeah. And we have a ton of exclusives on Patreon.

2587
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,240
It's this is our full time job done through through Patreon.

2588
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:23,320
And so we do we talk.

2589
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:27,080
We do deep dives into Futurama and King of the Hill that are only on

2590
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:31,960
Patreon dot com slash Talking Simpsons, as well as what a cartoon podcast

2591
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:35,640
where we go super deep into non Simpsons sitcom related things.

2592
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:39,160
We did one just about Batman or the South Park movie or

2593
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,120
the Lion King, too. We just did.

2594
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:43,880
So so many fun ones.

2595
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,240
And yeah, I know. Thank you guys so much for having us.

2596
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,960
We've we've been telling you guys since we first met.

2597
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,360
You're like, you know, Simpsons, right?

2598
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:57,360
If you ever need a listener should know we've been needling you since 2018.

2599
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,240
You know what? It pays off.

2600
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:01,600
That's right.

2601
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,240
But the long play the long game.

2602
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,800
And I know, but I'm sorry how we did it.

2603
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,000
And we've had we've all had fun with you guys together and separate on the show.

2604
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,400
