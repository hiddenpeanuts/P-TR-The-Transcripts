1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,240
This episode was recorded a while ago.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,820
A simpler time with the only thing we had to worry about was a global pandemic.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,080
We again want to voice our support for the protests against police brutality going on

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,380
across the country and now across the world.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,280
The other day on Twitter, we linked to bail funds and mutual aid funds.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,660
There's also links in this episode description to go fund me pages for the family of Breonna

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,940
Taylor and Darnella Frazier, who recorded the murder of George Floyd, as well as a group

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,460
called Bean that focuses on black mental health and the National Lawyers Guild.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,620
Thank you for listening.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:47,380
Stay safe and once again, black lives matter.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,100
Ladies and gentlemen, good boys and girls.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,660
The following podcast is presented with thousands of sparkling tangents and electro podcast

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,420
electromagnetic sounds.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:22,060
It's the Main Street Electrical Parade on Podcast the Ride.

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,140
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, where if we ever decide to end the podcast, we will do

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,500
decades worth of farewell events first.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm Scott Gardner joined by via electro syntho magnetic sound, Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,560
Hey, yes, I'm here.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,360
We will pull a motley crew, a Rolling Stones, a kiss.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,220
We will threaten to retire, but never do it.

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,220
Exactly.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,220
We promise.

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,420
And Jason Sheridan is here as well.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:56,580
Every time I stop talking, I will end my sentence with I am glowing away forever, and then

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,980
I will come back a couple minutes later, probably.

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:08,260
I think I think it would up the drama of the podcast from this point if we just if we say

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:14,700
podcast the ride is glowing away sometime in the next 15 years.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,140
So this is your last.

30
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,960
This is what the episode you're listening to is one of your last chances to experience

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,460
the podcast, the ride magic.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,940
I think that's I really think we should manipulate the audience more.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,220
I think we should really play with their emotions.

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
So I think that's good.

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,260
I think we should actually just do it more aggressively, like threaten to quit, set like

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,780
because like Motley Crue just said they were going away forever and they came back and

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
it's annoying.

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,860
But it also makes a lot of money because people then feel bad and they feel like they have

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
to see us.

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,220
So from now on, every live show we do is our last show.

41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
Sure.

42
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
Yeah.

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Why not?

44
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,660
No, let's let's up the drama.

45
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,780
We can Elton John this is Elton John or like I feel like Elton John and Cher do this all

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
the time.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
Like they're kind of in a perennial.

48
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,000
They're saying goodbye.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But maybe they are.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,420
Elton is really now.

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,140
Elton claims he's really saying goodbye on this last tour.

52
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,460
I don't know about Cher.

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,860
I'm not sure about her.

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,660
The Who have retired a few times and they've come back.

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,820
There's two of them left.

56
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,460
So I think it's a common trick.

57
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,300
I mean, Jay-Z retired.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,780
I think this is also sort of part of like legend and myth making.

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,980
Michael Jordan retired.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
He's retired twice.

61
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,620
He came back.

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,020
It's part of like, you know, the legendary return is something like I never thought.

63
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Oh my God.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,500
I thought I would never be able to see Jay-Z again.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,740
I thought he'd never make another album.

66
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,260
He retired at what, 33 or something.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,580
Didn't he put out more albums post retirement, quote unquote?

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
I think that was like a midway point.

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,900
That was so long.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,660
Was that like, it was like a decade over a decade when the Main Street Parade first?

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,140
Yeah, I think it was in 1996.

72
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,940
Now he's mostly Jay-Z retired.

73
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,140
Jay-Z said he was retiring in the first track of his first album.

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,260
He's a hedge fund guy now, mostly.

75
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,940
He's mostly just managing investments now.

76
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Right.

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,380
You don't retire from that.

78
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,020
The smart move is to stick with it.

79
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Sure.

80
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

81
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
So let's get retiring.

82
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,860
And you know, today's topic, the Main Street Electrical Parade, I remember a very dramatic

83
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,940
run, the first real farewell in 96, where they were selling the bulbs.

84
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,600
That was a very like, pieces of the Berlin Wall type, own history, make sure you own

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
a bulb.

86
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,000
What do we have that would be a legitimate piece of podcast the ride history, but is

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,840
also essentially an infinite supply?

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,640
The Mason jar water glasses at Mike's house.

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Wait, hey, hey, hey, wait.

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm just going to give away glasses at my house?

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Yeah.

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
What?

93
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Mike's dishware.

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
That's infinite supply.

95
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
There's a lot of them.

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
There's like, there's like eight.

97
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
There's like eight or twelve.

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,560
You got a couple pallets in there.

99
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Infinite supply.

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Let's try.

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,480
Well, how many glasses do you have?

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
How many glasses?

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah.

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah, I don't know.

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,480
I a few in the house.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,160
I'm giving away Jason's ice cream glasses.

107
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah.

108
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
My ice cream bowl is Mike's glasses.

109
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,720
Scott's kind bars.

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Infinite supplies.

111
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Look, in quarantine times, those I'm not I'm not losing a seed of one.

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
Not a chocolate chip will be wasted.

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,440
I had as I was saying it, I think I figured out what it actually is.

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Edwin's hair.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Oh, my God.

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Edwin's shed.

117
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
It's everywhere.

119
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Yeah.

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Yeah.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Yeah.

122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
OK, great.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
So you got plenty.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
But technically, it's not infinite.

125
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,760
There just is a ton of it.

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,400
So if we find like a nice little way to package that and then send little tufts of Edwin's

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,040
hair to our fans so that they can say goodbye to us, because, yeah, it's sometimes in the

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
next several decades.

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,600
But guess the ride is over.

130
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,360
It's blowing away forever.

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,840
I have to say selling the bulbs I thought was a very candy move and a ten dollars a

132
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,120
bulb.

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,440
That's a pretty affordable souvenir by Disney standards.

134
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
But it was the 90s.

135
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
It was the night.

136
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,040
I mean, I think today those are going for, you know, if they if they did it new now,

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,520
they'd be like 45 each.

138
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh, and flipped.

139
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Flipped immediately.

140
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah.

141
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Were they actually the bulbs or were they other bulbs made to look like the bulbs?

142
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Do we know?

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,920
I don't know that they could have been the bulbs because I think the bulbs were pretty

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
specific.

145
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,560
They were definitely weren't just bought at the store because we'll get into the history

146
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
of it.

147
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,920
But at the time, the more popular type of electric bulb of Christmas bulb was like they

148
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
were much bigger.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
I saw it described as thumb sized.

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
It's like, you know, what's still at my parents house.

151
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,760
And then at some point, smaller lights came in vogue.

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,840
But at the time they were doing this, they were pretty specifically from Michigan Avenue

153
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
in Chicago.

154
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,320
So like a company gave them the bulbs.

155
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,280
So truly, that is a little bit historic if you're getting the bulbs from the 70s that

156
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,960
had to be hand dipped before the parade began.

157
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
That's not too bad.

158
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,240
But I wonder if at this point they just like went and bought a ton of bulbs at Dome Depot

159
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
or whatever.

160
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
Yeah. And you never you did not own a bulb.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,080
I never bought a bulb.

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,960
I was definitely very aware of the the first glow away, the first farewell season.

163
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,840
Right. And I wondered if I should have.

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,560
But I never that would have been a apparent pester.

165
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,040
And I did not do that pester.

166
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
Have we looked on eBay to see what those bulbs might be going for?

167
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
No, that's a good move.

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,040
You want to check already on it?

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:08,680
The original 96 bulbs, which in theory could be from the 70s or it's all the biggest scam

170
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
they ever pulled. I don't know.

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,720
I have to say, I think that's like growing up with it like growing up on the East Coast,

172
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,520
I've been going to Disney World.

173
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,960
I remember this parade.

174
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,360
Spectro Magic definitely made a bigger, more upsetting impression in my mind.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,720
But I think in my head when I was younger, it was like there's always a nighttime light

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,640
parade. And in fact, this parade inspired by the Electric Water Pageant, which looms

177
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,560
larger in my mind as like a a regular Disney world go where you always had to make a night

178
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
of like, oh, we have to make sure we're by the Magic Kingdom or go to the Polynesian

179
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,040
or something and see the Electric Water Pageant boat parade.

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
That is a question I had.

181
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,600
Is it are you guys as steeped in the Main Street Electrical Parade not having Disneyland

182
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
as your as your main park?

183
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,400
Well, in nostalgia wise, yeah, it was the doll face.

184
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Spectro men were more of the thing I remembered because of Disney World, because I never

185
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,840
went to Disneyland. So it's more of this parade is more of like myth.

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,960
It's myth to me. I've seen it at this point now, the newer, the newest version of it.

187
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,760
But it was not something directly from my childhood.

188
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,080
This version we're like focusing on today.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
I forgot that was the case for me.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,960
My first trip was, I forget, 87 or 88.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,760
I mean, it's like it might be one of the first things in my life I remember.

192
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Like I remember my POV and I remember I really loved Pete's Dragon already.

193
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,560
So seeing the dragon in the parade, I mean, that might have been like the Disney

194
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,480
character I was the most excited to see just because that was the tape I had arbitrarily.

195
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm not as fond of it anymore.

196
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,480
But truly, I like I remember hearing that first note.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,440
I remember the vocoder and I remember the dragon going by.

198
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,520
It's like a really indelible memory from the first Disney trip,

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,880
which obviously left a gigantic crater of an impression.

200
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,240
And I can only imagine people, you know,

201
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
people's memories of it from the 70s and 80s.

202
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
I don't know.

203
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm glad it made it to myth point for you, regardless of not having had that

204
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,520
that baby brain moment that I that I had.

205
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Well, I mean, the music, I think I knew the music before anything else,

206
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,600
because the other thing is every parade samples that music, seemingly

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
every nighttime parade after it uses snippets of it.

208
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,600
The Pete's Dragon, especially that one is interesting just because it's probably

209
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,760
one of the more spectacular floats.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,320
And it's funny because like that was supposed to be a temporary

211
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,040
like movie promotional 70s float that wasn't supposed to be permanent.

212
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,960
And it just stuck around.

213
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,560
Yeah, yeah, it's very odd, like a very sign of the times thing

214
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,120
that now is this kind of permanent place that Pete's Dragon has in the parks

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,800
that it probably would not have otherwise.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,160
I don't know that there'd be any representation of Pete's Dragon.

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
No. Should there be?

218
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,080
I don't know.

219
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,800
Well, nowadays, kids are all about the live action

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
Robert Redford starring Pete's Dragon, right?

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,840
We're all watching and thinking about that live action version constantly.

222
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,120
Of course, I definitely remember that Robert Redford was in it.

223
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,000
I for sure was aware of that before you said it just now.

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,520
Did that come out 10 years ago or last year?

225
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,080
I don't know. I'm not sure.

226
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,960
It could be either.

227
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,000
The answer really in the nether realm.

228
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,280
The answer to the bulb question on eBay is that you can get a bulb

229
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,720
for like 30 bucks, 35 bucks.

230
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,880
OK, 30. Yeah, it's not an unreasonable markup, I wouldn't say.

231
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,760
And it comes in a little like box with that says Main Street

232
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,040
Electrical Parade also with a little like triangle shape.

233
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,680
So it doesn't seem like it's that hard to come by.

234
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,240
Some of them are a little more expensive,

235
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,960
but I'm not sure if it's like their special.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,240
Maybe it was like Pete's like dragon, like the eyeball of the dragon or something.

237
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,320
That would be a extra expensive bulb, I assume.

238
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,080
This is from the A in to honor America.

239
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,760
One of the stripes.

240
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,520
It's the point of the A.

241
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
It's the peak.

242
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
One of the stars on the stars and stripes.

243
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,760
One of the states.

244
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,280
I mean, yeah, that's that's that's crucial.

245
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, it represents Tennessee specifically.

246
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,120
Oh, it's worth a more important 100 grand.

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,320
Yeah, they should have like geo tracked them somehow.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,600
But I found it so I find it so funny that they did this and they sold all the

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,560
but and then just like this thing was back so quickly.

250
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,240
I feel like it never really went away for that

251
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,160
much time, and it's sort of been in others, been versions in other parks.

252
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,120
If you guys had would it have been I actually I honestly don't

253
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
know this, I should have done this research.

254
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Was it in Disney World before Spectrum Magic?

255
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,840
Oh, that's a good question.

256
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,920
I need to the timeline is so confusing to me and I looked at it.

257
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Jason, you have an answer.

258
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,120
Yeah, I have. The answer is yes.

259
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,320
It ran in the Magic Kingdom from 77 to 91.

260
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,800
And then Spectrum Magic

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,000
debuted after that, and then it came back to the Magic Kingdom in 99 to 2001

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,560
and then came back to the Magic Kingdom from 2010 to 2016.

263
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,080
Wow.

264
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Oh, yeah. It's I mean, it is like a world tour.

265
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,000
They start shipping it back and forth.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,720
Yeah, it is so Paris, Tokyo.

267
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,920
I mean, they built other versions for it.

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
California Adventure, my favorite California Adventure.

269
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
I'll try to hold this up to the camera when they change the drum to say

270
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,280
a California classic like

271
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,840
come on, guys.

272
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,040
That's a that's a weak tie together for sure.

273
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,840
A bizarre way to explain why it's there.

274
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,320
Hey, and you know, it ended up in in Manhattan, too.

275
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,640
But I'll save that one.

276
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, that's one of the odder events that is.

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The shit is wild.

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah, really.

279
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,640
It may have happened.

280
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
We twice.

281
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,040
Why? Well, we'll see.

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
Then we'll hear. We'll save it.

283
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,360
Yeah, let's let's try to go about this in an orderly fashion.

284
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
I mean, like, what do we do?

285
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,760
Should we sort of talk through the history of it?

286
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,560
I mean, Jason, you were talking about the electric water pageant

287
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,640
a little bit, which was its predecessor in in pretty much every way.

288
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Yeah. I mean, this is one where one of my favorite

289
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,880
characters of the the Disney executive board of hunks, Cardwalker, shows up.

290
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
He you know, they were they were debuting the electric water.

291
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,760
They showed the electric water pageant

292
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,960
a on the seven seas lagoon in the Magic Kingdom.

293
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,840
And that was really that was another thing that like that wasn't supposed

294
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,000
to last a long time, but everyone liked it.

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
So they just kept it around.

296
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,320
And while they while they showed that there were like Disneyland reps there.

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,120
And I think the company edict was like, hey,

298
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,000
we we need to do some stuff for Disneyland, too.

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
We need to have some stuff there.

300
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,840
It can't just we can't just be throwing everything in Florida.

301
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,040
So some some.

302
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Yeah, because it's early 70s.

303
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Yeah. So like all the all company resources are going to Disney World.

304
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,240
And yeah, and I saw it explained to that they were doing a lot of concerts.

305
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,680
They were doing quick promotions like that.

306
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,400
But concerts are ultimately cost prohibitive

307
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,600
and only like some of the guests in the park in a given day can go see it.

308
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,960
So is there something that everybody can see leading to?

309
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,520
I forget the quote from who, but somebody somebody saying,

310
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,760
why can't we make Main Street our stage?

311
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Why isn't it? Can there be a like a great nighttime moving concert essentially?

312
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
This is also like the technology was at the right time.

313
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,840
Nickel cadmium batteries play a big role.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Play a big role in this parade.

315
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,320
These like little portable batteries

316
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,720
that had enough juice to light all this stuff up for one go of the parade

317
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,120
and then get it backstage and recharge it for the second go of the parade.

318
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,280
That is so insane that they yeah, they could,

319
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,080
because if you've ever seen a parade at Disneyland or in a Magic Kingdom,

320
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,520
yeah, you know it like parade.

321
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,160
I forget the order, but it'll be like a parade leaves from the small world area,

322
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,040
travels south to Main Street.

323
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,320
Then there's another parade where it goes backwards.

324
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,080
And then there I guess that's the order, because then it gets stored up

325
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,160
up north up in the storage area in the northern part of the park.

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,640
So that that's a parade that is entirely about electricity

327
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,200
will not have any electricity if they don't charge every single battery

328
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,960
really, really fast.

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,440
That's like an yeah, it's like I'm trying to think the most power

330
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,360
sucking charging situation where it's like you're running all your apps

331
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,320
on the iPhone at once and like I just ruin the battery after an hour.

332
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,200
Like it's just it's crazy.

333
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
I really you would think that was like it would just be a panic

334
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,800
once all the parade floats got back there.

335
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, yeah, truly.

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,960
And you know, I should say that's that's not how it runs today.

337
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Right. It's just like in its janky 70s,

338
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,600
you know, formation, that's how it had to happen.

339
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,560
But I I also like seeing the breakdown of what they considered

340
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,280
because, you know, they they like this idea.

341
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,200
I think, you know, the the electric water pageant

342
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,920
was essentially a mainstream electrical parade, but on barges

343
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,200
like it's going along a lake.

344
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
So presumably there's just big power units like there would be on on any boat.

345
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
But in doing much smaller, more mobile

346
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,760
you know, little floats, how are we going to charge these things?

347
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,480
So there was talk of gas generators, but they make too much noise

348
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,760
and produce too many fumes,

349
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,520
a lot extension cords they went through.

350
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,080
But they would create trip and fall hazards very true.

351
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,000
Like where? Yeah, where are extension cords coming from?

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,320
The characters would have to run on a giant wheel to power it

353
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,120
like a hamster wheel.

354
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,200
Cinderella would be running with the mice.

355
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,600
Every character has one of those radios

356
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,400
that you charge with a hand crank to play.

357
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,240
Oh, down.

358
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,800
Everything is out of sync.

359
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,240
It just sounds like a horrible cacophony.

360
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
They're all just rubbing sticks together, kindling,

361
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,920
trying to create sparks.

362
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, they're very, you know, this parade steps.

363
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,040
There could just be like a train's like a coal based engine on each

364
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,840
each float.

365
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,240
You have to show characters just shoveling hot coals into an engine.

366
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,040
You know, we're trying to bring coal back.

367
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
It's tight right now.

368
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Twenty twenty is the best time to bring coal back.

369
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
And I think Disney is the place to do it.

370
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Clean coal, clean coal, clean, clean.

371
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,240
We're going to take it.

372
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
We're going to clean it and then it's going to be clean.

373
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,880
And then it's clean coal, cleanest of all.

374
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I mean, to be fair, all the presidents have said the phrase clean coal.

375
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,280
I don't know why.

376
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,480
What the hell?

377
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,880
Cinderella is going to take the coal.

378
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,000
She's going to clean the coal and it's going to be clean coal.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
We understand.

380
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,280
Just as Disney pivoted during World War two to making

381
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
government propaganda and educational films,

382
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,840
Disney during Corona in order to get a financial like bailout

383
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,200
bridge loan has to start making clean coal, like like new ducktails.

384
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,600
David Tennant Scrooge McDuck has to talk about clean coal.

385
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,560
It's just a giant five minute ads in every episode.

386
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,160
But you know, Launchpad is a financial decision.

387
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,440
They have to take like a train ride and launch was like, gee,

388
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,200
did you know Scrooge, this was a clean coal.

389
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
It's really safe.

390
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,480
Return to like me could get to work in factories again.

391
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,360
I think I'm going to go get a job shoveling clean coal.

392
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,120
Star Wars, the Clone Wars, the final season, the search for clean coal.

393
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,480
The that's a lot of the delay in Avatar is they're having to shift

394
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,520
the philosophy like unobtainium is out and coal is in.

395
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:03,440
The Navi have agreed to this is this is the way of the future.

396
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
And we are going to start building.

397
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,080
Yeah, you know, fuck these trees.

398
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,880
Fuck the Hallelujah Mountains. Time to drill.

399
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,240
They no longer fly banshees. They roll coal.

400
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,440
They have the lifted pickup trucks run on coal.

401
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,000
Joe Rody is now doing the expansion of Avatar land

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,560
that's just based around coal and coal mountains,

403
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,040
large mountains full of coal.

404
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,640
And we first find coal in the myth of Santa Claus.

405
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,800
And everyone loves Santa Claus.

406
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,680
Santa Claus is a part of everyone's childhood.

407
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,360
And, you know, if we can if we can trust him, then we can trust coal.

408
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
Joe Rody has stopped wearing like his trademark, like hat

409
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,920
and vest and stuff, and just now has one of those T-shirts that says like,

410
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,240
don't mess with an Imagineer who was born in February and has a giant earring.

411
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
What?

412
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
There was like algorithm T-shirts that are really specific.

413
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,160
You ever seen those? Probably. OK.

414
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,400
Do you know he was born in February or is that?

415
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,360
No, that's just a guess.

416
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,040
You don't celebrate Joe Rody's birthday specifically. No, no.

417
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,240
Perhaps we all should. Yeah, we should.

418
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,200
I just watched a

419
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
one of these great channels that just uploads every

420
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,360
like piece of promotional material.

421
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,040
It might be cow missing on YouTube posted

422
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,480
footage of like the announcement of Animal Kingdom when they were still

423
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,240
calling it Wild Animal Kingdom.

424
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,280
And Rody does a presentation and he looks pretty much like he does today,

425
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,960
except in a very Eisner esque suit, like a double breasted with a big thick tie.

426
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,480
You know, he really dresses like Bruce Wayne.

427
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,840
He dresses like Val Kilmer, Bruce Wayne,

428
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,840
but still has the big curly mustache.

429
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,840
Do you think there was in like towards the end of Michael Eisner's reign, a CEO.

430
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,000
He wanted everyone to dress like him.

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,800
That's it very much felt to me like if it wasn't enforced on his part,

432
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,160
then he gave Rody unsolicited fashion advice.

433
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,120
Or like he'd call the Imagineers into the office and he'd be like, look, here's a deal.

434
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,880
I want to make some changes around here.

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,360
I've ordered a suit in exactly your size.

436
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
It's over sitting in my closet.

437
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,800
I'd like you to go over and I'd like you to wear this from now on when you're in public.

438
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,280
You did that to everything.

439
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
There's this thing, Magic Eye.

440
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,200
All the kids love it.

441
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
I want every tie to have a pattern like Magic Eye.

442
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,400
I want people to stare at your tie for hours on end

443
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,920
to enjoy the three dimensional spaces on your tie.

444
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,840
I've invested in all people into doing your bidding.

445
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,200
If you hypnotize them with the Magic Eye pattern on your tie,

446
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,640
I invested over three billion dollars into a Magic Eye company.

447
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,560
He spent more time focused on that Magic Eye company

448
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,680
than he did all of California Adventure.

449
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,760
He should have bought Magic Eye when he was CEO of Disney.

450
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
That's shocking.

451
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,400
That's shocking.

452
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,160
Don't have been the Eiger move.

453
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,480
They're like the Eiger, you know,

454
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,800
all of the biggest properties of the time.

455
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,960
Should have bought that. Should have bought big dog shirts.

456
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,600
Stussy.

457
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,240
Big Johnson shirts.

458
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,720
Please welcome the newest member of the Disney family, pissing Calvin.

459
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,920
That's an empire.

460
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Yeah, really.

461
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,560
They would be unstoppable now.

462
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,800
I like to praise him, but he missed out on the biggest purchasing opportunities of 96.

463
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Although the Disney company did put through some, was it Hollywood Pictures?

464
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,720
I think they did put out the Jerky Boys movie.

465
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,440
Really? Wow.

466
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,680
I think so. I think technically, yes, I believe Jerky Boys is Disney.

467
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,320
Wow. And I was wanting to type Jersey Boys, but that's not right.

468
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,920
Well, because that's you like that.

469
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,880
That's the real music back when they made real music.

470
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Back when we made that sound, our sound.

471
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,040
Ah, Jerky Boys, the movie

472
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,520
Touchstone, Touchstone Pictures in 95.

473
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,200
So in the same little run of time, Disney put out Jerky Boys, the movie and its Pat.

474
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,400
Oh, my God. Those are Disney plus now.

475
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,560
Yeah, I know. Really stuck it on board right now as we're recording.

476
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,040
Yeah. Where the hell is that?

477
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah, they got to loosen the standards.

478
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,040
Come on. They're sitting on so many.

479
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes. I've never seen the Jerky Boys movie.

480
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,680
Neither have I. As of the time, I was too scandalized by them at the time.

481
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
So like the Jerky Boys could show up in a Star Wars movie.

482
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,480
Absolutely. The dream.

483
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,520
Or a Marvel movie.

484
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,360
As could the three ninjas.

485
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,320
Oh, yeah. As could Captain Ron.

486
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,360
Yeah. Yeah. As could Mikey from Life with Mikey.

487
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,720
Wow. They are making as could cabin boy.

488
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,880
They're making no use of the Touchstone 90s properties.

489
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,880
Captain Ron should come back.

490
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,040
And with Castle.

491
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,840
Yeah, that one's due for the kind of reboot

492
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,360
where everyone forgets that the first one wasn't good.

493
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we're so don't think about it.

494
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,520
Don't think about it.

495
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's epic.

496
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,960
Captain Ron is back.

497
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,480
Kurt Russell is returning to pass the torch to the new generation of captains.

498
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,480
OMG, epic.

499
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,280
Three ninjas to three ninjas should come back.

500
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,600
That's shocking.

501
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,920
Three ninjas has not been announced.

502
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Yeah, we're going to get around all these.

503
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,600
Well, in the post Corona spending spree,

504
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
they're just they're just going to cycle through.

505
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,680
God, they own Kazam. Really?

506
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, my God.

507
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,920
Or it was like a copoly gram was also in.

508
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,520
Maybe they just distributed it.

509
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,640
Did they do they own surf ninjas?

510
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
Remember surf ninjas?

511
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,160
Probably not.

512
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,480
It feels very touchstone, however, for them to do three ninjas and surf.

513
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,160
I know they do not know surf ninjas.

514
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
Might be new line.

515
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,240
I think it was new line.

516
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,840
They do the gun in Betty Lou's handbag.

517
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,080
You know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

518
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,280
The gun. Yeah, yeah.

519
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Penelope and Miller.

520
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,000
It took me a second.

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,280
Cathy Moriarty. It took me a second. Yeah.

522
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,880
You'll know it when there's a full Disney Plus series about it.

523
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,880
Anyway, I could look up touchstone pictures all day.

524
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,680
This is let's put this in the queue to do the full touchstone.

525
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah. So but yeah,

526
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,440
back to the parade everyone loves.

527
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, I

528
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,160
though they even so here's another thing that they considered electrifying

529
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,160
the tracks along Main Street like cable car style.

530
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,920
That's interesting.

531
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,120
So like they would every flow would have gotten its power from the like what the,

532
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
you know, what runs along those?

533
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,680
I guess the the horse carriages or.

534
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
Yeah, the trolley tracks.

535
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
That would have been fine. Yeah, yeah. Electrified.

536
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,360
It's not like there is a baseball team

537
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,640
named after the act of dodging electric

538
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,200
sparking trolley cars.

539
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
It's not like. Right. That's right.

540
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,480
Yeah. Yeah. Why did we talk about this before?

541
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
Was it because of Dodger Dogs at CityWalk?

542
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't remember what spurred this.

543
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,720
I think I took a double decker bus tour of like the boroughs of New York once

544
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,800
and the very New York tour guide was like, the Dodgers never should have left Brooklyn.

545
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,800
Even the name was about dodging the trolley cars when they came

546
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,280
careening around the corner.

547
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
Nostalgic for that.

548
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,320
They got to take the Main Street at Disneyland and put it on a slant.

549
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,320
Everybody's having to dodge all those cars.

550
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
More dodging at Disneyland.

551
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,400
More dodging.

552
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,600
That's what a real city's about.

553
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,320
They should run those Main Street bugs down at 60 miles an hour.

554
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
Kids got to jump at it away.

555
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,280
Make those horse trolleys spark like a real trolley.

556
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,880
And spook those horses before they go out.

557
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
Light off fireworks in front of their face.

558
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,800
Make them run down Main Street Hill as fast as they can.

559
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,720
Do a horse race. Do a horse race down Main Street.

560
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,320
Let the people bet on it.

561
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Let people make money.

562
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,120
Oh, Disneyland's no fun. You can't play the ponies.

563
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
You should be able to play the ponies at Disneyland.

564
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,320
Most most American entertainment at the turn of the century

565
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
was about either startling or confusing horses.

566
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,480
The fact you can't do that on Main Street is a travesty.

567
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,440
You got all the fireworks right there.

568
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
Scare them. Scare them.

569
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Scare them!

570
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Scare them.

571
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,200
Scared a horse. The kids will love it.

572
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Scared a horse.

573
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
We don't advocate for scaring a horse.

574
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
We don't advocate.

575
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
No, that's that's what the character.

576
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
That was that character. He was wrong.

577
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
That well-observed Brooklyn-y guy.

578
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,720
I imagine as we head into this we'll also have some well-observed

579
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Chicago-y guys because a

580
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,200
Chicago company ended up getting hired to build these floats and install the lights and the nyCAD

581
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,280
batteries

582
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,720
Because the creators like liked the specific type of bulb like I said that lit up Michigan Avenue

583
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,080
at night

584
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,800
So they hired a Chicago company to do it great all it because it's like by this point

585
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,520
We're saying, you know, here's the timeline Disney World opens in 71. I think it's like

586
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,040
Summer of 72. I think it's sometime in 72 that

587
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,600
All right, we're we've announced this parade. Hey, not all the fun is in Florida. We got fun right here a new electrical parade

588
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,320
It's gonna dazzle you. Um, so they start building to this event

589
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,240
That's been set up and then they check in on the Chicago people and they haven't done shit

590
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,920
They just completely dropped the ball or so Disney says yeah, they I mean maybe they have a different story

591
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
They might I mean

592
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,440
If you were a Chicago factory worker and Disney caught you having built nothing with two months to go

593
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
What would you say?

594
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,900
I don't know. I think you could make up a couple different. What year was it was the 70s?

595
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
70s

596
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,300
What was happening in Chicago in the 70s? I don't know

597
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:59,780
Hmm. I'm just I'm doubting my own ability to do a Chicago accent is what I'm it's just the Bears just do the Bears

598
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,260
You know, I guess that is that that's all you got in the bears. That's all you gotta do. That's odd

599
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, and it's kind of that acroid. It's a little bit of that acroid thing. Um

600
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,980
I

601
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,380
It's all right, I'm too busy. I'm seeing I'm I can't wait look we got busy

602
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,740
We were seeing all these we were seeing all those shows at the second city. I

603
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:29,260
Would laugh it too much. I had to take a sick leave cuz my my ribs my ribs and my stomach hurt from laughing too much

604
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
This kid balloon she

605
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Michael O'Donoghue Marone

606
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Yeah

607
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
That's a good excuse

608
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,560
Yeah, that'll yes. Yeah. So yeah, every all these Chicago factory workers were too busy laughing so they didn't get

609
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
so Disney had to

610
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Gather up all these floats just yank them away from the company drive them to

611
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:06,660
LA as fast as humanly possible and finish this parade in like half the time or less than they had

612
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,300
Established to do it assuming it was gonna be taken care of which did require that

613
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,920
So in the initial conception of the parade there were five hundred thousand

614
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,740
White miniature bulbs and they all had to be hand tinted

615
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,820
So they had to hire a bunch of ladies, of course

616
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,860
It had to be ladies who else but ladies could do this dead to dip the bulbs in in all of the colors

617
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:34,580
Wow, yeah, that's what it's well, it's like a weird. That's like ink and paint like the ink and paint gals

618
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,820
I don't know why Disney was convinced that men shouldn't be around paint. I guess

619
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,940
That's women's work is painting

620
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,580
Paint fumes are gonna get in anybody's brain men are far too ladies. You can't be trusted men around paint

621
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,540
They'll just start drinking it. They're far too dumb and crude

622
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,680
That was Walt's concern in the old days and he was right to think it

623
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,760
I'll say this for like in terms of the Chicago company trying to get this parade off the ground

624
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,880
It's not like they had a great inspiration to draw from because the electric water pageant floats

625
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,940
It's well documented that as you said, those are barges covered in chicken wire

626
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,940
Wrapped in lights so kind of rigged up and kind of has never really changed

627
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,680
I mean, I think they've upgraded it a little over the years

628
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:35,160
But the one night or one week engagement has now been going for decades and decades

629
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,880
But it's not like a technological Marvel. What's crazy essentially?

630
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,080
Oh, I was just gonna say what's crazy about it and it's all like the the rush to finish it

631
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,840
And I guess it's actually like the same when it comes to most projects and theme parks

632
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,880
it's like it feels like it's like I have a

633
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,520
Like some sort of project to in school and I'm rushing to finish it the night before and it's just like well

634
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,080
I don't know what we're gonna do. I don't know chicken wire and dip it in

635
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,400
like we're just gonna try to piece stuff together like with whatever we have and then

636
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
the difference of course being that like

637
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,640
the you know science project I made in high school fell apart like the day of

638
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,400
Me making it well, and then this thing but that's not far from how this played out. I wouldn't well, that's true

639
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
You know, you're right. They've have to reconstruct it. Yes. I

640
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,520
Mean yeah, it sort of was as janky as like a

641
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
volcano for a science seemingly

642
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,780
Less than a week before the debut a third of the floats were not ready

643
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,600
third of them and they and I I think it so then there was like a

644
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Address rehearsal where I let's say let's attempt this

645
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,120
Let's try to get through one pass and they did not get through the one pass

646
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm see you guys might have seen different versions of this story. I saw that a

647
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,200
Horse fell over a Brooklyn Brooklyn guys dream

648
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,600
Now that's funny that's funny that's like Belushi level funny

649
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,160
The Belushi falls down and the horse falls down

650
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,320
Float crashed into one of the buildings. Yeah went off the track on that

651
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,520
And this was I think the night before this is the night right before the very first performance

652
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:32,000
I feel like I'm forgetting another story. I had always heard that they got down Main Street and like died in the hub

653
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Like the

654
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,520
Yeah, the lights turned off costume sparking is a big

655
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,240
Thing a big thing mentioned people just walking around with electric costumes sparking at each other

656
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,020
And I think I think Jason what you just said about that they made it down Main Street and then it went dark in the hub

657
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,800
I think that's that's not the rehearsal. I think that's in the that was the first night

658
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,200
That's like what that's as far as they could make it. I think yeah a guess and press there and that sort of thing

659
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,260
God which is a testament to how

660
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:14,200
Just instantly lovable and fun and kooky the thing was that it was like that's a if that happened now

661
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,940
Oh my god, all your all your news today's and your mice chats. Everybody's all up in arms

662
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,620
Service furious we'd be roasting the hell out of them

663
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:30,140
Yeah, but I like that it was that fun just for the like the one block that it made it that like who cares

664
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
We love it. Yeah, really?

665
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:39,380
Yeah, it's like I'm trying to think like what is I guess the closest thing in recent history is that float in?

666
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,740
Florida catching fire

667
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,240
The Maleficent Dragon float caught on fire a couple years ago at this point. Yeah, it's like the biggest like

668
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,220
Parade fail that I can think of in the last few years, but also that was awesome

669
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,360
Yeah, you're right. That was like that was great. What especially once you're like you're you're seeing it and you're like

670
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Oh, I hope everyone was okay

671
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Everyone was yes that rules

672
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
As long as you can call it then nobody was hurt yeah, that's the coolest thing ever

673
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,720
You know the last minute scrappy nature of this where floats are missing and we're like

674
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,480
you know, I think the other thing about the night that it debuted was that they were like the parade started the first float is

675
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,480
Leaving the station and the last several floats are not done and people are like screwing in bulbs

676
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,720
As it's going at like the parade is in progress and they're still finishing these things. I think actually

677
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,680
Oddly the most recent example of something being this janky unless they've just kept it secret from us is

678
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,480
The replacement for the mainstream electrical parade light magic

679
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,040
Which if we haven't said this officially on Twitter or anything

680
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,280
This is a little bit of a two-parter because light magic we're doing an episode about as well

681
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,760
If you don't know about light magic, I'm so excited to share we'll get into it later

682
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,220
but like oddly the whole story with that is

683
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:13,720
Let's do a super high-tech parade to replace this always janky parade and then that too the floats weren't working

684
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,760
There were major technical problems. It wasn't ready to go by the time they'd organized some big event

685
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,520
So like the same thing essentially happened in the 70s in the 90s. Yeah, I don't know

686
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,120
I think paint the night which is like really the like realizing that dream of the technologically superior

687
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Parade, I don't know. I haven't read about any like big problems with that, but I'm sure there were I wonder if they just keep

688
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,560
Those problems hidden now not problems, but I thought there was supposed to be like that parade in

689
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,960
Japan I feel like there are more

690
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,880
Interactive elements or was there were at one point

691
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Where like people had wands or ears that would light up and would bounce along to the music and I feel like they

692
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,360
Promised something like that for Anaheim and it didn't really happen

693
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,240
We did get remember a new a new

694
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,100
Mix of a classic Al City song. We definitely got that for sure. Well, of course we did. Yes

695
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,240
I am remembering now that I remember reading like mice chat articles about the issues with the paint the night parade

696
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:25,720
So there were some issues, but I don't know if they were as severe as like they were shooting sparks into the audience or anything

697
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,600
They just like they keep a lid on these things. I guess a little better. I don't know

698
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,160
But now but they've also leaned into

699
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,040
It's not like Disney hides all these stories of the problems at the Electrical Parade

700
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,160
I think they kind of love these stories now that something as as beloved to Disneyland fans as this parade had such a

701
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
like

702
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,320
Crappy messy start. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's like it's kind of like adds to like the spunky nature

703
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,920
The can-do spirit of the Main Street Electrical Parade

704
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
That's really what it is. Yeah

705
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
even in all of its

706
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,320
Jankiness and crashing and lighting unfired for the parade

707
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,640
They did have to develop for the first time and now commonly used

708
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,280
System or just like the way parades happen now, which is an automated show control program

709
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,200
Where you know in a street light kind of way a parade a float rolls into an area

710
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,720
Sensors catch it and trigger a new music cue to start right which I don't I don't think had been done

711
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,980
Up until so that there could be like a seamless

712
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,080
Music flow from section to say now the Pinocchio part is starting now. The snow white part is starting

713
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,880
Yeah, that was an innovation for this parade that they still have. I'm sure it's more Wi-Fi than radio signals

714
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,600
Now but yeah, so there there was a lot of technology going around

715
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah. Yeah, pretty cool

716
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Is now the points to talk about the song?

717
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,160
Yeah

718
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,120
Sure. I mean it is certainly potentially a final four

719
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,840
That we could do of best theme park music. Yes, and I don't want to spoil that but it's so it seems very possible

720
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:25,800
This could be if not number one then then in the final four. Yeah, it's got a hard hard competition with blood on the sand

721
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,480
Blood on the sand from country fairs

722
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean it's children's children tap their toes to that rousing number

723
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
It's also it's blood on the saddle

724
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,560
But is it is it? Yeah

725
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,480
Okay, it's that the title of your asking Jason. I know I know

726
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,560
Right, he says blood in the sand and blood on the sand. Oh, yeah, maybe it might be a leader

727
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,200
It's I've looked it up and it's the blood on the saddle it's blood on the song

728
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,240
Is there ever blood on the song lyrics now? Sorry blood. Oh, no on the

729
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
saddle lyrics

730
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,360
There was blood that's just like a pre-recorded track by Tex Ritter

731
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,760
That's interesting and blood all around and a great big puddle of blood on the ground. Oh blood. Oh wait

732
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I think there's sand I

733
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,960
Don't know what the blood on the sand is the sequel to the first 50 cent video game

734
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,320
There was 50 cent the 50 cent g unit video game blood in the sand was the sequel to that

735
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,080
You've confused again for a country bears song

736
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,340
Again I mixed up the g unit video games and country bears again

737
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,660
You have to stop so let's let's speak let's test you then who who did the song

738
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,060
Pimp 50 center the country bears Jason. I

739
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,500
Feel like that's the number Henry six, right?

740
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,980
Does sound like that I don't blame you at all but it is I will have to say it is 50 cent no

741
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Dillon lose

742
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,660
It is we maybe will eventually do a final four with songs I

743
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,620
Think I think final four is for sure mainstream electrical parade Baroque. Oh down of course is the name of it

744
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,140
Really? Oh down. Yes, but I think also I think Sinbad is in that final four

745
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,420
That's that's pretty formidable

746
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,460
It's almost like do you have to separate instrumentals and

747
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,300
Lyric songs you have to make those different or they or those are the sides

748
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,220
Maybe this final four is like 32 competitors instead of 16. Oh, yeah, and it goes over three episodes

749
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,460
Yeah, yeah, I think we do it really soon because we're bored

750
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,500
Yeah, let's just let's expand why does it have to be 16

751
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,020
Yeah, the next final four will have 128 competitors

752
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
From the instrumental conference

753
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,340
phantasmic

754
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:29,380
The loop that plays inside the ice cream parlor on Main Street on the Gibson girl loop

755
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,860
the droid rooms from start to search

756
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
This is good we should do this

757
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,620
But yes the very possible winner

758
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,100
Baroque oh down which I'm so excited to talk about because it is the

759
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,340
Synthesis of two great loves of mine Disneyland and old synthesizer bullshit. Mm-hmm

760
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,020
There's a real chicken of the egg with me

761
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:02,580
Do I like this parade so much because it is so synthy or do I like synth bullshit because of this parade?

762
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,140
Is there any way to know I?

763
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,620
Don't know I think it's all like so as I said

764
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,140
I truly do remember hearing the first note and the vocoder is a three-year-old

765
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,740
So it feels like so tied into my psyche at this point

766
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Right many I mean many classic movies

767
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,100
I like had some sort of presence at MGM studios

768
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,940
like that was my exposure and then I would go to video stores and

769
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,900
if I saw stuff I would rent it or if I like I would hunt it down because like

770
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,940
Oh, yes singing in the rain. That's in MGM studios a lot. I should watch that and it's if you

771
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,340
naturally prefer

772
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,340
Desserts and treats that are shaped like Mickey Mouse

773
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,940
That's probably because of theme parks that well, that's true. Yeah, probably

774
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,540
Could be from some others or maybe just like three circles together

775
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:02,140
But no, I have so many of those things where you really decades after the fact

776
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,700
Like oh wait do I at the end of the day like this because of

777
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,180
Because of Disney stuff when I was four years old. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the answer is probably usually yes

778
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,660
For with almost everything. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly why I like

779
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,060
hotel lobbies and musaq and yeah, sure

780
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,980
Do you know wonderful texture? How hard do you go on?

781
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,140
Knowing about the synths in the songs in the song. Excuse me. Um, I

782
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:35,180
Don't I certainly don't know what was played when I look at like I've seen a list of what

783
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,680
Was used on it. I'm no look. I'm not actually a musician or a gear yet

784
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,900
But I know when I see words like prophet five, I know we're in I know we're in a good territory

785
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,260
I know what makes the sounds that I like and the list is pretty good

786
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:56,440
It's a pretty robust list of like 12 like great old analog since that were used on this thing

787
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,320
Do you I don't want to put you on the spot here

788
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,980
Do you have like a just a little bit of a vague like I know this is my favorite old synth

789
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,400
ooh, um, I don't I own a

790
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,320
This is a pretty different area, but but I bought off a craigslist a whirlitzer electric

791
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,240
Oh, which is this great like tan keyboard. That's what the Carpenter's played. It's on Queen

792
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
You're my best friend. It's on

793
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:31,560
It's the super tramp it's the logical song keyboard so that that's that's kind of different from

794
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,340
You know this like Moog area, but yeah, that's that's one. I'm especially fond of yeah, that's good

795
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,040
I don't go I don't know the tech spec. I don't know the stuff about since specifically

796
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm a fan of the sounds I have like logic on the computer which has you know hundreds of synth

797
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
Pads you can use for your MIDI keyboard

798
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,000
Sure sure oh and we should say I mean the certainly the theme song of our show is very much inspired by

799
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Yes, the major electrical breath. Yes, it is

800
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,160
It also it's I don't know it was kind of an accident that when I was when I was putting the thing together

801
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,780
I realized the song together. I realized that the opening and the drum is kind of like the opening to the

802
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Disney sing-along tapes

803
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,000
Yes, yes totally the rhythm of

804
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,160
So it's a little bit of a combo of both of those things

805
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,720
Yeah, I

806
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,880
Remember well, that's a little like connecting the dots

807
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,320
I feel like you know we put out like five of these things and then maybe I realized oh, you know what?

808
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,040
That's kind of like yeah, that's a that's a cool little nod you did

809
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,160
I'm not sure if even maybe even new listeners don't realize you did the theme song

810
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,560
That's not so if we were at we should we is that something we should say in every episode like in that end screen

811
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,360
Should we credit you for the song and Aaron my wife for the art I

812
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,520
Mean, I don't know we don't have to say it. I don't know

813
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,920
I it's not like it's not like I'm seeing it attributed to like some sort of old composer on the internet or anything

814
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,760
It's not being wrongly it's not being attributed to these guys to Perry Kingsley

815
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,680
podcast theme unknown written by

816
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
Unknown

817
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,280
Public domain no way to know it's a it's a Shakespeare situation

818
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,920
Yeah, there was one person or 200 people and I don't know. Yeah. Do you ever you know what?

819
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, so good. I was gonna say do you have the artist name of Baroque?

820
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,880
Oh down because that was just a song that was not a Disney made song that was like

821
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,120
Yes a song they brought in seemingly or originally for inspiration

822
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,160
And we're like, well, let's just license this and now and at some point they did buy it Disney now owns Baroque

823
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
O'Down. Oh, is that right?

824
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,480
Yeah, I didn't realize that others but the person who discovered it

825
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,320
I know is Jack Wagner often called the voice of Disneyland or Disney World. Yeah

826
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,600
This is an insane if it's true

827
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,640
although I think I feel like I've seen different sources because I've seen that Baroque O'Down was maybe used in the electrical water pageants

828
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Which maybe he found it for that too

829
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,800
But what but certainly there's multiple Disney stories attributing it to this guy Jack Wagner there were they were talking about

830
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,800
What is the score of this parade? Is it Fantasia music?

831
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,480
And then he said it just doesn't fit the or because the orchestral doesn't work with this for me

832
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,400
It may be it's a weird keyboard thing and I have records that are like this and he went and found

833
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,960
This record by Jean-Jacques Perry and Gershon Kingsley and that became the score but Jack Wagner if you don't know is the guy

834
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,280
I mean, he's mainly known for remain seated, please

835
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,920
permanecer sentados por favor and

836
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:41,520
He is he's the vocoder voice at the beginning of the parade he is the like, yeah ladies and gentlemen boys and girls

837
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,720
Bonkers so that got like the the texture this guy added to the park in general with his voice

838
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,120
But also that he picked this song and is the vocoder. What what an MVP legend

839
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah a literal Disney legend and

840
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,160
Probably a ptr legend to Perry you did say Perry and Kingsley was there a re in Kingsley so

841
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
Jean-Jacques Perry Gershon Kingsley

842
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,480
They I mean I I found that this was some connecting the dots that freaked me out in high school

843
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,120
Realizing that because they made this cool this really amazing record called the in sound from way out

844
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:26,280
Which is a weird kooky record from 66 of blippy bloopy keyboard music

845
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,080
That same title was and the cover were used by the Beastie Boys for an instrumental album

846
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,200
They you like borrow or whatever you want to call it the same that that phrase which is very cool

847
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,840
But this is from an album called the kaleidoscopic vibrations

848
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:49,900
Gershon Kingsley also did a similar like early synth song called popcorn

849
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,640
Which you'd know it from the melody which is that?

850
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,420
Bimp bump bump on a bump bump bump bump on a bump that feels like one of those songs like you know

851
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,680
But you don't know where it's from unless you guys don't is it in Tetra. Don't they use it in Tetris or something?

852
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,760
God, maybe my wrong. It's like I'm not sure my I don't know where song I'll look it up popcorn

853
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,720
I don't know where popcorn is is from but it's definitely it's just one of those like yeah, what is that?

854
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,840
That's some like 60s novelty thing and I don't know who made it. It was one of these guys

855
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,060
I think I believe it's used in Tetris

856
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:29,500
Uh, yes Tetris, yeah, it's in Tetris really a theme Tetris eating popcorn remade I think

857
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,980
Huh?

858
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,140
Yeah Tetris popcorn instrumental. Yeah. Oh

859
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,900
Geez Wow fuck

860
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,540
Yeah, so these guys like clearly like yeah like major figures in the history of synth music

861
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,660
Some of the first people ever to use a Moog synthesizer in any regard

862
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:56,820
And what I love about all this stuff so much is that I was I was trying to figure out like what's important about Moog

863
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,460
keyboard specifically and

864
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
You know a lot of it is like technical stuff

865
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,980
That's kind of above my head

866
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:10,260
But I think the main thing is that early keyboards were trying to sound like other things like can we get this?

867
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:16,740
You know electronic machine to sound like a piano or like an organ or like an orchestra or something

868
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,540
Like I think early keyboard stuff was like, how do we make sure we never have to hire an orchestra again?

869
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,780
can we get a machine to sound like an orchestra and

870
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:31,220
Robert Moog with his early keyboards said what if it's not trying to sound like other things?

871
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:38,460
What if we embrace the the art of fists in the electronic nature and they'll just be like these bizarre sounding things

872
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,620
They'll just sound totally kooky and weird and Perry and Kingsley were two of the first musicians to say that's great

873
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:49,260
Let's like twist all these dials and get bizarre sounds out of these machines, which is totally

874
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,460
What the parade is like every little every different little here's the deep one

875
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:00,460
Boop boop boop and here's like if you listen to their original recording all that character is in there

876
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,360
like and it's just amazing how much like

877
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:11,860
It's indelible now you like think of all these bugs and these little like kooky characters and their soundtrack was like

878
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,060
Just like inherent in this unrelated song made in 67

879
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,820
Yeah, that is very interesting how perfect that ends up being

880
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,700
I mean, I'm sure there's obviously there's a million different ways to you know, make creative decisions

881
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,780
But it does feel like it was completely written for this

882
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,120
It fits perfectly like a parade

883
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:41,020
It was completely like parade music already even though that wasn't the purpose of it and the original track is not that

884
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,340
Different from what they use in the parade like if you yeah, they re-recorded it

885
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,900
Yeah, but it's yeah, it's pretty it's pretty right on like down to that

886
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,620
Like that opening drone and that real wild pitch bends like boom

887
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,940
It's so great. It's so great. I think what I was saying was like that

888
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,740
The bizarre character of those old keyboards is the parade too. It's like

889
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,120
Weird and janky and kooky and of its era, but that's what everybody

890
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,440
Loves about it. I don't know. This thing is like it's like the mystery electrical parade isn't inherently a

891
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,640
Retro thing. I don't think that's why people love it, but there's certainly that

892
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,760
Error to it. It's like it's like so part of the DNA and I love that

893
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:30,360
Disney has something that's so of its time in so many ways. Yeah, because it's not retro

894
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
It's also not like retro Disneyland in the way that

895
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,520
You're like opening day Disneyland stuff is

896
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,920
It's retro in the way we I think talk a lot of on the show we like is like 70s and 80s retro Disney

897
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:51,880
That like is the I mean and obviously you Scott, you know what I'm talking about more than anyone but like the retro future

898
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,680
That's what it feels like

899
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,320
I mean since since in general have such character to them and and I think as a kid

900
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Whether you knew it or not you were like thinking that this is the music of the future

901
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:10,640
This is suggesting just hearing a synth is like you're thinking about like robots and you're thinking about some crazy

902
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,680
technological like

903
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,200
Society like well, I got you couldn't I probably couldn't articulate it at 10

904
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:24,080
But if I heard those noises and beeps it was like whoa, this feels like some crazy cool like hundred years from now

905
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,480
It really as a kid you cannot process what these sounds are

906
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,520
You like don't like I don't know what this is but it is different and I want to hear more of this and I'm sure

907
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,000
this parade factors into the why like I

908
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:45,960
Probably the vast majority of music I listen to has some synth component. I bet that's that's true for you to some extent, too

909
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,480
It's just I don't yeah the just the texture these there's I provide as cool as hell

910
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,720
I was working on something yesterday and I was like I should see what synths they have in logic and there I

911
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,400
Was just saying there's like hundreds and I just go through each one and just like run my hands up and down the keyboard

912
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,760
Because it's so satisfying to hear these bizarre

913
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,320
Robot sounds that are in there. It's like which when you call me

914
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Oh my god, just putting your hand on a key. How cool it feels instantly

915
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,680
and that's what the fact that these early synth guys were such like they were combo musicians and

916
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,720
Scientists like they worked in laboratories literally

917
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,360
And some of the early ones like it took an entire room to play it and I think the Moog

918
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,600
What this stuff is played on were some of the first keyboards that could actually you could pick up and take somewhere else

919
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:46,200
They weren't stuck in a laboratory. Yes, it really it's honestly it makes too much sense that these were scientists

920
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Because there's something like so beautifully artificial and clinical and scientific about the sound as well

921
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,240
I mean that in a good way. Yeah

922
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,480
It's like what's kind of like it can be like a lot of them can be like kind of almost like cold sterile sounds

923
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,880
But there's something there's something beautiful about that too, isn't there?

924
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:13,680
Well, and it's funny it's still like I did this ever not feel current like when we were in

925
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,960
Orlando and I was staying at Universal I was walking around like

926
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,200
the the

927
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:28,240
City walking by the hotels like after the parks had closed but horror nights had started and the soundtrack of horror nights in

928
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,020
2019 was all like synthy

929
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,180
Like spooky like it I found like a playlist

930
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:42,280
I don't know was official or not on Spotify and it's all like a mix of weird horror music and like

931
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,240
Synthy like club music and stuff and I was just walking by I was like that sounds cool

932
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,120
Should I just should I go in should I should have gone in I should have bought a debt

933
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,480
But just standing outside it's like wow that seems like a cool party

934
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:03,200
Yeah, it's like I mean obviously like I think everything comes back into stint of vogue or whatever

935
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,880
But like stranger things has that very synthy

936
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,400
Synthy song we just watch good time for the first time a couple of oh, yeah

937
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,380
And obviously the Safdies love this this synth

938
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,300
They love using it to make you feel just constant dread

939
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,780
They love I mean like it follows like there's always like every year

940
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:31,780
There's some new thing that feels like the future by using a lot of synths like it'll never not be the future

941
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:37,380
This is what I'm saying. We always come back to this about Tomorrowland and Epcot like just there's no new future

942
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:44,500
It's still like it's it's still neon and since that will always be it's like a future that will never come

943
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:51,300
Getting out of date. What's that deep neon blue always the future? Yes. Yes

944
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,420
Color schemes of Tron legacy how to correct probably the digital thing

945
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:03,860
Maybe one of the things that is age the best in terms of like the look of the odds and 2010s

946
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:09,040
I can't remember the actual movie myself, but just like that blow glowing

947
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,860
Greenish blue is like yeah, that still works still like that

948
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:21,500
Yeah, and Daft Punk always feels like future music despite always nodding to 60s and 70s music

949
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:29,420
Tron the music by Wendy Carlos who also did a lot of these early experimental like a peer of Gershon

950
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,720
Kingsley and John Jack Perry with her switched on Bach

951
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:40,340
Records those were like also make a mix of experimental or and also fun and weird to listen to

952
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,780
Which that was yeah a lot of these early records were like

953
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,620
What if we took classical music and played them through these weird keyboards?

954
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:53,700
And in fact the guy who ultimately played the Disney version, I believe Don Dorsey is his name

955
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,100
The guy who made the new burro co-down for Disney in the 70s

956
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,800
He also put out an album in the 80s called Bach busters

957
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:09,040
And it has a cover that is delightful to look up where a guy playing Bach is like

958
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,340
Running somewhere or from something while holding a big keytar

959
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Check out Bach busters

960
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:23,920
Do you have a keytar Scott? No, um, I only the the one that came with rock band. Oh, right

961
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,520
Technically I do have a little what do I have it says it a mini move I forget

962
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,360
but

963
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,280
also interesting about all this that John Jack Perry

964
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:45,960
Went to Disneyland in 1980 and saw the parade and this just started playing and he didn't know that his music was in the parade

965
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:52,720
Until that moment. Wow just started. Yeah bonkers like it was because it was run by the publishers

966
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,900
Disney didn't rip him off. He was making money from it. Right? Just they just like never

967
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,320
alerted him so he's just in the park and hears that his

968
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:06,400
Notes start and it freaks him out, but it made him very happy and kind of never

969
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,720
Stops cuz I don't know if we've said yet

970
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:16,560
like this is the backbone of the soundtrack of the parade and then as the radio cues like as

971
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,760
the floats cue the different music cues

972
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:28,240
Like electric versions of like Alice in Wonderland or and and the other songs kind of play on top of this

973
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:35,000
We're like mix that is a really bonkers thing about it that it was this other track that Disney didn't make and yet

974
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,400
It was the base that all of their melodies go on top of the fact that it worked as like a starting point

975
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,920
And now we'll do all the classic Disney songs and that they all fit. It's never like anachronistic

976
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:54,760
It's so crazy and probably helped make them a little more current at the time like bring them back into people's minds

977
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,480
Yeah, I mean they were re-releasing those movies every other month still but you know

978
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,760
Very merry on birthday is probably my favorite within that it's such a fits so perfectly in that particular variety of

979
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,240
Flake weird deep

980
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:16,200
That that one fits the best for me and that might be my favorite little musical stint

981
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,320
That's probably right cuz like the movie is a nightmare

982
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,480
Movie is a nightmare

983
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Or like a

984
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,440
Psychedelic surreal I should say it's psychedelic more than a nightmare

985
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,040
I mean the movie is a nightmare, but that's not what we like about on birthday sure sure

986
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,920
Maybe it's time to start

987
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,680
You know we should maybe start talking about sections of the parade and floats and stuff

988
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,520
But just real quick before in the music section. I one thing I think is awesome

989
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,080
John Jack Perry Gershon Kingsley were both born in the 1920s, but they only died pretty recently

990
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,600
like Perry died in

991
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,120
2016 Kingsley died last year these guys made it so long

992
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,640
And when John Jack Perry died a relative said

993
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,880
No one should be sad

994
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:09,320
There's nothing he would want more than for his fans to be playing his crazy funny catchy moog music and smiling instead of being sad

995
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,600
He was the happiest guy so listen to his music and smile. He seems like the coolest

996
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,960
And this for you can watch footage of him not from not that long ago at the knitting factory playing Baroque

997
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,800
Oh down how audience goes bonkers?

998
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:29,040
Well watching him actually play the complicated parts of it so cool these guys are great

999
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,880
Maybe very happy to talk about these guys. Yeah, did you ever think about did you know you could see him live?

1000
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
Did you ever think about it? Oh

1001
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,240
Yeah, I don't hmm. I mean I was out my radar

1002
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,080
Yeah, no not really

1003
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,920
nor have I I've made no effort to see marauder probably the the biggest

1004
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,600
you know the

1005
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,460
Most looming I quote my own thing Lord of synth

1006
01:05:54,460 --> 01:06:00,400
I was gonna say there and we plug Lords of synth can somebody watch that Scott made a very funny

1007
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
Was it a short I guess you call it

1008
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,080
Adult swim special it was a 4 a.m. Special yes if you're interested in

1009
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
synth and Lords and

1010
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,400
Synth patchwork and that kind of thing

1011
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,360
Please check out Lords of synths one of my favorite things that urban

1012
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:23,040
Part of many past guests of the show on a part of it too, and yeah, it's it's great Perry and Kingsley not

1013
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
reflected in it, but

1014
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,600
Yeah, hey, it was it was so fun. I still can't believe it happened

1015
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,440
Where is it available?

1016
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,300
Just on YouTube for free okay? Wow isn't that insane? Yeah?

1017
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,880
It's it's funny that works out

1018
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:44,600
So many people have told me they like Lords of synth it because they saw it because they got to see it

1019
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:49,020
It was not some weird paywall, so yeah go to YouTube look up words of synth. I'm very proud of it

1020
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
Yeah, check it out

1021
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,540
Yeah, so let's get back to the actual I guess parade

1022
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,480
Yeah, yeah, what are what part what parts do we like what?

1023
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,240
What's what are what are highlights in your your guys mine? I mean they're all kind of highlights

1024
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,840
I always think about like goofy sitting on one of those balls

1025
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,200
Mm-hmm, I don't know why that comes to mind

1026
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,240
I mean the I think the Kings are the two turtles that hat turtle glasses turtle

1027
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:27,280
Like I was trying to figure out if they have names, and I think via eBay at least if the eBay

1028
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,080
Listings for like models of them you can get are accurate

1029
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:37,360
And I think their names are lightning bug and twinkling turtle wonderful how twinkling turtle I have the

1030
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
I have the Park Star

1031
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,240
Turtle oh

1032
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,600
That's great. Yeah, I have that one look at that

1033
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:50,060
That's about that's a that's a top-notch Park Star that I guess is twinkling turtle that is twinkling turtle. Yes

1034
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:55,120
I have twinkling turtle. Hi. That's there's maybe a disconnect for me that he's yeah high in the parade

1035
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:00,500
I didn't know he was wearing a tie until I got the toy. He's wearing a tie the ones got a jaunty hat

1036
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,320
I like the snails too both the snails are great

1037
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:11,440
Yeah, snails and ladybug and if you had to pick something to do in this parade

1038
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,040
It would be hard to resist

1039
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:20,560
Driving one of these things around oh yeah, that would be spinning. Oh goddamn cool spinning that thing. Are you kidding me?

1040
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,920
I would have a ball spinning that turtle I

1041
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,160
was thinking in the way that

1042
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:36,560
These are this the music's done on weird janky synthesizers the parade is chicken wire and chaos and the way the fact that these

1043
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,480
There's such a human element to the way those things move around and spin around it is

1044
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,200
You know it's not like perfect motion controlled rise of the resistance

1045
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,800
It's weird and wonky and you can see the like antenna

1046
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:57,480
No shake back and forth and you can imagine one of them driving into the crowd if they weren't careful

1047
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,740
It's not that everything in theme parks has to be

1048
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,720
Janky like these things are I just love that there's both. I love that. There's like the highest technology and

1049
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,660
You know weird rickety technology, too

1050
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:18,080
There's a human element to the turtle spinning flick flailing wildly in a seemingly dangerous way

1051
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,240
And it would be so fun all right not to hit people

1052
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,080
But if you lined up a bunch of like dummies a bunch of crass crash test dummies

1053
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,080
Along Main Street, and then just got to like plow through a row of 20. Oh, just nail them. Yeah

1054
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,680
Yeah

1055
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,900
Like for giant bowling pins oh

1056
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,280
Yeah, yeah, oh my god right in the middle of me. Oh, yeah, I'm down

1057
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,800
See if you can see if you can get them all with that initial impact right

1058
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:55,560
Hell yeah, I was gonna say I love the when dopey is driving the minecart with the diamonds or the jewels I should say

1059
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:03,440
Yeah, that is a child of course the jewels and in Snow White and they perfectly

1060
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,200
Made them as attractive as they were and the new minecart

1061
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:13,760
coaster and I say new it's five years old, but the new ish minecart coaster and

1062
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,560
When you see those jewels when you see those rubies and sapphires, I you know that's a nostalgic

1063
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,840
thing for me

1064
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:28,760
Gotta give it up for the fancy mice the waltzing mice that are all electrified

1065
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:38,080
One of the top uses of the fancy Cinderella mice which is my wife Aaron loves very much

1066
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
I don't know what it I never asked her to

1067
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,680
Explain what it is exactly I?

1068
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,720
They their heads are just so giant and they look so

1069
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,280
Stupid they just look like such daft characters, but in a little tricorder hat. It's like they're trying so hard

1070
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,360
It's like Homer putting on a tie

1071
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:04,320
To be mildly impressive at work. That's that's how it feels like these dumb creatures are trying to look I dressed up

1072
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
I'm doing a good job

1073
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,520
About dressing up

1074
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,880
I was noticing when I was watching the video that like the seven dwarfs have on like gold pants

1075
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,320
Or like so like shiny pants like happy has gold pants and then like one of them just has like maybe purple pants

1076
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,680
But they're shiny they're like dressed like the Rolling Stones or something

1077
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,360
Like they're like they're like aging rocker kind of cool leather pants that are colorful

1078
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,520
Which I really like it's like I don't know that it reads so well to people like I don't know you could tell

1079
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,560
Necessarily, but maybe maybe it's something you subconsciously realize that happy's pants are gold

1080
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,000
Yeah, and it's sort of like refracting light right some way here. You're noticing it in some regard the

1081
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,280
We you know we should we should talk about the costumes the fact that all these costumes are electrified

1082
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,460
And how insane that must have been in the 70s it did light people on fire the first time they tried it

1083
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:02,480
But not so much anymore, and I it's it's very complicated with late to there

1084
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:08,400
I think there's battery packs like in wigs often. Yeah, that's where they're hiding a

1085
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
battery pack in a wig

1086
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,600
Yeah, it's very cool

1087
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Some of very Liberace is what it is

1088
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,800
Liberace he must have loved the Main Street Electrical Parade I hope he got to see it. Oh my god

1089
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,480
There'd be no better audience

1090
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,160
Oh my gosh

1091
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:31,480
He would have been the like if he ever like could just like have joined the parade on one of the floats and played piano

1092
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,680
on top

1093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,840
That might be the greatest thing I'd ever seen like this one like this big mouth

1094
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,640
Yeah, it's like the mouth the big pleasure island. That's gone. I think from recent versions

1095
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,240
Is that right or is that still there? That's there isn't it? I?

1096
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,640
Saw it. I watched a video of them

1097
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,500
Building it in one of the side like really rebuilding it and rebulbing it

1098
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,800
In one of the like former parking lots at California Adventure like what's probably Cars Land now

1099
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,360
They were like the parking lot was clear, and they're like putting you know they're putting the thing back together

1100
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,120
It's kind of fascinating footage

1101
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,840
I think it was a Martin's vids, but I know that face was in that okay

1102
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:17,280
It was at least still around in the it's I'm looking at it in 2017 in the faces there. Oh all right

1103
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:23,200
Some stuff is coming going though right like there was rescuers stuff. I think at some point I

1104
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Didn't see that I believe it

1105
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,920
Yeah, there's a on the Pinocchio front

1106
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:35,520
There was a big underwater section, so there was more Pinocchio

1107
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,520
Which includes when you wish upon a star as the score which I forget if the other part had that

1108
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,640
But there's a bunch of seahorses. There's a huge monstro. That's spouting and Gepetto's boat is in its mouth

1109
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,240
And even Gepetto's there like he's about to get eaten or like he's just getting spit out. I don't know what moment we're seeing

1110
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,280
But it was it was really cool like I could only find an old grainy video

1111
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,020
But it was I don't know I don't know why they took this one out. It's super cool

1112
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah, there's a lot of it's like I'm interested in yeah, if there's like some sort of resource that we're missing that has like every single

1113
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,040
Little change and all the different versions. I mean there is a lot of there's a lot of documentation of it

1114
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,200
But yeah the Disney fandom that it has a full list of floats

1115
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,120
I don't know what was running at any given time and obviously

1116
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,600
internationally they

1117
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,200
Do not have the to honor America

1118
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,000
section oh

1119
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Right yes is yes

1120
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,120
To honor America yeah very interesting that's that's a very of its era thing too

1121
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:47,480
It wasn't there for the bicentennial it was a couple years late, but it still feels like it was part of

1122
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,800
bicentennial mania

1123
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,880
Yeah

1124
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,680
It is 77 it seems like it got an or 77 when it debuted

1125
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,680
I have 77 as an important year and 84 as an important year

1126
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,720
I think a lot of what we think of the parade as comes from 84

1127
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
77 was the opening excuse me

1128
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,840
so much so supposedly that I read that um

1129
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,840
You know as fond as we are of it like some of what we a lot of what we love might be from those years

1130
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:23,680
That you said and those refurbishments because Disney apparently likes to keep photos of the original on lockdown

1131
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,700
Like it looks so bad in the early 70

1132
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,200
It must have been like the you know the weird first season of mystery science theater where the robots are falling apart

1133
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,180
It's not like the the still janky, but charming version

1134
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,380
We know I think like Disney does not want you to know how bad it was in 72

1135
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,740
yes, they want I mean because with any of this stuff with any of the Disney stuff like

1136
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:50,040
What happens is is that your brain remembers the newest version of it?

1137
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:56,600
Yeah, so it's like unless something was drastically different like in my mind. I saw this version

1138
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:03,380
Forever this is the like the new verse the newish version like which I haven't seen I guess we saw Scott

1139
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,580
I know we went to see it in 2017

1140
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:09,980
It was one of the best Disneyland visits. So what a great one

1141
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:15,700
Yeah, we went to blue bayou because we had to buy the pig package and then like you got a prime viewing spot for the

1142
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,020
New per the new viewing of the parade

1143
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,940
and a blue bayou dessert of

1144
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:26,640
One of the bugs. Oh, yeah, I finally forgot about that. I have probably have a photo of that somewhere

1145
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:34,960
Yep, which which we ate while in the wind that somebody checked their phone and said la-la land won the Oscar tonight

1146
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:40,760
Yes, we had that dessert in the window where it was not yet clear that

1147
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,800
it ended up being moonlight and had watched the

1148
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,160
Oscars in the great moments with mr. Lincoln for a few

1149
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Awards, I believe right. That's the day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a fine ABC

1150
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,720
production so they

1151
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,040
some great cross-company synergy

1152
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,320
So watching the Oscars in the Lincoln Theatre, so so great I got they got to do that kind of thing more

1153
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,960
Can we just like we just watch you know, what would you do?

1154
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:17,320
Um, oh, yeah. Yes bachelor in paradise from from the Lincoln shutting down

1155
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,200
Yeah shutting down the Lincoln Theatre early to watch like all in the family live

1156
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,840
My only complaint about it was that they should have like lifted up the screen to see Lincoln once in a while while we were

1157
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,360
watching

1158
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,240
He should have watched along and nodded and laughs and right

1159
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,800
Made caddy comments about what the what the celebrities were wearing. Mm-hmm

1160
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,640
Yeah, and then they like in between instead of showing I was always just you know, Joan Rivers style

1161
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:53,000
Snipping and snipe course. Yeah, I was gonna say instead of commercials. They should have displayed two brothers

1162
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
On the screen

1163
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,800
Just we cute we got it queued up for you. We know what shit like it's

1164
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,960
Just the highlights here. Yeah

1165
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:10,880
But yeah, I don't think Abe has a queued up and uses it to play off people whose speeches are too long

1166
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:21,820
Yeah, two brothers should be this probably some commercial campaign that is begging to use two brothers like one of these

1167
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,400
What's the there's some commercial about where like the different?

1168
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,920
The KitKat factory and like the

1169
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,640
The brothers split into different

1170
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:37,040
Lefts lefts and rights left wicks right wicks. Yeah. Oh, it's Twix. It's not okay

1171
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:43,820
No, KitKat is a strong strong bond. You need all those all of those wafers

1172
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:52,420
KitKat is a strong bond KitKat is a strong bond meet me familiar salute

1173
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,280
Or maybe it should be like Coke or Pepsi should buy it and

1174
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,400
imply that the other that their competitor is the Confederacy of

1175
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,040
Sodas is blue

1176
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,360
so coke

1177
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Would be

1178
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:19,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure the I gotta chart the math on this but it's it's dying it's you could change the colors. Yeah

1179
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,160
Any products that doesn't have a catchy jingle right now

1180
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,520
Two brothers is sitting right there waiting for you to grab it looking at you La Croix

1181
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:35,280
Maybe honestly, maybe there is a synth version of two brothers that could be made

1182
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,040
Like a well, that's the yeah

1183
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:46,400
Maybe they yeah, they got to appeal to the you know, all the the hardcore American adventure fans out there

1184
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:52,960
And yeah, they got they should do it in the middle of to honor America a Civil War

1185
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:00,440
Section with lit up electric versions of the family and then the brother who dies goes dark

1186
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,120
Oh, yeah, dragon. Yes, they

1187
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,320
We've talked about mashups before they should start mashing up Disney properties like this

1188
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,360
Yeah, yeah, I so it's like you're going from did it intend to do and ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

1189
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,680
Ding ding ding ding and then

1190
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,360
Right and then Ben Franklin and Mark Twain could be wearing gold pants

1191
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,240
And they shake hands and then spark yes

1192
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,040
That would be really great spark of American Brotherhood

1193
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,840
I

1194
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,200
Was saying but to honor America

1195
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,920
I mean, it's like I I don't mind that it's fun

1196
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,760
but what I didn't realize is that before that the

1197
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,360
finale of this parade

1198
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,760
was a huge section with

1199
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,440
where characters were in like I

1200
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,200
Got to describe them as like crystals essentially. It was like

1201
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,240
like glass rectangle it was it was a mix of like

1202
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,840
Glass and mirrors and the characters were done in neon and they spun

1203
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,880
I got to show you guys this if you haven't seen I found like a really crappy old video of it

1204
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,160
It was like it

1205
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:30,720
I mean it looks like Logan's runners and a do or so like I it made me so mad that that's not the finale

1206
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:36,000
Anymore it was like this the sleaziest Vegas mirror on the ceiling vibe

1207
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,240
Um that was like a truly amazing finale before

1208
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:48,640
It was like yeah real real grimy and cokey. I loved it. Hmm. Yeah, that's great

1209
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:58,200
That's like that sounds bad. I mean bad in a good way. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it feels good to be bad though

1210
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,600
It looks to me like the only the silhouette that I remember seeing was was Pinocchio

1211
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,940
So seeing like a neon silhouette of Pinocchio in a revolving

1212
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,640
mirrored cube and it felt like what would be at the entrance if

1213
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,560
Pinocchio opened a strip club

1214
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,200
Which he could have I mean he was on the Pleasure Island

1215
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,080
If he had liked Pleasure Island more you could see him opening up a strip club for sure

1216
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,960
It might have planted the sea if he didn't quite learn his lesson, yeah, he might have opened

1217
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,720
a

1218
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,720
rural Italy's

1219
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,920
hottest strip club

1220
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:44,720
He could have turned into like a he could have turned into whole like wooden Bob Gucci Oni type

1221
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:52,400
Well, if you know if it was him doing the stripping

1222
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,220
Like if he grew, you know now that he's real he grows up gets buff

1223
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:00,720
He's like Chippendale style and the club is called real boys

1224
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,960
Hmm

1225
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:13,040
You choked on that idea it's just the name they're all of a you only strip club they're all of a sorry I

1226
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,080
Was joking on how much money we're gonna make on that idea

1227
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:27,780
Yeah, well, I mean we've we've already got to make the two brothers burrow codown mash

1228
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,340
We are known you know what I'd like to officially formally

1229
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:36,180
Suggest that the listeners stop calling us good boys and start calling us real boys

1230
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,140
No

1231
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,020
No now now my choking is started

1232
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:49,700
Well, we keep it real here on podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's why we're the real boys the real boys

1233
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:53,460
Yeah, that's that's it. Oh

1234
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,380
No now I'm so now I'm upset I brought up the

1235
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:03,620
Revolving mirror cubes. It's your fault. Am I gonna just let it die? I'm like Peter Pan. These boys are all grown up

1236
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,500
Worse worse, but it's good worse, but it's good

1237
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,500
Sometimes sometimes it's it's it's good to be worse

1238
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:22,060
As we also talk about lost floats did you guys catch the

1239
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,060
1985 and 1985 only

1240
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,860
film tie-in float oh

1241
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:34,940
I saw don't tell me just cuz I'm gonna I have I have so many tabs open

Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,220
Is 85 the great mouse detective

1247
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,940
That is the year but not the okay

1248
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:59,460
It's real it's we'd never think of it return to oh, oh, yeah, I miss it was a return

1249
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:05,960
Miss this look up pictures look up pictures Wow bunkers

1250
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:10,900
I'm very excited about this. I can't believe I didn't see this. Whoa

1251
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:17,860
It's a it's similar in it's it's not unlike them I think mirrors were also deployed in I don't know why they aren't using

1252
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,860
mirrors more often

1253
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,340
It looks pretty looks pretty good

1254
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:29,140
And also very like casino sleazy Biff Tannen's pleasure palace really does yeah

1255
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:34,980
Yeah, this is not that far off from some of the original MGM grant

1256
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,020
Oz

1257
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,020
stuff I feel like

1258
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:43,940
Well, do you yeah, it's a lot like that absolutely did you read about the incident

1259
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:51,460
The incident oh is that on some is is it is it written in a way that is sort of?

1260
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:58,000
Weird and misspelled well, I'll read it. You know I haven't proofread it. I'm just gonna read this sentence

1261
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,060
I'm not gonna look at it again here

1262
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:06,660
We'll see what it is the float that we're talking about return to Oz float the float barely lasted a single summer as the reflective

1263
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:12,620
Mirrors suffered this floats fate as it caught fire and was completely destroyed

1264
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:20,480
That's better written than what I read what I read I didn't believe because it was so typo

1265
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,940
so the you're saying that the

1266
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:28,720
The lights like refracted around the mirrors and it caused the thing to overheat

1267
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,540
It sounds like it was cursed glare that it sounds like there was a curse or something

1268
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,100
It burned itself down for the insurance money

1269
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,660
That's what I'm getting it. Yeah, I

1270
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,940
Were there care where their characters

1271
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,540
From the movie walking around do we have any

1272
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:55,820
They were on the float there was a Dorothy and there was a guy here if you google google image means your electrical parade returned

1273
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,060
Oz you'll see it

1274
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:04,180
There's that the the pumpkin head guy. I don't know who that is pumpkin head one of the jack pumpkin. I believe that's his name

1275
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,100
And I see I

1276
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:11,580
Dorothy is holding a chicken

1277
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:15,740
Huh, is it a real chicken that a fake chicken? I?

1278
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:19,900
Cannot tell from these there's a decent video of it

1279
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,660
Um, I was looking for tick-tock

1280
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:27,620
But tick-tock is my favorite character from return to Oz

1281
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:35,500
He was sort of the round like copper I assume copper robot guy do you know him do you know I'm talking about I

1282
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:42,420
Have never seen this film really still to childhood scared of this film. Oh, we got it. We got to do it. I

1283
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:46,180
Haven't seen it in quarantine. We got to do it. Oh

1284
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,940
Is it on

1285
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,100
believe so

1286
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,460
Okay, it looks like it is yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, I'm scared of it now

1287
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:59,860
You should be currently scared while looking at it. You should be scared

1288
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:05,660
There's a ton of Oz books like these are not characters made out of whole cloth

1289
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:09,580
I believe like these are from the the bomb. Yeah. Yeah, those are from the books. Yeah

1290
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:16,300
I think it's some ways return to Oz is a little more like the books than the the Judy Garland version. I

1291
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:22,900
Think I always hate that whenever anything is quote more like the books. I always think it's worse

1292
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,220
I believe I'm in point Willy Wonka

1293
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:30,780
I'm not what I know jack pumpkin head plays a big part in the continuing books

1294
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:36,580
Oh, yeah, I'm not saying return us is better than the classic Wizard of Oz. I'm just saying sure

1295
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,900
it's like more it's interesting because it's more like

1296
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,140
horrifying

1297
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,380
Yeah, well I'd like to think that

1298
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:54,340
In my mid-30s, I would not watch this film and be scared

1299
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:59,040
But maybe I think I think maybe I'm gonna try to get Lindsey to watch it tonight with me

1300
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,460
We've watched it. We watched it years ago, I think

1301
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:08,540
Oof I'm getting a real my my never-ending story

1302
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
Jeans or

1303
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:19,900
Getting lit up here. I'm I am I never ending story phobia is kicking in. I look I feel like I

1304
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:21,900
Know exactly what you're saying

1305
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:26,940
And I think there's a sense you'll get a sense of accomplishment though when you do it because I've been trying to do that

1306
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:31,740
Here and there with other movies. I've died the scariest one of course being Hellraiser

1307
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,140
No, yes, where I watched Hellraiser because I was like, you know, you'd see the VHS

1308
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,100
Copy of it sitting a blockbuster and just go

1309
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:46,260
Never never how why why would I do it who likes it why

1310
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,620
and then I was like, you know what let's try it and

1311
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,480
There's some interesting stuff in it. It's a lot of like hooks going through skin

1312
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:00,980
I don't necessarily need to see hooks going through skin, but the return Oz is so much less

1313
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:08,620
Gross than that. It's but there is one thing that is so traumatic in my mind about return to Oz that I think you might know

1314
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:13,580
You might know it's not gonna be that traumatic though for you now, but as a kid as a kid I saw it

1315
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,580
That's why it's traumatic for me

1316
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:19,660
I'm looking at pictures of the gnome king and I don't like this guy at all

1317
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:27,140
You're not gonna like a lot of the characters. I really think I'm going to hate all of the characters. I think

1318
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:33,740
Griffin Newman and on blank check I think nodded to this when they were talking about silence of the lambs

1319
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,900
But I think in my head

1320
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:42,940
It's just that that that one poster of silence of the lambs where them there's them like the moth is on her mouth

1321
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:45,420
Yes, like I think I thought it was hellraiser

1322
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:52,700
I think I thought it was like a movie about a villain who like puts a moth on your mouth who changes your

1323
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,020
mouth into a moth

1324
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,140
Or the or that I didn't know what it was when I was six

1325
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,700
So maybe I thought Jodie Foster was like some kind of moth Queen. Well, she'd spit moths

1326
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,900
I think that's because I think maybe I thought it was like the fly. Oh

1327
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:12,620
Yeah, cuz I had seen cuz my friend Luke would his parents let him watch our rated movies

1328
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:17,300
Am I it was that like I was like forbidden from it, but we just never saw it

1329
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:22,660
So I thought that I couldn't see our rated movies. So I didn't really see our rated movies until I was in my like mid teens

1330
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,100
Sure

1331
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:29,540
So they felt like they felt like truly I would I might like I

1332
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,500
Might die if I see an R-rated movie before I was ready. I

1333
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,920
Yeah, I think I thought every one of these movies if you put it on would just be like plotless and it's just like

1334
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:50,580
People getting like whipped and tortured and torn apart on a rack for 90 straight minutes. Well now there's no stories. There's no characters. It's just

1335
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:55,780
Yes, from what I know of hellraiser. There is a lot of that, right?

1336
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:59,700
I mean you go beyond the world hellraiser of hellraiser is a lot of pleasure and pain

1337
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,820
There's a lot of again close-ups of skin

1338
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:08,060
With a hook going through it and like tearing the skin

1339
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:13,780
You're like, well, this is actually closer to what I maybe thought it was than some of the other movies where I went

1340
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:17,820
Oh, this is fine. This isn't that bad, but hell raisers pretty intense

1341
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,840
But not without some interesting not without some interesting things in it

1342
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,860
Hmm. Hmm. Well, maybe it's time. Let's face our fears. You watched the scariest movie hellraiser

1343
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:33,720
I'll watch the scariest movie returned which is rated PG. I think

1344
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,200
Bullshit I hate this rating. I think you scary. She's scary for 34 year olds. Yeah

1345
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,760
Here let's get back on the ground of some let's let's go to the opposite of

1346
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,560
Let's go back go way more pleasant than this

1347
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:58,160
Our our pal the dragon our else I have to make sure to say Elliot the dragon not it's one of those Frankenstein

1348
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:04,800
Things I think I still even though the title is Pete's dragon. I still look at him and I think oh look there's Pete

1349
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,040
I also know that's not right. I also think that

1350
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,800
Yeah, yeah

1351
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:16,820
I mean like truly special to me in a way. I can't further explain than I already did. I just try really

1352
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:22,980
Remember seeing this for when I was three years old and boy it just it made my heart glow

1353
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:27,980
I could not be more earnest in my affection for this thing and I I don't think I'm alone in that

1354
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,860
Yeah, I don't know. I know I have never seen the original Pete's dragon, which might be blasphemous

1355
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,960
And it's not because I was scared of it or anything. I just have never seen it

1356
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,900
but that dragon

1357
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,300
does

1358
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,460
Feel like I saw it and have some sort of attachment to it from childhood

1359
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,660
Very easy to mix up in my mind with sword in the stone

1360
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:53,180
Sure, he's dragging sword at the stone similar

1361
01:33:53,820 --> 01:34:00,980
Yeah, well, I mean it's well like the era but then one is live-action and one is all animated right

1362
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:07,940
But you could yeah all those from the round that era. I can kind of miss mix up a lot of things

1363
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,820
Yeah

1364
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:12,380
That's what is that within a few years or am I?

1365
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,900
Wrong

1366
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:19,120
They're a little they're a little far apart. That's like 60s and 70s. I think

1367
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:23,900
I'm not sure. I'm curious if people think Pete's dragon is good. I haven't revisited in a while

1368
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,740
I think I may have just liked it because it was around it might have been one of those. Yeah

1369
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,640
Well, the character is so cute and friendly looking

1370
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:38,240
It's like well and I mean as with all just like you know my any Star Wars affection

1371
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:43,000
Comes from the ride first I think I like Pete's dragon because he's in this parade

1372
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,520
Yeah, that's yeah, I could see that that makes a lot of sense. It might be better not to watch Pete's dragon, you know

1373
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:54,240
Just like have your perfect memory of this dragon is the one from the parade and

1374
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:00,880
He'll never go. Yeah, it'll never go away because the parade is gonna apparently come back for the rest of time

1375
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,600
Like they'll never they brought it back last year

1376
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,360
When the attendance was sluggish at Disneyland because of Galaxy's Edge

1377
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,160
Yeah, I people lose it I mean I

1378
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,960
Definitely have fallen for it, too

1379
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:23,040
It's like oh the electrical parades back like how many times have they done this and I still fall for this crap

1380
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,080
Yes, it's still and I yeah, but yeah when

1381
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,640
Mike when we went with Aaron and Lindsay

1382
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:37,400
Just like that that glow that comes from that opening note in the VOCA and and then you start seeing him look there they are it's

1383
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,520
Yeah, I don't know even if it is like a crass marketing move. Yeah, it still triggers something that is very pure

1384
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,360
It's yeah, they do it a lot. They're doing a lot. So I'm just saying yeah, you'll be able to see this dragon

1385
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,280
forever, I think

1386
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,280
Yeah

1387
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:01,620
I'd like to say that when they brought it back this most recent time a couple years ago

1388
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:08,640
I'll go out on a limb and say that commercial that they made in the warehouse where all of the characters live

1389
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:15,320
Like like the room of Disney magic that you have in your heart and the girl puts the last bulb on it

1390
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,480
I think that might be the best Disneyland commercial that there has ever been

1391
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:24,320
Yeah, it's up there like it's up there with like that's original Space Mountain commercial. Oh

1392
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,920
Oh hell which is such a

1393
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,120
Now yeah, well, thanks for reminding me all right number two

1394
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,980
Well, if it was a final four of Disneyland commercials, it would absolutely be in the final four. I think

1395
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:43,340
That's not a bad idea. That's not a bad. We haven't thought about that yet. I don't think yeah

1396
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:48,200
There's that Disney land Paris one with Donald running around with real ducks like that's very cute

1397
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:53,800
That is cute. I do like what a different song eras that I'm going to Disneyland

1398
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,040
There's like they've gone in and out of it. There's all the athlete things

1399
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:04,460
Oh you you guys had that too. They sang I'm going to Disney World in the marketing material

1400
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:08,520
I so I didn't realize they recorded both versions of it. They did both. Yeah

1401
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,120
Trick this

1402
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,000
But I don't know I that

1403
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,620
You know that ad though. I really I think they nailed I like like when when all the floats are

1404
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:27,540
Leaving like heading into the park with this glorious pink sky that really is like the ideal Disneyland we all

1405
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:36,420
You know we all imagine is there as opposed to just like it's a boring like warehouse back there. It's they did such a great

1406
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:39,180
It's what you want it to be backstage, you know

1407
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:44,560
Yeah, the cloak like the closest to that I've probably talked about on the show before it was the maybe

1408
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:49,140
2015 d23 where they had this Imagineering exhibit

1409
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:54,020
And it was it felt like that it felt like you just walked through

1410
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:59,540
The warehouse and it was like it had the big like it had the big weird Ben

1411
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,820
Is it Ben Franklin float from that weird 70s parade?

1412
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,360
Do you know what I'm playing? Oh, oh, right. All right. Yes. Yeah

1413
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,180
American parade or something. Yeah, I forget the name of it, but it was a big sandwich

1414
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:16,100
Yes, yes, it was a big sandwich. Oh, yeah now you have my attention

1415
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:24,500
Rex like the full the full-size Rex the like ride vehicles that felt like walking through

1416
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,740
I mean what I the commercial came after that but then I was like, oh, yeah that kind of reminded me of that exhibit at

1417
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:31,740
D23 which they had never

1418
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:36,340
The next year was like or the you know, two years after when they did the next one in 2017

1419
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:37,580
It was like

1420
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:42,940
Pirates of the Caribbean only and it was like half of the movie stuff and you're like, yeah

1421
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:46,380
I don't know if this is quite as good as two years ago

1422
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:51,340
Two years ago. I was so thrilled there two years before that

1423
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:54,100
I mean, I was so thrilled to walk through all that stuff and then I was like

1424
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,320
Well, it's cool to see like some of the ride vehicles and some of the pirate robots

1425
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:00,640
But I don't necessarily need to see Barbosa's jacket

1426
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:09,500
You don't want to see the headband that Keith Richards wore when he just shows up on screen for 30 seconds

1427
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:15,200
I yeah, I was not as thrilled to see that as I would have been to see some other like

1428
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:18,420
country bear busts or robots know I

1429
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:25,620
So they this first one away

1430
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:30,020
In 1996 in a very confusing way

1431
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:34,220
I don't really still don't really understand why they took it away

1432
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,300
But it was a big disaster and they replaced it with this thing light magic

1433
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:43,000
Please go to patreon.com slash pockets right will explain light magic. It was so much emotion in it

1434
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:50,260
Disappearing but but like why it was like it's felt like an absolutely arbitrary event to get rid of it

1435
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:56,460
They completely backfired because now they've just been plugging it in to like fix, you know

1436
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,280
Attendance problems ever since yes

1437
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:04,100
Yeah, I wonder I mean I I would imagine that like the people in charge

1438
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:09,100
Probably because of the janky nature of it, especially when it like when it started

1439
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,820
Then the nostalgia obviously wasn't there because it was new

1440
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:17,180
So I would imagine that maybe the people in charge and the people who were making it

1441
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:20,900
This is a guess but we're like all they saw was were the flaws of it

1442
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:27,260
All they saw were like, oh, yeah, this looks like shit like we got to make a much better version

1443
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:32,740
Whereas like people that came to the park were like this is great. We really like this and

1444
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,940
It's lasted for whatever reason, you know for so many years

1445
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:45,700
And I think yeah, they I don't think they realize it's it's because of what they were regarding as as crappy or or

1446
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:49,100
Tossed together. It's just what it's the character of

1447
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:55,820
Of what it is. Some things are meant to be super high-tech and some things are charmingly low-tech and that's what this thing is

1448
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:56,380
Yeah

1449
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:02,340
And boy did it backfire as will explain because what they put in was supposed to now here we here's a real parade

1450
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:05,860
Everyone hated it. I hate it. I'll say that

1451
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:12,140
Yes, I have to give them credit. I mean the the farewell season marketing like this billboard

1452
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:17,380
Now it's time to say goodbye. Okay, I get that, you know Mickey Mouse Club reference

1453
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:22,580
The farewell season logo like I get trying to drum up business

1454
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:30,500
This one with the two snails and the text we can't glow on like this is the grimace

1455
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,700
Seen

1456
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:39,620
Because they're smiling like they're smiling. It's saying we can't glow on like this

1457
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:43,580
They're cracking that is so upsetting

1458
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:47,300
It's a it's a forced smile. They're jokers

1459
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,980
David joker

1460
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:56,780
Bugs are joker fine joker fight. They can't go on like this. Oh, yeah, that's really morbid

1461
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:01,620
Wow good fine, yeah, that is oh my god, what a nightmare. Yeah

1462
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:06,020
We can't glow on like this like it's it's funny

1463
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:11,780
Like, you know how they say Wolverine when he pops his claws out it hurt and he says this is famously in the first X-Men

1464
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:16,740
Movie it hurts every time maybe these characters are just in pain doing this parade

1465
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,380
No, no, Michael

1466
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:25,300
Maybe the lights are just like it's really like hurting them. They're all kind of sentient

1467
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,220
Floats and they're just in constant pain. They're dizzy

1468
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:33,860
They're overheated and they just need to be put out to pasture

1469
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:37,940
The light is their blood. It's supposed to be inside

1470
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:49,340
Oh, they're leaking they're gonna run out they need transfusions the original the original Imagineers gave them consciousness

1471
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,340
Imagineers gave them consciousness

1472
01:42:54,860 --> 01:43:01,900
Walt was working on consciousness for the robots before he passed away and then they finally perfected they have perfected it in the 70s

1473
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:08,620
And the floats had the early version of the consciousness, but they could also feel pain. I

1474
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,940
Have to say a that y'all get into it over on the second gate

1475
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:21,880
There is a pre light magic pitch of what the the new parade was gonna be gonna be that isn't that far from

1476
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:25,100
Characters who are whose consciousness is like

1477
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:32,440
There is one of the creepiest worst ideas have ever and we'll I'll tease it for for over there. Yeah

1478
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:36,580
Hey, it's it gets it gets grim

1479
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,860
But of course the the parade

1480
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:47,700
You know kept going kept reappearing and but pretty quickly in fact it what it was 96 it went away it reared its head in

1481
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:52,700
1997 in one of the strangest events Disney ever did where it

1482
01:43:53,900 --> 01:44:01,100
Transformed it got a new name as it ran through Times Square in New York City and was called the Hercules

1483
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,500
Electrical parade. Yes

1484
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,220
Zero to hero, baby

1485
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,220
I

1486
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:17,900
This is so bizarre they did they did a whole deeply expensive weekend in New York City

1487
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:24,420
Promoting the release of Hercules several years prior having done a

1488
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:31,980
Like ginormous screening of Pocahontas in Central Park. So it was kind of a sequel to that

1489
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,900
I think slightly less pleasant films

1490
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,740
with

1491
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:41,360
Huge New York events that get in New Yorkers way and make them mad

1492
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:47,260
We got to do it again. I don't I mean, I'm not the first person to say this

1493
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:54,140
But I don't understand why they used that parade like Hercules is a movie wasn't this like neon

1494
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:56,940
light synth movie

1495
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:03,680
Not really no, they also made original Hercules floats that they never used again

1496
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:09,340
Like this one night one night one night this horrifying representation of Hades

1497
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,500
Which I'm assuming is what the inside of James Woods is

1498
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,300
Rotting brain looks like now

1499
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:21,340
But like yeah, they did from what I was reading they did this in

1500
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,700
1977 for the Pete's Dragon premiere

1501
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:31,020
Oh in New York, yeah Pete's Dragon premiered at Radio City musical and they did

1502
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:39,380
Some sort of whether it was the electrical parade, but they they did a similar event for that as well. Let's well document it

1503
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,220
Whoa

1504
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:44,940
That's crazy and I also found another strange

1505
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:47,660
Outside of its natural habitat

1506
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:52,780
Although you know what I'm realizing I think they made a big deal out of this thing and they said

1507
01:45:53,260 --> 01:46:00,060
This is the first time the Main Street Electrical Parade has been performed outside of Disneyland and that's it's bullshit if that

1508
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:05,580
If there was a another New York one then that that's one and then I found another one

1509
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:10,440
Which is it was the halftime show of the 1978 Orange Bowl

1510
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:17,060
Which I think is in Florida unless I might be confused you're right moves, but I think it's for

1511
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,860
and

1512
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,220
It's

1513
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,220
Find this video

1514
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,740
So it's it's really strange

1515
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:31,140
I mean like the floats will go through but the floats are obviously still extremely small in a football stadium

1516
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:37,700
So what it mostly becomes is people with like big electric umbrellas or something kind of like making shapes

1517
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:42,460
Just like walking around in circles and it only makes sense if you're in a helicopter point of view

1518
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:44,140
It's an it's insanely boring

1519
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:48,660
It was a pretty bad idea of a halftime show and then they bring out

1520
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:53,300
Pete and Elliot and Pete keeps they they give him dialogue

1521
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:58,220
He keeps saying like wow Elliot the Orange Bowl and he goes

1522
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,540
Wow, I've never seen so many people

1523
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,300
And just that

1524
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,500
infinitely really strange

1525
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:14,540
So it's a mixed bag seemingly the non Disneyland performances

1526
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:19,020
Did you catch the detail about the Times Square

1527
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:24,780
Turning off the lights for this. Did you catch? Yes. Yes. Go here. Go ahead this corporate

1528
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,780
I forget where I pulled this from

1529
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:32,180
but so they got Disney ran the electrical parade through Times Square and

1530
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:36,540
They got most of the businesses to turn their lights off

1531
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:41,420
So that parade could light up nicely all but one

1532
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:50,020
All the businesses complied with the exception of Warner Brothers who had a Warner Brothers retail store at the crossroads of 42nd Street

1533
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:57,260
And Broadway the lights eventually did go out at the Warner Brothers studio store when the chain went out of business shortly after that

1534
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,460
So I don't know what to fuck you man. Like that's not cool

1535
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,620
People lost their job. That's not a

1536
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:10,500
Newspaper writer humor in the 90s was rough stuff like very bad

1537
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:16,660
But maybe someone was like the light while someone was trying to like fill in the coloring book

1538
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,140
screen of like a picture of Taz

1539
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:22,140
Like maybe they needed to do that

1540
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:29,340
That's my brother's stores where you were like coloring digital coloring books on screens

1541
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:35,360
We we got to do the full Warner Brothers studio store episode because

1542
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,780
did I share these with you or was I saving it for the idea of doing this that I found a bunch of

1543
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,140
internal use

1544
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:48,220
Music videos made by people from different Warner Brothers studio store franchises

1545
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:51,800
There was like a music video contest for an award show

1546
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:55,500
where like they all got together and like did a like a

1547
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:01,740
medley of grease songs but changed the lyrics to be about like stocking shelves and like

1548
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:04,020
We're out of Taz dolls

1549
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,700
Wow

1550
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:14,020
You told us about the award show I don't know that I dug down into it enough to see the music videos yet. Oh

1551
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:17,560
It's so good. They're gonna be an episode just about the award show

1552
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:21,220
Yeah, Joel Schumacher comes out in the middle of promoting

1553
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:27,180
Batman and Robin and could not be more cocky about the suit and like you guys are gonna love it and there's so much

1554
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:34,580
Oh the toys we're gonna make so much money you guys we are gonna be flush with cash. He's just like top tier

1555
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:40,300
Most confident anybody could ever be no idea what's coming for that movie

1556
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:45,140
Yeah, that's great. What yeah this I love those stores

1557
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:52,100
I'll say a Trump is part of all that to Trump is it was an owner of several or they were like in his Atlantic City hotels

1558
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:57,740
Yes, that's correct. It's yeah. Yeah, there's a lot there and we should do that one soon. Yeah

1559
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:01,300
But as for this one, you know, what else about?

1560
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:08,020
Time Square, I mean, yeah, they had to it took seven days to get it to New York City for one performance

1561
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:12,440
And they you know, they filled in potholes. They paid

1562
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:17,220
$500,000 to fill but I mean the whole thing cost five thousand five hundred thousand dollars

1563
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:21,300
But like yeah, they had to do like they had to fix up the city to make this possible

1564
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:29,180
This is a Disney vacation of Times Square era. So they were like spending money left and right on like family-friendly events. I

1565
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:35,900
Will say the Hades float is cool is very cool. Yes. Yeah, I

1566
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:41,340
Also am I also think it's they did do the to honor America at the end as well

1567
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:47,600
Which is funny. Hey, which is like it's a promotional float for their movie

1568
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:53,580
Do you need like the the patriotism at the end of your promotion for a movie a?

1569
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:58,720
Movie set in ancient Greece. Yes. Thank you set in ancient Greece

1570
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:01,180
I

1571
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:06,740
Roam is it right? I always I never know who's who yeah, he's Rome. He's Roman I think

1572
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:10,340
Yeah, that doesn't

1573
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:14,180
Quite make sense, but I bet boy. I bet mayor Rudy

1574
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:21,460
Watch that America float go by and remind him of the country love so dear and that he'll do anything to protect

1575
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:24,420
Rudy should have been on the float with the gold pants

1576
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,420
Oh

1577
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:31,860
Rudy Rudy covered in Christmas lights with gold pants waving to everyone

1578
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:36,860
With an electric toupee with an electric to neon electric toupee

1579
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,380
What?

1580
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:41,380
Alright calling for fan art

1581
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:46,220
You know what? Wait, let me let me not call for fan art. Let me call for Photoshop

1582
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:52,500
Let me call that. Yeah. Yeah, let me call it up. Be real Photoshop of Rudy Giuliani

1583
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:57,220
With gold pants Christmas lights and a neon to pay

1584
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:01,020
standing next to Mickey and Minnie on the to honor America float and

1585
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:03,540
specifically the New York City

1586
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,580
Hercules

1587
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:06,580
electrical parade from 1997

1588
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,340
That's my official. Yeah, it's

1589
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:18,620
Specific assets. It's tough. But yeah, I I think everyone's up to the challenge and if you're listening to this still in quarantine times

1590
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:23,260
You like us our board is held. Yeah, so get to work Photoshop experts fill your

1591
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,860
Fill your time. I also

1592
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:33,460
I would say a full episode about the Disney vacation of Times Square. Oh, yeah, that's good a very fun one

1593
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,460
Let's put that in the queue, too

1594
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:41,020
But yeah, this was certainly the one of the most fun zones of that

1595
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:47,860
Seen by a million people it ran over four times the length of the typical Main Street electrical parade

1596
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:50,100
They really did it. They really

1597
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:57,660
Got some people to go to Hercules in theaters not enough but some but some

1598
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:59,820
Oh

1599
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:01,140
Yeah

1600
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:06,380
Well, what else about this thing? I mean, it's hey, it's it'll be very happy. It'll be back

1601
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:09,580
It'll certainly be back. It might be back. I would

1602
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,180
Should I I'll predict it now I bet when

1603
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:20,060
Everything opens back up dizzy. It's like hey looks look what's back come back, please

1604
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:24,700
I would I would have to think so and we'll think that it's grass but

1605
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,660
We're all

1606
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:33,700
I'm gonna say I think they're gonna wait on it for some sort of a lull because I think like

1607
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,500
For insane people like us when the park opens up

1608
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:41,700
It's gonna just be like the biggest attendance day of all time that first day

1609
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,300
So I feel like maybe they wait

1610
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:50,140
To bring it back for like another lull a time, but maybe we'll see

1611
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:53,140
They got to find some way to do it

1612
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:57,220
digitally virtually for all of us sitting in our

1613
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,060
separate apartments

1614
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:06,420
There is a full 2019 live webcast of that version of it on YouTube

1615
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,660
The official Disney parks channel

1616
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,340
That's nice. Oh good

1617
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:16,300
I'm glad to hear that I like that. They've been doing all this stuff like here's a really nice multicam

1618
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:21,600
Tokyo phantasmic like those kind of things they've been digging up to to entertain us

1619
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:28,060
Have been appreciated. I guess we hey we didn't say also that it was it was also used as like a quick fix

1620
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,660
Fuck fuck fuck. Let's save

1621
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,180
California adventure

1622
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:37,780
Which has no Main Street they put it over in like Paradise Pier and

1623
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,020
Called it the

1624
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:46,580
Disney's electrical parade. Yeah, they had a rebrand for that quick a California classic a California California

1625
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:51,180
Classic I guess that's really what you got to say about it at the end of the day

1626
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:56,040
It's a California classic whether or not it's in New York or Florida. It's always a California classic

1627
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:59,540
I was interested to learn I'm going through some random things

1628
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:04,260
I was interested to learn the Baroque hoedown is used in the ending theme of a Mexican sitcom

1629
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:07,940
From the seven from the 70s. That's fun

1630
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,940
Yeah, Wow

1631
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:13,480
One of those guys I forget which though

1632
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:18,960
There's another Perry Kingsley song that I think is the theme song to the game show the jokers wild

1633
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:24,180
Oh, I might be getting the game show wrong. No, that's it jokers wild. Yeah

1634
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:26,180
I

1635
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:31,940
Met check out that in sound from way out there all it's also good all these dumbles and songs are delightful

1636
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:36,980
I can find no evidence just from a brief search that Liberace saw the electrical parade

1637
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:41,740
But I will still I will hunt I will still hunt

1638
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:50,120
He though when I googled Liberace Disneyland he did describe himself as a one-man Disneyland

1639
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:56,400
Sure fair enough he has an out he has an album called my parade of golden favorites

1640
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,520
He has an album called that so

1641
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:06,100
He is also a one-man parade also Liberace episode eventually

1642
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,200
There's no way

1643
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:15,280
Like themed entertainment and Liberace places to go. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on board with it. I'm like writing them down

1644
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,720
I got a little got a literal list

1645
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,120
I'm excited for all of these

1646
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,000
I

1647
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,660
What do we what do we leave people with I'm tempted to

1648
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:28,200
Mike you should screw around and see if you could do it

1649
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,800
Maybe I could do it on top of the what I'd really like is to for the music on this to go out with

1650
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,680
Like can we take the can one of us with our?

1651
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,720
our keyboards at home

1652
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:45,720
Incorporate two brothers into Baroque. Oh down. Oh, yeah, I I'll try. Yeah, I'll try I think I think it shouldn't be hard

1653
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:49,920
I think it should be that hard. It's not gonna be amazing. I'm not gonna spend like weeks on it, but

1654
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:53,400
Certainly not

1655
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,680
You might be right

1656
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:02,280
Yeah, the downtown Disney ordeal theme was getting into guns and roses Chinese democracy

1657
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:10,120
Territory theme my god here's version 27 that theme is still only like 50% of what I wanted it to be to be honest

1658
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:14,720
Yeah, I still at a certain point in length release the demos

1659
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:18,600
Release the devos. I have a lot of said a lot of

1660
