1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dog.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Warning! Before you can listen to this podcast, we have to scan you for Pandoran micro parasites.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mmm, you've all got them.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But don't worry, you're in good hands.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've enlisted the Dr. Stevens from the Avatar Flight of Passage pre-show.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once he's matched to a microphone, we can start to talk.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And, uh, podcast.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We welcome David Danapour to the final Feliz Navidad, The Way of Winter, on Podcast The Ride.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome to the final Feliz Navidad, The Way of Winter, a Yuletide celebration of all things Avatar here on Podcast The Ride.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A podcast series that will soon end, after which, sadly, we will be in Kansas anymore.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm Scott Gardner.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's about the reaction that deserves.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm really like, I'm trying to think about what it means.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, I know what it means, but the actual words itself.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The grammar was so next level.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It was so, uh, so wrong that it was a new type of grammar that worked.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I would need to see it on a piece of paper to really decipher it.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Uh, yes, I'm here.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm looking at it on paper. It's not helping me.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, just text it to me and I'll look.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Mike Carlson, for the last time, I see you.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I see you.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sharon, I see you.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I see you.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see you.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sounds more like I see you.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, like I see you.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Medical trouble.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Um, no, no, no.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We are wrapping up our Avatar celebration here.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Um, and by now, The Way of Water has made a billion dollars.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And I would like to think that The Way of Winter has done similarly for us.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And our influencer check from James is coming in.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
James Cameron, I'm sure.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Knowing that so many phrases we've contributed to the way.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wait, wait, wait.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We haven't talked on the show about the new one because we gave them the word mighties in the movie.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You called it the mighty Akron.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then now there is the weekend song.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And the week, wait, I already don't remember what it is.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's the phrase in strength?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You give me strength.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The thing that our character, the sector keeper, our real book, I, we know the sector keeper.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's a real character.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
All right.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He sure is.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Um, they're after it.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They're listening to podcast, the rides, catchphrases and incorporating that is crazy.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The weekend is doing a song that's the title of it is a catchphrase from our show.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They're not.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I mean, I don't think we're not crazy enough to think that he's actually stealing it from it.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But the coincidence.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's getting a little unreal.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Um, I well, and you know what?

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But like so much of this little journey and talking about avatar for a little while has been about kind of just like steeping in the culture and finding it together and making the cultural embed much talked about cultural impact together.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And maybe, maybe it's what if it's not coincidences?

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What if we are part of it?

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What if, what if it's the cultural impact of avatar is going to be helped by the cultural impact of podcasts?

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The rock.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, I think you're right.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And then in a certain like in a future movie, there'll be like a character named Jason eating a hot dog or something.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And it'll continue and continue and continue until the three of us are in one of them.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe I don't know.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I we can we can only hope so.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I mean, were that to happen?

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, you know what?

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There was a tease I read.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think like that fifth one might take place on earth or something.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's going to come back.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think they have to come fight like nature.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Nature is that the nature?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's the name of the character?

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's here.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's here.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Jesus.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, we are nothing.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Edit that out.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So that sounds good.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It says something about her learning about Earth.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Whoa.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But he but Earth sucks.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I know in future you just want to go there.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's a bad idea.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, but a recipe for some fun.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I look for I'm up for whatever it is because my love of this franchise has grown only while we've been doing this.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hope you guys feel similarly.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And if we were somehow to be lucky enough to end up being part of the franchise,

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
then and only then would we be close to something achieved by our guest today,

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
who is an actual part of the don't shake your head as if that's not no.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Bill just said you are you are a genuine part of the Avatar mythology.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A character in the way in the characters way beyond all the events of the films even.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We'll talk about it.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'm so excited.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's here to close out the series.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't think of a cooler way to do it.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You may have seen him on The Good Place on Westworld or on the dropout.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you have definitely seen him in the pre show of Avatar Flight of Passage at Disney's Animal Kingdom.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The gentleman who plays Dr. Stevens himself, David Danipour.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hi.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, thank you guys.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you, Michael, Jason and Scott.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks for it.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We should have the name tags.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no, I know your names.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've been listening to the podcast.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thanks.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So funny.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You guys are so funny.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I was saying it earlier and I'll say it again since it's recording now.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, OK.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You guys have great voices.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's like you guys are like radio hosts.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It feels it sounds like you guys are, you know, moving on up.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, thanks.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is a nice thing to say, because I do.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's not something I would think that we have is like the slickness.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And that's the thing with radio hosts look down on podcasters for for not being able to like, you know, read a five second promo or talk up a song like you would talk up.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't stop believing on the radio and like coming in here.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's journey with don't stop believing where they throw it away right before this journey.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We don't believe in.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, but that's like that's only like a five second job.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You guys are doing like that's a good guys are doing 90 minutes of like, you know, sure.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, thank you.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's nice to hear.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I mean, if anyone wants to give us like traditional DJ jobs, I think we're interested.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, it'll be like Wolfman Jack or you guys want avatar jobs and.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK, we're getting greedy.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're complimenting us because you haven't heard those episodes where we just ask, will you hire us to write this or be in this or half the show?

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Three words, pal.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Work for scale.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You want to be the new cousin, Bruce's is what I'm saying.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because I did a tweet, which I should have deleted, but I left it on.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And sometimes I get like, why did I do that?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I like tweeted at James Cameron and I was like, hey, if you need a scientist, put me in your movie.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And they got like five likes.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And that's great.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I would have liked that if I.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think it's still up.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OK, let's make all the listeners find the tree as full of her nation.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, Clifford, a Wilbur.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You tweet the tweets on the day everyone will go to our Twitter.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They'll follow you and then they'll retweet it.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And let's get this on this guy's radar.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
OK.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's do it.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, then let's also retweet one of your tweets that let's let's do one for you guys in the movie and then let's all worry about us later.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, we don't want to be greedy.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Here's what we'll try to get a number five.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We'll try to get you in three or four.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They're filming for now.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let us will tweet at the Wolfman Jack estate and will say, let us do be the new Wolfman Jack.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is state the intellectual property from the voice.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And we're assuming that any like any deceased person has an estate.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And we're also assuming that any listener knows who Wolfman Jack is.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I picked one of those relevant DJs of all time.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Graffiti, right?

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
American graffiti.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, American graffiti.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's true.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He lives on in the.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For the last 20 years, I heard he dislike would they anytime you thought you heard his radio show was just like clips that they had recorded and they were just randomly play them and piece it together.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Like he was barely he was not showing up for shows.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This one's a rocker.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, it didn't matter.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's into this one.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I believe that's what the current politics are not ideal.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is Wolfman Jack and I am a ghost in the machine.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Truly what he was.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We'll do one of those two.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll do one of those.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Fair, fair.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But we'll look.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, there's there's compliments come on your way to because we love your performance in this ride so much.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think we actually have to be first bit of business.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We have to thank you for giving us all the material for the Orlando live show that we did where we essentially recited everything that you had to say on that day.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It was it was I listened to it.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I had a friend whose name is also Scott and he was he told me about that podcast and he's like, oh, you should listen to it because they're talking about you.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We shout you out.

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, no, no.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, I listen to it.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
At one point, I think it was you, Scott.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're like, before we start the, you know, mild roasting, I just want to say I know David DeAndre for and like, you know, he's great.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And, you know, I love him.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And OK, now let's begin.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm glad that registered and I'm glad you I'm glad you know nothing.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We didn't do anything in the aftermath that made you not want to come here.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, no, no.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, I mean, I messaged you right after that because like, oh my God, that's Scott.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I remember you, you know, coming to the shows with for improv shows sometimes, sometimes some shows.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sure.

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The significant other of the performer will come to a lot of the shows.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And yes.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And you were on a team with Aaron, my wife, who did improv for a little while and super funny.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And and and so I saw you do you guys were on a team together.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I saw you do improv a bunch of times and I am not I'm certainly not making the supper.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's like revisionist history.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think Aaron can attest that there when there whatever the first time I saw the show you were in, I definitely afterwards like, who is that guy?

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like you got that you got that lift.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, thank you.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because you had this you were just so like natural, but like and like willing to play kind of like odd energies that were not anything like what anybody else on stage was doing.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You were just like on a wavelength that was just like this is like naturally.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This isn't just like thinking of funny stuff.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is like the guy being really funny.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, yeah.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I really did feel that way.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just I was just, you know, acting like myself.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But thank you.

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, no, no.

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you would hide in performance.

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But thank you.

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, I forget.

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What was the question there?

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or is there a question?

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Maybe we're just talking about how this all well, this all came together.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This all came together in a nice way.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And then, yeah, you follow me and then we wrote each other and it was like, oh, this is perfect because we had just begun this celebration of Avatar.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Flee is Navi dot.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I'm thinking about it anyway.

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Ever since then, I'm like, it's got to be a way for David to come on.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And this is perfect.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A full examination of of your performance of Dr. Stevens.

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, and one more thing just before we dive in, because I've also liked in recent interaction with you that we had to push this because I got COVID and you were giving me tips on this and telling me to explore getting the Pax Lovid, which the then the insurance was like, yeah, you're fine.

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You don't need that.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're so it doesn't sound like you're bad enough.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't sound shitty enough on the phone.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So we're not going to give you the so I just get through it in a regular way.

249
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I was glad I tried.

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You actually did make me you helped me make the phone call, which I showed.

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There's something else was prescribed.

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It was mildly helpful.

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Anyway, not cool.

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Insurance.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They're trying.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hear that's having a lot with Pax Lovid is they're trying to feel like if they have any hoarding it for the higher risk categories.

258
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That might be it.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, I didn't have a good like stat and lie about.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't play a character who needed it.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You should have lied with all wheezing off and stuff.

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, you also got it in a time when I think a lot of people got it right after Thanksgiving.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's a good point.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When I got it, I don't think they were just like, no one's taking this.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Right.

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Take it.

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, it's funny how it goes in and out of people caring or thinking about it, myself included.

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was like, that old thing that what is this?

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I love the 2020s.

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There's no covid anymore.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then there you go.

272
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I got it.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But you are land.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The show is so funny.

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think it made me a little intimidated to come on because you guys were so funny.

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I'm glad there's no audience because I think you guys would be, you know, it would then it's like you got to compete like, oh, wow.

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
These guys are making all these.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I wish I had if you would come out in that audience, you would have people.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, God, I know what else to get to you.

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It would be you would have lived.

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
OK, we'll get to the another avenue of this later, but I'll get you to I'll get you to the comments sections of things.

283
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, I'm so curious.

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're wondering.

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You may have seen the dark side of people's opinions.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, God, what a tease.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, OK, just just to wrap up what I was saying on the light side of it.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How nice it's been talking to you and I appreciate getting that advice.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I like that you gave me a little spell of advice and then finished it by saying, but don't take it from me.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm not a doctor.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I just play one in Avatar flight of passage.

292
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I was so delighted to read that email.

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's kind of in this in this odd medical because, you know, you came up another time on the show in a brief window where we thought the pandemic was bad enough that we were willing to do Twitch streams.

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We tried a lot of work.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes, that's what we found annoying.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
A lot of work.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
One that we did was we did a competition and NCAA style brackets for that we called the fake doctor final four and Dr.

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Stevens was a candidate in the we made sure that you were competing to be for the title of best fake theme park doctor.

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't I don't know.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I knew that I know that I threw the results of it because the Muppet one and I thought that was boring.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I might have been gunning for Dr. Stevens.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't recall. I'd have to look it up.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't remember anything about who won.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, you guys should know before I am not attached to the, you know, Dr. Stevens being like loved or not loved.

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Right. Right.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You guys can like go full full honesty.

307
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's like I want to hear, you know, like, like I want to hear the, you know, the like the honest.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Right. Right.

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You could be nice to but also also I'm in the mood for nothing.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I like being roasted, I guess.

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, OK. OK. OK.

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I didn't I don't think any of us thought we're going to do like an Isaac Chotner like New Yorker take down of you.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, well, yeah.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We can Dennis Miller over here.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I didn't think we were going to do an Isaac Chotner or a babe.

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, I think well, I when we were down there for that show and we were staying for a few days, I think, Mike, you had been to the Pandora section of the park before.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes, I've I've been multiple times.

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes. And Scott, you and I, that was our first time ever.

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So to a certain extent, we experienced your character and performance together.

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't know.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Here's what I'll say.

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is the closest you're going to get to me as far as a roast.

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And it's not anything that I don't think it's actually a roast that depending on if the ride breaks down, they make it seem like you don't know what's going on sometimes.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But that's the ride making you seem like you're like a scientist, but you have no clue what's happening in the lab.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And that's the closest it ever gets because some people would be like this.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Say you're a dad and you think that guy is actually helping.

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is a real guy.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Nothing fake here.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
One out of 50 dads might think that.

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Like, oh, this guy was that was right.

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think that was Joe roadie's idea.

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's a great idea.

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He was like after everything was shot.

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He was like, OK, now we're going to do one for when we don't know how long people have to wait.

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And so he's like, so you're just going to be like, I'm going to come right back and like leave.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah. And then and then and then I would I go off stage or offset and then I come back like 10 seconds later.

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But, you know, they edit it.

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So it's like it looks like yes, I came back a lot.

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They can do it as long as they want.

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And he was just giggling.

342
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He was just like, this is going to be so great when it actually happens in the park.

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It happened.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think one of the first times I did ever did the ride and it took forever.

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They scanned your character came on screen left screen.

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I swear it happened like maybe twice where you left.

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, again, if one out of 50 dads who like thinks maybe you're like a ride operator, but you're sort of like plant, like maybe this is live.

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're like, I don't know. This guy doesn't know what he's doing.

349
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The scientist is really something's broken.

350
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He has he needs to fix this.

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They're fitting it on you.

352
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's like I there's somewhere I'm trying to be and it's this guy's fault.

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This dweeb won't let me pass this door.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll take it.

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Just, you know, he keeps scanning me.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There's the vibration thing keeps going off.

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How many times do you need to scan me for germs?

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So it keeps it keeps doing everything.

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I believe once it scanned me twice at least.

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, wow.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But it was like and then when you do it for the first time, you're like a little long.

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like you don't know how long it's supposed to be.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But yeah, it was definitely a long new set.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah. And of course, and I don't know if I'm getting ahead the move, move your arms around a little, which is an iconic line.

365
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And I don't even say that facetiously or anything.

366
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Truly. That's like if you're a nerd for this stuff, you're like, it's a good line.

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's a memorable line.

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But that happened a lot in this stretch of like the ride.

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Something was wrong with the ride.

370
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They never tell you certainly when we were together, we got a couple move your arms around.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think when we rode it.

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I bet that's what it is in general is people feeling like that you like that they are what they've been watching you for 15 minutes.

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And that's probably where you're responsible.

374
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think even if people are consciously thinking about it in the back of their mind, they're like, this guy's got to hurry it up.

375
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So that's what it is.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Dr. Stevens is the fall guy for the long wait.

377
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They're like, we've got to.

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, we've got to pin that on something.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We've got to be mad at somebody.

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's not usually a specific person to do it.

381
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All of the ride technicians, what are they called?

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They're players or cast members.

383
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All the cast members are like, hey, Dr. Stevens, it's his fault.

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Take it up with this guy.

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Throw a drink at the screen if you need to.

386
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They should have done it like the Mr. Potato Head animatronic where you got to roast people in line and there were generic roasts.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So somebody like it would just be like, hey, look at your hat.

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's pretty silly, right?

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We got to scan that for germs.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I wish.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I wish.

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's funny.

393
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I wish.

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's redo it.

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's redo it and add something like that in.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sure.

397
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And of course you get royalties for that.

398
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Of course.

399
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The same royalties I get.

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Right.

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I was going to say.

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So we're going to be rolling in money.

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If I had to guess, knowing anyone's history with appearing in these kinds of things, that would have been my guess.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Disney's kind of like, Garrett, and here you go.

405
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There's one thing once and goodbye.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, in a way they sort of had to pay me more because they messed up.

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So like I did the shoot and then I get a call like three weeks later and they're like, oh, we need you to come in to do some ADR.

411
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Like we just want to add some stuff in.

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So I go in into this like small ADR booth and I think it was in the where the Imagineer offices are on.

413
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Wow.

414
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Where is that?

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Flowers?

416
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Flowers.

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Flowers.

419
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And you know, it was like 10 minutes.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They just needed me to add like one line or two lines of like safety, like some sort of legal stuff.

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Right.

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Then I go home three, four weeks later.

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I get another call like, David, it's not your fault.

424
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
We need you to do ADR again.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I was like, OK.

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They're like, no, no, you don't understand.

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You have to do the whole thing.

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Wow.

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I had to dub the entire thing.

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And this time we went to like a really sophisticated, fancy ADR studio where there's like a huge theater screen.

431
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Like that's where they do all the like Disney, like the actual Disney movies.

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Whoa.

433
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah. So I'm there for like eight to 10 hours.

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Jesus.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like dubbing my own voice.

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And they want all the uhs and ums.

437
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So it's like it's I think it sounds a little like not as authentic as it should have sounded like when you sit when you were when you first acted it out because I'm just like trying to, you know, and um, you know, and then also they're like, can you can you make it a little more energetic?

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So so it's like the voice probably doesn't match my face in some interesting some like intuitive way, you know, like people watching right just get a little like something's off.

439
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Like that adds it makes like whereas it was kind of like maybe downbeat and naturalistic the first time and then you add to add this thing.

440
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So the combo makes it like just gives it this odd.

441
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah. What is up with this guy?

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah. Super. So it's super odd after that.

443
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And but they but I got paid so much more.

444
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh wow. Yeah.

445
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah. For all the multiple days.

446
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's awesome.

447
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah. And and yeah I mean overall I didn't get paid that much more.

448
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

449
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I wonder if I'm allowed I don't know if I'm allowed to say how much maybe I can give a it's like it's like closures.

450
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's like six months, five months of rent.

451
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's better than I thought.

452
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

453
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Actually. Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay.

456
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Not a great place but like a decent place.

457
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

458
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I you know it kind of makes sense what you're like having to dub yourself you know ADR stuff can be very difficult and stuff but I always saw it like watching it for the first couple of times.

459
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I was like oh this is a fun choice for this character because he's a scientist who probably does not spend all day in front of the camera.

460
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So he's like you know who's not a polished broadcaster as referred to at the beginning.

461
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, you're a real you're a real guy.

462
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You're not a camera, an on camera presence.

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No, he's intelligent and he knows what he's talking about but maybe doesn't do presentations all the time.

464
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I would say it's very charming.

465
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Right, right. Yeah.

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, that that that was what they were going for.

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So you got that on the on the nose.

469
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, they wanted.

470
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They wanted me to be a little fumbling which which was easy because they like gave me all these new lines on the day of.

471
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And then not only that but they wanted me to do it out of order.

472
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And so they're like okay now do this part first and then do that part.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I'm like oh well that's not the way I had just you know.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Learned it.

476
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And they wouldn't give you a card.

477
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know that I had I had a monitor sorry teleprompter which was I think an iPad that was like jigged up.

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But it was here and the camera was right in front of me and they're like try not to look please look directly into the camera.

479
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So I would do takes where I would look at it and they'd be like no no no no no look directly into the camera.

480
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah.

481
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wow.

482
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah.

483
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And what you're doing is all I think that's the craziest thing about it is that like you are responsible for introducing so many elements of this world and this like you have to let people know about scanning for micro parasites and the doctor Ogden.

484
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Restarted the Avatar program and that and that we call it a crime but we call them banshees.

485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's like it's so many things like those are not easy things to like individually to keep it here let alone to like shuffle around.

486
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Right.

487
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Right.

488
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah.

489
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's not like you know it's not normal vernacular.

490
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

491
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah.

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Right.

493
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh which also wait.

494
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So the one question is not that it would have helped because I've like.

495
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But I guess OK.

496
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
My guess is did you know Avatar at all before this.

497
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I watched the movie and I thought the first movie was I thought well it was James depending on.

498
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
No let's just be honest here.

499
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I thought it was good but like not super memorable.

500
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So it's weird because when I watched it I was like oh this is a pretty good movie you know.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But for some reason it never stuck around in my mind as some other movies it didn't like stick deep.

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah.

504
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't know if that's because they're just using the same formulas as some other movies do like once they just don't surprise you and just keep the same formulas they might not.

505
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Sure.

506
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And with you maybe.

507
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

508
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But yeah I mean I knew the movie I knew that there was avatars and like you know you control them by getting plugged in somehow.

509
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

510
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So I got the basics.

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But then it's not like you could have easily.

512
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh this is the part where I talk about a week on that or as we call them banshee.

513
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

514
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like that part I didn't remember from the movie.

515
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't even know if it's in the movie.

516
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

517
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We've only our weird avatar thing is kind of it's bubbled up like I feel like very early in the podcast we started talking about it because of the land and the ride that you're part of.

518
00:25:45,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And then it like I think just by repetition and like just that it kept coming up like that's the only reason we all ended up kind of liking the whole thing is just like we've just like stood in it so much and now I am fond of these like what happened.

519
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We went around this like merry-go-round so many times.

520
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Now I do know it.

521
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I do know the characters and I do like them.

522
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But what a weird thing that like for a movie and a franchise to need like you.

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But what you have to do is just weirdly think about it for 13 years and then it'll kick in and you'll start to like let it simmer on the stove for 13 years.

524
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then it's right.

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's like it's like a fine wine or an aged whiskey.

526
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's what it is.

527
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's why I like it so much.

528
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Right.

529
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Right.

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I one other thing I have to say before we move on from that you having to repeat the whole thing.

531
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We talked about this on the show a while back.

532
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The the ride test track which is at Epcot.

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't know if you've ever been on it but it's it's a like you it's presented by General Motors and you drive a car really fast.

534
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There is a there used to be this big intro with a bunch of jargon from like a scientist and that was played by John Michael Higgins great comedic actor who I got to work with once.

535
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And of course I'm like oh you want to talk with that ride.

536
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And this whole story was I did the whole thing.

537
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I had to say all this complicated stuff and it was big long takes and it was really hard to do.

538
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And then a couple of weeks went by and they said I need to do ADR.

539
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I went in and it looks to just a few lines.

540
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
No no no the entire thing.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The exact thing that happened to you.

542
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm shocked that this you're telling this story when this is the exactly what happened on this other ride years ago.

543
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh my gosh.

544
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We need to have like a group like a therapy group for for for for for for those coping with Disney World shoots.

545
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You know what you should do.

546
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
There's a band of all like actors on it's called like the band from TV with Greg Grunberg and he plays drums.

547
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You should have a band with all the other guys and girls and everybody in the intro video.

548
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Patrick Warburton.

549
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Gary Sinise.

550
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think these people are all musicians by the way.

551
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes.

552
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
John Michael Higgins.

553
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm working on my violin so maybe I can work that in.

554
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Or maybe I'll do percussions.

555
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you play anything?

556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I mean no.

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I did violin in elementary school and you know I just I just we just had a daughter.

558
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And so I'm like oh I should probably get into some music.

559
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And so I started like I bought like the cheapest violin.

560
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Bad idea because it doesn't sound that great.

561
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And then you know I started like practicing a little bit and doesn't sound good.

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So you know you can do lullabies and like Dave Matthews band songs and stuff.

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Maybe. Yeah I should I should learn sounds a little.

564
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah.

565
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Twinkle twinkle little stars at my level.

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's nice.

567
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's good.

568
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's something.

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I guess one question to ask is to go back to the beginning.

570
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How are the the basic stuff like how did you come to be part of this to begin with.

571
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh OK.

572
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah.

573
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I auditioned through Actors Access which is like a casting website.

574
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So it's it was basically not a cattle call where like anyone can go but it was like an

575
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
open submission so anyone could submit.

576
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You didn't have to have an agent and it was listed as theme park workshop.

577
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So like I because of this podcast I went back and reread the email and it had asked us to

578
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you know dress comfortably.

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't wear any lab stuff because we'll provide it for you and be prepared to do improv.

580
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I remember when I went there it's like they didn't care about the lines.

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
They just want you to just sort of workshop with them.

582
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh yeah.

583
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And so the audition was like a workshop where you just for 10 minutes you just sort of did

584
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
all the you know different variations of the of the audition with them.

585
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And then what are you talking about in there because it's not bad with our stuff.

586
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I wouldn't imagine.

587
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah it was it was just like it was basically everything except Avatar.

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So like the micro parasites.

589
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh yeah.

590
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

591
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Or like yeah you guys you all have them.

592
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I think that was part of the audition.

593
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's just like you guys all have them but don't worry but you do have them.

594
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And then you know it's just like I just started talking about whatever you know.

595
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh they go through photosynthesis which is you know when the when the sun creates when

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
they're able to produce energy but we're using the sun.

597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Well you don't need to know that.

598
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You just need to know you're safe.

599
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You know it's just it's just improv.

600
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And then I didn't hear anything for like two months.

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And then I get a call from from my agent.

602
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I think it was my agent.

603
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It was probably an email and it just said they want you to audition again for grad student.

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This time it was called grad student.

605
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

606
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And then I went in and this time they wanted you to get all the words right and just did it.

607
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And then same script essentially.

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And and that was it.

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then didn't hear again from them for like a month.

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then they just called and said you know we want you to play this character.

611
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I didn't know it was for Disney.

612
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I was trying to figure out which theme park it was for.

613
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I was thinking maybe you know Universal or like Knott's Berry Farm.

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But I for some reason I didn't think Disney because I couldn't think of any Disney characters.

615
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Right.

616
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That would fit like this sort of scientist guy.

617
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh sure.

618
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You know and then it isn't.

619
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Disney movies.

620
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Non Disney at the time.

621
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah.

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh weird.

623
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

624
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Wow.

625
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I love the like successfully getting through the layers of like a mysterious project that

626
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
has to be a pretty cool thing as an actor to do.

627
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah.

628
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I mean it's always good when they want you to do something.

629
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah.

630
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But yeah.

631
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then and then I went to do the shoot.

632
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No no no.

633
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You know there was a lot of prep for it because they wanted to do the wardrobe and I got I

634
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
went into the Imagineering Studios.

635
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The one on flowers.

636
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Flowers.

637
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Flowers.

638
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Flowers.

639
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Flowers street.

640
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah.

641
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Flowers street.

642
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And it's like that place is like a dream world because everyone there is so passionate you

643
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
can tell about their job and they're so meticulous and specific with how they want things done

644
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,800
and but they're also open to like suggestions from each other so it's a very collaborative.

645
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,000
And I also remember there was like a Starbucks there they kept policemen like do you want

646
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
something from Starbucks?

647
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,700
There's like a Starbucks inside the facility and everything's free from that Starbucks

648
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,440
for everyone so it's like everything's on your tab on their tab but I don't drink coffee

649
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,400
or anything so I just go no I don't need it and they kept going but it's free it's

650
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
like anything you want it's free.

651
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I gotta make something up.

652
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Muffin?

653
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Do they offer a muffin?

654
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,980
No no muffin no I know yeah anything you wanted anything from a Starbucks was there for you

655
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,780
to take for free for everyone not it wasn't just me it was like free for all the workers.

656
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,380
And a workplace where everyone's doing like insane next level stuff and they're all excited

657
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,540
to be there and Starbucks is free.

658
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,660
This is great to hear about.

659
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,020
Would you guys ever want to do stuff an Imagineer type job?

660
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,660
We've only begged on the show many times.

661
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,220
I'd see if I could fit it in.

662
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,060
It's a weird genuinely I'm always like well where do I fit into that because none of us

663
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,940
are engineers the second half of the word we can imagine but the geneering part is where

664
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,500
it gets tougher for me and I have no literal like heart skill when you think about the

665
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,300
level of like a Joe Roddy we'll talk about like who I'm sure like if he like if his whole

666
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,380
career ended at just like he's an incredible matte painter or mural painter like he was

667
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,820
good enough to be that alone so I like I think having the specific skill sets is probably

668
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,620
the toughest thing.

669
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,140
Two friends of ours I think we can say right because it was tweeted about two friends of

670
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,260
ours rode a ride that's coming to Universal.

671
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,060
So like that aspect where it's something that's like the mini we're talking about Van Robe

672
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,300
Show and Evan Susser wrote Dominion's Ride.

673
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,620
We're saying yeah VillainCon.

674
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,740
So Evan and Van you've heard them on the show.

675
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,300
Friends of the show are right amazing.

676
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Pretty crazy.

677
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
Yeah.

678
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,660
So like in that like they wrote a lot of I think I don't know if I'm going to get jokes

679
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,280
and stuff and like set up.

680
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,400
They're not crunching numbers or anything.

681
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,200
So like in that aspect I believe yeah this would this would be great.

682
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,640
Now do I also think I could maybe conceptualize a new ride.

683
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Yes I do think that.

684
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,040
But I'm just saying I think from like at least from a standpoint of like oh if not to Barry

685
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,840
Farma at some like simple little thing where we need we could write some fun copy and come

686
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
up with a scenario.

687
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,240
Yeah I love anything like that is a dream.

688
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,160
Yeah because you already pitched some good stuff here for the Avatar ride that making

689
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,880
fun of things would have been great.

690
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Dr. Stevens Rose.

691
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,800
Well wait I just thought of what it could be.

692
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,400
It's like hang on we have to scan for something.

693
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,840
An ugly hat.

694
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
You have one.

695
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Great.

696
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Perfect.

697
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Oh yeah.

698
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,680
These are good auditions for that job.

699
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Yeah yeah yeah.

700
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,520
So we're trying to illustrate it by Doug.

701
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,160
Well and the specific thing that you got to do which is like I've always been obsessed

702
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,280
like somebody being in the video that plays all day every day somewhere.

703
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,760
Something that happened on this show once was that I found an opening somehow successfully

704
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,080
to film a video where I was an astronaut that played in a Fry's electronics in Anaheim

705
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,920
for two days before it closed.

706
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
And this was me trying to do what you got to do.

707
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,400
I was just like if I could get any weird just for two days that's great.

708
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,800
That's a dream come true.

709
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
So this thing where like I'm a guy and I'm telling you rules about something and make

710
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,120
sure you press the button.

711
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
And it was like fake.

712
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,560
It was like a make a wish thing they made up for me.

713
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,960
But it was still it was like the coolest thing ever.

714
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,360
So what you got to do this thing where like you're playing into infinity forever.

715
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,040
It's it's it's it's so impressive that I'm very impressed.

716
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Well thanks.

717
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Yeah.

718
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,680
So you were so was it like a commercial for Fry's electronic where you were an astronaut

719
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,840
that was like so confusing by this TV or something.

720
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,480
There might be a whole there's Fry's electronics things behind you in here.

721
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
I went to a fry.

722
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,920
I really like fries electronics in general because they had all these great themes.

723
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,680
It was a themed electronics store and the one in Anaheim was space themed.

724
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,560
And I went into it one day and there was a video that played where a guy is like we're

725
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,200
about to launch and you need to press the red button to make sure that we have a successful

726
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
launch.

727
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,340
They're really mini version of what you did for real.

728
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,360
And I was like why is this playing only here in this one store.

729
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,440
That's so weird.

730
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Maybe this is my chance.

731
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Let's red tape.

732
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
I don't have to go through.

733
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,360
I don't have to do the workshops and all this stuff you had to jump through.

734
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm not a real actor so I don't have to prove that I'm a real actor.

735
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,520
So somehow we got a hold of Fry's people and they were like yeah the store is closing anyway.

736
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
It's fine.

737
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Put it in there.

738
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,280
And they played it for a weekend before it is as all the listeners know about this already.

739
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Wow.

740
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,000
So you made it independently and then gave it to them to play.

741
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
We tweeted it.

742
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We tweeted it out.

743
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,480
And then our listeners were like this maybe shows that this is the way we can maybe help

744
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,160
you out and try to get you in an amateur film.

745
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,240
Our listeners were like Fry's you got to see this.

746
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,140
Boy Fry's this video is great.

747
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,920
And then it genuinely did make it to somebody deep in the Fry's.

748
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,800
I don't think I've even said the whole I can't say everything about this but it had to go

749
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,560
all the way up the flagpole.

750
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,640
It actually did and that's it.

751
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,760
All I'm at liberty to say but somebody very powerful had to go.

752
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
All right.

753
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Why not.

754
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
That's great.

755
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah.

756
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,280
Let's try to get a scientist spec thing together and to get us on Avatar.

757
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Yeah.

758
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Sure.

759
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
We do our own workshop.

760
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Yeah.

761
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Yeah.

762
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
These guys improvise.

763
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,680
I'll try to fake my way through it.

764
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
You'll be fine.

765
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I'll do it.

766
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,200
I'll just repeat all my astronaut stuff.

767
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,280
Maybe if we just put our like make it and we record it on a VHS we slip it to a cast

768
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,680
member on the ride and one day for some reason there's four scientists in their lab.

769
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
That would be hilarious.

770
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Scanning for germs.

771
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Yeah.

772
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
That would be great.

773
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Come on.

774
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,600
I have to consult with Dr. Robinson and Dr. Miller.

775
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Dr. Miller.

776
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Dr. Jones.

777
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Are you the hot dog Dr. Miller?

778
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Yeah I was.

779
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
In the lab?

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,280
And now it's a bumbling set of four scientists.

781
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
I do like this.

782
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,760
Disney Creative Campus locked down today after mysterious VHS dropped at the mail drop.

783
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Were there secret messages in it?

784
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Was it a bomb?

785
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Was it a threat?

786
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
VHS.

787
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,640
It's like we don't know what's in it because we don't have a VCR.

788
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,440
We don't know how to play this.

789
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,200
There's no way to find out where the technology is not here.

790
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,920
One of the three fillases in the valley where we could play this VHS thanks to being the

791
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,720
second largest media company in the world.

792
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,280
So you do get through all the layers of this and you wait first of all it's like it's prep

793
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,360
and it's shooting you're out here on the Engineering Campus.

794
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
That's all a dream.

795
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,560
That's crazy.

796
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
And then the shoot.

797
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
What's the shoot like?

798
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,440
Oh the shoot was great.

799
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:14,120
They rented out a sound stage in North Hollywood or Sun Valley area.

800
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,680
And they set up the stages.

801
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,560
They had Dr. Ogden's stage.

802
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,160
And the woman that plays her was great.

803
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,240
She was also in a bunch of other stuff.

804
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,360
I think maybe just that's her voice.

805
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
I forget what else she's in.

806
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:35,400
But she was sort of like you know like sort of like being around the block like oh yeah

807
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,760
this is your first Disney shoot.

808
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Wow really?

809
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I don't care.

810
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,760
No no no in a good way.

811
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,640
But it was like oh yeah this is my first.

812
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Wow.

813
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,120
She's showing you the road.

814
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,920
She's like oh I got stories.

815
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,480
Yeah she's like I'm also in I forget some other ride she does the voice for.

816
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
We don't know this.

817
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I feel like god it sounds familiar.

818
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,640
I mean I've forgotten stuff but that's interesting.

819
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,560
Maybe it's in Disneyland where she does the voice.

820
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,160
So I can figure it out.

821
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,080
It's possible we did a whole episode on this and I forgot.

822
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Yeah yeah it happens a lot.

823
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,640
They're not the easiest thing to find credits for at attractions.

824
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,360
Yeah yeah that's true.

825
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,800
But that's cool because Dr. Ogden is your mentor and Dr. Stevens now that we know specifically

826
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,120
Dr. Stevens is a grad student so who may be.

827
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
That's a question.

828
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,720
Do you have it in your head that maybe you like looked up to Dr. Ogden?

829
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,800
Yeah yeah yeah that was part of it.

830
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,040
She's someone I looked up to and they really wanted me to keep you know saying her name

831
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,960
like I look up to her.

832
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,400
I don't know if it comes through that I keep saying Dr. Ogden.

833
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
We noticed.

834
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,120
That's one of the funniest that you're in this room for so long and we are getting all this

835
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,680
information and about worlds and cultures and you're gonna fly but then within that

836
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,560
you need to know that Dr. Ogden is great.

837
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,840
Dr. Ogden wrote a book.

838
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,360
Dr. Ogden restarted the program.

839
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,200
So that's funny it was similar it was funny to do to read all that.

840
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,120
It's coming back to me now they're just like you really look up to Dr. Ogden.

841
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Dr. Ogden.

842
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Okay.

843
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:16,320
We have talked about before like man they really like Dr. Ogden.

844
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:25,840
Do you think that Dr. Stevens got ever got to meet Dr. Ogden or was there a distance

845
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,160
was it somebody you like read in grad school or like did you have a relationship or did

846
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,960
she blow you off in the office?

847
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,360
Do you have any sense of further mythology?

848
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh you mean like the backstory of Dr. Stevens and Dr. Ogden?

849
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,280
Yeah okay yeah coming from me and how I played it it was yes we had like training back in

850
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,560
the home base wherever that is and then I got shipped to like Antarctica like some sort

851
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,840
of remote station where I'm just sort of explaining things to people and I'm like all alone and

852
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,800
so that's why it's like oh I haven't talked to people in a long time so this is why I'm

853
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,200
sort of you know talking to people like this because I'm just isolated it's just you know

854
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,200
oh people yeah I know how to talk to you yeah so this is what you do.

855
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,080
This is what you were playing the feeling that all of everyone had coming out of the

856
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,720
pandemic like yes I know how to be at a party I can talk how have you been how is your life

857
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,600
like we were all everyone was like Dr. Stevens after all that.

858
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh yeah after the pandemic everyone was yeah a lot of strange behaviors.

859
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah the first part the first party genuinely I went to the first half hour I'm like are

860
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,680
you a maniac what are you have you not said sentences in your life every lights are shining

861
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,660
I'm like I'm recoiling I want to go in a cave.

862
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,040
They made a funny SNL sketch about this I don't know if you guys saw the there was like

863
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,560
an SNL sketch video about so yeah it was it was it was funny a lot not all their stuff

864
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:09,760
is great but this one was sorry I mean I love you but some of this stuff is you know you

865
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,120
do it every week so it's hard yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

866
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,720
if they're batting 250 then that's you only remember the good stuff from the compilation

867
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,800
we like what we grew up with in high school.

868
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,480
Go back that was your favorite that was your favorite cast.

869
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,760
The actress Dr. Ogden was her name is at the top of the page Allison Blanchard and she

870
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,160
was the it's it says luggage scan computer in star tours.

871
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,520
Oh so does that mean that's not the there's the Patrick Warburg robot but then there's

872
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,320
is it like midway through the line.

873
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,760
So yeah there's some voices checking in.

874
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,000
There's the x-ray if yeah with the robot but I can't remember if that how audible those

875
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
lines are.

876
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,520
So that might be something she did yeah yeah yeah there before you uh well you get getting

877
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,360
into that I guess that's a that's a huge question probably a lot of people have is like the

878
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,000
awkwardness that was completely a designed that is a that was that was what they wanted

879
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,480
that's a choice it's what you were you were going for.

880
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:20,640
Um yeah yeah I mean if you if you judge my baseline as this and then see how far away

881
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,800
Dr. Stevens is I mean it's sort of a little bit you know it's like always part of you

882
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,880
how you are so yeah I mean it's it's just like an extension of that I just played on

883
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,960
it a little more plus the dubbing you know made it extra awkward probably yeah or maybe

884
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,820
not I don't know maybe the dubbing didn't make it awkward it's just in my mind it's

885
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,960
just like right that's not that's not my voice like this doesn't match but they're just like

886
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,760
no no it's perfect yeah if it's the yeah the weird thing must be like the rhythm of saying

887
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,020
the ums like having to like remember like you don't know your own vocal patterns that

888
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:02,000
well to like no no no it was a quarter of a second before the um not a half second yeah

889
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it's I mean it's like doing a karaoke with oh yeah because the words are there and there's

890
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,160
like a little bar that you have to like try to match and it's just sounds right there's

891
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,240
something visual yeah yeah oh yeah these places that they try to give you all the help you

892
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,240
can there's like there's a beep and then there's like this line going through of like where

893
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,640
the where sorry hit the mic where it where the words are like where you should say them

894
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,000
and then the words are underneath and it's just like karaoke basically with your own

895
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,480
interesting I wonder if this is common with all these ride videos for some weird reason

896
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,560
yeah what is the why do they need the timing wise or something like is it like did they

897
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,360
like speed it up a half second or something or a quarter of a second and then like you

898
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,360
know come like come in and do it a little faster like I wonder I wonder what yeah why

899
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,200
that might be common I mean my theory is just that they don't shoot a lot of stuff like

900
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,080
like Imagineers do a lot of stuff but one of the things they don't do is like film production

901
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,600
and they don't hire a sound guy maybe this they don't hire any sound guy yeah they don't

902
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,120
know a good guy they need a good guy where was the guy holding the stick thing oh we

903
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:26,480
didn't have them yeah so who's making the call this time it's like I'll call the actor

904
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,720
you get it then you get it in 15 years when this happens again oh go back to the imagineering

905
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,080
thing I didn't see anyone there that looked like an engineer that like builds things they

906
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:41,240
were all like artistic right so I think it's a lot in the name like sure just add the engineer

907
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:48,040
so so you guys have a lot of potential posts to fill look direct I've directed for television

908
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,560
I would love I've also I've made ride videos for rides that don't exist I've done every

909
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,440
possible yeah every possible addition for this kind of thing and then it's and now I'm hearing

910
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,040
that they can't I've done things with a sound person I know how to get the sound right can

911
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,760
I sound engineer this podcast that's where what am I talking about you do it all the time you've

912
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:12,520
logged kidding me thousands of hours I guess what I'm auditioning for is to run sound on ride

913
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,120
videos you'd love it though I know you'd like to go higher than that but when you do to be there

914
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,320
to watch every raw take of every video say this the sound person is always the most interesting

915
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,560
person on set hmm they're just always for some reason like I'm like this person's lived the life

916
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,920
like yeah like there's something about people that are obsessed with sound that makes them

917
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,200
more interesting I know that seems vague but it's truly I don't have a specific type of person I'm

918
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,200
talking about it just always there's somebody's hyper focused on sound and I'm always like oh

919
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,960
okay sound this is the sound person is I agree with you and I think there's also just in the

920
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,480
way they like you see them working with equipment or like hooking up your mic or someone else's

921
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,880
mic it's that kind of quiet confidence that like if you if you have a regular mechanic and they

922
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,200
just start doing stuff without looking at it yeah it's interesting I don't know why that is but the

923
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,920
guy who did all the sound for everything at Funny or Die was the used to be the drummer for Yngwie

924
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,600
Malmsteen perfect so he's in like old like you know crazy European hair metal videos in the early

925
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,680
90s wow that's what you're after yes like is what I'm after yeah this guy must have a story oh yeah

926
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:31,120
that's a good one um but anyway uh but back to the shoot I'm sure what other stuff about well I

927
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,280
was asking about like the the awkwardness in the case you know this I think maybe has to be

928
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,760
brought up a phrase that has not been said yet in this episode and that phrase is you know what

929
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:50,400
I'm going for uh uh uh fly uh and this this clearly is that I think there's a couple iconic

930
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,280
things that you say in this but that that takes the cake and you've probably I imagine this has

931
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,240
come back to you in a it's on t-pub people have made shirts yeah and shirts and yeah I've got

932
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,040
friends send me links to these shirts yeah is that legal can they do that not technically yeah I don't

933
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,120
know though it's if it's not oh I guess I guess if it's like that's a phrase in the world you can say

934
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,880
uh fly yeah as long as it's not like a picture of an acron on it yeah is there I wonder if I should

935
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,640
sell I maybe I should do and a shirt or something that sounds legal I think so yeah I think you're

936
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,200
fine on that and we know look that for a long time at least until this new movie the avatar font

937
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,760
papyrus and that's just free on every computer so you can use papyrus without a problem hey real

938
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,920
real retweet it yeah yeah of course yeah I mean or maybe and uh podcast the ride shirts

939
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,160
oh man that was exciting to hear we'll split the revenue but yeah yeah it's it's a it's a it's a

940
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,960
it was I guess it was improvised but come on it's just a line it's not really like you know

941
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,120
it was improvised though I don't know that's pretty big it I mean I just sort of rephrased the line

942
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,520
I forget what it was was it just and fly and I added uh or was it maybe that's it maybe that

943
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,600
was it and I probably don't remember super well because you did not expect that to be the thing

944
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,680
that is latched onto hey I just remember whatever the line was before that I started saying and I'll

945
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,320
fly and and uh I think Joe roadie was like keep that keep that you know he's whoa I love that whoa

946
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,680
well because we're full in Chris Farley show mode right now yes I know absolutely

947
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
uh

948
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:42,000
well I didn't know who Joe roadie was I just knew he was like the passionate guy on set with like

949
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,520
yeah like a lot of stuff on his ears and like I was like oh this guy's different and he's really

950
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,720
into everything because there was like three directors there was Joe roadie there was like

951
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,520
some guy from Disney and then there was like another guy from Disney but from different

952
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,120
departments I don't know if one of them's like corporate Disney and one was like theme park

953
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,240
Disney and then it's like Joe roadie is like the creative guy that's like trying to push for the

954
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:12,160
creative ideas right uh so there's like three voices you know do this do this do this coming

955
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,600
up to me each time yeah is that confusing it's very confusing yeah you have to like figure out

956
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,240
who's the guy in charge it's sort of like commercials you guys have done commercials where

957
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,480
you're like who's the guy in charge yes I just listened to whoever whoever last told me what to

958
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,640
do anyone can tell you anything I'll do it yeah exactly the last person to tell you something

959
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,040
you're like got it the camera you're telling me like go in the front of the camera and say these

960
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,880
and I go like yes yeah yeah in that case sometimes the most unnerving thing is when the director is

961
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,560
very chill and laid back and just like I'll just try it a few ways well we'll record it all whatever

962
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:56,480
and you're like oh but what is what are the people from hostess have to say there's about

963
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,240
a dozen of them by the way Jason I saw your hulu you your hulu commercial it's so good

964
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,800
yeah it's like actually pretty funny you know and you're like perfect in there you're just like

965
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:14,960
oh what about plus uh hulu plus yeah that was one where it's like everyone was an improv uh train

966
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,360
performer and actor and everyone was very chill and uh it was really nice time yeah so I don't

967
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,920
know if you're allowed to talk about this we can edit it out right yeah sure okay yeah so so everyone

968
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,320
did you guys all improvise that together like with your pitches of like hulu I they did a lot of alts

969
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,320
like everyone tossed out a bunch so they had a bunch to go and then there was like 15 second

970
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:47,040
version of the spot 30 second version uh try this ending okay try this ending um there is a bunch of

971
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:56,480
endings where it is uh said that I am the main guy's nephew uh and everyone got gets mad at me

972
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,400
because they didn't know I was in nepotism higher the the main guy being the guys like give me ideas

973
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:10,320
the lead the ringleader guy yeah who also we we later learned that like um uh we were talking

974
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:16,160
about UCB and stuff and he he brought up our friend Zach Reno who's been on this show before

975
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,800
and he's like oh I performed his wedding and I was like I was at that wedding so we were in the same

976
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:31,280
place before oh wow wow so mild nepotism mild yeah so so yeah a few degrees of separation

977
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:37,920
that's a hell of a backstory yeah yeah they're not clear to the hulu ad viewers no now you know

978
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,320
yeah you know all the secrets of dr steven's and if uh yeah I don't know if you're allowed to

979
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,200
because you always sign all this stuff but it's like who cares you know but also I don't want to

980
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:56,640
give you money back um what I want to say about the the uh fly thing well first of all like because

981
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,920
roadie I feel like has helped make it a thing because you retweeted so that there was like a

982
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,680
poll of you can all right here's three sort of like what we did three like pre-ride videos or

983
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,080
doctor people and you can only keep one and and roadie himself said has to be the uh fly guy

984
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,040
and which I love seeing because his typical I guess as you experience you met the man you

985
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,480
worked with the man he his his typical mode seems to be like flowery language big eloquent

986
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,280
paragraphs so seeing him say something as blunt as the uh fly guy I thought was kind of charmingly

987
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,200
off brand yeah and he must have enjoyed getting like the the props from him for that oh yeah yeah

988
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:44,000
he's he was like the most supportive person on set like he made me feel really confident because he

989
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,440
it was like the opposite of what you're saying where the director doesn't say anything he was

990
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,440
just saying I love he would he would be like dr argh agden is straight is like a straight like not

991
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:00,560
straight but you know um uh traditional sort of type of character like a sort of traditional

992
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,160
high status character that do you get at the parks and he's like and then this character is

993
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,480
just sort of you know all over the place it's like I love it I love it it's gonna it's gonna

994
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,320
blow their minds because he wanted to blow he wanted people to be like you know this isn't

995
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,760
normal Disney stuff that that's what he was saying and like the whole time I'm like so you're saying

996
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,240
I'm not doing like it's not polished like and you like it you know it's like okay

997
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,560
but he was like he was just you know very encouraging yeah huh yeah he like he kind of

998
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,880
like caught how you were generally doing it and said keep going further in that direction

999
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,920
and you like you sort of like found this mode for it together right right that's pretty cool yeah

1000
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:51,360
he also do you know that he did this big instagram post about dr stevens and why it's

1001
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,080
important to the fabric of the ride have you come across this I got tagged I think

1002
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,920
yeah yeah I think I remember reading it what it was positive right it was it was very positive

1003
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,200
and we've we've talked on the show a lot about Joe roadies posts as I was saying he'd like

1004
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,680
some little things some like the you know a frame of a picture a detail up on the roof he will

1005
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,160
here is a long long rationale for why this is important yeah that it is the way that it is

1006
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,000
and this I don't I can't I don't want to read the entire thing but it's a big breakdown

1007
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,360
specifically of uh but then it gets into other stuff about about your performance let me just

1008
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,480
let me do some of it uh how I love that the word uh is so pivotal to the characterization and plot

1009
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,040
that it must be translated for people who cannot hear meaning that it's in the captions

1010
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:52,000
it's in the closed captions on the ride and that a distorted fish eye lens view of an ill shaven man

1011
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,520
who seems unsure of what to say is the preamble to a major theme park experience at animal kingdom

1012
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,440
we're always trying to place our design in that right place where you're not quite sure is this

1013
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,600
really real is it supposed to be real but it's not real is this a mistake and I'm not supposed

1014
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,360
to be seeing it like it ties into his greater animal kingdom feelings about well when is it

1015
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,880
contrived and when is it just nature being nature and how do we trick you like he's including your

1016
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,200
beard the choice of your facial hair in like in the fabric of why the the ride is successful

1017
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,600
yeah I mean that was their choice they you know they told me to come in ill shaven wow yeah wow

1018
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:42,880
ill shaven it was on the on the notes before the before was that literally no no it wasn't that

1019
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,440
they said to come in you know with some stubble I think sure maybe was the word

1020
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,680
uh regular person says it ill shaven it's very judgmental that was the only the barest roasting

1021
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,920
of you on this episode is the the implication that you were not good at shaving yeah yeah but it was

1022
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,720
a choice yeah it was yeah because you know you always go on set with like a razor and like

1023
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,880
you know whatever because they're always like uh keep it or let's shave it or maybe just a mustache

1024
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,440
I've never done a mustache maybe I should do a mustache I've never done a mustache it'd be a

1025
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,520
tie you'll probably get something specifically because of the at least one thing we want that

1026
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,840
mustache guy yeah Jason's mustache is pretty good oh thanks yeah and yours yours is a full beard

1027
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,520
I got a full beard yeah Jason I mean Jason sort of I guess Jason has a goatee-ish

1028
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:40,800
I during during like lockdown era pandemic I would shave just the mustache like I was just well

1029
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,120
just as like when you would come up with ways to amuse yourself I was like I'm gonna try having

1030
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:51,200
a mustache for a while and I remember Mike we got on a zoom once and he went well we'll talk about

1031
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,560
it

1032
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,560
and then we never did it never came up yeah I forgot I forgot I was like oh he's gonna make this the

1033
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,200
first I made I may have thought like oh wow look how different it is and then as soon as we started

1034
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,400
I go no it's good and that's how you've always had it like I may have just absorbed it I well I

1035
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,600
think I shaped all the rest of the beard off except a mustache I just accepted it I mean the

1036
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,600
history Jason you've ended up having to be on edge probably in every episode of I have done

1037
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:31,120
something two percent different that surely this will take up 15 minutes you're never gonna believe

1038
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:36,720
how they say this word in southeast Pennsylvania and we're gonna talk about it 10 percent of the

1039
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,920
podcast is just saying what word did you say I really is I feel like if I ever met anyone from

1040
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,320
that area it would never come up it's just it's always unfamiliar to me it's all new to me it

1041
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:52,880
bleeds into my real life because Jane Jane is started calling out when I say milk

1042
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,720
is it more of a milk it's it's more okay yeah it kind of sounds like me lk right she's like

1043
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:09,600
milk milk you repeat and you can't think yeah what's the simpsons up and at them

1044
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,440
yeah the goggles do nothing

1045
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,440
I was thinking about a simpsons thing in relation to all that that you being

1046
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,200
getting this thing that you improvised becoming a he's this guy he's the a flag guy this is similar

1047
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:39,280
to Bart being the I didn't do it guy right is it weird in any context to be like

1048
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:47,760
to have that phrase in your head like the something guy uh you know it's not weird to me

1049
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,200
because the only way I hear about is if I have to do an active search online I have to do like

1050
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,280
and uh fly in quotations and then and then I can start but like I would not have known about any

1051
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,480
of this unless like friends send me links right so it's not like something I think about but when

1052
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:11,600
I do go and read the the stuff uh yeah sometimes it's like there's like you guys are making me feel

1053
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:17,280
good but I've I've gone and read the comments sometimes and there's like a lot of you know

1054
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:27,600
there's some people that uh prefer dr stevens be uh removed and oh no no never yeah and like

1055
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:35,600
sometimes it's you it's usually um you know my weaker stages of time to time we become weak and

1056
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,920
sure it's usually late at night and you're just like oh I haven't googled myself in a while yeah

1057
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,280
and you just like do a little google and then you're like oh this didn't bother me that much

1058
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,200
I can go further and you start you know look looking further and further and then you and then

1059
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:57,920
you start it starts like hurting your feelings a little bit um and to the point where you're like

1060
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,000
you start clicking on their profile and like trying to see like whether their comment is of value

1061
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,400
you know it's like oh well they only have 13 followers this comment that you count um uh it's

1062
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,600
all negative I shouldn't be doing it and but but now I've gotten better at it where it's like I'm

1063
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,720
okay it's like it doesn't hurt my feelings anymore as much yeah we'll see then then what happens is

1064
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,080
I start digging more and more until I find one that that hits uh like you need to kind of like

1065
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,880
get the little zap yeah almost like I just want to I don't know I gotta feel it a tiny bit and then

1066
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:38,080
I'll like oh I remember once I I clicked on some guy and it's the guy that co-wrote the pixel movie

1067
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:45,120
have you remember that movie pixel yeah it's with adam sandler yeah yeah the guy hates the pre-show

1068
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:52,320
what dr stevens yeah he hates him and it's and it's like I'm just like why why is this guy like

1069
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,040
why does he care about it so much that he has to like tweet I guess he's like a super disney fan

1070
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:03,760
and like it's it's messing with his vision of the way disney should be but um we gotta find this

1071
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,320
comment yeah it's uh oh I know these names there's two writers it's like the younger writer guy

1072
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:15,120
there's there's two writers one of them I've heard of this person okay okay yeah but then

1073
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:22,400
but then I started looking up dirt on him and then I'm like okay so you're gonna dis me let me go see

1074
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,040
some sure and then I looked up I was like oh pixel won a razzie a razzie is an award for the worst

1075
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:34,320
movie yeah I was gonna say you didn't have to go very far to get to the phrase co-writer pixels

1076
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:42,000
it's right in there isn't it yeah come on co-writer of pixel yeah so it's like I have to find

1077
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:51,280
something to like to level off the that that's my yeah unhealthy hat therapy of of that so do you

1078
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,280
find enough positive or just like for being having fun with it that it feels better than this is this

1079
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,360
is the whole thing for you has been more fun than than not you know the positive always comes in

1080
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:10,320
person like I went to um a uh uh give the kids a village is a non-profit oh right yeah in orlando

1081
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,680
give kids the world give the kids the world okay yes and so they they had this big convention

1082
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:24,160
where they wanted to you know fly in all of these disney uh persons like the uh I think it was the

1083
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:31,040
voice of aladdin or maybe it's the voice of little mermaid you know all of these different disney uh

1084
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,040
people notable performers notable performers thank you you're the professional you know how to

1085
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:43,760
how to extract what what i'm trying to say uh and and uh one of the and uh see I guess I just do it

1086
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:50,800
normally um one of the one of the panels were the theme park um theme park theme park specific

1087
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,600
yeah yeah and so I went there with and I don't I don't really go to Disneyland or Disney World so

1088
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,560
I don't really know oh yeah yeah yeah but there was like the woman from the haunted

1089
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:09,280
mansion and then there was the fig the fig puppet fig fig fig fig the dragon yeah yeah uh-huh he

1090
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,800
was super nice he because so it's like so so I'm going and I'm and I was talking I was like so what

1091
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:23,360
it's okay I didn't finish the story um ah sorry guys no no so so give the kids the world oh yeah

1092
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:31,040
yeah I've created this um convention where all the money goes to their foundation to help the

1093
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,760
kids that they help and so you know I went out there and then the people that actually saw the

1094
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:44,480
panel were very uh uh loving and yeah gave a lot of praise so I guess in real life the interactions

1095
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,680
I got were all positive but you know how uh the internet and twitter and all that stuff is oh yeah

1096
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,800
do you guys ever read bad comments about the podcast the ride or if there were

1097
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,800
no we don't get fixated on every bad thing that gets said any mild criticism

1098
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:11,440
well the two things I I have feel like I've had a couple reactions one it's every now and then

1099
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,080
you just double check yeah the other person's post and and sometimes you go like oh they're insane

1100
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,400
nice don't have to worry about this and then the other is like they hone in on something so

1101
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:29,200
particular so odd and then it's just like I never I'm not insecure about this because it never would

1102
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,960
have occurred to me to even be remotely insecure about this so yeah yeah fair enough if you don't

1103
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,920
relate to it at all and who care yeah it's tougher if it's something you you care about or something

1104
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:47,920
I mean you know what's a scarring moment in podcast history for me that almost got me off

1105
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,120
of doing podcast it almost made me go I don't like doing podcasts before we started doing this

1106
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,760
podcast with many many episodes when I was on I was on the show dough boys which is a podcast

1107
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,560
about chain restaurants I was a guest on it and I felt comfortable when it started but then when

1108
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,360
it began I was like wait I've never really been on a podcast have I oh I'm sure it'll be fine

1109
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:13,040
the next day a comment or somebody tags me on twitter and says say um and like more motherfucker

1110
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:21,760
just in my replies and it truly made me like well I will stay out of that game forever and a

1111
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,720
I'm so glad I I didn't but to bring it back to to your performance and uh like you told us this stuff

1112
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,280
about being sounding like slick and broadcasters I don't feel that way at all and I like that you

1113
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:38,320
did this like non-polished performance with an uh with an iconic uh in it as somebody who does

1114
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,200
say it from time to time but he still wants to try to be funny in front of a microphone it's nice to

1115
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:50,800
have a uh celebrated people to like it a lot yeah for sure I'll uh I'll take that thank you yeah

1116
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,200
it's a nice moment for the for the unpolished in general yeah

1117
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:02,160
yeah and on your your character is an unpolished hero I guess oh yeah standing up for all the

1118
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,520
unpolished having an impressive job it's it's right it's interesting because again I truly mean

1119
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:14,400
it like when yeah because you felt it like meeting theme park fans who are some of the most rabid

1120
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,680
fans of anything but does it feel like you should be like doing the con of convention circuit no

1121
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,560
right I don't know I don't I think I the way I think of it is like I'm only

1122
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:32,720
in like recognizable in Orlando like in that area certainly maybe those specific conventions

1123
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,120
but like there's Anaheim wonder con stuff like that I don't know I don't know maybe I'll

1124
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,760
like people we know around everybody listens to show it would be so psyched yes that's

1125
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,760
absolutely absolutely true I think people are going to be very excited to hear you on the show

1126
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:52,080
yeah yeah I hope so I hope uh I hope uh I hope they there's another tweet that I got so I get

1127
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,600
tagged on stuff yeah so then I look at it one of them was there's like three pictures of different

1128
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:05,040
Disney uh scientists yeah one of them is putty from yeah yeah yeah and then one of them is uh

1129
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,440
this other person that I don't know and then there's me and then it was like Mary F kill

1130
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:23,520
Dr. Stevens was killed so you know um I haven't seen the other people I mean the putty is like

1131
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,760
you know he's looked he's pretty good looking I guess uh they're traditionally using their

1132
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,560
marrying putty or their uh fucking putty I don't because I don't know his like character's name

1133
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,040
I'm thinking there doesn't have a name I don't know yeah maybe but then what isn't if it's

1134
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,680
Wallace Langham in the ride dinosaur which is my guess I think it was Dr. Seeker I believe

1135
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,520
doctor that's a crazy choice Dr. Seeker is a slime ball that's not somebody that's who you kill you

1136
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,480
would be the least popular Dr. Stevens with no ill intention for anybody you're a guy doing your job

1137
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,480
I think you're a Mary oh thank you thank you I think you have sex with putty

1138
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:09,040
with Dr. Seeker sleazy in Vegas and that's I guess what people are thinking maybe

1139
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,400
putty's more of the like uh you have a I'm just saying putty now I said he's the character but uh

1140
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:20,000
this is a tough choice and when it's a group of three that's what we are I don't want it don't

1141
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,640
kill me or f in the pilot or whatever the hell he's a pilot right yeah yeah

1142
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:36,000
so unnamed pilot thing unnamed uh soaring pilot and I'm marrying Dr. Stevens oh um that's that's

1143
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,160
very nice I think that's the universally correct choice I'm not I think yeah I totally agree

1144
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,640
the um there's one there's another tweet that I don't think is a mean I don't think I'm I'm uh

1145
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,360
I'll offend you by saying this but I was curious anybody's Dr. Stevens tweets and here's one from

1146
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,480
Just Mateo a couple years ago here's what you think of this I've seen arguments over which

1147
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,240
Disney character is a Republican or Democrat but I think we can all agree that Dr. Stevens from

1148
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:09,200
the Flight of Passage pre-show forgot to register to vote oh yeah yeah I think I think Dr. Stevens

1149
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:15,840
is like a uh yeah he's he's not he's not a voter he's got too much stuff on his mind yeah you're

1150
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,080
out of the country you know you need an absentee first of all with mail-in ballots I think I think

1151
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:25,600
he's a mail-in he's a mail-in guy he has he's an independent mail-in guy but you maybe like forget

1152
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,400
because you're busy like because the way that like you said the way the camera you go oh right I have

1153
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:36,000
to talk on camera maybe you're also like uh I got these lab results to go through oh wait shit oh

1154
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,480
the ballot when was that two months ago crap yeah yeah yeah I mean I don't know if you guys uh

1155
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:50,560
go political here but I think Dr. Stevens is um not for you know I'm not gonna do it

1156
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm so curious I was like where's the line no I'm not gonna okay it's just you can certainly

1157
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,960
keep it to yourself Dr. Stevens you don't want to reveal all the all the recesses of Dr. Stevens

1158
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:12,480
sorry yeah um but he let but if Dr. Ogden switched into politics uh and ran for office you know he's

1159
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,480
supporting Dr. Ogden that much we know yeah probably I mean Governor Ogden yeah I guess so yeah

1160
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,640
I'm trying to think what else to ask here I mean we've covered a lot of ground for sure

1161
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,680
I had something I was wondering because I had heard um someone who did music for a part of

1162
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:39,360
universal once and they were like well I should really get down there one of these days like uh

1163
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:45,040
I should see the Spider-Man ride my kids are teenagers would they like it and the I'm listening

1164
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,600
this interview I'm like yeah man I think your teenagers would like Spider-Man ride you were

1165
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:57,920
part of yeah yeah uh have you been to Pandora have you read it have you seen yourself oh right oh yes

1166
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:05,760
okay this is a little story which I've never told um okay so when I went to that convention

1167
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:13,360
that was the first time I went uh right to Orlando yeah yeah and um it's not it's not in Disney

1168
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:18,560
World it's just in one of these hotels nearby right it might have been a Disney World hotel

1169
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:25,600
that they rented um and I had never been to the ride and I didn't have a ticket because Disney

1170
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:34,000
never offered right you know which has a little while so so this was a non-profit organization

1171
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,880
giving me flying me to Orlando and uh the host of the panel I started talking to him his name was

1172
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:49,680
Mark uh Mark Daniel I believe um and I might be getting his last name wrong uh and he said

1173
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,320
I told him I'd never been on the ride he and he was like flabbergasted like what you've never been

1174
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,440
on the right we got to go right now and it's like 4 p.m. Orlando time I had flown in on red on a

1175
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:06,080
red eye and woke up at like noon like an hour before the so it's like I I was very uh out of it

1176
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:12,320
and he goes we got to get you to the ride and I'm like okay let's do it and so he had a season pass

1177
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:20,400
but he had to go to like a different park to get checked in and then then he could go to any park

1178
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,920
this is recent so it's all like yeah Disney World's insane yeah you can't park off yeah this was like

1179
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:34,000
last year yeah oh and so I go on the I go into uh is it Animal Kingdom it's yeah we go into

1180
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Animal Kingdom we walk in and it's like almost closing time and there's no line so we just walk

1181
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,440
through the whole thing like the whole there's no line for that's crazy by the passage we walk all

1182
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,360
the way through and then you see the big avatar who which is huge I didn't realize how huge it was

1183
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,600
yeah in the tank in the tank the avatar in the tank is huge yeah it's like 10 feet tall um uh

1184
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:04,320
and then you know I'm wearing a mask so no one is noticing me it was during COVID during the middle

1185
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,840
it's more of a it was like last year so more so masks were sort of required I believe right um

1186
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,880
um so I see myself and I'm like oh my gosh that's so funny I've never you know have you seen even a

1187
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,960
video off on YouTube I've seen the video on YouTube but it just felt a little surreal seeing

1188
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,760
you know yeah seeing it right there and then and I was in the back so nobody could see me so then

1189
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,000
I turned around and did a little selfie I like took the mask down took did a little selfie

1190
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,720
and took a picture of you know me with the with the uh pre-show in the back and you know he does

1191
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:44,160
he says all his stuff move around a little bit yeah it's sort of I mean it's sort of like uh

1192
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,600
it's sort of like you know it's just I think most people to go to the ride maybe are just

1193
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,120
not too pushed either love them or hate them they're just sort of like oh this is just part

1194
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,280
of the ride sure um so you know we go through the flight of passage pre-show and then I get on the

1195
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:10,240
ride which is like sort of like a bicycle seat and then yeah you strap on and there's a big screen

1196
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,760
and the ride starts and it's incredible because it just feels like you're flying

1197
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,320
yeah and then there's little sprays coming at you and it's just incredible and then I'd say like a

1198
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:34,000
minute into the ride I start to get nauseous wow like I'm just like whoa I'm feeling sick like

1199
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:42,080
what's going on and then and then uh you know I can hear like Mark next to me he's loving it he's

1200
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:47,920
just like whoa yes he's like repeating lines that they're saying you know because because there's

1201
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,440
one avatar that's like you're sort of following that's like guiding you along right yeah um or

1202
01:16:53,440 --> 01:17:02,560
ekron one one banshee yeah and I'm just feeling really sick at some point I like close my eyes

1203
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,320
and it's like I can't take it anymore because like it's making me like it feels like I'm gonna

1204
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:13,760
throw up and I'm just sweating and sweating and when the ride's over uh Mark looks up at me and

1205
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:22,160
he's just like wasn't that incredible and then I go yes it was and I didn't tell him like I was

1206
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:30,720
sweating so much but it it uh it was so humid it was during the summer or September months so it was

1207
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:38,800
it could have just been the heat but I the ride for me was yes it's I I don't I can't do those

1208
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,880
rides I could do a roller coaster just fine the 3d is probably the 3d yeah universal studios has a

1209
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,760
lot of those now a lot yeah and I had the same thing happen to me I think the harry potter ride

1210
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,720
I had to just close my eyes it was just like this is a really similar really nausea and yeah I even

1211
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,160
get a lot I do it but I get a little like tingle of it but people love it I think it's just that

1212
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:06,640
I'm like like older and as a kid maybe I didn't have do those rides I don't know or maybe it's

1213
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,520
you're like yeah it was like you didn't get it you're the immunity yeah I didn't get the

1214
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:18,400
early immunity yeah so yeah to answer your question Jason I went on the ride and it made me sick wow

1215
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:29,440
wow the person who explains the ride before it was back it was a major part of the experience

1216
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:37,280
we had a tough time on the ride yeah that's pretty crazy yeah um so uh so you were not fully prepared

1217
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:45,200
to uh fly no no I wasn't yeah you wouldn't do it again no I it was not a fun experience the first

1218
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:51,200
part was the first minute was incredible and then after that it's just like get me out of here it's

1219
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:59,200
just like not ending wow yeah um a question about that video that I guess I'm curious about that

1220
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:04,240
feeling like does it ever just hit you out of nowhere like oh there's that video of me playing

1221
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:10,800
right now there's strangers watching me across the country right now and then there will be again in

1222
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:17,440
10 minutes and then in an hour and then again tomorrow that's interesting you know I've never

1223
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:23,040
thought of it like that I I don't know how I feel about that I think if I really think about it I

1224
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:31,200
would not feel too good because it's like it's like you know I would I because of the dubbing

1225
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:37,840
thing it's like I don't want you know I feel I feel a little like it's not fully representative

1226
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:45,600
right so so yeah I guess I wouldn't feel too good about it but you know uh they can change it if

1227
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,320
they want I wouldn't feel bad about that if they if they decided to change it would you not really

1228
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:55,920
yeah I don't think I would feel bad about it huh huh yeah because it was just addressed we haven't

1229
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:01,760
talked about this in the little Feliz Navidad season that James Cameron said when Eiger got

1230
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:08,960
reinstalled uh I you know I told Eiger hey I'd love to I'd redo the ride and we could do like an

1231
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,040
underwater thing for the new movie so there wasn't the talk of do we put a different uh

1232
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
ride film in there not that anything was said about would we change the pre-show

1233
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,720
but it certainly could happen because they might have to explain now how you ride a what's do you

1234
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,520
know the name of the other the creature no I'm going in cold I don't I want to know the water

1235
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:34,080
one do you know you want to cover your ears no oh okay it's the yaloo the yaloo sorry the mighty

1236
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,640
aloo are we going with mighty are we sticking with mighty you're still going to determine that hey

1237
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:48,480
let the king uh see the movie first before I was just giving a name to uh uh in vulture they say

1238
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,160
you've met the mighty cron now yes yes that was nice to see yeah yeah tagged us we have this whole

1239
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,560
thing mike uh invented he started saying this phrase the when you get on about the ride when

1240
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
you get on the ride and you get on the mighty acron and you ride on the mighty acron and then

1241
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,640
we were starting to go like I think we you might have even thought that was something that David

1242
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:13,760
said in it I knew or the mighty editor it's in the movie but it's not apparently it's it's only he

1243
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,480
said it so when mike googled the phrase ultimately all of the results were him if you look up mighty

1244
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:27,680
acron it's just me in this podcast so are they did they incorporate that in the also okay the

1245
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,760
fall we've we discussed a little bit but but in the new trailer for the one of the one of the

1246
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,400
trailers for the new movie there's a shot where they just what are they asking for a description

1247
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:42,320
of it's talking about like what is it like to feel a was heartbeat right there god and there's a big

1248
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:50,640
long pause and then the character goes mighty and then there's a cut to the water acrons flying and

1249
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:56,640
we were like this feels very weird purposeful mighty's not like a thing that all the navis said

1250
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:03,280
in the first movie or anything so anyway that got to them someone listened to the podcast and then

1251
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,520
someone pitched it probably like it probably wasn't written and someone pitched it and then

1252
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,120
they're like okay let's let's try mighty it's like can we do it again but say mighty this time

1253
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:20,080
I have a pitch and then boom mighty yeah I'll let you say it and not not take the credit ourselves

1254
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,360
where that's a nice theory so you're saying they're going to change the software sort of like the video

1255
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,920
that's being shown and I don't think it's an official plan something James Cameron maybe

1256
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:35,200
wants to do in success of the the movie which I wish it's success I think it's gonna get it but

1257
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:41,200
the uh so so if that happens and then suddenly you find out there's a new video you really you're

1258
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,480
fine you had your time oh yeah yeah I would be perfectly fine with that yeah wow yeah but

1259
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:52,080
be perfect if they want if they need somebody to tell us talk about what it's like to uh to

1260
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:58,320
get in a link chair and board an an elu uh and maybe learn about maybe a different doctor's

1261
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:05,600
experience training the elu would you be up for the job again um good question I think I would

1262
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,760
want someone else to do it but I would want to do like a little cameo you know oh cool maybe just

1263
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:21,760
like one thing so I don't have to do all the all the dubbing again that's fair well what if uh I

1264
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,880
mean there's got to be a way to like that you're like you're in the back like your your chair is

1265
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:33,120
turned and then the the new person who's talking needs to like then these you know and these

1266
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:39,280
characters swim as opposed to the ekron who what's that we're um dr stevens could you help me out

1267
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:45,600
yeah you have to roll in back in and just be like all right guys let's get ready to and uh swim yeah

1268
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:53,360
yeah I think it has to be you'll just do that just that's all I would do yeah yeah same money

1269
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:58,080
though as last time yeah yeah roll in the frame and your hair is white and you have an eye patch

1270
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,400
and everyone's like what happened to dr what happened to him between rice this is it's been a

1271
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:11,520
tough 40 years for yeah dr stevens uh that this is great well at least this needs to happen this is

1272
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,400
where we can start james cameron do do more as much with david as you want to do this I feel like

1273
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:21,920
at least the cameo I'm glad you pitched that um I well I mean we're kind of coming to the end and

1274
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,040
this is anything else you want to say about the experience but there's you know there's a little

1275
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,720
thing I'll veer into but uh and I don't know any like anything we did we did not get to about this

1276
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:37,200
whole weird no I feel like I told you about how I got sick on the ride one and only time I told

1277
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,680
you about the shoot I told you about the audition I told you about the mean tweets

1278
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:52,880
dumb wrong mean tweets yeah I don't know I think yeah that's a lot there's well um there's one more

1279
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,520
little thing if I could spring on you and I um I asked about you you brought up violin I asked

1280
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,200
about the music abilities and it probably it doesn't really matter here but there's something

1281
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,400
that we have been ending these episodes with because it's the Feliz Navidad the way of winter

1282
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,600
we've been doing little uh uh Christmas carols at the end of the episodes or as we call them

1283
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,040
amati kaya carols that's for the name of the tribe in the movie and we've just been singing

1284
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:25,280
these silly songs at the end of the episodes and I have a song prepared which has a two line

1285
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:32,960
cameo for you speaking of cameos uh would you be up for doing a brief uh part in a song that uh
