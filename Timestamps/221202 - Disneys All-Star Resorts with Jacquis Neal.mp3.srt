1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,520
Warning, the following podcast contains quickly named food courts, two double beds becoming

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,720
a quadruple bed, three story cowboy boots, and tasteful 90s colors you'd find in a juice

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,320
box commercial.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,040
All this plus Jacque's Neal returns to talk Disney's All-Star Resorts on today's value

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,760
priced podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who are only around

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
sporting equipment.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,800
If it's used as scenery at a novelty hotel, my name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,280
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,880
Yes, I love all the giant objects that populate these hotels.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,040
Well, of course, but sporting equipment, when was the last time you were around it in an

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,840
earnest way other than being in an Orlando resort?

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,080
Yeah, that's a great point.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,800
It's a really good point.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,320
Surely actually, let me ask you, when was it?

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Do you know?

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I don't know.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,080
I feel like playing with the dog.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Sporting equipment?

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Yeah, what's the equipment?

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Maybe a small ball?

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I guess that's kind of a stuffed ball.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
A small...

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
No, dog toys don't count.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,840
What a tennis ball would though, I feel.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Scott Geerner here.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Yes, a tennis ball that's actually earnestly for a human would count with this question.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,120
They had to have made it with earnest intentions and otherwise the tennis ball doesn't count.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Because it can't be like a cute dog ball for this question.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,760
It has to be a real tennis ball.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,840
This is probably the answer that the Griffith Park dog park, there's usually a few tennis

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,880
balls lying around, so you pick one up and throw it.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
That's probably it.

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
A used dog tennis ball.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,800
A used dog tennis ball, but they say you're not supposed to give them regular tennis balls

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
anymore because they can chew them up and choke on them.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
There's harder ones you can get for them.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Mike's just lording his famous love of tennis over Jason.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
But I don't...

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
That's not exactly...

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,080
I won't even count that for this exercise because I don't know.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Scott, do you have an answer?

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,640
I do because I have a little boy now.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,040
So I have gone to buy a basketball and a basketball pump and another basketball pump because I

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,880
forgot I bought the previous pump.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Nice, nice.

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
I can show you both of them here in the garage.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Is there a hoop?

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Is there a hoop anywhere?

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,280
There's not here, but there's a bunch around town.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
The greater Burbank area.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
We find our spots.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Golf clubs over there.

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
Those have been around for a long time.

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
But I do golf.

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
We moved into a...

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
We're renting a house now.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,120
So I was looking, I go, I could get a basketball hoop here.

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
I could do that.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,480
At least the child's version of Fisher Price.

63
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Let's ask our guest to bring him into this.

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
I assume maybe it's been more recent.

65
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
It's been less than a week.

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay.

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Can I tell you?

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
That's fair.

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,880
I play basketball and baseball weekly.

70
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
That's great.

71
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,360
That voice from the show is physical.

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,440
How I Met Your Father returning to podcast the ride.

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,920
J'Keesaniel is back.

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Hello, everyone.

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Hello.

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Hello.

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Thank you.

78
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Yes.

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Let's talk about sports.

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
What's missing from this show?

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's talk about it.

82
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes.

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Let's talk about it.

84
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Explain the basics of it.

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Explain the basics.

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
What's the ball you said?

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, you know, it's a little ball, hand-eye coordination, nice bat.

88
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
You're trying to hit it over a wall.

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,160
I feel like that's all you need to know.

90
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
That's all you need to know.

91
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,640
I played when I was in kindergarten.

92
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
I played baseball.

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And the only...

94
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,680
And I've said this before on the show.

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,760
One of the best moments of my life was I went to a bachelor party in Wisconsin and we just

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,160
rented a house and somebody had a wiffle ball bat.

97
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,760
And we were all just taking turns throwing and hitting and whatever.

98
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,640
And I was getting mocked by my peers, my friends, because how poor of an athlete I was consistently

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,880
in high school and elementary school.

100
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,200
And I got up there and nobody hit the ball more consistent and farther than me.

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,400
I shot everyone up to the point where you can ask them about this.

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm not lying.

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,900
There's many witnesses.

104
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,120
I think it's a fluke, which happens to me all the time with sports.

105
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Bowling, it happened to me once.

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I bowled like a 230 or a 40.

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
A 230?

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Once.

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
And then not again.

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Wow.

111
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,200
Situation with sports.

112
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Can I...

113
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
I know we're going to be talking about stuff.

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Can I...

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Does anybody else bowl?

116
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Anybody bowl?

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
No, not really.

118
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
No.

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Not often.

120
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
I like to.

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Can I ask...

122
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Because I often think this.

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,440
Bowling is the one thing I don't want to be great at.

124
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,400
Because I feel like if you're good at bowling, it takes the fun out of being good at bowling.

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Right?

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,480
Like part of the fun of being good at bowling is, will I get some strikes today?

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,640
Will I have the game of my life?

128
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,440
Well, you want to hit a strike every time.

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,120
And when you do, it feels good.

130
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,520
If I know I can bowl 250, 260, like, okay.

131
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
It feels boring at that point, right?

132
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't know.

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I think what...

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,040
Maybe this is not what you're saying, but I feel also like when you go bowling, it's

135
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
so much more of a hang.

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, yeah, that too.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,040
If you were also very good at it, it wouldn't have the same vibe.

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah.

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
You would just be mad, like, go this motherfucker again.

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,080
Go ahead and get your strike.

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
Go ahead and curve the ball.

142
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,440
Because you would be so much more like, I brought my own ball, I brought my own shoes.

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,040
You would be an outlier with the group, unless you're with a bunch of bowling friends.

144
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,120
But I would still have my own ball and have my own shoes with an average of 115.

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Yeah.

146
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
You want to still be...

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
That's more about the style.

148
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
You want to pick that color ball, you want to pick the bag.

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Yeah.

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,000
But I just don't want to be like, great.

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
I can be average.

152
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Like, what is that, 150, 170?

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Probably 150.

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
170 is a good score.

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
170 is a great score.

157
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,640
170 is a great score.

158
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Yeah, okay.

159
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,960
I bowled with somebody a couple weeks ago who was a really good bowler, like the curve

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,000
and everything, and he got 167.

161
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wow.

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's good.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He was good.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We was like, this motherfucker, this dude is great.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Anyway, I just wanted to know.

167
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,680
I've never asked that question to anybody else.

168
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I just wanted to see what...

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
I think you're right.

170
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
I think it would miss.

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
It could ruin the hang, certainly.

172
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,600
We've all bowled together at Downtown Disney.

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Oh, yes.

174
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
At the lanes.

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I don't remember how we did.

176
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I don't know.

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,080
I don't remember how we did either because we were eating a big thing of nachos at the

178
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
same time.

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
We had to keep wiping our...

180
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Cleaning our hands.

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
There's so much going on.

182
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh, yeah.

183
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
There's a lot.

184
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Oh, that's right.

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Yes.

186
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
The combo of snacks you're eating with your hands with greasy balls.

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
We had full deals.

188
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
We had full deals.

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah.

190
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Because the table was right by the lane.

191
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
So we were going back and forth between the ball and do it, which was fun.

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,280
But I don't think you could focus on either thing that well.

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,800
But I mean, whatever.

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Only when it's theme park research assignment.

195
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,920
To go back to your previous point, we're around sporting equipment when it's big and fake.

196
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes.

197
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Exactly.

198
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,200
We're just covering everything for a long time.

199
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Or we have to.

200
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Yeah.

201
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Yeah.

202
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,800
If they put a Topgolf or Batting Cages, we'll be there.

203
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,480
You know, at Disney specifically.

204
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
At Disney.

205
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah.

206
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
I mean, I love I'll be at Batting Cages to begin with.

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I love Batting Cages.

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
They're great.

209
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
They're so fun.

210
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,480
There's a Topgolf here now, too.

211
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Is there?

212
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah, there is near the airport.

213
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Okay.

214
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Wait, that's that's themed.

215
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
That's a thing.

216
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,640
We could review that.

217
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,320
That's always in like silly places like Vegas and where indoor skydiving is.

218
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Yeah.

219
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,600
Actually, I think you just gave us an episode.

220
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I just gave you.

221
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
All right.

222
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll see you all later.

223
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Thank you so much.

224
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Thanks for having me.

225
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Job.

226
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
You gave us a future episode instead of doing this one.

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,880
And it'll help our health.

228
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
It will.

229
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Yes.

230
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Just moving a little bit.

231
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,520
Swinging a club.

232
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,040
So yeah, we're talking all-star resorts, the Disney World Resort, specifically the All-Star.

233
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
What a top.

234
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
What a like no one's ever said it.

235
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
We've never had it on a list.

236
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
I love this.

237
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
Specifically about the All-Star Resorts.

238
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I love this.

239
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
They're my favorite.

240
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
I have so many thoughts.

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wow.

242
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So many thoughts.

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
They're my favorite.

244
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,320
There was a little discussion.

245
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,480
Jason texted me and then I emailed about this because there was a discussion of what is

246
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,880
under the umbrella of the All-Star Resorts.

247
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,440
Probably the ones with All-Star in the title.

248
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,960
That's what we ended up on.

249
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,960
It became shorthand for all the value resorts.

250
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,920
It became shorthand for all the value resorts, which now includes Pop Century and Art of

251
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Animation now.

252
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,840
I saw one video refer to those.

253
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
Those are actually a tick up.

254
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
They're called Value Plus.

255
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Oh, see that's a new name.

256
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
That's a new name.

257
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
It's a classification.

258
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,080
It's a new name.

259
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Those two have their own complicated history.

260
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,360
We've sort of narrowed it down to the original three.

261
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Was someone concerned?

262
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,560
Was somebody like, well, Pop Century is going to be its own thing.

263
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,040
Jason was not concerned, but he just asked me and then I emailed.

264
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I was confused.

265
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Because you're right.

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,600
Because when you think about those, when you think about the All-Star Resorts, I do not

267
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
so much Art of Animation.

268
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,040
I feel like they should just make that.

269
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,240
It's more expensive than the other four.

270
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,920
To see you from the All-Star Union.

271
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,440
But Pop Century does have a little bit of the All-Star feel to it more than Art of Animation.

272
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,080
They were building Pop Century the first time I ever went to Disney World.

273
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,200
My second time going to Disney World, we stayed in Pop Century.

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,520
When it was relatively a year or two old.

275
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,200
It felt very similar to the other All-Star Resorts.

276
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
It's big stuff.

277
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,400
I don't know enough about Art of Animation to know if it's big stuff or not.

278
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Yeah, I don't know.

279
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
It is.

280
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
It's big stuff.

281
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
It's also big stuff.

282
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
It's also big stuff.

283
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,480
It's got a lot of sweets themed after the movies.

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,400
That's partly why it's popular.

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,880
Those two, I think, elevated a little in price-wise.

286
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,800
Still pretty inexpensive.

287
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,280
But they sit on a lake and they have the Skyliner station in between.

288
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,800
So that's what I would say.

289
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,360
Okay, that's why it's worth it.

290
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,760
I just did the search for three, four weeks from now.

291
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
In between the holidays.

292
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,980
How much do hotels cost?

293
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,480
Some shocking numbers coming out of Florida for the hotel.

294
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,960
Shocking numbers, not since the deep COVID era, have shocking numbers coming out of Florida.

295
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm talking like some of the hotels, $1,000 a night.

296
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Oh my God.

297
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
The high end one?

298
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Yeah, the higher end.

299
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
That's ridiculous.

300
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah.

301
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
It's ridiculous.

302
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Because these hotels, the nicest Disney hotel is not that great.

303
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Is that?

304
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Yes.

305
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Right.

306
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:02,000
Core-wise, maybe lobby and vibe and the convenience of proximity to a park or some other perk.

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,520
And I'm sure there's suites where you go, oh, holy shit.

308
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
But I don't know.

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
So many Disney hotel rooms are just like...

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Are just hotel rooms.

311
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,360
They're just hotel rooms.

312
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,720
The only hotels that I would stay at that wouldn't be a value resort.

313
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,240
At this point, it's not even about cost.

314
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,400
It's just about principle.

315
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't want to spend this much money for an upgraded Holiday Inn.

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,240
But the only ones is the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

317
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
And I got to be staying on that side where the giraffes are.

318
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,400
I want a giraffe right up to my damn balcony.

319
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Have you done it?

320
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I know.

321
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
That's like my...

322
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:46,840
I started planning a trip and I was also planning a Europe vacation.

323
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,640
to go to the Animal Kingdom Lodge for the whole thing.

324
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
It was like $8,000.

325
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,280
And I was like, all right, maybe not at the same time I'm planning a Europe trip.

326
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah, right, right.

327
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Maybe not.

328
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Maybe not.

329
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,200
But that's the only one I would pay that much money for.

330
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,280
And a boardwalk hotel because it feels like you're not at Disney when you're staying on

331
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,760
that lake with the yacht resort across the hall and that shit like that.

332
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,280
And it's fun to walk to Epcot.

333
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,760
You can walk to Hollywood Studios farther, but it is fun.

334
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
Every other hotel can suck it.

335
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,920
It's not worth it to me.

336
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
No entry.

337
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,480
Like I love the vibe of the Polynesian.

338
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I don't like that price.

339
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I don't.

340
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
But like, does that do anything for you?

341
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
A vibe?

342
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,120
If it was more reasonable?

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,040
If it was more reasonable, like, because that's the thing, if it's a dope vibe, sure.

344
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,360
Yeah, the Polynesian, although I will say this the last time I, because I've been at

345
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,280
Disney World quite a bit and I've gone to other, I've gone to the other resorts just

346
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,920
to like check them out or eat in them because they have good restaurants.

347
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Last time I was at the Polynesian, I had not, that's somewhat similar to like Hawaii, correct?

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Yeah.

349
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
I had not been to Hawaii yet.

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,120
Now I went to Hawaii for the first time last year and now I'm wondering what I would think

351
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,360
of it if I went and checked it out now.

352
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Now that I know the vibe of Hawaii, I don't know.

353
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
Would it make me, would I be like, this?

354
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Actually is worse.

355
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,960
Well, it has to be worse.

356
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Well, yeah, it has to be.

357
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,000
It has to be worse because you're not there.

358
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're not in Hawaii.

359
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,280
I would say it accurately, I think it does feel like Hawaiian hotels in that they were

360
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,720
built in the early 70s and you kind of like, you know, like only so much remodeling can

361
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,000
take away the early 70s feel of it.

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Yeah.

363
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,160
So I do, I feel transported just, but that's, I'm after like 70s vibes anyway.

364
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,480
Gotcha.

365
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,000
So you might be like, I don't know where you stayed in Hawaii, but you might be like, this

366
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
is old and stinks.

367
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,880
I know I, I like, I like old and I like old and stinky.

368
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,400
You know, I, I appreciate old and stinky.

369
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
I like what they call balconies in Hawaii.

370
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,320
The, the Linnau's or no, the Linnau.

371
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,680
Is that what a balcony or patio?

372
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,320
Yeah.

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,120
They don't call them patios or balconies.

374
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,280
They're called like Linnau's or something like that.

375
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:04,920
Huh?

376
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,600
I feel like last time you were on, you were saying, I think you went for the first time

377
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
when you were 21.

378
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,400
When I was 21.

379
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,720
Yeah.

380
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,240
Yeah.

381
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,280
Cause like, I feel like that my half of my nostalgia, or I guess maybe more than half

382
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,320
for contemporary and Polynesian is cause I went with a little.

383
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah.

384
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,600
When I was like five and I was like, well, this is the greatest place I've ever been.

385
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
This is the greatest place ever.

386
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,760
Yeah.

387
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,200
So I could see it where you're going later and there were other options and you were

388
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,120
like, yeah, okay.

389
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,560
Yeah.

390
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:37,800
I mean, so in 08, 08 when I went first time, 21 years old, I had never been to any

391
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,600
Disney park.

392
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,440
So like I'm going to Disney.

393
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
We touched down.

394
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,280
We get on that magical express.

395
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,840
You're going to get the video going.

396
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm like, you know, we, we walk up, we pull into the actual resort.

397
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,120
Everything is Disney, right?

398
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,280
And then we jumped to the, I stayed at the all-star music, uh, movie resort.

399
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,560
That was the first one I ever stayed at.

400
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,800
Oh, this is the first trip ever.

401
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,640
This is the first trip.

402
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,120
Okay.

403
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,080
All-star movie.

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,560
And I was like, this is dope.

405
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,840
It felt like Disney.

406
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,760
It felt like what a Disney hotel, what I thought a Disney hotel would feel like,

407
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
which is big Disney characters everywhere.

408
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah.

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Like, you know, just nothing, just Disney shit, right?

410
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,600
It was like, all right, we're not just a hotel.

411
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,320
We're a Disney hotel and not like subtle Disney things.

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,680
Right?

413
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,960
Like it was no, we got big statues of Woody and we got statues of like the

414
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,520
characters and Dalmatians and like, I was like, oh shit.

415
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
This is pretty tight.

416
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,200
And then the customer service was nice and everything was dope.

417
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
And I was like, oh, this is great.

418
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,480
And you're getting the full, like you associate all-star movies resort

419
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,280
with the experience with the experience.

420
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,320
Yeah.

421
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,040
That's huge.

422
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Cause to me, like, all right.

423
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,720
Yeah.

424
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,880
I've been, we've all been to the contemporary or stayed in it or something

425
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,880
like that, it's a hotel, like, you know, it's a hotel, it's a hotel, right?

426
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,760
You know, is not the operative word necessary.

427
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,560
Again, I'm after early seventies vibes.

428
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,680
I love the place, but if you don't have that it's, yeah, it is not.

429
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,080
Yeah.

430
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,480
It's like, maybe there's Mickey ears in the carpet in the carpet, you know,

431
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,320
like a painting, the monorail going through was cool.

432
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Monorail goes through is the big selling.

433
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,440
Yeah.

434
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,000
That's that's that's cool.

435
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,400
We all, yeah, we all was for fetishizing it because I think we were real,

436
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,360
especially because we were little and we'd have books where you'd be like

437
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,120
the contemporary, but I can imagine if you have none of it, you go and you go,

438
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,240
yeah, okay, it's kind of a weird big building.

439
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,880
Yeah.

440
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,000
Like I've stayed, you know, I've stayed in nice hotels before, you know, okay.

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah.

442
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
And the thing too is.

443
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
You're not staying at your hotel the whole time.

444
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
You're out a lot, right?

445
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,560
Yeah.

446
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,760
So for me, the room isn't a drawing point to a hotel.

447
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,280
And like at this stage, I've seen a lot of Disney rooms, like I've seen like

448
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,640
the fantasy suites above Pirates of the Caribbean.

449
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,280
I've been in those rooms and I went in, wow.

450
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,440
I went on a tour for my birthday.

451
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,840
Wow.

452
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,800
They like took me through and shit.

453
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah.

454
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,320
And they show you all of that.

455
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,360
And like those rooms like light up and, you know, like trains be coming out the

456
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,960
walls and I don't think we've talked to anybody who's been in there yet.

457
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,720
What happens?

458
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,280
This is, this seems so like every room in the suite has what they call a good

459
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,760
night's kiss and you can like flip the switch and your room comes alive.

460
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,480
So every room is differently themed.

461
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,960
So some rooms like the wall, which just looks like a regular wall will like start

462
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,160
to light up and fireworks to pop off of it or other rooms, like the trains will

463
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,640
pop out the walls and like the toys that's in the room will start coming alive

464
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
and everything like that.

465
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,040
It's kind of like the Tiki room, like, or the Tiki hut, the Tiki room, whatever

466
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,480
it's called.

467
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Cool.

468
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,120
So like that's dope.

469
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,480
Like if my room did that, yeah, sign me up.

470
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:55,960
Sure.

471
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,680
But the contemporary rooms are just rooms.

472
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,360
They're really just boxy 70s businessmen.

473
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
Literal boxes that they put in, which we learned when we were doing.

474
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah.

475
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,520
Slid them in like drawers.

476
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,120
Yeah.

477
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,280
It doesn't sound, but that doesn't sound relaxing or magical.

478
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,800
No.

479
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,360
Now that said, you're in the all star movies.

480
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
Like I've never stayed in there.

481
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,400
We, I've done pop century, Jason did pop century.

482
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
Wait, nobody's stayed in any of the all stars.

483
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,200
I have.

484
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,600
You have?

485
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,120
Oh, okay.

486
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,680
All right.

487
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeah.

488
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,720
Which one?

489
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Um, I've stayed actually at two.

490
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,720
I have stayed at the, I'm trying to remember the first one.

491
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,400
I think we stayed at the movies when I was younger for a couple of days.

492
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,320
Cause sometimes you break it up to save some money too, if you want to do one

493
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,120
of the better hotels.

494
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,760
Um, and then more recently, Lindsay and I stayed at the, uh, music one.

495
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,000
Which is dope.

496
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
I really like the music one.

497
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,920
I like it.

498
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
There's a good vibe there too.

499
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,440
There's a really cool vibe there.

500
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,720
Yeah.

501
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,880
There's like a little bar outside by the pool.

502
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah.

503
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,800
You can swim right up to it.

504
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,520
Yeah, it's, it's again.

505
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,680
Yeah.

506
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,280
If you're, if you're, I get it.

507
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,840
If you're like whole thing is like hotels and I'm going to hang out and I

508
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,080
need a specific thing, like a specific vibe.

509
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,920
But if it's like, I'm going to be here a little bit and like, you can have a nice

510
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,840
drink at the end of the night and go back to the room.

511
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,360
Yeah.

512
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,640
Right.

513
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,000
Sure.

514
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,480
It's great.

515
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,280
Let me do it.

516
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,640
Here's the, the lay person, uh, the, the overall picture of these resorts.

517
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,440
They, I think Disney mostly had more premium options.

518
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,880
It's more in that grand Californian, especially like late 80s, the Eisner era.

519
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,960
It's all of these kind of ornate, beautifully themed and getting kind of

520
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,160
expensive hotels like Grand Floridian and Yacht and Beach Club.

521
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,880
So then, uh, early nineties, these start popping up as a much cheaper option.

522
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,800
So it's kind of, there's sort of no frills room wise.

523
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,480
I feel that that's what I was going to ask you guys about, but there are also,

524
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,960
and then you're not attached to a monorail or boats or fancy transportation.

525
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
So you're not paying for that, but you're saving a lot of money.

526
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,000
The buses go to these hotels and they're also not, it's not the ornate Cape

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,160
Cod type theming or whatever it is.

528
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,960
Big objects and Disney characters.

529
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,480
And here's a big tennis racket.

530
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah.

531
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,840
And so two of them open in a 94 and one of them opens in 99.

532
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,560
So it was kind of like a new breed of resort.

533
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,880
You don't really find like, I don't think there's this in Paris.

534
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,000
Like, no, it's a pretty particular.

535
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,560
It's particular to Walt Disney World.

536
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Yeah.

537
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
And those people save a lot of money for sure.

538
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,600
And there, there was a few things going on with the company at the time.

539
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,640
They realized they were losing money to people staying on the outskirts, saying

540
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,640
in like Kissimmee or staying in the outskirts, uh, the cheaper chain hotels,

541
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,840
much more affordable.

542
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,120
The other thing is like around 94 early nineties or so, you know, they, they

543
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,240
opened a bunch of moderate hotels, uh, to Puerto Orleans, Caribbean beach.

544
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,160
But there was a big emphasis at the time of keep people on property.

545
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,840
The most important thing is we keep people in the bubble.

546
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,480
Yeah.

547
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

548
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah.

549
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,320
And that's what it did for, I mean, cause when we were looking, I mean, an

550
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,120
Oh, eight a night, these tickets were like $70.

551
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,760
Even now they're still like around the like 100, 129 range, which is,

552
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,800
I was kind of shocked when I saw those numbers that even I figured even these,

553
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,280
they were just charging way too much more because they're still relatively cheap.

554
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,880
Yeah.

555
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah.

556
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,920
That's not bad at all.

557
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,800
I think a hundred dollars and under a hundred dollars was what they initially

558
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,800
started as now they're between one, yeah.

559
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,200
120 and 190.

560
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,880
Oh, okay.

561
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,680
So they've gone up.

562
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,160
So it's still under $200.

563
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,560
Okay.

564
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,000
For now.

565
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,720
Open up.

566
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Like, yeah, now you're not blowing the, which is what I want it when it doing pop

567
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,280
century when we went a couple of years ago, like, yeah, I would love to not

568
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
oddly spend $400 every night and not really see the returns.

569
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,440
It seems to me like you're like, it's not even about that and the saving money for

570
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,040
I think you, it seems like you like the places vibe wise.

571
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah.

572
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,320
I like the places vibe wise, which is why I do like boardwalk.

573
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,160
I like animal kingdom lodge, even though I've never stayed in those two.

574
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Like the next time I go to Disney and I splurge, it's going to be one of those

575
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,920
two hotels because like the vibe of it for me, if I'm going like, let's, let's

576
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
talk about Disneyland.

577
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,880
Yeah.

578
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah.

579
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,320
Let's talk about, I don't know if anybody saw, obviously I've only been to

580
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,040
current Disneyland, which is fun.

581
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,440
Cool.

582
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,200
But if anybody saw that documentary on Disney plus where they show like the

583
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,920
old Disneyland hotel back in the day, like when it was like really themed and

584
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
had different shit, like that would have been cool.

585
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,120
But now I'm like, all right, it's not that much there.

586
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,760
It's a Marriott.

587
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
It's a Marriott.

588
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,480
It's a very nice Marriott resort.

589
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,400
The grand California is beautiful.

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,880
Here's the thing.

591
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
I want people to hear me out.

592
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm not shitting on these hotels.

593
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,320
Grand California is great.

594
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,560
It's a beautiful hotel is dope.

595
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,400
I love sitting in there high as hell and just looking at the wood.

596
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
The lobby is insane.

597
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's beautiful.

598
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
Just sitting in there.

599
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,880
If I have to do it's a great place to take a poop.

600
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,320
Like you need like a nice bathroom.

601
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,800
Bathrooms, great bars and restaurants.

602
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah.

603
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
I I'm not shitting on these hotels.

604
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,920
You're shitting in them.

605
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,800
I'm shitting in them.

606
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm sitting right in them.

607
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,040
But I look at these hotels and I'm like, OK, these are really nice hotels,

608
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,160
but I could pick these hotels up and put these hotels anywhere.

609
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,960
So if I'm paying this much for a hotel that I can just pick up

610
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,560
and take anywhere else, like I can't really pick up

611
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,360
any of the all star or value or any of the all star.

612
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,600
And put them anywhere and be like, where the fuck are we at?

613
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,240
But at Disney, I'm at these hotels and I'm like, this makes sense.

614
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
This makes sense.

615
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,920
Yeah, there's like no like cheap Motel Six that just has a bunch of big toys outside.

616
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,800
Yeah, like there isn't doesn't exist the version of it because to me,

617
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,960
it's like it's the kid.

618
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
It's your kid brain going, everything's big and there's a bunch of toys.

619
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
And there's like, yes, like it's fun because it feels the vibe.

620
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,920
It reminds me of like a Disney store or something or like a toy store.

621
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,920
So you're not going to get that anywhere else.

622
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

623
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,560
So for me and then to like just the like the Grand California is like seven

624
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,320
hundred dollars a night. Yeah. Yeah.

625
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,080
It's got so crazy is and to do what to look at fucking,

626
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,440
you know, pins across the street like the what's the bowling alley

627
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,760
at downtown Disney now to look at Naples?

628
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
The last time I stayed, I had a view of the sandal store.

629
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,240
Yeah. Like what? What? Yeah.

630
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,440
So that's the thing that makes me upset, too, because for that amount,

631
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,680
I can go to Disney World and have a giraffe come up to my fucking balcony.

632
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,080
Like, you know, put his neck up to my.

633
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,560
So you're not giving me anything different with these hotels. Right.

634
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,080
To charge as much as you're charging.

635
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,720
And the vibe of them is if you are really doing a Disney like vacation,

636
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,800
you're not in your room as much, even though you may have Disney

637
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,960
like or days where you stay in the crib or stay in a hotel or whatever,

638
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,280
just to rest or relax.

639
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,440
You're mostly just sleeping in the room for the most part. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,160
So and probably barely and probably barely.

641
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,840
You're like, you know, if you're trying to crank through parks,

642
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,760
you're not relaxing a ton. You're not relaxing the time.

643
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
Well, especially now, if you're like, all right, I set an alarm for 650

644
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
because it's seven a.m.

645
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
I have to open the app.

646
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,760
I have to open the correct app.

647
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,520
I have to get off the Wi-Fi.

648
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,640
Jason, I hate to cut you off, but remember, you have to stay up till midnight

649
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,480
to buy the thing to get the reservations, to get you into the app at seven a.m.

650
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

651
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,680
I may have been looking at a June twenty twenty two article.

652
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,760
I was looking at the September one, which is updated.

653
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
They made a point of making it more complicated.

654
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,720
Yeah, that's right. It's ridiculous.

655
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,200
Don't get me started on it. Yeah.

656
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,280
You know, what just happened to me with the Wi-Fi is I was I was on the Disneyland

657
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,080
Wi-Fi and I tried to enter the I tried to get on my app and flash my

658
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,240
my pass that's only available on the app.

659
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,680
I don't have a physical pass.

660
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,640
I have a card. Right.

661
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,800
To you. Do you have a card?

662
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,880
You don't have a card.

663
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,000
No, I don't. Yeah.

664
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,280
And I tried to get on the monorail station to get into Disneyland.

665
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

666
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,520
Mission basically.

667
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,840
And it would not come up and it kept asking for a new password and a new password.

668
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm like, I know my password. I'm not crazy.

669
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,120
I know what my Disney password is.

670
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,480
And I'm not going to say it here. Don't do it.

671
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
Everybody took a pen and paper out like

672
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
let's use some teamwork.

673
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,920
You say your password and I'll say your email.

674
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,200
I was going to say, yeah, you can say your password, but

675
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
people might not get the email. Right.

676
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's true.

677
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,120
I think they can guess.

678
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,680
God of a listener guesses it.

679
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,520
Can you tell them if it is that

680
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
guess on Twitter?

681
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,120
I know what I'm thinking, what it is.

682
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,400
I think you'd have to you'd have to make a lot of a lot of leaves.

683
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,720
Well, let's let them guess.

684
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,800
But let them guess.

685
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,440
You're sure your security is pretty tricky because your email is password one

686
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,680
at Gmail dot com.

687
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,560
But your password is password two.

688
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,240
So they're not going to pay that.

689
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,160
Security question.

690
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,440
You have to know as much about the Beach Boys as I do.

691
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,720
And then you'll get it.

692
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,920
But anyway, I was trying to basically I just like

693
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,160
I could not even access my pass.

694
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,440
And I when I was with somebody and I was like, I'm sorry, I can't go in right now.

695
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,480
And then I thought, is it the Wi-Fi?

696
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,360
And I got off the Wi-Fi and I got into it.

697
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,000
Right.

698
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,480
Wi-Fi, signing into the app at all.

699
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,720
How does that happen?

700
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,160
How does it block with your password?

701
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,560
Yeah, that's interesting.

702
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,520
We've threatened to do an episode about Go Disney.

703
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,320
The Disney.Go.com, which they're still using.

704
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,560
And you have to like your app routes you from the app to a website

705
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,960
to do certain elements like to make reservations.

706
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
You can't just do it in an app.

707
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,560
It shoots you over to this.

708
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,000
What is it? A company that Disney bought 20 years ago for the internet?

709
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,080
Yeah, it was a competitor of like Yahoo and ASG.

710
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,960
And so Disney in an attempt to become multimedia empire.

711
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,520
We know ABC.

712
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,080
They bought Go.com.

713
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,120
And so Go.com is still the backbone of a lot of the company.

714
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,760
And it's so bad.

715
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,560
Yeah. And the thing supporting the backbone is they hire a lot of contractors

716
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,320
for projects, the projects launch and then they lay off the contract.

717
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,360
So it's not.

718
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,720
But like that Wi-Fi, if that Wi-Fi was flimsy,

719
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,560
even if it's working a little bit, I feel like if it was all in apps

720
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,600
you wouldn't have that happen a lot.

721
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,440
Maybe I'm wrong.

722
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,640
But like it feels like everything was just one thing instead of being routed

723
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,040
from app to website back to app.

724
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,800
Some of that stuff wouldn't happen because I've had that.

725
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,040
Whenever I have to make a park reservation, it like routes me to the browser.

726
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,920
Yes.

727
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,520
You in the app.

728
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,240
Why am I in the app?

729
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,000
Right. And then I have to re put in my password.

730
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
It's so inconvenient.

731
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,880
I worry they've only made it crucial that you reserve everything.

732
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Everything.

733
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,680
Every meal, every day, every ride.

734
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
So and so that's fine.

735
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,760
There will always be in the app, but also the Internet's horrible.

736
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,960
It's going to be like a movie minority report.

737
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,280
They're going to have a thing where they know what you want and you'll just

738
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
they'll be have a printout before you even know it.

739
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,120
And then that'll be in the app telling you.

740
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,200
But then the printout will say not available on the day.

741
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,000
Oops, somebody ate the page.

742
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,560
Oh, I saw that earlier in researching this.

743
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,560
I was trying to see like, what are these hotels cost right now?

744
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,200
So somebody ate somebody ate somebody ate the page.

745
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,000
I can't go to I can't look at what restaurants are at all star music today

746
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,640
because Dale, the web page was an acorn.

747
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,240
This is people jokes.

748
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,880
People joke sometimes like, why are travel agents around?

749
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,200
Why is Apple Travel still in like not Apple computers, but the chain Apple

750
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,440
Travel? Why is that still in so many like malls or shopping centers?

751
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,120
And the answer is for this.

752
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,760
Yeah, yeah. Right.

753
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,040
We'll do this for you.

754
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,080
And you don't really pay a fee to them.

755
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,000
Disney kicks them the commission.

756
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, or like Disney, there are a million we could.

757
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,760
We should get become Disney certified travel agent.

758
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,280
You should. There's a lot of.

759
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,560
Yeah, you're right. There's a lot of a lot of the right hosts.

760
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,920
When you had that idea, I think it would be a funny bit to do.

761
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,680
I think have links and every time somebody clicks your link,

762
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,520
you get a commission with a book.

763
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,080
Yeah, I'm coming around on the idea.

764
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,960
And they get access to other pools of reservations.

765
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
It's kind of wild.

767
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,680
That's the only way to like beat this or win this war of attrition.

768
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
It's the Disney company's waging on us.

769
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,560
Theme park fans.

770
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,040
Everybody's in their phone.

771
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Part of the machine.

772
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,760
I haven't been last time I was at Disney World.

773
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,080
I stayed in All Star Music and that was 2018.

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,760
And and like it wasn't phones yet.

775
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,160
Like we said, the magic bands like you did, obviously, you know,

776
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,560
Fastpass was still the paper tickets still and everything.

777
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,320
Like that, I think.

778
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,280
I think it was still the paper.

779
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah, it was still the paper tickets.

780
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,080
So it was like it was it was.

781
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,000
And now if I go back, it's just going to be all phone.

782
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,680
Janey plus you can see between 2008 and 2012,

783
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,760
they were they were doing a lot of interactive lines like in games.

784
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,760
You could play in the queue to get you off your phone.

785
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,760
And at a certain point, they went, we're admitting defeat.

786
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,640
Yeah. And we're pumping some money into the phones like where people are going

787
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,640
to be on their phone. We're going to be on your phone at all times.

788
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,480
But I feel like people weren't always on their phones.

789
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Like in comparison now, people are always on their phones because you have to be.

790
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,760
But in comparison, I feel like people were putting down their phones to a degree.

791
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,360
You nervous about going back?

792
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,240
You think the vibe's not going to be good when you go?

793
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
I am. I am kind of nervous about going back.

794
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,520
I I yeah, I'm nervous.

795
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,840
I'm nervous about going back, which is why if I go back

796
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,920
the next time I go back, I will cheat on my All-Star Resort.

797
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah. And do like the big one just in case.

798
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,400
This is like I think I'm probably not coming back for a very long time.

799
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Like just in case is that I mean, you know, outside of just a random trip.

800
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,280
But if I'm going to like really drop the dough.

801
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
Sure. Yeah. Oh, I hear you.

802
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
Because they're going to pray. They're trying.

803
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,840
I mean, they are. When I say war of attrition, they are trying.

804
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,520
They're hardest to get us all to tap out going all the time.

805
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
That's what I think that's what it is.

806
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,720
That is what they're trying to do.

807
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,080
They're just spending as much money. Yeah.

808
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,320
They don't want you regularly.

809
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,200
They'd rather have people.

810
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,400
They'd rather have us going once every five years

811
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,000
and rich, very rich people going all the time.

812
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
Yeah, that's what they want.

813
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,360
And they were in people like they they are.

814
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,160
They do not like you because you're like, I'm just going to have a Clif Bar

815
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,560
for breakfast or coffee in the room.

816
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,600
No, you buy all three of those meals.

817
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,880
We are in the process of some weird like computation that is happening.

818
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,880
An aggressive computation.

819
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,520
It's not about like staffing and stuff.

820
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,520
It's about maximizing the type of person that's spending the most money in the park.

821
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,480
So with the reservation system, you can keep out the annual pass holders

822
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,880
until you need to fill up the parks with more of them,

823
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,160
because you'd rather have them than nobody.

824
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,480
But you can keep them out until like people that are going to spend more money

825
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,080
are stacking up in the parks. That's what you're going to do.

826
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,120
So then at the last second, you can release more spots

827
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,880
for annual pass holders to go, well, OK, fine.

828
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,520
I'd rather have them in spending five dollars if we didn't fill up

829
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,600
with the guests that are paying more.

830
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,760
So that's really what it's about versus like, oh, it's just for staffing.

831
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,080
They don't give a shit about staffing.

832
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,960
They don't give a shit about staffing.

833
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,280
Staffing is they're about to lay a bunch of people off.

834
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,840
Right. They don't care.

835
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,720
That article just came out.

836
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,480
I realize it wasn't until I made a few jokes about it online.

837
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,360
It dawned on me how close we were to the holiday season.

838
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,480
Oh, yeah. Threatening the like, well, layoffs are coming.

839
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
Layoffs are coming. God, it's wild.

840
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,680
It's wild. They don't care about staffing this.

841
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,720
They need more staffing now more than ever.

842
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,120
Oh, they need so much more.

843
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,240
That's the other thing you're saying, like, keep the the annual pass holders

844
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,680
until you just when you need them.

845
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,040
That's they're like doing the same thing with staff.

846
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,880
It's like, how little can we get away with? Yeah.

847
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,960
You know, they can get people they just don't want.

848
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,640
They don't want the staff.

849
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,800
This is it's quite a culture.

850
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,120
It's yeah, it's pretty wild.

851
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,800
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

852
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,640
It's always like the thing that happens with corporations.

853
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,080
And it always happens to some degree, because I feel but like right now,

854
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,720
especially just in the world, this type of aggressive

855
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,000
like number crunching is happening.

856
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,800
Data science and algorithmic, when we were the social network and moneyball,

857
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,920
we didn't realize like, hey, remember that's coming.

858
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,280
It's going to fuck your life.

859
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,200
Yeah, everyone. Yeah, that's coming for everything.

860
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah. And that's what and I've said this story many times on the show.

861
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,680
But in the some Don Rickles documentary, Bob Newhart says that the mob was

862
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,800
it was better in Vegas when the mob ran it.

863
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,920
And he's right. Is that is a heavy adult.

864
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,080
I said it many times on the show.

865
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,080
But now it makes more sense than ever when we're seeing what Disney's doing,

866
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,280
because the mob would allow things that didn't make that much money to exist.

867
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
But now it's a corporation. You're pro.

868
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,440
Pro mob. I'm a mob.

869
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,000
Listen, the mob is cool.

870
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,840
You know, they they they dress nice.

871
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
They always smell good. Right.

872
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,840
Yes, cologne. You know what I'm saying?

873
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,440
On your cheek.

874
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,160
There's a little tab. They live by a code, you know.

875
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,680
I want to something.

876
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,720
I watched the first 45 minutes of Casino and Goodfellas and I'm all in on them.

877
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,520
Yeah.

878
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,000
Just so you didn't finish.

879
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,880
You didn't finish.

880
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,240
You didn't get to the end.

881
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,720
You didn't get to the moral.

882
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,920
I ran out and bought suits.

883
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,080
The loose loose tons of how you say really the jackpot with this thing.

884
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,600
I wonder what happened.

885
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,200
Great.

886
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,400
You know, talking about the All-Stars,

887
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
I watched a bunch of videos of people reviewing them online.

888
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,840
And then there was one like very kind of dry informational one.

889
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,400
And they're like, hey, look, here's a benefit of staying at the All-Star.

890
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,600
You get to book fast passes 60 days out.

891
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,160
You get the magical express for free.

892
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,320
And then it's just like, you know, you get to use Disney transportation.

893
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,280
And those were like, this is old info now.

894
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,080
Yeah. And I was like, wait a minute, this is 2019.

895
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,880
Yeah. The three are gone.

896
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,760
Yeah.

897
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,000
It's that and that's that's so my heart broke when they got rid of Disney

898
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Magical Express.

899
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,280
Everybody hates Genie Plus.

900
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,080
I think. Yeah. What a bomb is.

901
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,160
It's a bummer.

902
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
And so like, you know, some of the things that I mean,

903
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,560
they still have the transportation that takes you to and from the parks,

904
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,680
which runs pretty often.

905
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,960
It's pretty cool. You're not going to drive anyway.

906
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,880
You know, like, and here's the thing.

907
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,360
Like, yes, if we're standing at Boardwalk, for instance, you can walk to Epcot.

908
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,480
You can get to Hollywood Studios relatively quickly.

909
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,440
But you still need to take transportation to get to Magic Kingdom

910
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,080
or the water parks or Epcot or Animal Kingdom.

911
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,560
So, you know, every hotel because Disney World is a city.

912
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,840
So every hotel has parks that they're near.

913
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,640
And but for the most part, you are getting on their transportation

914
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,800
to get to and from most of the places.

915
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,600
So like the fact that the all star resorts were never like walking

916
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,040
distance to many of the places wasn't a big deal to me

917
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
because I'm getting on a bus for 80 percent of the shit I want to go to anyway.

918
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,840
You might be in bed most places. Yeah.

919
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,160
I had most places, right?

920
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
You know, so it's not that big of a deal.

921
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,120
The one thing that somebody brought up to me was and you somebody,

922
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,640
one of you guys just said it, you were researching like what restaurants

923
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,040
are at the all star. Yeah.

924
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
And like they don't have any restaurants.

925
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,600
They have that they have the big cafeteria. Right.

926
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,240
So they have and each cafeteria has like three or four

927
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,240
different styles of food that they'll sell throughout the day.

928
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,600
So you can always eat and stuff like that.

929
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
But you're not getting, yeah.

930
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,320
You know what?

931
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,840
You know, like the one thing I like about Disney World is they got pretty good

932
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,920
restaurants at some of the hotels.

933
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,600
Like some of those hotels have great fucking restaurants.

934
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,520
Animal Kingdom Lodge is so good.

935
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320
I always forget the name of G.

936
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,600
I forget G.Q. and Buma.

937
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,080
Yes. About Fejiku.

938
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,360
Yeah. Yeah, that's incredible.

939
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,920
My for me, I guess it's all about how you travel.

940
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,080
Like if you are the type of traveler that, yeah, I'm going to eat at the parks.

941
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,120
But if I want to sit down and eat at a nice restaurant, that's not at the parks.

942
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,800
I would rather it be or just like walk up or anything like that.

943
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,440
Then obviously, this is better to do at a hotel that you're staying at

944
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,400
or you can easily walk to. Right.

945
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,320
The type of traveler I am, though, is if there is a nice restaurant

946
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,720
that I want to go to, like I'll look and research it before

947
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,120
and I'll just plan how to get there. Right.

948
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,080
And yeah, it may take like 20 extra minutes.

949
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,680
I may have to take a bus to the nearest park

950
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,240
and then from that park, get on a bus to the hotel I want to go to.

951
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,640
But like, I'll do that.

952
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,400
Like and I've had like really good meals and it only adds an extra 30 minutes

953
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,280
at the most, because the number one thing somebody told me

954
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,640
when I first started planning my first trip to Disneyland or Disney World

955
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,480
was just don't be in a rush, never be in a rush.

956
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,720
And so like I so I took that to heart.

957
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,320
So for me, an extra 30 minutes to get to a restaurant

958
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,280
I really want to go to isn't that big of a deal for me.

959
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,760
Like I'm not in a rush.

960
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm not going nowhere. You're in the bubble.

961
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
You know what I'm saying?

962
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
Like you're in the fucking bubble already.

963
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,680
So it's not that big of a deal for me in that aspect.

964
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,960
Or I may plan like, oh, we're in Epcot today.

965
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,160
Instead of going right back to our hotel, we'll just go to that.

966
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,200
Like we'll go to the Polynesian and go to the restaurant there for dinner tonight

967
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,120
and then make our way back to a hotel or something like that.

968
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
So there's ways around it.

969
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,600
If you want to go to the other restaurants that are throughout the

970
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,800
throughout the whole resort, that doesn't really add that much time.

971
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,920
But, you know, it's how you travel and you can take a lift.

972
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,000
You get you can also take a lift fairly inexpensively,

973
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,760
at least when we were there last time.

974
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,720
Yeah. Yeah. From like a hotel to hotel.

975
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,880
That's true. Except remember that when we were on this end of the property,

976
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,160
that was a lift nightmare.

977
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,840
There was a lift nightmare where we came back late.

978
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,320
And it was literally like roads were closed and from downtown Orlando

979
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,520
from a live show we did.

980
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,400
And we got like just trapped on the same road back and forth.

981
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,560
The driver could not figure out police had to like escort us.

982
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
It was over an hour or deal.

983
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,720
That you can blame that it's this end of the property or anything.

984
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,600
But it did like I was having like bad flashbacks looking at this area on a map.

985
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,840
Sure. Right. Oh, God.

986
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,320
Lift disaster after 10 o'clock.

987
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,440
Who knows? Who knows? Yeah.

988
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,120
Yeah. Yeah. But earlier is fine.

989
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,280
That's what I was going to ask is like, OK, you're fine with it

990
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,280
being like cafeteria food court style restaurants,

991
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,880
but you never found yourself in a situation where you're like trapped

992
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,200
or like, I'm not getting anywhere at this point.

993
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,160
Now stuck with these restaurants, which are kind of, you know,

994
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,040
they're probably fine. They get the job.

995
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,960
No, I never did, because, you know, for the most part, the way I travel is

996
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,760
if I'm at a park or if I'm out, I'm generally there for most of the day.

997
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,600
Right. And and, you know, and I always would get the dining plan,

998
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,720
which with the dining plan is a little easier to kind of plan your meals out

999
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,680
because you know where you except for like the quick service.

1000
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,040
If you is easier to plan your table service meals out

1001
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
because you need to know where you're going to actually use them. Right.

1002
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,240
So, you know, and then, you know, at the at the worst,

1003
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,800
at the absolute worst, I'm still at a theme park.

1004
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,080
So like if I have to just order a room service pizza,

1005
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,600
like it's not the worst thing.

1006
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,360
Like theme park.

1007
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,800
Yeah. Yeah. My bar is at theme park.

1008
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,040
And so if the whole piece of it has to be just delivered to my room, like

1009
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,680
I'm doing OK, I'm doing OK for the most part.

1010
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,880
But like I've never felt trapped in a hotel.

1011
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,480
Again, last time I was at a Disney World Park was 2018.

1012
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,640
So who knows what it's like now?

1013
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,840
But I mean, that is you mentioned the pizza in room, like pizza delivery.

1014
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,480
That is a common thing at the All-Stars.

1015
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,920
Yeah. Like the they all kind of I think one reason people like them is the consistency.

1016
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,960
Like there's a big food court in the hall.

1017
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,200
All the lobby buildings are called halls. Yeah.

1018
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,160
There is usually a giant pool and then one or two smaller like quiet pools. Yeah.

1019
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,440
You can get pizza.

1020
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,720
There's jogging trails. There's walking trails.

1021
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,120
There is like some exercise. Yeah.

1022
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,920
Yeah. So you can exercise and they're all in a row, the three hotels.

1023
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,600
Yeah, they're all relatively close to each other.

1024
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,240
Yeah. So you can walk to the other all if you want just to change of pace.

1025
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,480
Now, you're going to find your change of pace is very similar to what you have just left.

1026
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,160
But yeah, it's very similar scenery.

1027
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,280
I mean, one cool thing about that is

1028
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,160
so they used to do like movies at the pool.

1029
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Yeah. They would bring out the big inflatable screen.

1030
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,120
And one time one of the movies was a movie.

1031
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,360
It was my fiance at the time.

1032
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,320
We didn't want to see that movie, but the other resort was showing a movie

1033
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,880
we did want to see. So we just like walked over to that resort.

1034
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,000
It took five minutes to walk over there from where we were.

1035
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,560
Watch that movie and then came back to our hotel.

1036
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,600
So like that was a cool thing to be able to do and that they were pretty close to each other.

1037
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,120
But I think these these and and this area,

1038
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,880
this is like the southern, very southern part of the property.

1039
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,880
I think it crosses.

1040
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,600
It is in Osceola County, not Orange County.

1041
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
Is it another county?

1042
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,560
Is that so wild?

1043
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,440
Disneyland border is in two different counties.

1044
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
But I love this.

1045
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,440
What you were saying about like, yeah, if I'm at the park,

1046
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,680
I'll just take a bus to another hotel.

1047
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,800
When when I was a kid, like my parents were like, OK,

1048
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,560
and then if we have to get to a hotel for dinner,

1049
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,080
we'll have to get to the ticket and transportation center.

1050
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,800
But as everything has built up, it's like, well, no, each park

1051
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,000
and Disney Springs are now like transportation hubs.

1052
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,200
So they all are.

1053
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,720
Just get to one of those.

1054
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,120
You can get anywhere like I get anywhere.

1055
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,760
Yeah. I stayed at Pop Century.

1056
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,240
What it's just like, I want to go to this one hotel.

1057
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,640
I was like, oh, Disney Springs is right there.

1058
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,560
I'll just go to Disney Springs and then get a bus to the hotel.

1059
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,880
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure.

1060
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,720
And depending on what time of day you're doing, like those buses run.

1061
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,360
Like if it's really late, you may wait. Yeah. Yeah.

1062
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,600
You know, you may wait a little bit for a bus,

1063
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,760
but if it's peak time or close to peak time, those buses are coming.

1064
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,880
Sure. Every like five to 10 minutes at the most. Yeah.

1065
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,920
So, yeah. You know, it's weird about the county thing.

1066
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,760
I was like, wait, does this mean like how are we looking on an electoral map?

1067
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,360
And in fact, most of most of Disney World is in Orange County.

1068
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,280
But then there's the Osceola Parkway and that's the division line

1069
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,840
and anything south of that.

1070
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,560
So it's all stars or it's not pop century pop centuries in Orange.

1071
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,480
And but it's just the all stars and the wide world of sports.

1072
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,600
And then outside of Disney, you know, it's right at the literally at the line

1073
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,840
is the Margaritaville Resort.

1074
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,800
Oh, yeah. I love this.

1075
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,200
H2O Water Park.

1076
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,960
So it's so if you're if you want to go to the rock and bruise

1077
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,080
in that's in Osceola County, but over.

1078
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,400
But you cross the highway and you want to go to the Red Robin

1079
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,160
or the Applebee's or the Hooters.

1080
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,040
That's an orange.

1081
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,240
It's an orange county and orange, at least in the most recent.

1082
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
This is a governor.

1083
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,840
This is the DeSantis Christ election. Right.

1084
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,440
Orange went blue and across the Seola went red.

1085
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,520
Yeah. So you're so you're in you're in DeSantis territory.

1086
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,680
I mean, all of it is, I guess.

1087
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,000
But electorally, you're in DeSantis territory at the rock and bruise,

1088
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,080
which makes sense with the connection.

1089
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,920
But that's a blue Hooters you got.

1090
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
That's a blue Hooters.

1091
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,080
We know we love our blue Hooters.

1092
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,960
If you're a CNN reporter and you want to interview someone in some diners,

1093
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,840
this is the perfect place.

1094
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,720
This is the perfect place.

1095
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,000
You just got to go right across the street.

1096
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,520
I'll do Applebee's here and then I'll do, you know,

1097
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,280
just going to avoid cars.

1098
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,480
Yeah. Sorry.

1099
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm just trying to get to the Denny's.

1100
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,760
I got to figure out kitchen table issues.

1101
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,600
So wait a minute.

1102
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,120
So so the all-star resorts are in red territory.

1103
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,640
Is what you're saying? Yeah, they were both.

1104
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,400
Well, it's been real all-star.

1105
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,320
Yeah.

1106
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,680
Well, you know, now it's trending that way with DeSantis and Chris.

1107
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,920
Literally, they were like, like one is plus eight for Orange's plus eight

1108
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,640
for Chris and Osceola.

1109
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,680
So all stars went plus eight.

1110
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,120
All stars went plus eight.

1111
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,680
On behalf of the all-star.

1112
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,840
No, that's what it was.

1113
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,760
That's where they were voting.

1114
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,760
They were voting right at all star music.

1115
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,040
And all their main issue is that like, look,

1116
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,400
sports is the first one on the bus lane.

1117
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,880
Like, so by the time the buses go to music and movies,

1118
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
there's so many people on the bus.

1119
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,160
Can't they redistrict to get the all stars in Orange County?

1120
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,040
Yeah, it's like they should.

1121
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,880
They should.

1122
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,560
Look, I mean, I was wondering, does any of this impact

1123
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,720
the way DeSantis is targeting the Reedy Creek Creek district?

1124
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,400
Right. Yeah.

1125
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,080
Like stopping Disney from doing it, although I'm starting to think

1126
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,200
none of that is happening.

1127
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,320
And that was all for show.

1128
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,480
It was all for show.

1129
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
It is not.

1130
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,000
Does that not sound like the DeSantis you know?

1131
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,560
Color me surprised.

1132
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,160
Full of bullshit.

1133
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,600
I don't believe it.

1134
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,480
But I but I do wonder, like, is this possible that

1135
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,760
due to like, well, they voted for me, so all star can keep doing

1136
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,160
whatever they want.

1137
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,040
But if that's the case, then sign me up, baby.

1138
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,920
Sign me up.

1139
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,120
He should announce his presidential candidacy at the all star.

1140
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,720
At the All-Star Sports.

1141
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,720
On top of a big star on a big football.

1142
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,600
Right on top of that football.

1143
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,240
Right on top of that football.

1144
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,520
He's running made his home run goofy.

1145
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,320
First in line for the presidency.

1146
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,080
They try to ask questions, but he just spits water out.

1147
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,160
The kids love him.

1148
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,040
I like it. It's honest.

1149
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,960
He doesn't say a bunch of bullshit.

1150
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
He just spits from the heart.

1151
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,320
One one cool thing, though, just thinking about like the big

1152
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,800
or one of the resource has like the Donald Duck and his nephews

1153
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,400
like spitting out water and shit.

1154
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,080
One of the things that like bothers me about Disney now is every new thing,

1155
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,160
for the most part, is generally an acquired property.

1156
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,400
Star Wars, Marvel, like, right.

1157
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,320
I think like the Mickey and Minnie Railway Railway was the first

1158
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,960
like ride or attraction

1159
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,840
that they had built in like 20, 30 years that actually used original Disney

1160
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,720
characters or something like that.

1161
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,320
That is not something that is not something they like acquired or something.

1162
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,440
Frozen in there.

1163
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,880
But I guess frozen. Yeah, it's pretty rare.

1164
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,680
What like the original Disney characters like the Disney Mickey Mouse?

1165
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,920
Like they don't build anything with them anymore.

1166
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,800
Yeah. So like I didn't know this the first time I went.

1167
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,400
But as I went back, I've been to Disney World five times now.

1168
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,200
As I've been back, I was like, it's actually nice to

1169
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,280
just have big Disney characters like Disney cartoons,

1170
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,440
like just kind of around and not Darth Vader or, you know, Star Lord or,

1171
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,040
you know, the Avengers or some shit.

1172
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,360
Yeah. So here are the the like industrial building where the Avengers work. Yeah.

1173
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,040
Yeah. Come out and say maybe maybe they'll come out.

1174
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,880
They're working. They're very busy.

1175
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,720
Yes. And you can't come in here.

1176
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,000
Never. You can never see what's on the inside of this building.

1177
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,280
That's calling out.

1178
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,880
This seems like that you it's fun to hear about sport.

1179
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,800
Goofy. Let's just get in the helmet.

1180
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,720
Let's just call out big stuff.

1181
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,760
Anybody likes this? Here's the big stuff.

1182
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,800
Freak. What is your favorite big stuff?

1183
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,000
I like the big jukebox.

1184
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,080
The big jukebox is cool. Star music.

1185
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,440
You love rock and roll.

1186
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,280
I love to rock. I love to rock around the clock.

1187
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,800
I like it's a little fuzzy in my brain right now, but I like the big

1188
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,000
like Broadway thing.

1189
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,320
Oh, the show to the show to the marquee.

1190
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,560
Like I like that.

1191
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
They have a few little street signs. Yes.

1192
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,520
And then a little mini Central Park. Yes.

1193
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,640
Field. Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1194
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,160
Say there's three there's three of them.

1195
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,960
Sports, music, movies.

1196
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,600
Movies was the latter one added in 99.

1197
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,800
So that's anything we throw out big things from any of them.

1198
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,840
I just want to make sure we named the themes.

1199
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,400
Well, I want to name the the music genres represented.

1200
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,880
You have Broadway show tunes, you know, country rock and roll jazz

1201
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,040
and then Calypso.

1202
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,600
Yes, one of the big five.

1203
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
One of the big five.

1204
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,400
We're always listening to a lot of I think that's Donald and him, right?

1205
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,840
That's the Calypso.

1206
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,920
The three Caballero in Calypso seems like.

1207
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,640
Kind of they had the Caballero's in mind first and then we're searching for like

1208
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,680
and what music makes sense.

1209
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,880
What can we put with them?

1210
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
I don't. Yes. I don't know if we can.

1211
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,880
What are the big Calypso artists of the last 30 years?

1212
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,480
Good question.

1213
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,640
Harry Belafonte. No, who's saying who says that?

1214
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,640
Is he probably not?

1215
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,680
Someone named Calypso Rose.

1216
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,840
All right. OK.

1217
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,320
I like the name. It tells you what it is.

1218
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,760
Calypso Rose.

1219
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,800
There's a steel drum with Calypso, right?

1220
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,480
Yeah, really?

1221
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, Jimmy Buffett has to have some Calypso inspired songs.

1222
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,800
This will not allow you to say that Jimmy Buffett is Calypso.

1223
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,160
I don't know.

1224
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,960
I think that is a real reach.

1225
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,000
Let me see. A reach?

1226
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,120
You got to have a couple.

1227
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,640
You can amend it with some if you want to put like,

1228
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,520
oh, if you want to call it like like Rum Ipso or.

1229
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,760
Rum Calypso.

1230
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,680
Apocalypse. So he has a song.

1231
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,600
So he's he's in the Ipso family.

1232
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,000
Is it a Calypso song about apocalypto?

1233
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,360
The Mel Gibson film?

1234
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,640
It was a very weird scene where you suddenly are watching

1235
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,760
and you're like, is that Jimmy Buffett's voice?

1236
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,080
I love it.

1237
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,920
Even the Wikipedia of Calypso, what they're calling out is like

1238
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,800
Harry Belafonte is jumping the line.

1239
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,160
Oh, so Harry Belafonte?

1240
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,480
You're right. Yeah.

1241
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,320
Or Under the Sea is Calypso.

1242
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,440
Under the Sea.

1243
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,920
Yeah, they could have did Little Mermaid.

1244
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,280
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't that?

1245
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,000
Sebastian, according if on the official Calypso Wikipedia,

1246
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
Sebastian is one of the main Calypso artists.

1247
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,400
What really?

1248
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,000
That's wild. Just in the list.

1249
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,760
This is what I'm saying.

1250
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,040
That like Calypso enjoyed some waves of popularity

1251
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,040
with jumping the line in Beetlejuice and Under the Sea.

1252
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,000
Sebastian is the second most popular Calypso artist.

1253
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,800
And they didn't use him. They used him.

1254
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,560
They own the one of the most popular Calypso artists.

1255
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,480
That's so funny.

1256
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,480
That's so funny.

1257
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,920
One song. Oh, no. Did he do with the sequel songs?

1258
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,400
Well, if you're including the videos where the voice of Sebastian

1259
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,920
Samuel Wright has a big party at the Caribbean beach, maybe that's why.

1260
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,240
Maybe he's already associated with Caribbean beach.

1261
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,200
Or also would Little Mermaid came out when? 89?

1262
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,240
89. Yeah.

1263
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,520
And All Star Music was 94.

1264
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,320
Which means they probably would have started planning it around 89, 90.

1265
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,080
Maybe they already had the plans in and they didn't know

1266
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,000
how popular Little Mermaid was going to be.

1267
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,440
Oh, maybe. Yeah, yeah.

1268
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,800
Maybe. Which seems weird because Little Mermaid was supposed to be like

1269
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,160
the movie that kicked off the new era of like Disney movies.

1270
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah, yeah.

1271
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,680
And I don't think, look, I don't know how much it costs to make a big thing,

1272
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,560
you know, because it feels like you could change. Six billion dollars.

1273
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,520
Well, if it's six billion, then I believe that seems high.

1274
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,760
But it's a little high.

1275
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,800
This is why they didn't change it.

1276
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,040
But you can make a big sabbatical.

1277
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,200
It couldn't be as big. Maybe it's smaller, but there's a crab.

1278
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:48,800
There's weird calculations all around because the in movies,

1279
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,080
that's almost maybe the weirdest list is like, well, OK, that's a natural.

1280
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,760
We're going to theme the different wings off of Disney movies.

1281
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,320
And there's infinite of those to choose from.

1282
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,960
So, of course, you got to go with Fantasia.

1283
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,840
Yeah, of course. Story. Yeah.

1284
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,960
101 Dalmatians. OK, OK.

1285
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,520
We're getting the love bug.

1286
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,120
Whoa. The love. Yeah.

1287
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,560
Love bug come from. Yeah.

1288
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,000
It's a little random.

1289
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,080
It's very random.

1290
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,760
That's very strange.

1291
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,280
The streamlining of the movies resort.

1292
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,960
And then you get into the Mighty Ducks.

1293
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,960
Yeah. Which is my favorite.

1294
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,800
I mean, that's great.

1295
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,680
I love that there's a big Mighty Ducks themed thing.

1296
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,200
But then you go to the pool.

1297
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,880
That's one of the pools there. Yeah.

1298
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,680
And you're getting it's basically it's like it's goofy playing hockey

1299
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,920
and it's a big duck mask.

1300
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,440
But this is the movie resort.

1301
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,360
Shouldn't we be seeing Gordon Bombay and Goldberg and Keenan?

1302
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,240
With the. So we should see Keenan.

1303
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,600
None of it should definitely have Keenan.

1304
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,480
If they installed that now,

1305
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,160
I weirdly a little boy Keenan perfectly like here.

1306
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,480
Like Daniel Radcliffe still at Harry Potter land and he's little boy version of him.

1307
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,600
Yeah. If it's just little boy Keenan.

1308
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,640
I would love I would go back immediately.

1309
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,080
Yeah, I would go back immediately.

1310
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,080
There's a lot of push and pull.

1311
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,040
They're still currying your favor with all these different.

1312
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,000
These things are changing, but you get Keenan in there.

1313
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,680
I am there. I am 100 percent there.

1314
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:23,040
Oddly. Yes, it's a little odd, but like still big ass things.

1315
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,440
It is. Well, I love the big duck shaped hockey.

1316
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, yeah. It's just that's from the team, which we did an episode about,

1317
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,760
which I love talking about the team.

1318
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,000
They haven't owned the team in a very long time.

1319
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,520
So there's an area. Wait, Wild Wing.

1320
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,560
Wild Wing is the name of the.

1321
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,000
Yes. If the with the the goalie mask shaped in a duck way.

1322
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,160
Yeah, I do want to.

1323
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,840
I've never been over here, by the way.

1324
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,480
Have you been over here despite not seeing you?

1325
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,080
Have you ever been to the All-Star?

1326
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,320
I can't remember.

1327
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,720
I just maybe just passing them.

1328
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,680
But I don't think I ever.

1329
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,880
I don't think it is really hard to because

1330
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,280
even if you have passed them, it's hard to see them because they once you enter

1331
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,200
into the area where the All-Star resorts are because they're not.

1332
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,520
You can see pop century from like just driving on the street.

1333
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,640
I think you can also see art or animation.

1334
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,960
But like the All-Star resorts, you it's almost through another gate.

1335
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,560
You have to go through another gate.

1336
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,240
It's the off-seal county to the.

1337
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,640
Yeah. To get to the All-Star Resort.

1338
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,160
The All-Star Annex. Yeah.

1339
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,840
Yeah. You got to go through the All-Star Annex to get there.

1340
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,280
So they're not like super visible from just driving

1341
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,880
on the Disney freeways or whatever or Disney streets.

1342
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,800
Kind of hidden.

1343
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,320
And they're kind of they're kind of hidden.

1344
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,960
Yeah. Although I will say, speaking of big things, one of the things

1345
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,240
I love about them, too, is that they have their names just in big

1346
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,600
ass letters right in front of the hotel.

1347
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,800
They're huge letters. All-Star sports.

1348
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,480
It's really gaudy.

1349
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,400
Yeah. It's a gaudy hotel.

1350
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,480
Just yeah.

1351
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,120
Would just like let's just make everything as big as it can fucking be.

1352
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Which I appreciate.

1353
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,240
I appreciate making everything as big as it can be instead of.

1354
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,800
Let's make this luxury.

1355
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,520
It's like, yeah, to a kid, it's like, that's cool.

1357
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,880
Yeah. Also a big buzz.

1358
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,280
If yeah, if I took my son over, like if he if we if our hotel had a giant

1359
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,600
buzz late year, he'd flip out.

1360
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,360
Yeah. Even like the cult, like the colors, like the big green.

1361
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,520
It's just so in your face.

1362
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,840
All-Star sports. Limey.

1363
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,000
Like a lime green adult would be like, you know what it reminds me of?

1364
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,520
Seeing that picture. Yeah.

1365
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,120
It reminds me of and we're all relatively in the same age range.

1366
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,120
It reminds me of as a kid wanting to go to Nickelodeon Studios.

1367
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,160
Yes. Yeah.

1368
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,400
Like and how sad it is to see that building now as an adult,

1369
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,080
because it still has the shape, but now it's all white.

1370
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,280
But then I think the Blue Man Group went in there.

1371
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,960
But it but like nothing is nothing now.

1372
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,320
It's just nothing now.

1373
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,520
But like that was when we were kids and we all wanted to go to Nickelodeon

1374
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,160
Studios, right? Yeah.

1375
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,600
And so as an adult, go into a place that kind of like has that vibe to it.

1376
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,640
Yeah. Like, oh, this is this is dope.

1377
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,520
This is fucking dope. Yeah.

1378
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,800
And you don't see such big splashy techie colors.

1379
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,560
No, you don't. Anywhere, really?

1380
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,880
Other than are like the resort, the signs from the 90s

1381
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,360
that are still up in Disney World.

1382
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1383
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,520
Exit signs that look like the purple painted.

1384
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,040
Yeah. Blizzard Beach.

1385
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,720
Yeah. Yeah. You're hitting the face with that like 90s color aesthetic.

1386
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1387
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,360
Yes. Now, I was a little this is pop century, not all century.

1388
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,040
Yeah. But I'll edit it out because it's not considered.

1389
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,080
I mean, it will be it will be its own odyssey.

1390
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,560
But I'll edit it out. I'll edit it out.

1391
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,520
I joke. But I music right here.

1392
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,080
But that would be a fun episode.

1393
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,040
The the odyssey to get pop century, both

1394
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,600
both properties open is like a 20 year ordeal.

1395
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,520
Really? Art of Animation.

1396
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,720
Oh, really? Century.

1397
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,880
Really? Yeah, it is.

1398
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,160
Art of Animation did take a while.

1399
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,960
I do remember that taking a while.

1400
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,040
2012. Yeah. They started it at the same time.

1401
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,240
And really? Yeah, they started at the same time.

1402
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,400
Oh, what happened? They just 9-11.

1403
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,800
Oh, all right.

1404
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,520
Wow. You walked right into it.

1405
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
You walked right into it.

1406
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,600
Please let him ask me. Please, Scott, ask me.

1407
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,360
So let me say my numbers.

1408
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,760
Yeah. But then 2000.

1409
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,560
So that delayed pop century.

1410
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,840
The classic years.

1411
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,920
What is we know is pop century now.

1412
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,160
That was delayed to twenty two thousand three.

1413
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,200
The other one did not get open until 2012.

1414
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
OK. Wait a minute. Pop century open in 03.

1415
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,360
Yes. Oh, shit.

1416
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,720
I thought it opened in like oh, I was wrong.

1417
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,480
I thought it was like opening when I went to it.

1418
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,360
But it was it was new.

1419
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,920
Yeah. Oh, they broke ground in 03.

1420
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,160
And no, no.

1421
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,640
In 2001, it was almost done.

1422
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,680
They were ready and they're really the and then tourism drop was so steep.

1423
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,000
They're like, all right, close these projects.

1424
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,040
So they sat abandoned for a long time.

1425
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,920
And then they got the one open.

1426
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,280
And then the other one was abandoned for years.

1427
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,560
If you stayed at pop center, you would just look at the lapidated buildings

1428
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,000
that weeds were growing through across the lake.

1429
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,120
Target on sunset. Oh, yeah.

1430
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,600
The husk, the big husk.

1431
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,840
Same thing. Yeah.

1432
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,720
But the premise is the original premise.

1433
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,640
The art of animation was supposed to be the legendary years.

1434
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,640
Nineteen hundred to 19 through 1940.

1435
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,320
So think about popular culture like exciting, thrilling, popular culture,

1436
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,440
like the Monopoly game.

1437
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,520
Like Charles Lindbergh.

1438
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,280
So no, that's why I choked like, no, we should do it.

1439
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,920
I've said that the story is wild. It is.

1440
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,800
Yeah, I'm like looking at it now.

1441
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,120
It's pretty wild.

1442
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,480
Anyway, I mean, we'll get on the.

1443
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,400
You talking about 9-11 will become not a five timer, but a 911.

1444
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,160
It did. It directly applied.

1445
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,000
It is not a circuitic thing.

1446
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,120
It directly affected.

1447
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,960
Bob Newhart thing applied to.

1448
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
Yeah, it is.

1449
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,240
There's a reason we tell these tales.

1450
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,600
They're very important.

1451
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,880
You learn from them.

1452
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,200
I was going to say, OK, I know pop century is a different thing

1453
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,320
and we will make it its own thing.

1454
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,560
But the vibe is similar.

1455
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,280
It's you arrive at a big hall, as Jason said, it's a bit and like,

1456
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,480
and it is pretty gaudy.

1457
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,920
The colors are like I have to admit that when I showed up,

1458
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,200
I did not know the vibe of pop century.

1459
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:32,920
When I got there in 2019, got there, a big old line and a line with loud music

1460
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,440
and where with like giant yo-yos or whatever.

1461
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,400
And I was I was kind of thinking, what have I done?

1462
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,240
Like I have to be here for six days.

1463
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,960
And it ended up being fine.

1464
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,320
I actually liked the rooms and I like the kind of economical nature of them.

1465
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,760
And they were just redone recently.

1466
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,440
But I I got there and thought, oh, my God, I booked a room in a cruise ship.

1467
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,520
I'm in a cruise ship accident and I didn't know what I was doing.

1468
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,440
And I'm going to be nauseous every day coming home.

1469
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,920
And I wasn't fully true.

1470
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,440
But there were times here.

1471
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,680
What do you think of this? If I throw this out, am I am I crazy?

1472
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,520
Am I am I as a realist?

1473
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,640
No, no, no. If I say that I I like

1474
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,360
I did want to escape the vibe a little.

1475
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,920
I'm like, I don't I we've done so much Disney today.

1476
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,600
Do I really want to come home and pass by a big lady in the tramp

1477
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,280
and climb the stairs into a fifties diner, a record player?

1478
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,600
And like I was I was a little bit like this is the one I maybe would relax

1479
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,160
a little more if I wasn't as very fair with these colors.

1480
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,160
And then am I but now I know Mike's Mike's glaring at me big time.

1481
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,280
But no, I can't agree with that.

1482
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,320
I mean, I was in the 80s, 90s corridor.

1483
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,280
So I got to walk to my room and see a giant laptop, a giant old

1484
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,440
giant old laptop.

1485
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,160
Four stories high.

1486
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,360
And I was like, I never want to leave.

1487
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,400
You're kind of the wrong guy.

1488
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,560
Built the 2000s wing, which will have the towers exploit.

1489
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,480
You get to live in the towers.

1490
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,320
So can I did you do you had when you went to pop century?

1491
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,160
Do you have did you have a kid? No, no. OK, no.

1492
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,440
I think you are now I'm doing the math.

1493
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,960
He would love any of these. Yeah, I get that.

1494
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,080
I get that. You're like, all right, the hotel is my my time to kind of

1495
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,160
like I want a little Disney, but I also just want to like

1496
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,640
kind of decompress before I go back to it the next day. Right.

1497
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,720
I get that. I get that.

1498
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,840
I again, like this is all like I said, how you travel.

1499
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,600
I don't think it's joyless or anything.

1500
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,680
I also wondered like what I would have thought if the first hotel

1501
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:37,400
I would have went to would have been like, you know, the Polynesian or like,

1502
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,360
you know, like with my whole.

1503
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,920
But as like, you know, coming into it and just ready for Disney.

1504
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,840
So it was Disney, everything.

1505
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,160
I was like, yes. Yeah. Yes.

1506
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,120
Something different.

1507
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,080
I'm also a cruise head, so I love cruises.

1508
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,720
I'm going on the Disney cruise in two weeks.

1509
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,760
So for the first time on a Disney cruise, I know for the first time ever.

1510
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,600
I've never been on a cruise.

1511
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,680
Oh, I'm so curious. We haven't talked about them a ton.

1512
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,080
Which one are you?

1513
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,120
Just the one leaving from San Diego.

1514
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,880
Wonder, I think it is.

1515
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,440
I think Disney wondered, wondered or smaller boats, but should be fun.

1516
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,400
I'm excited for it.

1517
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,120
Yeah. Do you know what the what's the unique stuff about wonder?

1518
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:15,960
I don't know.

1519
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,400
And probably nothing like I they, you know, like they have a big ass theater.

1520
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,000
So they're going to do a lot of Disney shit, I'm sure. Yeah.

1521
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,000
Like live shows.

1522
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,440
They they have a lot of live shows on there.

1523
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,440
And just Disney themed.

1524
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,680
I don't know. I've been on many cruises, so I'm interested to see

1525
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,040
how this is going to be different.

1526
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,720
What do you go on like different types of cruise?

1527
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,000
Like we have I don't have any of us been on a cruise.

1528
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,680
I went on a my family went on a Norwegian cruise line cruise to Bermuda,

1529
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,520
New York to Bermuda when I was like in sixth grade.

1530
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,880
OK, but we're not like cruise guys.

1531
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,960
Is there like how many cruises have you been on?

1532
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,840
I have been on

1533
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,240
give me a second. One, two,

1534
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,200
three, four, five, six, seven, seven.

1535
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,360
And by the end of this year, I'll be on nine

1536
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,160
because I'm going to Disney Cruise and then I'm doing a Virgin cruise

1537
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,280
later in December.

1538
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,720
Oh, you're fully.

1539
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,760
The Virgin one is free.

1540
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,560
I got them free or else I wouldn't be going.

1541
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,680
But I got like a four thousand dollar room for free.

1542
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,280
So I'm definitely fucking going.

1543
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,040
Is there is so have you gone on a variety like is there

1544
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,360
the ones are more adult vibe? Yeah.

1545
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,760
Yeah, I've been on.

1546
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,280
I mean, the nicest boats I've ever been on were Royal Caribbean. Yeah.

1547
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,400
And I've been on like they're like latest boats, which is, you know,

1548
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,440
they have fucking roller coasters as going

1549
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,720
or like water slides that take you around the whole park and just like land.

1550
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,760
They have lands. It feels like lands, you know, like it's crazy.

1551
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,160
And then I've also been like with homies on Carnival Cruises,

1552
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,920
which is just party.

1553
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,360
Yeah, like as partying and shit.

1554
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,240
So those are the two cruises I've been on Royal Caribbean and Carnival.

1555
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,000
And I'm sure Disney is going to be a lot of kids.

1556
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:14,240
I'm I'm truly just going to say I've been

1557
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,680
to say I've been I feel like I've been on so many cruises

1558
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,800
and so many people know I love like the Disney parks.

1559
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,440
Those are like the two

1560
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,920
quote weird things that I like to people.

1561
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,120
So it makes no sense that I've never done the two things together.

1562
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,360
So I'm going just to like go.

1563
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,280
You know, you're probably dig it.

1564
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,080
I'm going to I'm going to have a fucking blast.

1565
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,520
I hope I hope so.

1566
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,440
How much it is because that's the crazy that Carnival Cruises,

1567
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,720
a three day Carnival cruise I can take for like four hundred dollars.

1568
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,320
How really? Oh my God. Yeah.

1569
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,960
Well, this is this Disney cruise was not four hundred dollars.

1570
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,360
So I started guessing, but that doesn't seem right.

1571
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,840
Yeah, it's it's it's a little it's expensive.

1572
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,640
But you know, I'm going to have a good time.

1573
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,440
You'll have to come back and talk about it.

1574
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,920
Oh, I definitely will.

1575
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,960
We'll see. Yeah, we'll see.

1576
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,200
We'll see if I have positive things to say about it, which I'm sure I will.

1577
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,480
The cruise that we're closest to going on is the Star Trek cruise,

1578
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,840
the yearly Star Trek cruise.

1579
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,320
You got to go like a big party.

1580
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,400
Yeah, I think theme cruises are I've never been on one,

1581
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,000
but I think they will be very fun because you just like summer camp.

1582
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,040
You're just around a bunch of people who like what you like.

1583
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,160
Yeah. And you're like isolated.

1584
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,520
So you're forced to hang out with each other,

1585
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,240
which once it's kind of like going to Disney World.

1586
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,960
Once you're in the bubble, you're in the fucking bubble.

1587
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,560
Yeah, you just kind of you just vibe with it.

1588
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,000
At that point, Disney has that new cruise.

1589
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,640
The Disney Wish was just unveiled a few months ago,

1590
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,880
and they sent a lot of like reporters and vloggers.

1591
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,680
And my girlfriend and I were watching all these videos and we're like,

1592
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,200
I think we want to go on this cruise ship.

1593
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,000
I'm like, yeah, I consider that.

1594
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
And it's like, yeah, I think some of the Germany stuff

1595
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,200
for the last few years is fading away because we're like, I know.

1596
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,920
On that cruise ship, the first cruise I went on at post,

1597
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,400
well, you know, post lockdown, depending first, first, first,

1598
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,200
Germany stuff.

1599
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,640
I like pandemic is called Germany.

1600
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,160
Yeah, the Germany side.

1601
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,640
It's a nicer way to think of that.

1602
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,720
Yeah, the German stuff.

1603
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,680
Yeah. But for me, I'm like, you know, I get once I got past it after a day,

1604
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm like, this is almost the same as being in like an all inclusive resort

1605
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,920
where everybody's around and touching the same shit.

1606
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:34,840
Right. Yeah.

1607
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,200
Stuff. So, you know, at least if I want to, I can spend all my time outside

1608
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,960
on the cruise. Oh, yeah.

1609
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,320
If you want to. Sure. Yeah.

1610
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,440
If you want to. Yeah.

1611
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,040
But I don't care because COVID ain't real.

1612
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,360
Y'all, y'all heard it right here on podcast.

1613
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,880
The ride COVID not written.

1614
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,840
I'm not editing that out.

1615
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,720
I'm editing Scott's pop century thing out, but I'm not editing that.

1616
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,640
Do you even see the big poster board that says the truth on it?

1617
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,040
The truth.

1618
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,040
I've been I've been sitting here with above my head the whole like.

1619
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,120
I don't know what it meant, but now I do.

1620
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,360
What else have we not said about the names of the bar and the food courts?

1621
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,240
Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1622
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,400
OK, so what do we think of these names?

1623
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,360
Because I'm a little bit let down by like a couple of the food courts

1624
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,840
on the website just use the same photo stock photo of a hamburger.

1625
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,120
Yeah, not a good sign.

1626
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,400
They're not really like showcasing, but like it sports its end zone food court.

1627
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,640
Yeah. The grandstand Spirits Pool Bar.

1628
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:36,120
Yeah. At movies, it's world premiere food court

1629
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,680
and the silver screen spirits pool bar.

1630
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:45,880
And then at the music, sorry, intermission food court,

1631
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,760
which I think is the worst name, maybe that's terrible.

1632
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,920
Because movies don't have intermission, Joe. Right.

1633
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,200
The rare one every five years.

1634
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,760
Maybe a Tarantino, maybe singing and the singing spirits pool bar.

1635
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,120
I don't know. Intermission.

1636
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,200
Oh, I got confused.

1637
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,200
I'm so sorry. Yes. Intermission is music.

1638
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,800
So it makes sense for the show tunes wing only for the Broadway.

1639
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,320
For the sometimes concerts.

1640
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,120
Unless it's like an old James Taylor might have an intermission at the Hollywood Bowl.

1641
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,520
Yeah, but we always do intermission.

1642
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,880
We suppose if you're old enough, you do an intermission.

1643
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,160
If you need to go and take your inhaler in the back.

1644
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,640
It's open one of these squares singing spirit.

1645
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,240
OK, so they're all spirits.

1646
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,600
Yeah, that's what a drink you can call a drink.

1647
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,440
We always call them spirits.

1648
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,280
How about the spirits?

1649
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,400
John Taffer might call them spirits, but

1650
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,360
he's in the business.

1651
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,520
Yeah, he's in the spirit business.

1652
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,320
That's a bullshit name.

1653
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,080
Shut it down.

1654
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,520
It's a little I mean, I think the thing about the All-Stars

1655
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,240
is that after Disney World had been open for 20 plus years and stuff, they

1656
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,600
I do give them credit for knowing like, OK, this is what

1657
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,080
how people vacation in this place, like the All-Star, like

1658
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,720
that's everything a family blitzing through the parks.

1659
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,720
There's a food court.

1660
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,920
There's a coffee bar. There is a bar.

1661
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:20,200
I don't know the law, the smarts about like all the bars are pool bars

1662
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,080
and they're mostly outside and it rains every day in Orlando.

1663
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,520
You know? Yeah.

1664
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,240
But so you're saying that that it's appropriate, the level of thought

1665
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,680
put into the theming for the average goer of the All-Star resorts.

1666
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,880
I think, yeah, if you're kind of running in

1667
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,160
running through all these things with 80 degree or 80 percent humidity,

1668
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,000
six hours of sleep at night, you might not notice that it's like,

1669
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,360
what the intermission?

1670
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,760
Yeah, you might not know that you're in the intermission. What?

1671
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1672
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,000
Eating a meal at intermission.

1673
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,960
And they do have they do have like the pool bars.

1674
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,640
You can't sit under them and they have like go on and sit if it's raining.

1675
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,320
They're like, yeah, but they're not like bars.

1676
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,000
Like, you know, like you're not going down to the lobby bar.

1677
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,080
If you just want to try to play was the indoor real estate was allocated

1678
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,680
for some of the biggest arcades you've ever seen.

1679
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,240
Yeah. Oh, yes. That's right.

1680
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,600
Yeah. I love the arcades. Yeah.

1681
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,880
I rest in peace. Disney Quest 2.

1682
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,440
I missed it. Oh, wow.

1683
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,840
Disney Quest. Oh, I did like Disney Quest.

1684
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,680
It was just cheesy enough for me.

1685
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,440
And honestly, you didn't grow up with it.

1686
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,160
You did it for the first time at 21.

1687
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,560
No, I did. I grew up with it.

1688
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,840
It was a Chicago first. Oh, right.

1689
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,640
It was a Chicago first.

1690
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,360
So when I went to Disney World because it closed in Chicago.

1691
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,120
So when I went to Disney World, I was like, oh, shit, Disney Quest.

1692
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,640
I got to go back to it as an adult. Oh, wow.

1693
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,480
Nothing had changed.

1694
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,680
Yeah. Nothing. Nothing had changed at all.

1695
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,560
Oh, I'm so jealous. Nothing had changed at all.

1696
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,320
You were in a Disney Quest city.

1697
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,080
Did you do a lot?

1698
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,720
We went we went when I was getting that Disney Quest became ESPN zone.

1699
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,240
OK. And Chicago.

1700
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,040
That's a good change.

1701
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:02,760
Which was fun.

1702
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,000
It's where me and my ex went on our first date.

1703
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,920
That's funny. First date. Yeah.

1704
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,600
And and now both of them are in that NBA store now.

1705
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,920
But when I went to Disney World, they had both the Disney Quest

1706
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,800
and ESPN, which was very fun.

1707
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,600
That's why it's perfect.

1708
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,520
That's why I was perfect. Best place.

1709
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,560
But yeah, now, Disney, I did.

1710
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,480
I did enjoy Disney Quest because it was just like a throwback to.

1711
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,880
Yeah. Like more fun.

1712
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,520
Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid. Yeah.

1713
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,720
So your first Disney Park was Disney Quest.

1714
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,400
I guess so. Yeah.

1715
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,240
Didn't even. Yeah. Disney Quest in Chicago, downtown Chicago.

1716
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,520
Man, this interesting perspective.

1717
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,160
Miss it.

1718
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,120
Disney Quest was not long ago.

1719
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,520
Like it was still in Orlando.

1720
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,280
Not too long ago. Yeah.

1721
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,440
Oddly, like 2017, 2017.

1722
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,640
Yeah. Yeah. I walked by in 2017.

1723
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,320
Still going strong.

1724
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,400
Yeah. They shut it down relatively like recent ago.

1725
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,520
Yeah. And again, nothing changed.

1726
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,360
Nothing changed.

1727
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,160
Nothing changed.

1728
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,440
They put in the NBA experience.

1729
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,560
So bad.

1730
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,400
The going the theme entertainment going public was not interested.

1731
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,040
No, because it was expensive and there wasn't a lot to do.

1732
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,360
And I loved the NBA.

1733
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,120
And even I was like, what the fuck?

1734
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,240
What is this?

1735
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,040
What is this?

1736
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:26,400
The NBA experience, I would think it would be going to a game.

1737
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,800
Probably, you know, I can.

1738
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,520
NBA experience, you know, which Disney World did have for a little bit.

1739
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,560
The bubble was there.

1740
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,320
Oh, right. Right.

1741
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,360
Speaking of bubbles, yes.

1742
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,920
All of the whole season during the germy time.

1743
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,920
The was at the Disney World Resort.

1744
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:43,880
It was in Osceola County.

1745
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,200
Yeah. All the time over the county line.

1746
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,880
During the bubble, there was all the talk of like people sneaking out.

1747
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
So I wondered, did anyone like, oh, like I got to get out of here

1748
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,320
and go to All-Star Music and take a look at the big things, you know,

1749
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
the easiest jailbreak to make.

1750
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,000
Yeah. Yeah. Did anyone stay there?

1751
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,800
Did they make I don't think you could like fit a lot of players in

1752
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,760
those other kind of small rooms.

1753
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,920
No, I mean, their families were there.

1754
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,920
Oh, yeah.

1755
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,400
And the bubble like stay in the bubble.

1756
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,480
But we have some of their families were there.

1757
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,920
Everyone was spread out among the hotels.

1758
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,400
I believe distribution was based on team rankings.

1759
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,440
It was like like the more and further you went,

1760
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,760
the more family members you could get to come and stay.

1761
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,840
So they made that an incentive.

1762
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,040
Yeah. It's a little like psychotic.

1763
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,120
Play Dribble Good.

1764
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,200
You better Dribble Good.

1765
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,880
If you want to see your kid.

1766
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,720
We will allow one more child to come based on your dribbling.

1767
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,920
Wow. Is there a there has to be a list somewhere

1768
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,640
just of which teams stayed in what hotels?

1769
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,480
There is. Yeah, I'm sure there is.

1770
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,160
Yeah, I'm sure.

1771
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,560
I look at that because that's fascinating to me.

1772
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,160
Yeah, I didn't know that's how it was.

1773
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,960
So did people have to be in the All-Stars?

1774
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,720
You would literally stay in the literal All-Stars were in all the All-Star

1775
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,000
Resort or they have been in the sports resort.

1776
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,360
All in the sports resort.

1777
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,280
Maybe that's where they put the family.

1778
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,480
Yeah, that's where they put the fan.

1779
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
You guys stay in the value resorts. Right.

1780
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,440
Because I think Disney World was closed at that point.

1781
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,080
Yeah. I'm not mistaken.

1782
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,920
Or right. It opened in July.

1783
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,200
It was a little bit of crossover, I think.

1784
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,360
Yeah.

1785
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,440
July's when there were vloggers, there were people going like,

1786
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,560
I'm staying at the Grand Floridian.

1787
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,440
I cannot go in these buildings because NBA players are staying here.

1788
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,240
Yeah. Right. Right.

1789
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,520
That's wild. What a time.

1790
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,120
Yeah, things. Boy, things get messed up.

1791
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,920
It's a really weird way.

1792
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,760
Oh, we didn't mention that about the sports one.

1793
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,840
A lot of visiting

1794
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,040
like middle school, high school sports teams will stay there.

1795
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:52,240
If there's competition like cheerleading competitions or or Pop Warner football,

1796
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,520
people will stay usually at the All-Stars.

1797
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,120
You didn't say the All-Star.

1798
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,920
You went on a band trip once to where we stayed off.

1799
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,040
We stayed off site.

1800
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,600
OK, because it was the cheapest because it seems like very easy.

1801
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,760
Like, well, you want your band to come and play.

1802
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,480
Why not stay at the All-Star music?

1803
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,000
You come on in. You all like music.

1804
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,400
It's not that much more than the holiday in or the mayor or Japan for outside.

1805
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,600
I mean, I think it was smart.

1806
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,240
Like if you're going to pay for a Hilton,

1807
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,640
which, you know, if you unless you get points,

1808
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,680
you might as well spend less money and just stay on property

1809
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,360
and get all the perks of the difference.

1810
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,680
They don't know the difference.

1811
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,040
They don't know the difference at all.

1812
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,560
Like kids all traveling together at these res.

1813
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,080
I could see it. I'm coming.

1814
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,120
I think my icy heart is melting.

1815
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,640
Once you got past the hall, I was surprised that like,

1816
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,520
oh, yeah, it's all pretty chill.

1817
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,560
I mean, the pool's a little noisy, but like, yeah, the vibe is pretty good.

1818
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,600
I never really felt I never really felt every time I stayed.

1819
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,280
And again, like first time I went, I was 21. I'm 36 now.

1820
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Last time I was there was 18.

1821
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,880
So how long was I was early 30s then?

1822
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,640
You know, I do not like kids a lot more than I did then.

1823
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,680
And like, you know, in a cute way to not like his.

1824
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,920
But like, I, I, I do wonder, like if

1825
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,680
I never felt like it was like frantic over

1826
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,880
like, or it was like too much like I'd never felt.

1827
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah, it felt like even like staying in a pool.

1828
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,360
Like that, that would be the same in any of the resorts.

1829
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,240
Like, you know, all the kids and some of those, yeah, some of the,

1830
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,800
the like fancier hotels, quote unquote, have pretty chaotic, chaotic,

1831
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,480
chaotic pools. Right. Yeah.

1832
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:47,000
And so I'm not really, which is where I would spend most of my time

1833
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,440
if I was at the hotel, like in the pool area or, you know,

1834
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,920
maybe I would grab some food, maybe go to the arcade, but you're mostly outdoors,

1835
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,080
which never felt too wild. Yeah. Yeah.

1836
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:04,360
I wonder how that would feel now. Like, you know, in my mid to late thirties,

1837
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,080
if I would be like, huh, one more kiss splash me with water.

1838
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,200
But like, I'd probably be fine.

1839
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,840
You probably wouldn't get thrown into a rage. Yeah. Yeah.

1840
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,160
I probably wouldn't get it. I probably wouldn't go into a fit.

1841
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,960
Maybe I think all the rooms at this point have been redone to something

1842
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,240
similar to like what we say to in a pop center.

1843
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,600
I think everywhere is kind of art of animation.

1844
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,160
I think has a lot more character decorations and stuff.

1845
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:36,400
But like, again, the way people like to go on these trips, it's like, OK,

1846
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,880
well, the second bed is a Murphy bed that when you put it up, it's the it's a table.

1847
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:45,240
When you put it down, the table folds down and there's a lot of storage space

1848
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,640
under the beds. If you have a lot of luggage. Is this the one you were saying that?

1849
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,200
At Pop Century. OK.

1850
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:53,160
I think all the all stars have been like turned into these kinds of things.

1851
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,960
Oh, really? Because last time I was there, they was just, hey, they're a bit.

1852
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:02,840
You can get you could get a queen size bed, maybe a king or double. Yeah.

1853
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,680
Which I don't know if they I don't know if they still do this.

1854
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,360
But if I can give everybody a little secret.

1855
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:16,200
If you ever go to any other hotels, I always request two double beds.

1856
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,520
Move that little table in between and put those two beds together

1857
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,440
and get the fucking biggest bed you can ever sleep in.

1858
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,480
Like in your life and like you put them both.

1859
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,920
And then when they come and clean them up, they don't separate them.

1860
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,840
They let they keep them how you have them and just put them together.

1861
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,600
And you literally are just rolling around like it feels like you're sleeping

1862
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,880
on an island and it is gorgeous.

1863
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,640
Yeah. And the only reason I discovered that is because Disney accidentally

1864
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,720
put us in a double room one time and instead of one bed.

1865
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,680
So we were like, well, you know, this bed is a little too small

1866
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,240
for both of us to sleep in.

1867
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,240
So we just put them both together and we were like, this is great.

1868
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,760
This is fantastic.

1869
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,880
Beyond King. It's an emperor.

1870
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,400
There's an emperor.

1871
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,240
California King is only just longer.

1872
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,240
Oh, it's the same way.

1873
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,320
OK, it's the same way.

1874
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,040
Emperor King is.

1875
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,960
So yeah, put it to put in two doubles together or two queens together

1876
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,920
is the biggest bed you can sleep in.

1877
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,320
It's amazing where for a home to two beds.

1878
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,360
But in terms of like people like, I don't really need an ironing board

1879
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,680
if I'm staying at a Disney All-Star, but I do need a lot of a bunch of USB ports.

1880
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:31,600
Every device of those, there were a lot of them need that phone has to be charged.

1881
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,240
It has to be charged. There's no way around that. Yeah.

1882
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,040
I've one more little thought exercise before we wrap it up.

1883
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,800
These are big themes that they dealt with with big obvious, you know, it's sports.

1884
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,720
You could do big helmets and it's movies.

1885
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,760
You have movie characters and music.

1886
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,080
So it's a big piano pool and all that.

1887
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,360
If they wanted to add one more, they want to keep all star.

1888
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,960
What these big primary topics, what would fit as All-Star for?

1889
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,600
I was thinking about this, too, before we got here.

1890
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,000
And this isn't the right answer.

1891
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,160
And this is not my answer.

1892
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,960
But I just got cryptocurrency was the first thing I thought.

1893
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,440
Not the All-Star Crypto.

1894
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,600
Yeah, because Crypto.com is a lot of another exchange went belly up.

1895
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,080
Yeah. The Miami removed the FTX branding on the arena.

1896
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,880
Oh, yeah, they did.

1897
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,640
Yeah. So there's a lot of crypto.com is coming up soon.

1898
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,600
Yeah. Oh, is it going to disappear?

1899
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,480
Really? No, no, no.

1900
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,680
We don't know yet. We don't know.

1901
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,080
Anything's possible. I mean, West, by the way, I think.

1902
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,040
Oh, I'm OK. Yes.

1903
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:35,160
Sorry. I didn't know any of this FTX arena is where Miami play.

1904
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,520
Yeah. And that they're taking FTX off of it.

1905
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1906
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,680
I think this arena might have been designed by the same architects

1907
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,760
as the All-Star. Oh, really?

1908
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,960
I think maybe.

1909
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,600
But it's the firm.

1910
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,840
The firm is insane when you see it on the Wikipedia for the it's built by

1911
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,000
architect Donica.

1912
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,840
Love it. Name is like yelling architect.

1913
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,840
I might maybe I'm putting too many letters in there, but I they've built

1914
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,480
a ton of like recent high rise stuff in Miami.

1915
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,240
And I saw an arena in there.

1916
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,080
So I think maybe this is the same people who built the stars.

1917
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,160
That's a crazy idea.

1918
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,880
If I'm wrong, then I mean, you know, South Florida,

1919
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,040
Southern Florida. I get it.

1920
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,640
You don't hear this a lot of cuts in this one.

1921
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,960
But anyway, OK, let's

1922
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,080
yeah. Well, OK, how does that work?

1923
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,120
Because, you know, I only vaguely know I know there's like a theory

1924
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,800
and there's Bitcoin itself.

1925
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,520
Yeah. All the halls different now defunct increasingly currency.

1926
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,400
I think you would. Yeah, it would have to all be different cryptocurrency.

1927
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,960
You know, Doge as the dog.

1928
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,120
We've seen that graphic.

1929
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,560
So there's a Doge wing. There's an Ethereum.

1930
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,280
I don't wait. We've all seen that graphic.

1931
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,040
What do you mean?

1932
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,080
Dogecoin is sort of a meme.

1933
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,920
Do we know what I'm talking about?

1934
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,360
Anyone? I know Dogecoin, but I didn't know it was based on like a image.

1935
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,280
It's kind of a meme.

1936
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:57,560
There's like a kind of a funny looking dog's face that's often associated with it.

1937
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,400
And it's like, you know, it's like kind of started as a joke.

1938
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,480
But then like if you invested in the right time, you could be a millionaire.

1939
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,440
Or lost all your money.

1940
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,560
It depends what time you took the money out.

1941
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,880
But I'm right. You don't have to cut it.

1942
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,080
Same same architect.

1943
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,840
Wow. Yeah.

1944
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,200
Great. Nice.

1945
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:19,480
Michael, the interesting thing, the FTX story just keeps getting more and more interesting.

1946
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,960
I believe a chunk of the management team was all in a big polycule together.

1947
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,560
Yes. That's a whole million in their pockets.

1948
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,560
There were like nine people living in a big house that were running the whole thing.

1949
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,280
They were all in their 20s, I think.

1950
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,040
Yes. And they were all in one big relationship.

1951
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,840
They had a guy on staff.

1952
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,760
They had a guy on retainer who would fly in to resolve conflicts among this sexual polycule.

1953
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,680
And these are the people who build FTX.

1954
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,120
Yeah. And this is all star.

1955
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,600
And this makes me love it.

1956
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,240
Not the architects.

1957
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,880
We don't know who they have sex with.

1958
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
But it's the coin people.

1959
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,240
The coin people.

1960
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,040
Yeah, we're all in one big thing.

1961
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,160
One big relationship. Yeah.

1962
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:07,000
So and then basically what happened was since all this stuff is unregulated,

1963
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,840
they were taking all the money, all people's money that they had invested

1964
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,880
and then using it to invest in other stuff, which then if you start running out of money,

1965
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,320
gets you in a lot of trouble.

1966
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,120
And the whole thing went belly up and people lost a lot of money

1967
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,360
because they had their money in there.

1968
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,440
But their money was being used to make other money until it wasn't, until they ran out of money.

1969
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,240
Interesting.

1970
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,640
It's very similar to Bernie Madoff.

1971
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,360
When people would give him money, he would put it in a checking account.

1972
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,040
He would put it in a business checking account.

1973
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,320
And when they would ask for a payout, he would make a withdrawal from that checking account.

1974
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:49,600
It's what happens at regular banks, but there's just more regulation on it.

1975
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,880
Basically, your money in a bank is being used to make the bank more money.

1976
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,200
Yeah. But it's not being used as recklessly, I say, not really knowing.

1977
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,160
That's true.

1978
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,160
They've been at it for longer.

1979
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,160
They just know how to do it.

1980
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
It's FDIC in short.

1981
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,160
It's guaranteed by the government.

1982
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,440
So there's more, some quote unquote protection there.

1983
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,840
Are NFTs in the family enough that we can...

1984
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,840
Yes.

1985
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,840
Well, they're in the family.

1986
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,360
Absolutely, Bored Ape is one of the wings.

1987
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,360
Yeah.

1988
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,560
I don't know who else, because what other IP do you have?

1989
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,560
Yeah.

1990
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,560
Everyone, I don't know.

1991
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,800
We know Johnny Depp has those NFTs about his son's, the character that his son created

1992
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,120
in a dream.

1993
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,120
Which are what?

1994
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
Is it a cat?

1995
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,120
No, it's a bunny.

1996
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,120
It's a bunny man.

1997
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,600
Is it worth like $10 now?

1998
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,600
It's a good point.

1999
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,600
It might actually be skyrocketing as far as...

2000
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,080
He's on tour with Jeff Beck and everyone needs these NFTs that were made by Johnny Depp.

2001
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,080
I don't know.

2002
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,480
The Paris Hilton one, I think, that they gave out to all the tonight...

2003
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,120
She's like on the tonight show.

2004
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,320
I'm giving everyone an NFT.

2005
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,280
That I believe it's worth like three to $10.

2006
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,280
Love it.

2007
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,280
All right.

2008
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,280
Okay.

2009
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,280
Love it.

2010
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,760
Yeah, that is true.

2011
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,760
Yeah, that is a cheeseburger.

2012
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,760
That's a free cheeseburger.

2013
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:06,680
What do you call then, can you name like the food court or the pool?

2014
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,320
I'm sorry, this is all on you because you're a crypto.

2015
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,320
Blockchain spirits bars.

2016
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,320
Blockchain spirits, yeah.

2017
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,320
I like that.

2018
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,320
Okay.

2019
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,320
That's the bar.

2020
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,320
Yeah.

2021
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,320
And then the cafeteria.

2022
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,320
What's this food court?

2023
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,320
That's a good question.

2024
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,320
The...

2025
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,320
Bitcoin?

2026
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,320
Bike coin.

2027
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,320
Bike.

2028
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,320
Oh, bike.

2029
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,320
Bike.

2030
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,360
Bike coin.

2031
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,360
Here's the problem.

2032
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,360
Here's the problem.

2033
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,360
Coin bites.

2034
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:37,200
I don't want to be insulting, but that's a little too clever for the precedent set by

2035
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,200
the other All-Stars.

2036
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,200
That's true.

2037
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,200
That's true.

2038
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,200
In a better place, you're right.

2039
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,200
That's a perfect name.

2040
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,320
So is it called like the trading...

2041
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,920
Oh, wait, the trading post.

2042
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,200
Ben, it's like a...

2043
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,480
It's a pun because you trade the coins, but also you eat food.

2044
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,480
That's fun.

2045
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,640
It's just like transaction cafe.

2046
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,640
Transaction cafe.

2047
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,920
I think you got it.

2048
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,840
I think that's more of a phone for the thought exercise.

2049
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,840
That feels the best.

2050
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,840
Yeah.

2051
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,840
Wow.

2052
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,840
Wow.

2053
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,840
I would eat there.

2054
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,840
Transaction cafe.

2055
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,840
Listen, you can't mess up a Mickey Waffle.

2056
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,840
No matter how dumb the name is.

2057
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,720
No matter how dumb the name is, Mickey Waffle stays the same.

2058
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,440
That's a beautiful sentiment.

2059
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,040
And I guess on that note...

2060
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,040
On that note...

2061
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,600
You finally survived.

2062
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Yes.

2063
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Oh my gosh.

2064
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,600
Yes.

2065
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,600
So great talking to you.

2066
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,600
This was great.

2067
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Oh, I love all-star.

2068
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,600
I love talking.

2069
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,400
I've never got to express my love for the all-star resorts.

2070
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,880
You made me love them, I think.

2071
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,240
Listen, I think it's cool.

2072
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:44,240
I think if you're going to save some money, but without sacrificing, like enjoying the

2073
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:49,400
area you're in, and then also when I compare the prices, like the cheapest hotel at Disneyland

2074
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,080
is Paradise Pier.

2075
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,560
I can just, I can fucking stay at Red Roof Inn.

2076
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,520
Like down the street.

2077
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,080
Like, instead of paying $300 a night.

2078
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:04,400
But the cheapest hotel at Disney World, I ain't getting that nowhere else, so I mess

2079
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,400
with it.

2080
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,400
Jaquice, I have an update for you.

2081
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,400
Oh, please.

2082
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,240
But a thing we talked about on your last appearance.

2083
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,240
Oh, yes.

2084
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:17,120
Because the DuckTales World Showcase Adventure came up.

2085
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,040
Well, as of the end of September of this year...

2086
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,000
...Cartico Rodriguez, the vice president of Epcot, in a Disney Parks blog post...

2087
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
New guy, Cartico Rodriguez.

2088
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:39,000
She said, coming later this year, the DuckTales World Showcase Adventure is going to happen.

2089
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It still hasn't happened yet.

2090
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
We are running out of...

2091
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
A year ago.

2092
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,400
Even saying in September of this year, even saying later this year, you're running out

2093
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,400
of time.

2094
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,760
So, but maybe people were speculating, well, maybe for the busy Christmas season.

2095
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,600
I mean, listen, if that's the case, please, somebody let me know.

2096
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:04,760
If you go to Disney World during Christmas, or anytime between now and New Year's Day,

2097
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,920
and it's there, let me know.

2098
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,920
Because I still don't know.

2099
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,080
I recorded this in May of 2020.

2100
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:16,440
I recorded Donald Duck for this.

2101
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:20,960
As a reminder, this was because there's a thing in the DuckTales where Donald Duck is

2102
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,960
voiced by Don Cheadle.

2103
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2104
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
You were the Don Cheadle-ified.

2105
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,000
I was the Don Cheadle Donald Duck.

2106
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,960
So he swallows like a voice modulator, and then somebody asked me, like, do the voice.

2107
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,960
I was like, bro, that was almost three years ago.

2108
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,960
I don't remember it.

2109
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:43,960
But he swallows a thing and then becomes like Smart Don, or just no suave and, you know,

2110
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,240
good talking Donald.

2111
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,240
Okay.

2112
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,200
This is a scavenger hunt that you go around the countries in World Showcase and you use

2113
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,080
the Play Disney Parks app.

2114
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:57,320
I cannot attest to how much of Go.com is the backbone of that app.

2115
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,320
It'll never work.

2116
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,800
I will tell you, that app takes up a lot of room on your phone and it makes your phone

2117
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,800
very hot.

2118
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:09,640
So, if it's a cold day, warm up by downloading the Play Disney Parks app and going to World

2119
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:14,480
Showcase to do the DuckTales World Showcase adventure and hear J'Kees's voice.

2120
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,680
Please, please do.

2121
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:21,800
I mean, I am upset that I haven't been given free tickets to go see this.

2122
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:27,080
I should talk to my agent or my manager and be like, hey man, I have a voice at Disney.

2123
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,560
They can run me a ticket.

2124
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,120
I don't even have to stay at a hotel.

2125
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,600
Just run me a ticket.

2126
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,600
Yeah.

2127
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,440
Although, if you can get them to also cough up a little All-Star room.

2128
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,920
I mean, listen, I'll take a week back at All-Star Music.

2129
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,920
I'll take that.

2130
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:43,920
Sure.

2131
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,920
Give me a nice pizza.

2132
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,160
I'll be second on the bus.

2133
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Second on the bus?

2134
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,160
Yes.

2135
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,480
So, hopefully a lot of people have gotten off at sports, gotten off at music.

2136
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,280
I can sit down for a couple seconds.

2137
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,280
And you can sit down.

2138
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,280
Yeah.

2139
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,280
I can sit down.

2140
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,560
Full exit through the gift shop.

2141
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,200
Anything else besides the, you can't even, maybe if you can be heard in Disney World

2142
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,320
and we don't know and we don't, do that if you can.

2143
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,760
But anything else you'd like to plug?

2144
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:07,760
Anything, oh yeah.

2145
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,320
I mean, listen, watch Physical on Apple TV.

2146
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:18,360
I'll be, like you said, in an upcoming season of How I Met Your Father, which is a who,

2147
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,840
which is a Disney show.

2148
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,920
Disney made me take an hour of COVID class before I can go to set.

2149
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,920
It was great.

2150
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,920
I didn't know this policy.

2151
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:25,920
It was fantastic.

2152
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,920
And they recently dropped the vaccine.

2153
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:29,920
And they just dropped it.

2154
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,920
Yeah.

2155
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:31,920
I've missed it by a couple months.

2156
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,080
Does anybody, is anybody fun in the video?

2157
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,080
Do they have characters?

2158
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,080
Garsh, be careful.

2159
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,080
No.

2160
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,080
That's it.

2161
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,080
Yeah.

2162
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,840
It was interesting.

2163
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,000
Like it was just lady talking.

2164
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,360
And then also if anybody, you know, if you're in LA, come check out Comedian Feud, which

2165
01:33:52,360 --> 01:34:00,920
is, I host a live version of Family Feud with comedians and TV people and all the fun shit

2166
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,960
at Elysian Theater every month.

2167
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:03,960
So come check that out.

2168
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:04,960
Oh, great.

2169
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,960
I think I'm a fan of Elysian Theater.

2170
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:06,960
Oh yeah.

2171
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,960
Awesome.

2172
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:08,960
Yeah.

2173
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,520
I just also just thought, you know, it'd be like perfect thing to do.

2174
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,320
They don't have to do it anymore, but to illustrate the six feet, you get Pinocchio

2175
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:22,640
lion and you lie to a perfect six feet nose distance to serve as a living ruler.

2176
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,640
Right.

2177
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,640
Disney COVID video.

2178
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,960
That's a perfect thing.

2179
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:35,320
You get him to sit, you illustrate, you get him to say COVID isn't real.

2180
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,840
Although that could be a pretty dope pool design.

2181
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,000
Pinocchio at the top and his big ass nose is the pool.

2182
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Big narrow, yeah.

2183
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Big narrow.

2184
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Like Olympic labs.

2185
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It turns into the bird's nest.

2186
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Oh, that's cool.

2187
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
That's when it gets long enough.

2188
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
So that's the jacuzzi maybe.

2189
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
All the way in the end.

2190
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Fantastic.

2191
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

2192
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Great ideas left and right.

2193
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
For our stuff, you can find us on the socials at Podcast The Ride on the currently technically

2194
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
existing socials, but we'll see where things go.

2195
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2196
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2197
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2198
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
We'll see you on the socials.

01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2200
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2201
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We'll see you on the socials.

2202
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,960
Currently technically existing socials, but we'll see where things go.

2203
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,960
We'll see what happens.

2204
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,360
Merch is available on our T-Public store for three bonus episodes every month.

2205

2206
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,640
Club Three.

2207
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:23,240
You'll find all that at patreon.com slash Podcast The Ride.

2208
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:28,080
And Mike, I know you got all those edits to do, but if you wanted to just toss some, like

2209
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:33,360
some fun Calypso music in as an exit, just a suggestion, but you don't have to.

2210
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,360
I'll put yeah, Margaritaville.

2211
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:37,920
I'll put fruitcakes, any of the Jimmy Buffett songs in the end.

2212
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,920
Sebastian the crab.

2213
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,760
Does Jimmy Buffett ever sing with Sebastian the crab on any sort of Disney album?

2214
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,760
I don't think so.

2215
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,760
You can put it together.

2216
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,760
Yeah, I, it seems hard.

2217
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:54,280
Look, take your collection of Jimmy Buffett stems and lay Sebastian the crab over top

2218
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,280
of it.

2219
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,280
All right, fine.

2220
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,280
I'll do that.

2221
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,280
Okay.

2222
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,280
And it's playing now.

2223
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,280
And if it doesn't play right now, I got very busy.

2224
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:01,280
So I apologize.

2225
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,400
If it's not about to play and you don't hear anything, you just hear the forever dog sting.

2226
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,400
I'm so sorry.

2227
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,400
Oh no.

2228
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,920
If you put in Tropicallia music instead of Calypso.

2229
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,920
Oh, big fuck up.

2230
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,960
If you do that, don't include my voice in this episode.

2231
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:16,960
All right.

2232
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,960
Now that's some editing.

2233
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,960
That's some editing.

2234
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:21,960
No.

2235
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,960
No.

2236
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,960
You got a choice.

2237
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,960
Which one is harder to edit?

2238
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,960
Be careful.

2239
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:26,960
Well, lately.

2240
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,960
Pay attention for what's about to happen.

2241
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,640
Forever.

2242
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,640
Dog.

2243
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:40,200
This has been a forever dog production.

2244
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:45,960
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehm, Joe

2245
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,560
