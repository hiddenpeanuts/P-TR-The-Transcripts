An invisible underwater movie legend

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Walnut confusion

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Near future magic key restriction innovations

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And more sticky taffer bottle talk

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All this plus it's a small world holiday

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ho ho ho! It's Podcast the Ride!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Holiday!

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Music

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Who loves to celebrate a holiday icon

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's given us so much over the years

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Eisner Claus

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Mike Carlson

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I like that, I like Eisner Claus

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just the man or the idea?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Just the concept

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The concept, I think, yeah, thank you for saying that

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think he's somebody who you look forward to

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Or we used to look forward to what he would give us every year

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When he would come down the chimney

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What would it be? Would it be a new parade?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Would it be something that made any sense?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Probably not, but that's what was great about it

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But in 1997 he was like, let's stir up some Christmas lights

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Of course, that's what I'm saying

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Scott Garner is also here

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, Jesus!

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Did you see him?

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I didn't see him

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I haven't looked right this whole 40 minutes

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You forgot I even am part of this

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, guess what I am

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And here's what I have to say to that

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hello, ho, ho

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, that's really good

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Really good, yeah

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ties it together

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Boy, you know, when you first said it

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought it was a stretch

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then once you said you're right

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He had the biggest sack of goodies

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Every year of the Disney decade

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Or at least the part of it that we made it through

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And as the years go on

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All right, sure, there was my childhood bike

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Or my Kinect set

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Or the various things that meant a lot to me

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Growing up as Christmas

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But today as an adult

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I still benefit from the toys he gave me

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The swan and dolphin hotels

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And the connecting Michael Graves Causeway

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The Norway expansion of Epcot

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Many, many wonderful appearances

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And great skits on the magical world of Disney

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know what, I have to say

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I do think Eisner Claus has done more for me

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All told than Santa Claus ever did

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I agree, yes

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And your logic-ing of what I just said

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is actually the reason I decided to go ahead with saying it

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because I went, you know what, it's true

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You like saw the logic at the end of the tunnel

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, right

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I thought of the phrase Eisner Claus

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Said maybe that's something

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Maybe you can say that

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And you know what

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know if he sold the property

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But he definitely at least lived at a place way cooler than the North Pole

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, right

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That incredible Malibu compound

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That combined a bunch of other compounds

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As far as I know

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's just one little dopey village up at the North Pole

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't think Santa bought a bunch of properties

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
From adjoining Christmas millionaires

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't think there's a lot of Christmas millionaires

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That live at the North Pole

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't think

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a pretty specific area

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, the thing is

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As I will be getting into

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've been very busy lately

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Very happy to be back

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But with just the pitch that my life has been at lately

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Big, big regret

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have yet to dive into the full Christmas universe

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That exists in the feature film Red One

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, right

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So when I bring up adjoining characters

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who would exist alongside Santa Claus

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That mythology has now been defined

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Red One might have taught us about Santa Claus' neighbors

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because I've been so busy like a fool

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I haven't gotten to experience who his neighbors are

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, Jason and I were both there opening night at Red One

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But I just don't want to

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So jealous

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's so much to talk about today

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We were at the premiere

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We walked the red carpet

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then we went to a couple of local cinemas

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The same night

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The same night

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We were standing in the back nodding

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We were not involved in the movie

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But you did the tour that the filmmaker would do on opening night

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And yours was not the satisfaction of having made the film

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yours is the satisfaction of watching a new audience

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Greet this wonderful film

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And throw all their joy at the screen

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can I ask what's the name of the rock

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Gael Gadot Netflix movie?

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, this is very confusing

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I believe that is Red Notice

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's Red Notice

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then there's other

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because Red Notice which as we know at least at the time was the most watched feature film ever made by anyone anywhere

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But then that record was beaten by another Netflix movie with a color in it

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Which I think was the Grey Man

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's a Russo Brothers Grey Man I think

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is that a Tom Holland movie?

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is that Chris Evans?

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Or is that Tom Holland?

143
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Cherry is Tom Holland

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Cherry is Tom Holland

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's kind of

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Cherry is red

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Cherry is red so it's close

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But it's not exactly cut from the same

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And it's an apple

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Cherry on apple

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's kind of this

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's kind of part of the fruitiverse

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But Grey Man

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Netflix is all about the color verse

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They did Red Notice the biggest movie ever made

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then Grey Man the biggest movie ever made

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But now Amazon has made Red One the biggest movie ever made

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So I mean you got to really stay on top of these charts

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a lot

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a lot to

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm just glad you guys were there to support seeing it time after time

166
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Did you like

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The opening night's enough to pack in like

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Assuming that you stayed up until like 4 a.m.

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like did you guys fit in like six viewings in the first night?

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Six, yeah

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Great, great

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well congratulations

173
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you for supporting art

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
For supporting cinema

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, of course

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And just to be

177
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Also to be super clear

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Dwayne Johnson's character in this is Callum Drift

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So I assume that

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Callum or Calum

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can I just guess

182
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Callum

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well that

184
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright well you just told me that you

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You weren't dressed as Callum Drift because you would have known that

186
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So you must

187
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh yeah

188
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You must have been dressed as Jack O'Malley

189
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I was

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Which is Chris Evans' character

191
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There's some

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Jason there's something telling me that your costume was Gryla

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That you were Kiernan Shipka's character Gryla

195
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh yeah

196
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I knew it

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I knew

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I was for sure

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can always tell

200
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Astrological signs

201
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I can always tell who's a Gryla

202
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And you're definitely the Gryla of the group

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's Gryla

204
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He loves

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's the part of the Gryhive

206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They call it

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah

208
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No I

209
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know

210
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think it's a shame

211
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
AMC theaters have been complaining about the Gryhive

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Getting a little too

213
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Rowdy

214
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Rowdy at the screenings

215
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Which I think is wrong

216
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You want people to be engaged

217
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You want people

218
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah of course

219
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sing

220
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are they so wicked

221
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do they want you to sing along

222
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then here they want you to be rowdy at the Red One screenings

223
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah

224
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah for whatever reason one of the screenings we went to we were the only people there

225
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And there's no real song associated with it

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That I've delved into yet

227
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So I just started singing the

228
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Unfrosted song

229
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh yeah

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's no song

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sweet

232
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want to sing along to something during the movie

233
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Give me that sweet morning heat

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah

235
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Every single day of the week

236
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm so glad that in taking up space in my brain

237
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Me now as a parent of two

238
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Holding space what you say

239
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Holding space

240
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I had a feeling that we were not going to make it 10 minutes into this episode of that talking about holding space

242
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh and it's going to be so timely by the time this one comes out

243
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's up to us to keep the concept of holding space alive no matter how many weeks have passed

244
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah you might say I've heard that people

245
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I work in serial media

246
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I hear that people have been holding space with the lyrics of sweet morning heat

247
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And really feeling that and empowering that

248
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I think that's beautiful

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah

250
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I think if you told that to Jerry Seinfeld

251
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He would tear up and say that's what I wanted

252
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then Jim Gaffigan would weirdly hold his finger

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're going on tour again

254
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I saw Jimmy Fallon a couple nights ago

255
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Who is going on tour?

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Jim and Jerry

257
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So they're going to be able to hold fingers

258
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh great

259
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I hope that's what it is

260
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I hope it's mostly them weeping

261
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah

262
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do we need to explain what any of this is?

263
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know

264
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Maybe it's in if you know then you do and if you don't you don't

265
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe if you don't you've turned this episode off by now

266
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah yeah yeah

267
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well I look I'm so happy to be back and bullshitting with y'all

268
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah of course

269
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
As you're hearing this I think if I have the timeline correct

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The listener has heard at least one episode with me

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But this is in our chronology in our timeline

272
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is the first one we've recorded together in several months

273
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So it's kind of my official homecoming

274
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right

275
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In a way

276
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That feels very pompous to be declaring for myself

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Welcome me back guys

278
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I believe I'm waiting for a welcome back

279
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was like I'm not sure how to do this is the big hello

280
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because then there's also an episode that people have voted on on the Patreon

281
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's your rebuttal

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And I was like is that going to be more of the episode where we go welcome back

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you think? Are you happy with what we did?

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know

285
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're going to have to go behind the paywall to maybe see exactly your thoughts

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But then I wasn't sure

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's hard to figure this out

288
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We're still in this weird multiverse

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This weird timeline situation here

290
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes true

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It'll be settled next year I think

292
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What it is

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is this is the

294
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well it's the main feed return

295
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Although again you've maybe heard

296
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No I think I've heard you by now

297
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah I think so

298
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But I deferred

299
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I didn't talk about it

300
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's right

301
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You didn't talk about it

302
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah we're talking about it

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Look the point is

304
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Say welcome back

305
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm waiting

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Welcome back

307
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you dad

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh boy

309
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is more confusing than trying to figure out a security detail for Santa Claus himself aka Red One

310
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes welcome back

311
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Now we know how hard Gryla's got it

312
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The audience is now wondering why we haven't welcomed you back on any other episodes

313
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sure

314
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well we'll get this a lot more straightened out

315
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Not that it'll be fully straightened out because I still don't know if I'm fully back

316
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You might still hear ones without me

317
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm still busy with things but I'm doing as many as I can

318
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I'm happy to be here for a little holiday homecoming

319
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is how I hoped that it would work out

320
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is the last episode of the, this is the last main feed of the year?

321
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The last main feed of the year

322
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes

323
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wonderful

324
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For sure

325
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well then just like very Brady Christmas

326
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Right

327
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is the time for the family to be back in one place

328
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right

329
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And to celebrate the great things that have happened in the time that we were apart

330
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Which before I get into anything that I've been doing

331
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let me say for the first time on mic congratulations Jason

332
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
On your engagement

333
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh thank you

334
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know how much you've acknowledged it on the show

335
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I have not acknowledged it in a way that counts

336
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which is in recorded media

337
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In person and in texts that don't count for shit

338
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But here I am on microphone saying congratulations Jason and James

339
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I haven't congratulated him on mic

340
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well well

341
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So you've beaten me to it

342
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm waiting around to be welcomed back to them

343
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I haven't done it either

344
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He's not getting congratulated

345
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's make all this right

346
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Congrats Jason

347
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Congratulations Jason

348
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Thank you very much

349
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you both

350
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah no it was nice to see and a fun surprise during my little sojourn

351
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I just want to say with that

352
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That I wish you to a very happy future

353
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That is full of Amazoning and prone bone

354
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And inflatable stuff with popping if that's what you want

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But only if that's what you want

356
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And mainly that you're

357
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That you can be thrown around as if by one of the X-Men

358
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
As much as you desire

359
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
By my very own father

360
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's done his own homework

361
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He's done a lot of homework here

362
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes I've shown my cards

363
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've listened to a lot

364
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You did drop a lot in the last six weeks

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now that he says it all out

366
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Which Scott says it all at once

367
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah I mean one of those I was still there

368
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This I will explain

369
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know if you didn't understand the wicked stuff we were saying

370
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Sorry look it up and hold space with it

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This I will say some of what I just referred to as second gate stuff

372
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
A lot of it was

373
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But imagine me not being on these episodes

374
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Just like kind of driving around

375
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then like hearing bits and pieces that just make me like

376
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My eyes just like go wide

377
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm making a lot of Kenan Thompson faces as Jason reveals

378
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well again it's just awareness of things

379
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That doesn't mean anything

380
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But like certainly dropping

381
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know something I think we face a lot

382
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Mike and I that we face a lot

383
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is that Jason will say something and we don't know what he's talking about

384
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And then in the comments a lot of people will jump in and say

385
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's a very famous thing

386
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I know what he's talking about

387
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It was heartening for me to hear

388
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As he's talking about Amazoning and prone bone

389
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That you're in a group with Anthony Gio and Zaccarino

390
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then nobody knows about Amazoning and prone bone

391
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Which maybe that says more about us and us not being

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
To call Jason in touch with ourselves as sexual beings

393
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Right

394
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So I'm just impressed that you can throw

395
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm impressed you can throw us these curve balls

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Seven years into doing the show

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then like 15 years of knowing you

398
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And I've never heard you talk about Amazon position before

399
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So I'm just impressed

400
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And in this context for the non main feed listeners

401
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This was it was initially brought up in reference to

402
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What a parade float of Goofy was doing

403
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well Goofy

404
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The Goofasaurus

405
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The Goofasaurus looking a little weird with it

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Which we will have to I think we're not going to do it soon

407
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But we didn't pay enough attention even to that parade

408
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I think down the line

409
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe we maybe we do the same sort of setup

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And just watch the parade

411
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The full world according to Goofy parade

413
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But

414
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This was I so I will say you know

415
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is a little chance to address some of what happened

416
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
While I was gone

417
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That that episode

418
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Main feed folks you're missing out because the real

419
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The good shit has all I feel like in general

420
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
A lot of the best shit is on the second gate

421
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And that was an episode there with Gio and Zac

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That made me jealous

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Because when I realized like

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait a minute you're backing into the world according to Goofy

425
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah

426
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I'm not there

427
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know yeah

428
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There certainly needs to be more talk

429
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You got you got to the goofball

430
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The big golf ball Goofy hybrid

431
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I didn't get to be a part of it

432
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You made me jealous

433
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
See that's what I was afraid of happening

434
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I

435
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You said don't know

436
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He did tell us

437
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We wouldn't get in trouble if you did something big

438
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah I know I said do big things while I'm gone

439
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Even if it means that it never it can never come up again

440
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Which is why it kills me that you took care of Mike's credit card points

441
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
While I was gone

442
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But if that means that there will be no more points talk

443
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In the future

444
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Ah

445
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It tears me up inside

446
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah I mean we'll we'll address this probably on the actual

447
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Club 3

448
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh there's gonna be

449
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's the

450
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There's a lot to talk about

451
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's the grand daddy of what there is to talk about

452
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
In the club 3 episode

453
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes

454
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh God

455
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Will that have come out by now

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Will I say what I'm about to say

457
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know

458
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Then or now

459
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know how to do points too

460
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I know what I need to do now

461
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I knew

462
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You don't mean also

463
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You mean the episode points too

464
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Points too

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Mike's credit card points

466
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Episode 2

467
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay

468
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I now know what I have to do

469
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Wow

470
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And a couple days ago it really dawned on me

471
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I kind of put it together

472
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's not gonna be soon

473
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I need a lot of time

474
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
To invest in this

475
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But I know

476
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh no

477
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's gonna be me

478
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Here I am waiting

479
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know

480
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's not gonna be tomorrow

481
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
With bated breath for points too

482
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's not gonna be tomorrow

483
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you going to dissect the paternal grandparents that I would call Graham Graham and Graham Pop

484
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Since you spent that one dissecting my mom and pop pop

485
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Or is that another episode

486
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait a minute

487
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know

488
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What you're saying doesn't sound familiar to me at all

489
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So it might have been one that I didn't listen to all of

490
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I am pretty sure Jason is referring to a second gate episode that has not come out yet

491
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh good

492
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay

493
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me question him on his pronunciation

494
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We all gotta

495
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh sorry

496
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There was a lot of interrogating Jason's lore when you were gone

497
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well look at that

498
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let the record show this happens when I'm not on the show

499
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Lest anybody think that all of the Jason interrogation is Scott driven

500
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Look at that

501
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah that episode actually will have come out by now

502
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So the listeners will have heard about your grandma and grandpa's barrel full of walnuts

503
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah

504
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That you would go into and heat up and have a warm walnut

505
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Heat up

506
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What are you making up stuff

507
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We've never heat them up

508
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We just crack them

509
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But there were warm

510
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You mentioned warm walnuts on the episode

511
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What

512
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well he was talking about the warm walnuts position

513
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Now how does that work

514
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Where do the legs go for that one

515
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's one of those ones that people post the images on Twitter

516
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Position of the day the yellow and pink creatures

517
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You think Mike and I are following position of the day Twitter's

518
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Position

519
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What's the account

520
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Position of the day

521
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think it's a website

522
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know people post these funny

523
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Now you don't know what it is

524
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
These funny graphics

525
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What's this Twitter

526
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't know I think it's a website

527
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is

528
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
A lot of what we stumble into with these things I feel is that you are just on different parts of not just the internet

529
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But of Twitter slash X slash horrible place than we are

530
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's that's that's ultimately what and and you know what we're the dorks

531
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We're the ones not experiencing sexual being

532
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh I looked as we should be

533
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I shouldn't have done the Google search I just Googled

534
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are they illustrations

535
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No it's like real people

536
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh

537
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't need to look up warm walnuts

538
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Maybe I have that wrong

539
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because I made that one up

540
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No

541
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah no I think that's made up

542
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We discussed warm walnuts Jason and the listeners have heard warm walnuts by now

543
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
A barrel full of walnuts with crackers and wet walnuts are the sundae topping

544
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe I'm wrong

545
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah I think you're wrong

546
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It was either wet or warm

547
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't remember what it was but it led to you talking about your grandparents barrel full of walnuts

548
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah

549
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's all I know

550
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A wonderful memory

551
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I know there was a barrel full of walnuts and the walnut was either warm or soaking wet

552
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How did I go on without getting to be part of the barrel full of walnuts conversation

553
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank God

554
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Please celebrate me home

555
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Back to the walnut talk please

556
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well I got a lot to catch up on

557
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And you're right that some of this will

558
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Basically I was going to come into this and consider this kind of the Scott return episode

559
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And do a little bit of response to some of the things that happened in I guess what we'll call the Scott free era as you did

560
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was going to drop a few just a few sparing thoughts on the Scott free era

561
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Lo and behold the great folks over at Club 3 the VIP subscribers have voted for me to do an entire full episode response to the entire Scott free era

562
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So that's some of what you've just been alluding to

563
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So if you want to get detailed granular episode by episode coverage of what I missed

564
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Head to Club 3 which is patreon.com slash podcast the ride

565
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I will I will I will leave this this thought and critique out of that one and say now after the run that we just came out of this is all right

566
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is this I this is something I think we have to figure out and I think this is this is non-negotiable as far as I'm concerned

567
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This this thing because this happened it's look it's happening with me here too in so many of these episodes we end up in these like inceptions of yes now you may have heard of about this from the past

568
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You may have already been hearing about this if it is in fact the future but divide that by four and maybe you haven't heard us talk about that we've got it we've got to get this figured out

569
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I agree we cannot be tossing these Nolan isms to the audience left I think the I think audiences things understand that the content is recorded out of order

570
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In friends the friends don't alternate camera and say this was actually recorded three months ago

571
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well that is a magic trick you see but I love hearing those behind the scenes tales

572
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's your note about friends you want more I'm sure I see how the how the characters are getting together but how is the sausage made I say do a reunion special every year

573
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But it's gonna get it's gonna get sadder and sadder and sadder and sadder and sadder

574
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Anyways that's just that's one that's one thought there will be other thoughts yeah forthcoming and now I get to kind of like luxuriate in it now I get to tag it relax and take my time but I will ask this at the top

575
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
How do you feel with the if this is in fact the end of the scott free era how does it feel how did it feel were you dreading this today taskmaster

576
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Scott being we have to be both back on topic I mean it was interesting it was an interesting experiment it was an interesting thing to do sure that's good

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Scott free I didn't realize was Ridley Scott's production company oh yes that occurred to me yeah I didn't realize before that brand so you couldn't see you didn't get any shirts made so I did not know I did see gladiator 2 though

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What do you think that's good fine sure that sounds like a good review yeah you know I'm putting in some good stuff Denzel's great you know

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I just saw gladiator 1 something I neglected to do my whole life so that's that's the kind of thrilling content that can be coming your way reviews of 25 year old movies

580
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So no I mean it was it was an interesting experiment but it was you know I I didn't know if something like an episode about points if we would have you would have looked at our patreon and it would have been everyone canceled

581
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Well I'm heartened by the listener enjoying some of the nonsense of the Jason and I nonsense this seemed like it this seemed like a very well received episode I have to admit I think that's true yeah yeah which and I have I have some thoughts about how to proceed going forward

582
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Knowing that information but again that that that I will save before the club through I don't want to burn it off all you do a lot of heavy lift I will say this I missed that you do end up doing some heavy lifting on the show sometimes thank you for so what do you what do you mean

583
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well anyway heavy lifting is relative I suppose not not literal no no not literally we set up the mic stand surgery not heart surgery or anything sometimes we have to move these chairs were sitting in from down below the stage record on to up on top of the stage and how big how high is the stage like a foot yeah that's a big lift heavy so yeah sometimes you're like oh I'm I'm I'm sometimes I would be like oh I'm driving this episode I need to check my notes I need to try to interject and then I need to also question Jason about something he

584
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:24,000
said that I don't know his history so I'm like I'm like oh this is a tough job I'm doing and it's interesting now that I'm doing like I'm trying to like cycle through all of it in my head so I'm like oh Scott would have done two of these jobs so it's interesting it's interesting so so and you're and you're recording you know you're always wearing so it's an interesting at all times so yeah I can relax a little bit you know if

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I know what you mean by the way about a barrel you know you could say what's that barrel all about or I could say what's that barrel all about now you know it is nice to have I feel when we've done two person episode there is something about like yeah it is like more of it is on you sometimes I feel especially when we have a guest where you know we want to do a good interview with the guest or it's a very funny person or somebody we didn't know I sometimes think like well I may be better off in host mode here and maybe I don't have as much fun like just with pure comedy that can happen

586
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:24,000
yeah yeah these are the thing not to not well though maybe we should get in out of the sausages made which is what Jason like that's true sure how did you feel about the scott free oh I mean I felt good I feel like I just brought my my brand of thinking I'm normal and accidentally bringing chaos that I bring even listening going back and listening to our second episode ever about the Indiana Jones adventure to prepare for

587
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:53,280
part two I'm like oh I hit on the chaos very early on that it was in there it was yeah there was some chaos I I think the first little bit of it what I did in an observation I had I didn't really say in the Mac or don't episode is that I'm like oh I feel like early on we were trying to be very professional and a little more button up and then I immediately

588
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:23,280
started talking about something it's saying and then and then we all loose end up yeah and yeah what was it what did you talk I don't remember now I also listen to the episode yeah I listen to the whole thing you know it's funny I guess this is the time whatever listener this it's kind of it's this reunion homecoming episode early memory I have and I don't know if it's that but I feel like we we've in a really good way we never talked about this too much we didn't do practice episodes we didn't super intellectual intellectualize it we just started

589
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:53,200
doing it and and this is the kind of thing I get perspective on having for the that was seven years ago this all started and this this couple months that I left is the first that's the longest stretch of not doing this yeah and seven yeah that's kind of a crazy thing like like the you know like like the longest stretch of a routine that's gone for seven years to to get away from that and to get a little bit of perspective and stuff interesting to do and I

590
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:23,280
something I basically something I remember is that like early on thinking like so what is it do we just like is it just analysis I mean I assume we could be a little bit funny but what are we gonna and there was something where we started doing like it was like hers like annoyed Harrison Ford voices something that has happened throughout the show yeah it's been a runner the entire time and that that the bit being like oh I see we do bits and voices and that's something that is part of this yeah that'll keep things loose that'll keep things fun

591
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:38,120
that'll make it a comedy show it was just a nice memory I recall and that we we never we landed on it fully organically that it can be that kind of show yeah then other things happened like well is it the kind of show where a character can come and interrupts and

592
00:26:38,120 --> 00:27:08,120
hijack things and you put in sound effects of what the character is doing and we quickly realized no it's not particularly that kind of show has its following but later on maybe characters showed up sometimes some characters do worry you know yeah yeah yeah so it is interesting if you listen to the second episode yes I was like oh it's a little stiff up at top but then I'm like oh wait no it's actually even though we don't talk as much about the actual discussion of any of the

593
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Jones I said this already in that episode the actual discussion of Ian Jones I bet is like 45 minutes on that episode and there's there's a bunch of top talk and then a bunch of segment talk at the end okay I go but if you listen to you go oh man I've been saying the same dumb shit for seven years because like I thought oh there's gonna be stuff I don't remember and I'm like oh I'm saying the same stuff I say the exact same stuff well that's something that I feel and this wasn't just in my absence but I feel like a very common thing said on the show especially by you is like yeah you know it's something I've been thinking and I've said this a thousand times on the show and it

594
00:27:38,120 --> 00:28:08,120
is true there are these things that have been said one thousand times yeah on the show yeah and I there's there was a bunch of stuff I thought I had said in that episode but probably just said in other episodes but there's a bunch of stuff where I'm just like oh yeah this is I thought that I thought I was really scared to listen to that first or second episode because I was like ah is it gonna be embarrassing am I gonna be I'm like it's not embarrassing it's like a little different but it's the same it's the same show and we had like we didn't do any practice

595
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:38,120
but we had had a lot of lunches and meet like what is this and we had some documents like we certainly did prep work that's true yeah trying to documents it didn't just document or two I guess totally come out and like all right we'll get some mics and we'll just show up like that voice though back then that oh yeah well cuz we were all hanging at the cellar sitting around the dirty wet table you know yeah well who wants to hear entertainment from three white guys if

596
00:28:38,120 --> 00:29:08,120
at least one of them doesn't sound like that that's true yeah but yes it was a you know it's interesting did you so does that mean did you find that the the the pressing ferocious need to cover to do Indiana Jones to was not as extreme as you have believed it to be for many years I think we actually found there was quite a bit to analyze I do think there's a lot of it I actually I didn't get to my notes we did we talked too much

597
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:38,120
about the Boat House and Disney Springs up top on that episode and I'm like Ty and then we did a little muppets and I'm like clock's ticking okay just a little bit and then we started going through and then I felt like I was racing through some of it but that is also a ride that benefits from being upgraded at least once or twice since we recorded that episode sure yes we talked we talked about the updates and some other stuff yeah I mean it's all well good so you got your updates are you happy are you sad

598
00:29:38,120 --> 00:30:08,120
you got your sequel in how do you feel I feel okay about it just okay yeah yeah I think that's not the report I want I want the report that you loved it that it's your fully you're fully justified in pushing for it for all this time and we don't have to do it again now I don't know but I don't know but either of those I fully justified yes I don't know that we don't have to do it anymore I think we have to do everything again I you know that's my philosophy I think everything again I think he's thinking about in the part three already well I'm not it's a it's

599
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:38,120
not as hard it's not as clear in my mind as points to but indie three is seven years from now perhaps and oh by the way you said you know what you need to do for points I do yes I think I know what I need to do as well which is to book another movie sure sure I will say this one yeah well I can tell you I'll give you a six month heads up so you can know when to be gone

600
00:30:38,120 --> 00:31:08,120
now it doesn't have a premise yet the or well all right there's a rough idea the idea is a guy is worried he's gonna be bored so he decides to make a movie as fast as possible yeah yeah we'll get into all of that yes let me let me say I want to say a couple and then we will get to a small world holiday I promise do we I don't know who how strong is the caring we will we'll do it we'll do it yeah well I mean but you want to get to it next year we can get to it next year

601
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:38,120
and that if we've done a fully deferred I guess we've done the fake out we've done the false start Frank Marshall get episode yeah like fully kicked the can I think we can do it we could just call this Scott's home for the holidays well that's nice isn't it I thought it was nice nice like the ride in theory well let's see let's let's see where it goes I wanted to share just a couple of things about what I just came from doing and just to remind to remind the listener the timeline but basically I think I am coming back from one of the

602
00:31:38,120 --> 00:32:08,120
probably the craziest stretch of my entire life that's what that's what my hiatus what you can use the word hiatus but that implies relaxation and in fact it was the opposite of that basically if you don't recall the timeline mid September our second child showed up earlier than we expected kind of threw us like shot us out of the parent cannon dealing with that wonderful but also stressful and crazy and then just the way things timed out in this awesome opportunity that came my way but with

603
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:38,120
timing that was a little bit less than awesome but hey you gotta pounce wouldn't know when things come up basically like I went straight from oh my god new baby to a very intense run of prep into how I spent my November which is directing a movie I directed my first movie I've kind of alluded to that a little bit but I was I was being cagey mainly because I wanted to make sure that it happened that it occurred and then I didn't say a sentence that proved later to not be true but I directed a movie and I'm super

604
00:32:38,120 --> 00:33:08,120
proud of it and I'm excited to see you know where it goes and hopefully like talk further about my adventures on that and fill the audience in on it I will say was a despite the like very compressed timeline phenomenal crew wonderful group of people like the crazy summer camp that you hear I mean I was going to say that occurs but I didn't know this occurred I've done like one longer form project but not a movie specifically and I was really hoping for that kind of like

605
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:38,120
crazy summer camp you're thrown in with a bunch of people you only sort of met and then you all gotta like go through adventures together and that's totally how it felt it was a wonderful thing the writers of the movie were also the stars of the movie it was a dream come true for them to get to do it so their enthusiasm was infectious and just like a like very very positive stuff so that that's what I'm happy to report even if there was you know a lot of good things happening in my life just like too many on top of each other I would say and it's been nice to like

606
00:33:38,120 --> 00:34:08,120
settle down and slow down I bet that points episode was nice because it was such a relaxing discussion about two points enthusiasts and you got to hear about different interests outside of your own it must have been nice to just kind of slow the road just like wow this is so it's so like it's so relaxing and meandering did I put it on at point five speed no that's just what it is the peaceful easy feeling that song we all know

607
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:38,120
look it's nice to hear my buddies having fun and I'm gonna come back around I have a little story that involves that too that will come back around to that but I did want to like in thinking about things from this experience that were somewhat PTR coded to use that term there's a few that I wanted to bring back with me one of which was very special and I just had to share it lots of unbelievable

608
00:34:38,120 --> 00:35:08,120
crew on this thing as I said like so many people bringing their a game like people like overqualified for the weird scrappy thing that that we were doing and you know you kind of a movie like this relies on like daily miracles and and and we had daily miracles because so many talented people were bringing their best and that included in the area of stunts we had some light stunts on this movie which which was a thrill because that's where you know like I'm coming from I've been doing more animated stuff

609
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:38,120
before this like in the lead up to you know switching over to to live-action directing and in animation you can write whatever zany shit and it's not that you know it's probably one of the easiest things to make happen is like a you know somebody flying across the room or getting her sure flying in the sky or getting like you know inflated really big and then floating up into the sky getting bigger and bigger as they go and you say that pop to say that a little quieter a little more intense and maybe

610
00:35:38,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Jason look it's not it is not my thing okay I just know it's out there and I had multiple people backing me up we're not waiting I believe I guess I believe you that it's real this is yeah well and this is look to be to be fair that is correct knowing about a thing doesn't mean it's your thing and that's an unfair thing to bring to the table and also as I said like this isn't one of those situations where we didn't believe you I think what the I think I was a little skeptical

611
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:38,120
but I yes I eventually I believe I believe I believed Jason I think what I think what the city and by the way of all that there's things I just I just shot many many days of movie there's things that are out of my brain completely that happened two weeks yeah of course the the mention of inflatable stuff every bit of it is lodged as deeply as the holding space interview it is like it's permanently in there and I think it's what it's less that we didn't believe you and I think more that you made a joke that was supposed to that you believed would communicate

612
00:36:38,120 --> 00:37:08,120
to both of us and to Justin Donaldson I think what you said was like well then the big problem for Mickey is that he'll be saying like oh don't blow me up and then we were all baffled like what does that mean because we didn't understand that that is like the idea that we were supposed to immediately unpack that and go oh it's a reference to inflatable stuff the very common fetish that was that I think was the issue for me well in your head were you like it's inflatable stuff everybody knows inflatable stuff

613
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:38,120
yeah I think that's what it was so I understand it you know it's the big he's online it's the big difference yeah yeah do you does that mean do you know what holding space is in general yeah yeah I feel like it's a thing that people said a lot more sincerely in like 2014 2015 I hadn't heard about it for like 10 years okay and then just seeing it in a

614
00:37:38,120 --> 00:38:08,120
balloon returning yeah about the lyrics of like a 20 plus year old song yeah what a thing what a thing anyway point is I you know on a fairly low budget movie stunts are kind of like like a complex thing to get your head around you're like can we do that can we do that and we thanks to a really great guy named Chris a really great stunt coordinator we were able to put some some

615
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:38,120
fun little moments in this movie who he's like oh that's a breeze that'll be fine that's fun I'm excited it's gonna be great to get to so like like in a crew full of great people this guy Chris one of the best and what we always heard was you know because he comes from like big old stuff he's done Marvel he's like and we just caught him in the window where he had a little bit of free time so he can like do us a solid help us out great well that's what we need love that great working with him in general then the last bit that he did he had somebody up on wires and we were figuring that out now that's

616
00:38:38,120 --> 00:39:08,120
that's gonna work and it was kind of a cold morning so everybody's bundled up a little bit and he's got kind of a knit cap on and the knit cap has an a on it and not just any a but the avatar a well not just any avatar a but the avatar way of water a well the improved font with with I don't know what it is in the middle we know one of the pirates plus what do you call it yeah papyrus new and improved and I see the a and I

617
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:38,120
get a feeling and I suddenly feel a little bit of nerves come over me and I say to him is that from way of water did you work on way of water and I think sensing the tone of my voice that it wasn't just asking a question that I was bringing some weight to that Chris looks me in the eye addresses me by name and he says Scott I was Jake Sully Wow and I go I go flying back as if I'm on wires

618
00:39:38,120 --> 00:40:08,120
I like wait a minute what does that mean okay so he's Jake he's Jake Sully stunt double and I'm sure there were like a number of those all told but as he gets into it and he shows me some of the stuff that he did he's he's fucking Jake Sully stunt double in underwater sequences wow he's doing like crazy double helixes and shit like powered by underwater jet packs attached to his feet and that's not just CGI no it's all mocap they did all of that right it was yes he was in tanks he

619
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:38,120
flew he was all over the world he's in the Bahamas he's I forget if he did in New Zealand some of it's here but yeah no that all happened and he was the one doing it and in a mocap movie like Avatar you know the stunt double is not just like you know a guy in a wig and a wide shot although that's also a cool thing I'm not knocking that we had a really great stunt double on this thing but like that means when he says he was Jake Sully he was Jake Sully he's Jake Sully in lots of possibly in more scenes than

620
00:40:38,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Sam Worthington so he was describing experiences of like doing a crazy underwater aerial helix thing and then getting out of like like getting out of the of the tank like he was in the tank he's in the tank with the ping pong balls wow he gets out and goes and consults at monitor with James Cameron and Sam Worthington who's giving him giving him character notes and then James Cameron will watch this like unbelievably complex thing happen and James is like no good the breathing was all wrong I didn't

621
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:22,760
believe the breathing five seconds before the thing at before the thing splashes down you need to be getting nervous I didn't feel any nervousness in your breath oh my god that's the sort of note that James Cameron gets he is analyzing human biology those are the notes that this guy got that's

622
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:37,400
there was the speaking gladiator 2 that got the cinematographer just trashed Ridley Scott for being lazy really it's like yeah he doesn't take as long to do things anymore and shots he wants just wrap it up and he like lets stuff go not the case was 70 year old James Cameron

623
00:41:37,400 --> 00:42:07,320
no clearly not yes he's looking at a fucking rib cage yeah there's bubbles flying everywhere the things are on fire and he's like look he's looking at chest expansion and going no no all wrong the computer could fix that yeah yeah but I but not in his world like it all has to stem from natural biology when you okay remember the whole thing about Kate Winslet breaking the Tom Cruise underwater breathing record she was like she did over seven minutes continuously

624
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:37,280
underwater and if you Google basically if you go into Google images type in Kate Winslet underwater one of the first images you will find is her with kind of like the big wings like doing the the the wingspan and then there's two guys in scuba gear down below her helping her watching her this guy Chris is one of those guys whoa wow insane helping Kate Winslet being Jake Sully and you guys know and the audience knows how blue-pilled I have become how avatar-pilled I and here I am doing a kind

625
00:42:37,280 --> 00:43:07,240
of like a nerve-wracking experience and right towards the end I got brushed with the magic of Jake Sully incredible yeah and the way he told me with looking me in the eyes where there was nothing braggy about it the way he said it was almost as if he was saying I walked with Christ I met him I passed in his glory yeah no no ego just just no he thought it was cool as shit too and he's like oh and then this one time and then I'm doing this and then I'm just like fucking coolest coolest wow so if you want it if you want

626
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:37,240
to see what I what I believe is a project graced with Jake Sully magic that that will be this thing which otherwise I don't really want to sure ruin any announcements about her right right too much so I had to share that couldn't keep that to myself that one more thing before we go into a small world holiday and I think you'll find this nice most of this experience very pleasant wonderful as I said incredible crew but I'm balancing a lot here I'm balancing very new baby who I've like barely met then I'm just thrown in this whole crazy thing basically I

627
00:43:37,240 --> 00:44:07,240
switched places with my mother-in-law I went to live at her place in Chatsworth because we were filming in beautiful Simi Valley right that I could get my rest and then she came and took care of my new son my older son god bless her god bless both of our grandmothers they really kept us together yeah not my grandma the boys grandmother sure but anyway it's this crazy thing barely processed having a child later I will watch Jake Sully's family grow in way of water and I will

628
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:37,240
water is that was the first I ever cried in a movie about being a dad any way of water discussion anyway I will process via way of water later but I'm you know I'm away from my family it's this crazy experience second son first movie and what I'm getting at I'm driving to that that's the base of any day where I'm in this experience but what I'm getting to is day three of the shoot where all of that is going on a new factor in

629
00:44:37,240 --> 00:45:07,240
day three of the shoot is that if you listener if you recall my son was personally in the NICU for a little bit doing great now adorable he when I left for my last week of work he couldn't smile yet and I came back smiling baby incredible wonderful so things are things are going great there but we had this NICU stay and on day three of the shoot we were operating from a reality where we thought that we owed the hospital forty two thousand dollars this turned out to be not true but these were the circumstances of the day

630
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:37,240
where I'm going to do a thing that is very stressful regardless and did I mention that this oh wait wait actually wait one more thing this is a fifteen day shoot listener if you know anything about film shoots have you ever been part of it or been part of one fifteen days is not this is not enough day this is the tightest schedule ever and there's so much pressure to you know like we can never go over time we can never like this this is the tightest schedule humanly possible there is there is no

631
00:45:37,240 --> 00:46:07,240
room for error just remember that as I go into what I'm going into and did I mention the day three of the shoot was also the the morning after Donald Trump was reelected to the office of the presidency so everybody's up really early having probably checked their phones hoping for good news seeing the worst news and now having to go into a day of work and God bless everybody in this the cast and the crew everybody had this air of like okay going to be buttoned up and we are going to get through this and this is it is good that we have something

632
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:23,100
to do I'm really glad that this way we can you know purpose purpose to the day and as long as we could stay busy we won't stop and think about the terrible thing that has happened that get that that is that all is in progress from about 630 to 930 at 930 we're in the middle of a scene

633
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,100
audible power down shoot shoot loses all of its power everything goes dark total confusion what just happened here it was an unbelievably windy day in Simi Valley it was the most visible wind like distressingly visible wind and we start asking questions and we realize okay powers down to the entire building well can we just throw things on a generator no because then we would have no power to the basically like we need the lights of the

634
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:23,100
room that we're in itself in order to keep going with the aesthetic that we have established so we there is nothing we can film there is nothing we can do the power is out from 930 to 430 we lose an entire day now remember what I said about 15 days a schedule that is not possible this was so crazy it's like it's all this stuff it's all the stress in my life and then Trump and then fucking the winds of change knock out the power of the one like nice thing that we're all getting to do and

635
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:32,300
that's distracting us from these insane circumstances these were joker fiying conditions this is completely insane and what I needed to do

636
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:51,780
in this moment was just kind of like touch the earth get tethered to something that was comfortable and just like basically I took a breather I'm like let me step outside for a second and I just kind of like I just needed a minute and in this minute I realized you guys put an episode out you would just put out the episode

637
00:47:51,820 --> 00:48:15,980
20,000 leagues under the sea with Matt Mazzani on the second gate and I thought I wonder how that is going over and I checked the comments of that episode and I see so many people saying this is making my day it is so nice to have just a regular funny ass PTR to listen to with the horrible news that we have just gotten and it was just wonderful to see

638
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:45,900
the you guys and I can there's a compliment I can give that I'm not even a part of because I wasn't part of the episode that just you guys doing what you do was making the listeners so happy and that the listeners were sharing such positive feedback and telling him telling us that you know it changed everything on a very tough day that made me so it lifted my spirits in this very difficult day and by the end of the day when I finally got to hear the episode I felt the same way it was my biggest barrel laugh is that a term barrel laugh

639
00:48:45,980 --> 00:49:15,980
I guess Jason's the one to ask he's into the barrel play as long as it's not for walnuts or with straps on your midsection I think you're fine barrel boy Jason Sheridan barrel enthusiast no I felt as jolly as a barrel full of walnuts seeing all of that nice feedback on it on a truly bonkers day yeah well thank you for saying that that's very nice had to pass that along and pass that and pass along to Matt Mazzani one of the finest people I know there's

640
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:45,980
no thank you man yeah great guests fun episode to do yeah and well in a pot in a very like sincere and nice one you know dreaming of a better play you know I mean the the world of what could be better than escaping to the world of Tokyo Disney see sure most positive place on earth that's right as everything's going to hell yeah no I would like to tell you though oh man we strategically planned it just in case you know what what's counter-programming yeah yeah well it's a good thing you didn't

641
00:49:45,980 --> 00:50:03,660
go the opposite way and get super cocky and that like and that the episode was about like all right today's topic the the Kamala robot the sure to be installed we're doubling down we know this will happen we know that voters will come through we saw the Iowa poll this

642
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:33,660
is a weird dude devoting a full episode to how resplendent that robot is going to be and how awesome her coat will be that could have been shoved into the back could be put into the furnace and never seen again could have been possible but luckily no no you thought you just did you just did a nice pleasant one so anyway just wanted to share that and say thank you for like in a time where I was literally like homesick doing a big crazy thing it was just nice to hear you guys doing what you do and being super funny it was like

643
00:50:33,660 --> 00:51:03,660
it was like let's say Richie Sambora is now playing with Bon Jovi and he hears a Bon Jovi concert and he's it cheers him up here's one I don't know he sees it this is a difficult he like out of the bit don't they not get along anymore but then you may be coming back though maybe this doesn't hang this doesn't hang together I don't okay I'm putting it I'm putting a tangent clock on this one two minutes okay one of these all right one of these Green Day fuckers has some side project doesn't he well they all

644
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:33,660
well I mean Billy is a few bands Billy is a few bands I forget Mike Dern also I think has a side project as well what I always are to get they are very strong there's a tight three person unit they would never I don't think they've ever done maybe you know Mike Dern did have wrist surgery 20 years ago I think I think he had a carpal tuba that's a long time I don't think he missed any shows though would just say the name of one of their stupid other bands well then we can move on there's I'm trying to think the network was the one where there was like their

645
00:51:33,660 --> 00:52:03,660
Devo band like 15 years ago I think maybe they've done newer network music as well but is that all there's still all I think that's them the long shot is a Billy Joe side project and I think it might just be him I don't know if there's another like this only two green name I think it's only one the long shot has some okay songs here's what I'm just gonna pull from a list here you know it's it's as if because the band didn't break up right that's what's happening so it's I am

646
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:33,660
as if I am Billy Joe and I have gone to do my 2011 side project the boo but I'm so I guess there's a lot of pressures to doing the boo and the pressures are kind of getting or aid the long shot same thing whether it's boo or long shot flying solo and doing a big ambitious thing outside your your perfect group Green Day is definitely stressful so hearing just like a great jam session happening between Mike and Trey yeah Mike would cheer Billy Joe up on that day

647
00:52:33,660 --> 00:53:03,660
I'm Mike Dern Jason's Trey cool in this scenario oh cool the wild man Trey cool which one's the tall one though Trey Trey's big drummer he's a big guy kind of crazy no but isn't Mike Dern taller is he I don't know actually I should know that Billy's obviously the shortest of the three I think just to confirm can you tell us the name of Bon Jovi's wine company Hampton Water Hampton Water Green Day has their own coffee as well so but now

648
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:33,660
about the coffee and all the crazy items they put Dookie on right it's it's funny syntax but Bon Jovi has the wine Hampton Water but Green Day has a coffee why just cuz he's went us back to Bon Jovi I just wanted to get us back to Green Day we were on the Green Day Jag anyway look it's as if I was Billy Joe doing the boo and all the power to all my amps blew and I didn't know how I was gonna finish the boo my side project right there's no how's there no link

649
00:53:33,660 --> 00:54:03,660
when I click on this on Green Day wiki the boo isn't even good enough to get its own page on Green Day wiki I'm not very familiar with the boo honest to god I don't know let's keep it that way now that I'm back on the show I don't want to see any votes over in club three about the boo I know I made myself the boo in this scenario but there's a Green Day is a Billy Joe Nora Jones collaboration here barf okay so it's a small world holiday small world holiday

650
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:33,660
we need to talk about don't we going strong since 1997 the only hiccup was the 2020 pandemic closure yeah no thank thank God the pandemic Mike if that laptops doing anything other than clicking over to the small world holiday tab then I want to see it shut Miranda Lambert and Billy Joe teamed up once seven years ago saying that all quiet and lascivious Lee as if you're talking about

651
00:54:33,660 --> 00:55:03,660
some called ordinary world I was as good for it I was trying to say a nice sincere thing and then I walked and then I myself drove it right into Green Day land yeah I was deflecting from a compliment a little bit but I didn't want it I didn't I only did Bon Jovi which is not as interesting as Green Day so I would say Bon Jovi is not as interesting as almost any topic in the world I would agree with that but that actually does make me at least somewhat interested in it because of that he's really I'm just saying but

652
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:33,660
obviously it's not as loaded on the show not yet give it time but if Bon Jovi okay here's what just happened Bon Jovi was said I kind of registered that I don't yes yeah yeah powering up Bon Jovi war machine gearing up in three months we'll be doing some but you'll have decided and I like it and I like Bon Jovi and I got my daughter listening to the theme song to Hampton water hmm Hampton guzzling theme from Hampton water is that possible you gotta show her the family trail

653
00:55:33,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Bon Jovi jr. married 11 from stranger that's true Jason knows that you know what is something worth talking about though that way to think well not I think we want to have time this holiday season but you know about John Bon Jovi's Christmas album right don't do I well yeah I have to lead a little bit more this was before he was John Bon Jovi his name was John Bon Jovi he had not split up the name at this time you know where I'm heading with this I don't think so he does all of the human singing on

654
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:21,100
the Star Wars holiday album Christmas in the stars I didn't know Christmas in the structures with the stars now is this album is separate from the holiday special it is confusingly yes there's the whole crazy holiday special but then there's also it's

655
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:33,420
Christmas in the stars it's the first professional recording of John Bon Jovi Wow I did not know this his songs are all very boring I will say no way as opposed to I mean because the money is

656
00:56:33,420 --> 00:57:03,420
the song sung by C3PO Wow which is the title song Christmas in the stars Christmas in the stars I don't know this that's shocking Christmas in the stars I am very surprised but yeah yeah do you guys know real quick I mean we're all over the place do you guys know this the rock and toontown album with the guy was his name like Craig and Company yeah I'll do Craig and Company that was on the Disney Channel so much when I was a kid he did this he did a song called haircut that the Disney Channel really pushed

657
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:33,380
you like my haircut you need a haircut yeah I was a full toontown album that's yes Sky Selga told me about this because I had asked on that episode the parade episode what is this toontown song and then he texted me and he said that is from this album rock and toontown I know that there was a full concert special that aired on the Disney Channel which I have watched in the last two years you see we're not so different all of us we have we share

658
00:57:33,380 --> 00:58:03,380
this so we come together for Christmas over the same bonds dumb bad Christmas special shit rock and toontown are we there yet I'm bored food for thought voice of the spirit younger kids stuff these are all tracks from this do bullies have mommies no that's why they're mad bullies are a different species right they're inhuman they're basically trolls this year you know I had this thought of this year I was like did we get through too much Eisner's I was like

659
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:20,340
are we burning too much Eisner this year because we really feel like a second half especially like hitting a bunch of weird Eisner stuff and I'm like no there is an unlimited room rock and toontown the rest of the goofy parade yeah so no I feel better about it but there was a couple weeks there

660
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:50,340
really to me his primary contribution slash the Michael Graves team Disney building in beautiful Burbank which we all call home the building held up by the dwarves right yeah there's you know we haven't even talked about we haven't really talked about his architectural footprint on this world which will maintain for thousands of years after we're all gone yeah aliens will come and dig up the wow this was a thoughtful species this building it's so clever little dwarves are holding it up

661
00:58:50,340 --> 00:59:20,340
yeah well the the aliens that are here already are appreciating it I think the ones that are still there showing up it's another thing you didn't get out you didn't you didn't manage to get your alien talk out while I was gone there hasn't been any but there's been a lot of alien stuff that's happened lately too big hearing mm-hmm it's a whole weird just got an email about another feature this stuff is fucking weird though this stuff is legitimately interesting unlike the other stuff that you even you admit it's not well yeah no it's not and it's I said it on the episode I said on the points upside ago on its face you could go to a person on the street and go you know it's a big alien here

662
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:50,340
ring or a bunch of guys said a bunch of crazy stuff and somebody go oh that is interesting and then you go why would you like to hear about the Jersey Mike sub that I just had for free and they would say no but yes but that's a person on the street we are talking about people who listen to this podcast these are sickos these people who listen to us they're all this they're the sicko they're that that comic drawing of the second yes there are people Jason nice people I guess if they like the point yeah I saw some negative comments too

663
00:59:50,340 --> 01:00:20,340
you don't know your points okay sincerely boy at this point we better not have more than 15 minutes about small world holiday I had a feeling there's gonna get well okay all right here let's let's actually like power it let's like we could preview for small world holiday next year I want to get a small world holiday to already snuck me into a sequel by even doing small world holiday

664
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:41,180
why not it's the same shit we need to do more everything more everything it's not the same because we do talk about different things in the you know for instance in your day we cover verandas and in your seven we cover how you tried to do a class to learn Shakespeare which you don't want to learn of course

665
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,180
different facets of the haunted mansion we could have that goal from every ride we could have we could find new different tangents in every single ride wow wall was right imagination truly is limitless I don't know if he said that he might have said it seems like you put it on a construction wall you gotta fill in some quotes I sincerely believe that we can get through small world holiday let's just okay let's reset it as if we could try would it help if we said we were like even there might be

666
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:23,900
no ad break when I do this but what if I bet this will help with energy what if I say and we'll be right back and when we're back we'll talk about it's a small world holiday all right so we're back and there may have been no ad in what you just

667
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:39,020
put an ad in there you can really fuck me up and put an ad in I'm gonna put an ad right when you're talking right now the next sentence you talk I'm putting it right yeah right there that's where it is oh damn it I mean I don't really know what happened because this

668
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:57,160
your only the listener can hear this but you did it didn't you yeah and it comes to be to be marketing I love I put two ads really close together son of a bitch this is because this is like this is like a video game weapon that you're

669
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:08,740
waiting like you're the ad splatter splat ads in the middle of any you like if the two of us say anything that you'd like if we started saying Mike I don't want to hear about alien stuff that's not kind of thing

670
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:28,380
yes shit he's right in an ad the ad splatter struck again is Jason there's something you want to say negative to Mike it's amazing just how many drugs hims.com has available the problem is we only have three ad breaks in a regular episode so I've used the ad breaks up and I'm going to let that last sentence play normally

671
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:43,700
that's a good structure though to like is you know instead of like the boring like it's roughly every word to just like jam all those ads I think that's what I've almost together but then with only three seconds of the podcast technically does come back but just for three and a half seconds

672
01:02:43,700 --> 01:03:13,420
this is gonna make so many people mad cuz like I'm gonna have to do the bit now this is in here but people are gonna have like a full four minutes of ads I'm gonna be so mad some of them are already mad because I'm bad they're out there I see your little there's some there's a flavor for everyone on podcast the ride you know and that's what it's about like a holiday feast each of us brings a different flavor to the table

673
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:30,420
one of us brings wet walnuts the other brings warm walnuts my walnuts are warm and dry and Jason's are wet and cold geez I'm out of I didn't realize there was a I have no type of walnut fire roasted okay I like that

674
01:03:30,420 --> 01:04:00,380
frozen walnut your walnuts are frozen just cracking some teeth yeah well that would get a bit would be a more exciting you didn't have teeth crackers growing up you would be able you put them in a nutcracker then that's an extra exciting crack cuz you're cracking the ice and the walnut shell you'd have a metal nutcracker though too we have to be cuz a wooden one from maybe would break I don't think nutcrackers crack nuts so good right like like practice like they're more

675
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:17,940
decorative I think it depends yeah yeah like certainly you should not Jason would you use a decorative walnut cracker no you would use a practical metal one yeah do you have one of those I don't think I think just ornaments that maybe they do the

676
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:34,940
metal nutcracker or of the wooden one the wooden soldier yeah I don't have I don't think I have any metal nutcrackers in the house I file away a wedding present I'm getting a big nutcracker

677
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:56,180
yeah his and her get recreations of Jason and Jane getting a getting him like a sexy lady for his bachelor party a sexy lady nutcracker yeah I think that'll be good right I don't know if you want your nuts cracked that's the last thing you want oh yeah we get

678
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:15,620
a bachelor party I don't know what do you think pal I don't know well I didn't I never had one either really yeah we team up where we going we think we're going down to Knott's Berry farm I actually did consider what do you think we're gonna

679
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:37,060
Burbank Sears we're gonna walk around the Burbank Sears yeah what do you think I have now been in the Burbank Zombie Sears oh I heard yeah I'm glad they got to this while I was gone I'm just making sure you remember I know you have a lot well you gotta engage your mere feet from it yeah that's true

680
01:05:37,060 --> 01:06:07,060
all right what what time is it how long have we been going we've been going an hour we've been going time to talk about that they put Christmas lights on it's a small world I think we can do it I believe in us small you did some of the stuff 1996 since 1997 Walt Disney's it's a small world has transformed has been transformed from a World's Fair festivity to a to a holiday spectacle holiday light color you could imagine red green

681
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:22,900
even blue they put a big Santa hat on the clock face outside they sure do which is nice it is nice this small world holiday is better than regular small world I like this take better than regular small world I have to agree with you I really like this

682
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:52,900
I'm not a small world hater I like small world fine I don't go on it a lot I go to more now that I have a daughter yeah better so much better now what is it because I tend to agree with you what is your knee jerk as to what makes it better and anything you don't say I will try to throw in the outside looks awesome the outside rules it is full if you haven't seen it go online it's just tons of Christmas lights because people are poor friends in Orlando and I think all the other parks at this point various parks have flirted

683
01:06:52,900 --> 01:07:22,900
with this tried it out but it didn't stick I really lands the only one that took it all the way I write they don't do this in Disney World do they am I way I'm not in Disney World they don't have a spectacular facade that's a real problem with the Disney World for that part of it yeah the Magic Kingdom small world is doesn't compare I would say kind of an indoor loading they also don't care about Disney World like they care about Disneyland what do you mean like imagine you're like it doesn't we get like Tiana's Bayou Adventure it was designed for Disneyland and then they shoved it into Disney World is that true that's

684
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:52,900
what I heard that's what I that's what I heard and like there's still I mean you can feel the philosophy like the Rivers of America gone Disney World they're like see you later cars are moving in and ours are like they paint I mean it's a few years ago already you got like historic landmarks right that's what that's so that they aren't yeah that's currently the philosophy and the proximity of the engineering headquarters being right up the highway go check on it yeah well that's look that's what the Lake Nona campus was supposed to it was and well hey maybe they were

685
01:07:52,900 --> 01:08:22,900
turned to it I don't know they might yes I feel like if there's no what climate Florida will be in the future let me let me throw this in and go so because you mentioned Tiana it seems like we've closed out the year without doing Tiana I would really like to go I really you've done it I have not gotten to do it here's another thing that day that I just described day three of the shoot which was so harrowing for me in many different ways this was also the day that the magic key passes were going on sale yes and I was like there's no way I can be on this set and managing everything that I have

686
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:52,900
to manage and also be like one sec hang on the Pinocchio the Pinocchio thing is still loading his nose is getting shorter which means I'll be up and it'll be my sorry just hold the take hold the roll that was not gonna happen but I also I was doing some math the night before I'm like hmm if this NYT needle keeps going the way it seems to be going I think I'm gonna want a lot of Disneyland in my future and I haven't had a pass in a while basically I paid a friend to get it to be in the

687
01:08:52,900 --> 01:09:09,020
queue for me and to get me so I'm back I'm back baby I needed it for that Trump cheer up for that post-shoot celebration so I will be I will go and oh and then and I got the lowest tier and in which then the shoots over and I'm like hell yeah I

688
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:22,880
you just finished your first movie what are you gonna do next I'm going to Disneyland look at calendar oh all of December's yeah fuck me January 8th you'll be back yeah so as soon as I can which will be the new year I will

689
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:40,860
go on Tiana yeah we'll do that maybe January or February so I guess you better pack some extra socks I hear the water has been like really hitting people it is so soaking people thank God and I guess Jason you better not pack extra socks because I know you're gonna want to get your soak on

690
01:09:40,860 --> 01:10:02,620
colds not colds been a little unpleasant lately and I know Southern California people like well use cold lightly but it's like I'm a little sensitive to heat and cold nowadays more of a summer wet socks man I yeah you could pre soak your socks to get comfortable and then go on it oh you're like a

691
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:32,500
a trainer yeah so a training for yeah Tiana soak your socks in the bath the nearby bathroom so your socks wake up it's wake up at 655 get the virtual queue yeah shut out of it sitting there in my soaking wet socks practicing but you're still but you're still getting your reps in I like this I like practicing for that's what did and Ernest goes to splash it retains that tradition I am getting ready verne for my return for my

692
01:10:32,500 --> 01:11:02,460
grand voyage on Tiana's at bayou adventure I am soaking my socks to the brim ice-cold temperatures watch this and then what he pro and then it's like then you see like they like turn his ankles blue with digital with an old analog effect with some hungry bear barbecue okay the next virtual queue is in two and a half hours the next ordering time that's available wait I have a question Jason when's the last

693
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:22,020
time you went to Disneyland I actually I was looking for is about to say this but I have not been in a theme park in over a year since we were in Orlando Wow I think since we were in Orlando yeah you haven't been in the parks but you have been looking up what aspects of going to the park are difficult

694
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:48,780
so that you can be mad about them from afar I like to keep abreast you know I like to keep updated it's our job Mike has also done a pretty good job at filling in you know he's outing Jason and I have a separate text chain of course about all these different details that's probably smart and now to exclude you're at it we've had a text date since 2009

695
01:11:48,780 --> 01:12:14,260
feel free oh you would like to be excluded on some stuff well he doesn't care about the four different lemonades you can get at the hungry bear barbecue you and I want to talk about the different lemonades they now have at hungry bear barbecue jamboree and all these new water dispensers which as someone usually packs a metal water bottle

696
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:26,260
I ate there with the family we brought them all there mobile ordered the food we have to I just got an email we have to reshoot all that stuff from when the power went down they need me right now guys I'm sorry

697
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:32,260
well I guess what does that talk about the sauces but Scott your movie Red One already came out

698
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Red Two it's Red Two I've been being modest of course I did Red One

699
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:09,260
I love Haunted Mansion Holiday and the average theme park goer loves it more than we do and we like it we're fine with it

700
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:14,260
I really like it I am not one of these haters of this thing

701
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:27,260
sure that's fine I would say that on a certain day maybe but I'm just saying like I don't know they could do it in Florida they do it in Japan so I'm just saying like it does feel like we do get special stuff still

702
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:39,260
yeah well here's also here's what I recall about Small World Holiday is that this ok 1997 it opens and this was this era where we've revisited this from time to time

703
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:54,260
this is when I started like being a little online about the parks this is where that turn happened and I'm getting on my little news groups and seeing how like oh things are getting a little chintzy maybe this park expansion is not going to be what we think it is

704
01:13:54,260 --> 01:14:14,260
Main Street Electrical Parade is going away what are they replacing it with the worst parade ever made a lot of stuff like that is happening and New Tomorrowland was like so it was kind of it was a bummer of a time you know I've described it before it was a loss of innocence for me in terms of my pure park love and we weren't getting a lot of cool stuff

705
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:44,260
and what I remember is that okay they're okay let's see so they're doing a holiday they're doing a Christmas version of Small World well what if that what if they kind of crap out on that the way they've been crapping out on everything and sure enough it is just this modest little project that's really nice that stuck and that they've never stopped it was a bright light in sort of a grim budget crunched time for Disneyland specifically so I always have fond memories of it for that reason I'm glad it never dropped off I also remember you guys have

706
01:14:44,260 --> 01:15:14,260
any memory of this or have you seen pictures of it that there was a time where It's a Small World did not have the glimmering white and gold color scheme they did this kind of pastel yeah yeah that was just not that good similar not nearly as egregious as the weird like forced copper paint job in Tomorrowland but it just wasn't as good it looked better pure white like the kind of perma 60s feel of the It's a Small World facade right it went away for a little bit but then they put Christmas lights all over it and it actually

707
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:44,260
the colors complimented that very well it like the Christmas lights kind of fixed the the aesthetic that It's a Small World fell into that wasn't as pleasant so so I have just very fond memories of when it started just like this is a nice thing it's such a layup and and they yeah they nailed it it's just a nice thing it's a nice thing and it's also like I'll just keep comparing a taunt of Manchala just because that's the closest thing I have to like an annual tradition of an overlay it is

708
01:15:44,260 --> 01:16:14,260
it's nice because it doesn't change the right it's not they're not putting new characters it's not a different movie it's it's nice because and I did sound stupid when you say it it's nice because they put us other lights on it and they put Santa hats on things yeah and there's a slightly different soundtrack yeah yeah and and and it's like it's interesting because it's like I was thinking like Haunted Mansion what if they did a holiday Haunted Mansion but it wasn't Nightmare Before Christmas and you just put Santa hats on all the ghosts you change the

709
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:44,260
soundtrack fine but but fun still yeah yeah but I'm saying like it's an interesting it's a different thing than that because it's like you're just dressing up what's there already and I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing but it's interesting that like it maintains it maintains the spirit of it in a way obviously stronger than the Haunted Mansion holidays which changes the vibe of the ride well that that soundtrack elevation is definitely a big thing a lot of the feeling I get that I love about Haunted Mansion holidays being outside and that kind of

710
01:16:44,260 --> 01:17:14,260
like that weird like shimmery unsettling score before that it's not even from the the Danny Elfman soundtrack and similar hearing a like big elevated version of obviously that the song changes the dolls all sing jingle bells and in some cases deck the halls but there's all there's still some it's a small world in there and the arrangement is really nice it's nice to hear kind of a 90s bigger better produced strings oriented

711
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:44,260
holiday infused version of the song I think I think the song it's a small world really shines limited capacity I agree and yeah version we're no small world song haters either that's right but it is you know I get it that it's very repetitive and it's a very simple type song but you do appreciate it more in between jingle bells or deck the halls when you get little breaks from it yes they're just varying it up at all makes you kind of miss and appreciate

712
01:17:44,260 --> 01:18:03,780
yeah sort of like the simple earworm nature I think it's I think overall the song is an upgrade jingle bells I think it is too I mean I love Christmas carols so I have to agree with you like I'm a big Christmas guy so they play wonderful I have been now the last month I've been twice Disney to Disneyland's

713
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:33,780
oh great and there's a lot the family I got the I made the family get passes parents so like there's a there's different you do the whole yeah your folks go along with your daughter and yes there's different configurations you can have I can pull one family member I mean I am I brave enough to go with a two-year-old yes but I haven't done it yet like just you in here is scary a little bit but I would do universal first because we have done that yeah but it's it's just such a long car ride and if something

714
01:18:33,780 --> 01:19:03,780
goes wrong so speaking of something going wrong last time I was there it's it's very hard sometimes to get her to nap at the right time because a lot of excitement going on so I was she's in the stroller still so I'm like okay if I push her in the stroller at the right time I can get her out and the time before that I was just walking around Star Wars land pushing her around and she was yelling and pointing a Grogu and then calling for her mother you're trying to get the naps to still happen while you're just walking around yes because she just gets

715
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:33,780
the day can last a little longer then okay yeah because she won't be so hard to deal with it seven eight nine o'clock whatever are you closing that stroller you trying to encourage kind of a relax it happens it's happened a lot so it's so like in the middle of the earlier in the day she'll go to sleep if she's in the stroller for an extended period of time and nothing is too distracting so the so in Galaxy's Edge she's running around and she was like so awake and I was like oh this ain't happening she saw Chewbacca she's never seen Chewbacca she's not seen Star Wars she's a Chewbacca it shocked the hell out

716
01:19:33,780 --> 01:20:03,780
of her she quieted down I swear to God within two or three minutes she was out she was asleep it just like broke her from her pattern she liked seeing him and she's like I'll bring him up now and she knows what's going on but he broke her knee she went right to sleep it's like her brain couldn't process so she just like she just gave up like well right not for today yes that's tomorrow's work she was so up and pointing it like a Grogu backpack and pointing everything and I'm just like wheeling her around here I'm like she's gonna go to sleep and then Chewbacca did it so

717
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:33,780
then cut to the next week we went and I'm in the Esplanade I'm like getting her sleep I did it last time we can do it this time the Small World Holiday theme comes on in the Esplanade which is the full Jingle Bells Small World she is almost out I have leaned the stroller all the way back I can tell she's on her way out Small World Holiday comes on she loves both of these songs she starts singing and ruins the entire it ruins the entire nap she does not go to bed she is

718
01:20:33,780 --> 01:21:03,780
in there I can see it she's lying down she's like is this Small World after and then sings right into Jingle Bells she's going back and forth nap ruined we couldn't go it ruined like it ruined from 5 p.m. on because she was so tired so you're trying to find Chewbacca now well I should have this very but getting from Esplanade to Galaxy's Edge it's a wild trip there with the stroller you can do it and it was such an infectious song she

719
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:33,780
couldn't stay asleep she needed to be awake to sing this thing and I yes I also get it I tried going walking around Grand Californian at that point with her just kind of in the back and it didn't work it really screwed me I'm amazed you try the naps even out on the road that's cool that it's worked it's just it's worked almost every time and it just extends our ability to be there without tantrums sure

720
01:21:33,780 --> 01:22:03,780
yeah for a little longer you gotta appreciate what you got cuz I just Aaron and I just went backwards oh it's really because I was sort of gone I was like I was busy and grandma was helping and and now I'm like oh right a baby yeah yeah back at the front of the line oh boy you climbed the mountain once now you gotta climb it again yeah yeah at least I know I can but yeah so so so I was I but I was while this was going on I was like god damn this is a good version of this song I was cursing it and loving it at the same time it's

721
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:24,860
great that's great stuff in the day Jason you got something on the pie I do yeah right now well I I agree more Christmas hats that's my beat plus up like put a Christmas hat on every human and creature in the Santa hat it's not a Christmas hat but it would be some other type of am I hallucinating this we did an episode about

722
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:42,060
Santa Kong right I think we did I had a whole discussion of just that they put a Santa hat on King Kong we did do that right we did yeah that's a big one that's one of the best that you don't overthink it yeah yeah put a big hat on a big thing yeah so here is one of my favorite creatures in the

723
01:22:42,060 --> 01:23:04,060
it's like this sea serpent has a Santa hat on and a wreath around their neck oh yeah yeah yeah and it's great and I was a little disappointed because some of the iconic creatures like the the gator with the or the crocodile with the umbrella or the pink hippo didn't have that much Christmas stuff going on

724
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:33,060
they're not all wearing this one this guy's decked out you know the umbrella the umbrella on the croc doesn't have like there's not like a candy cane pattern on that I might have just not noticed it I didn't see it this popped even just watching video this popped up like it's under the sea Ariel's next to them so there's also very cute I think it's the snake from Jungle Book

725
01:23:34,060 --> 01:24:03,060
but it's in the Egypt sect is Ka Ka kind of like on a deconstructed Christmas tree yeah maybe let me I can describe the thing open here it is like right in front of the or to the side of the Sphinx so but it's like the opposite of the Indiana Jones snake which is scary this one is cute well I should hope so yeah a bit of that's right is a bit of a different tone it would have I mean to be very funny if right in the middle of

726
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:33,060
Small World there is some like terror the one of those after hours events they just made Small World scary they bring out slave Pinocchio from Hong Kong yeah yeah oof that was rough did you see that picture of him no I think you just tagged me and I still that's a sign to not look yeah that was a really scary picture that sounds very creepy in terms of scares in this thing I I was watching a horror movie and

727
01:24:33,060 --> 01:25:03,060
I was watching a video of it and I didn't know from what year but keep in mind that there's a you know this is obviously largely about about Christmas and the holidays but then there's kind of a new year representation as well and there's always a part where the there's a flashing sign of that that has the you know next year the numbers of next year right written on it and in this case that just we round a corner and I wasn't expecting it and that all of a sudden we're in the new year

728
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:33,060
and then flashing on and off and lights is twenty twenty yeah and I when I didn't so I must have been watching a twenty nineteen one and not knowing that it's coming there's something about seeing twenty twenty and flashing lights it's it's like you're looking at the Confederate flag it's like it's a it's a hate crime to see the words to see the numbers twenty twenty like don't show that to me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that video I should report it to YouTube get it yeah yeah you could probably get it they would understand I was watching I

729
01:25:33,060 --> 01:26:03,060
did notice that because there's twenty the one I was watching was twenty twenty five so I did not have that same reaction that's gonna be the same situation in five years well yeah let's let's let's just hope that here's the hope we can put out into the world is the twenty twenty five is not a future notorious year well we'll see we'll see hopefully I don't even know what if it was Harrison Ford saying we'll see the Hulk but red

730
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:33,060
yeah he's he's bitter because people like people are gonna see me in that stupid red Hulk what do you mean another round of reshoots my friends are gonna see this they're gonna make fun of me if we reshoot it a twelfth time maybe it'll be good what do you mean you already put out the heavy meal toys what are my grandkids gonna get this right here is also the way we make yes and these wooden Santas are really fun oh yeah

731
01:26:33,060 --> 01:27:03,060
they're kind of like Tiki Santas yeah but I mean it's like almost like a 2d wooden Santa and they're really stylized it's hard to track from year to like I mean I guess you could have track from year to year what they put up somebody must I'm sure there is like a running tally of like and this was new this year and this was new this year but it's all it's all kind of a wash to me nothing so insane has been added they put the snowman I believe at the end toward the end is new this year so this big if you've seen that which is a really cool giant snowman yes and the

732
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:33,060
I think it's his winter wonderland under him and the font is a little sinister but it's supposed to look like icicles sinister well hold on let me find it yeah yeah here here the snowman was added in 2011 was it really oh then I'm thinking of something else I'm thinking of something else yeah that's a little bit of a metal band font yeah I like it but yeah I feel like the lights outside the

733
01:27:33,060 --> 01:28:03,020
lights on the building as like LED technology just keeps getting better and better I feel like they're more vivid all the time sparkles I feel like yeah it's straight lights like you'll get little like little like bright white sparkles sure and it feels like extra fun when the like it hits the top of the hour and is it every few minutes 15 every 15 minutes the little show yeah that goes on wait no okay let me admit I watched a ride through

734
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:33,020
but I don't know what happens to the little clock show I don't know how the clock show is different but it is different there's a first of all there's a hat on the clock as you said yeah but what else happens to that clock show do we know we need to just watch I think it's kind of standard the little guys come out and then they go back like there's nothing special it's not different for the holidays I I didn't really notice a difference that stuck out when I watched I admit to not watching the actual ceremony I watched the turning on the light ceremony which is just a very quick

735
01:28:33,020 --> 01:29:03,020
thing they do that where they do almost like they do a California adventure at Halloween time it's an unspectacular ceremony but I do like the idea that you switch on like I wish there was a Guardians of the Galaxy when it's monsters after dark when they like counted down to like the thing turning yeah a different color yeah but no I don't actually don't know I should look that up yeah should look and see if there's a difference in the little clock show because yeah they it's every 15 you said it's usually like the toy soldiers

736
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:16,380
pretending that they don't know what happens to try to get small world holiday 2 to happen we have to we didn't know what happened to the clock show if it's happened in seven years that's fine we're on a good we're on a good precedent you may as well point I was reminded in the very

737
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:32,820
two of us all have quit by seven years from now there'll be one of us left I don't know who it is and is it a pure monologue or is the one do I don't want to suppose who it is but is the other is the one who's left doing it to like pillow versions of the others oh maybe yeah there's like it's

738
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:50,140
you're pretending they're there or it's they've been replaced by an AI we both we whoever we are who have been replaced by a eyes mmm yeah like James Earl Jones we have willingly submitted our voice to the AI the AI averse except we did not also die right but yeah it's

739
01:29:50,140 --> 01:30:20,100
well he did it before he died yes you could so he got paid he had a lot of fucking bad bullshit with Darth Vader they can do whatever they want and his family gets paid which is nice I was reminded I was saying at the very beginning of the ride you kind of hear like a monologue from Santa but he's in his home yeah there's Santa house so you're all just kind of four years you're just kind of peeping on Santa it's just

740
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:50,100
like we're hearing his innermost thoughts we're hearing is his monologue talking to himself so he's thinking you're saying you think he's thinking that he's not saying it to us I think he's saying it but he's like talking to himself like if you talk out loud when you're like okay I gotta I gotta measure that I gotta do you know like well this is your read on it but this is the is this just a cousin of one of the some of the sexual things that we've learned about in the recent past this is this a fetish called like Christmas

741
01:30:50,100 --> 01:31:20,060
voyeurism I don't think peeping I think peeping Tom is a universal reference I think voyeurism Tom can be a pervy thing of course it can say it is exclusively a non-pervy example of peeping Tom well you've just never been curious about how other people live when they think they're not being one I'm not saying it's me Jason's very online that's why he knows more about being a peeping Tom

742
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:50,100
he's read up on being a peeping Tom he knows all the ways you can be and it's not one thing being a peeping Tom can be many things yeah it could be you can peep on a lot of you can be a peeping Tom and peep on many different things or people yeah you know he's a college friend you may be Tom Ripley this guy I met and he seems really interested in my life I don't know what's going on literal peeping Tom yeah I don't know we're going out on a rowboat later just

743
01:31:50,100 --> 01:32:20,100
check some stuff out so we'll see what happens there's that radio voice again it is the perfect amount of time this exists the perfect amount of time too it is like just long enough where you get a nice chunk like it but it's not doesn't overstay its welcome yeah so like sometimes some years you're gonna miss it which is nice again Haunted Mansion Holiday it's so long you're not missing Haunted Mansion Holiday if you're going a couple times a year

744
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:50,100
I like that thing I continue to agree it's it's a little bit long and yeah it feels a lot I think I like something that plays a little hard to get yes and then it's like if you can if not Monsters After Dark I feel like even runs longer than I feel like that runs closer to two months but this thing runs like a little over a month like it just it had just or it was just opening when I was there like mid-November so like it's like six weeks yeah mid-November

745
01:32:50,100 --> 01:33:20,100
to what I think is when the holiday stuff wraps up does it go that long it probably ends of the day before our passes are good again yeah yeah yeah we are exactly boxed out of fuck with us you will not see this but you got to see you got to say with you you are in the yeah so I will get to at the end of yes you can do it it's I don't think there's anything we're barred from seeing the tree is up but we went twice and that second November trip was to make up for the December

746
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:50,100
trip we wouldn't be taking that is where they're headed you're gonna have to start doing like there'll be like certain price tiers like okay well with the with a magic key you don't get to look at the Matterhorn we've now we've written a scanned you have to have done a retina scan to get a magic key and like yeah no okay well like there look there are unfortunately blackout pirates there are a number of pirates throughout the attraction who you don't get to see but you get to see a few at the beginning

747
01:33:50,100 --> 01:34:06,100
one in the middle and then a couple you know sixty percent into the right and then nothing for the last five minutes but the people with the top tier pass get to see all of them you're saying well yeah until the four hundred dollar written add-on yeah

748
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:19,700
because you're gonna want to guarantee your path to seeing every pirate yeah with the keys these I did you joke but these sort of thoughts I've been having a lot in the wake of the last few weeks as certain things

749
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:46,900
accelerate toward their inevitable end and that is where oh boy well that was a heavy way to put it swell that's all no we can't not an hour and a half I can't get into what I'm talking about I mean I you know what I'm talking about hey cheer up come on I was trying to say happy 2025 to y'all I'm it's me baby new year okay that's something that happens baby new year Jason's favorite character in fiction I would imagine

750
01:34:46,900 --> 01:35:14,100
I'm changing from my long typical podcasting beard to my little Sash and Di-P the face Scott made when you said Di-P I'm back baby that is kind of a universal like the old year leaving the new year beginning Jason that was not what my harumph noise was about it was less about the concept of baby new year and more about the word Di-P

751
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:37,300
you're worried about the universality of my references I think I nailed this one yes that one not an issue yes certainly you're reacting to the reference to baby new year and not the joke about me stripping my clothes away in front of you and putting on a diaper little being said right before Di-P

752
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:58,100
no years of stage acting taught me to have one costume on under the other so the Di-P is ready to go so you're wearing it already yeah what he's this is a long way for him to tell us that he's currently wearing a little Di-P in all seriousness I think a thing that I

753
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:27,620
really like about this ride that I think works well on an attraction in Florida the Space Mountain at Christmas where they just they just pummel you with music and blinking green and red lights there's so much Christmas stuff in this and granted it's Christmas around the world but it's just like you're getting hit with Christmas carols and lights and decorations and stuff you're being pummeled you're being pummeled so like it's yeah you know what

754
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:56,980
I feel like it has just like I think it sort of filled a void the Disneyland had which is the need to just have Christmas the ride that's sort of what this is I guess that's true it just became like you know the like the dolls and everything in it like all work and it's all complimentary but what it really is about is just like taking a boat past a bunch of Christmas lights into a place to see more Christmas stuff yeah more winter stuff it's Christmas the ride that is like a really it's pretty simple

755
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:27,540
which in this and look in the spirit of holiday of forgiveness and and coming together this is something I haven't experienced this myself but you know I've I've been on the record about my feelings about living with the land but I like the feeling that I get from this Christmas version I think I would like that the Christmas version of living with the land because I think that would have the same thing of kind of being Christmas the ride it seems it seems neat to me I hope to do it in person at some point we really should fly

756
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:57,540
tomorrow or tonight to Orlando to do Pizza Rizzo and to do that living with the land clock is ticking do we know have any idea when it's going away I don't know but when they were talking about starting the monsters in construction it seemed fat like it seemed like that was on a faster track are we gonna have to do a Pizza Rizzo Pizza Rizzo episode without having eaten at Pizza Rizzo I'm worried that that might be the case I went I walked around I visited Malia I but I didn't get to I like the really if

757
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:27,540
really ultimately the food is part of it but maybe the food is not part of it I did like the little wedding banquet room a lot yeah I like things that I really like that yeah I mean it's to Mac or donut it's very the pizza I mean I bet I bet it's funny seeing stuff that I remember opening like 10 years ago like a Pizza Rizzo or like the Hello Kitty store get flipped to Monsters Inc. and the wicked like center

758
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:57,380
like it's very straight it's like I feel like they built that out so much and then they're like we're putting in new stuff they put all this money into transforming the space and now they aren't holding the space ironically I have if they said you'll have time to enjoy enjoy it in 2025 but I don't know will it last six months I don't know well all the more reason to light the fire to I was gonna say this at the wrap up

759
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:26,620
but my my New Year's resolution get down to Orlando we've talked about we talked about a couple episodes ago there's a lot of stuff happening this year there and of course I mean the opening of John Taffer's right Taffer's Tavern in the on in the I Drive area you think they would let us break a bottle of Taffer's brown butter bourbon on the building as it opens like it's the ship official inaugurator by the bottle too he doesn't have to pay for it

760
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:56,620
sure he's not going to so in late you said a bottle that's money out of my pocket we can do before like some cream soda in there you know we don't have to actually he just has to look like it was his bourbon doesn't actually I also think I could probably like you know buy some other I still I'm still carrying around that sticky bottle oh yeah exploded in Vegas that we offered to do that way I think we had with Griffin I offered it to James Zdomian who seemed rightfully disgusted

761
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:26,620
by the idea yeah it's still kicking around my house I'm gonna have to this is becoming a real I don't know that bourbon can turn like sandwiches but it is very much a Homer and the Big Sandwich situation this thing just gets grosser and grosser by the day but I could fill it up with other whiskey reseal it and use that to break the well on the second gate Jason has said he's he's not enjoying expired food like he used to well now you're great as

762
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:45,060
boys I know I've had to make a lot of lifestyle change in the last year plus we don't if you think that if you think that we're I'm gonna burn any time here on the getting the giant sandwich this is club three business that's gonna be on the paywall yeah I we have

763
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:55,180
others Christmas stuff because I have a little small world thing let's cover Chris it's not quite Christmas oriented that's why it's hard I wish there was like a comprehensive list of everything because I'm sure there's like

764
01:40:55,180 --> 01:41:09,660
invisible stuff even I'm not noticing or making the lights brighter or more aggressively Christmas or holiday which 18 I felt like I would be like a week you could do this in a week right I don't know if there's other stuff I'm not even thinking about but I

765
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:24,860
think longer than I had for the movie I was gonna say yeah I hear 18 days my head spins I think the with this and on a mansion they had to preserve a lot of the original stuff is so old at this point you mean so they don't careful they got a

766
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:45,420
tiptoe that's why yeah they have to go do not knock the serpent so it's all doll number five in India you don't think somebody's falling over and crushed one of the dolls like oh no turn it around that face the wall and then like yeah they like just find like a

767
01:41:45,420 --> 01:42:15,340
basketball or something and paint a face on it or a volleyball like Wilson they paint a volleyball stick it on the little kid's head and nobody's gonna notice it's a stylized face so we got any rides with pigs in it just grab a grab a pig paint it skin color and throw it on there 50,000 bulbs I saw yes yes that's another little fact more facts you remember any facts I don't have any more facts I kind of settle my facts I mean facts Christmas is beloved

768
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:45,340
all the world round yeah that is a fact yes Christmas is a Christmas season is a time for caring fact there was a weird thing that I was looking at some like website where they're like here's some 10 facts about haunted on a mission a small world holiday and like most of them aren't even facts just like it's good and you're like yeah that is I guess yeah that's a that's a trick listicle that's a trick stickle it is a trick yes it was a trick arbitrarily made into 10 it's like this is like number nine it's like it's all about the small details and one of the first rooms representing the northern region pay close attention to all the

769
01:42:45,340 --> 01:43:15,340
subtle festival details again this isn't really a fact my favorite is the mailbox with letters to Santa and a silhouette of the man himself in the window situated behind a little furry friend with a paddle what what what yeah what do you guys know what that means and I'm gonna paddle some animal well or is the animal the one with a paddle I don't know wait say the sentence again let's really think about our conjugation here okay my favorite is the mailbox with letters to Santa and a silhouette of the man himself in the window

770
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:45,340
situated behind a little furry friend with a paddle behind he's so Santa's behind does the furry friend have the paddle pointed at Santa's front I or is it Santa who has the paddle and he is behind I thought it was the furry friend was in front of the house is how I took that a silhouette of the man himself in the window situated on him situated behind a little furry friend with a paddle what's the furry friend I what

771
01:43:45,340 --> 01:44:15,340
kind of yeah is Santa have like a furry friend historically and I don't think so he has mrs. Claus he is Rudolph Rudolph isn't free though he's a reindeer and we're combining okay it's we're combining furries and paddles Jason I'm not online enough what is it I'm throwing is it is it just an Easter egg of tiptoe the blue reindeer the Macy's mascot but does tiptoe the blue reindeer from Macy's have a paddle does it wield a paddle it has a walking parade float

772
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:32,560
yeah but we don't we don't have it's a shame I think we already said our Christmas lineup but learning about the original character tiptoe the blue reindeer that they're trying to get inception into us that like this is a guy they did work you love it huh they

773
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:51,540
Incepted you I bring it up tiptoe on this I think I saw a lot of people going what the fuck is I didn't remember tiptoe yeah you go to sleep dreaming about tiptoe now and Macy's great stock and return policies well you always go to sleep thinking about Macy's return policy let's be honest

774
01:44:51,540 --> 01:45:04,520
oh my god another reshoot on the movie guys I gotta get out of here oh let's just let me do my episode visions of hassle free returns floating in his head

775
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:21,520
okay I'm looking at a still from the video of this tiptoe I see no oh okay you wish no I see it's a silhouette of Santa and there's maybe like I don't see a paddle I don't know what's going on what's the paddle I don't know I see no furry friends

776
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:41,500
with a paddle do you see this is a Rorschach test now we're looking at a silhouette I don't see a furry friend in a paddle I guess this is an article from last year so I perhaps the paddles gone but what's to the left of Santa in that silhouette is that his hand or is that a candle it looks to me like he's holding a wishbone

777
01:45:41,500 --> 01:46:00,480
is it a ping pong paddle is it a ping pong paddle is it a pickleball paddle I hear that's really growing in popularity is Santa playing pickleball up at the North Pole maybe are there enough human beings to play I guess he could play with the elves elves little friend with a paddle I mean what even character has a paddle

778
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:24,460
now I'm looking at 2023 I see no paddle what is this wait wait wait stop everything I got it this is what they mean there's a little it has nothing to do with Santa there's a little white cub some kind of like polar bear cub who is on a paddle as if on a kayak that's what it is the Santa thing was confusing

779
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:54,460
what we're looking at is Santa's house and then separately in front is a cute little bear in a kayak they are not in the same room Santa is not ominously hanging out behind you were trying to okay okay I was saying like oh look for this and then look behind it okay oh geez well I skipped too far ahead in the video yes alright because when you said that sentence I pictured that like I don't know some kind of a pest got into the house or that Santa has changed his mind about a pet

780
01:46:54,460 --> 01:47:24,460
that he got once or is particularly mad at the reindeer this year yeah and he then so he is as we've said in the past he has come with a paddle for their ass right like Santa's gonna do something really bad with this paddle to a little furry creature who I don't think had it coming oh I thought the creature was gonna nail Santa with it oh you took it a whole other way yeah I took it the other way there's some kind of like revenge fantasy happening I thought that was gonna be the impetus for red one they have to rescue Santa from this unhinged

781
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:54,420
little creature who's taking him captive there's some sort of little gremlin or some kind of like freak reindeer went into the flying machine like some sort of freak creature yeah who has somehow gotten loose in Santa's house got a hold of a paddle and now he's gonna go buck wild on Santa's butt Jason what animal would you want to paddle get a paddle from who would you want to get hit with who which animal would you want to take a paddle to your ass are you saying do I want a strong animal or I want a weak animal

782
01:47:54,420 --> 01:48:10,820
to run up to you I don't like a baby goat would probably be cute okay I'll try to manage a paddle anthropomorphic or regular with just a paddle in its mouth think either yeah but that's a big difference oh yeah anthropomorphic it can uh can really

783
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:40,820
curse at me and swing yeah well I didn't say that speak English swing I guess baby goat then okay that would just be cute it's kind of just like it'd be cute now I could put my hands on my hip and go like right come on really but I mean it look it wouldn't hurt too bad because you would have the diapy on yeah like a little padding yeah diapy provides padding that's what it is it's literally what it is it's padding yeah it's padding

784
01:48:40,820 --> 01:49:10,820
so it meant to be padding for it's meant to be padding the other way not writing for a paddle right not paddle well WDW magazine is a written a confusing article let's just put it that way magic confusing clickbait trixticles coming from yeah online Disney well this is what got us into the mess of that Eisner is the golfer and then the still unproven fans thing I'd love to figure out the fans thing this year and I still can't find her next year 2025 I still can't find the thing that was new this year that was not the snowman so that is that's what

785
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:13,900
why we're gonna have to do another one I guess so I guess well here's what I'm

786
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:21,820
wondering is should I burn how deep are we in now what's that almost two hours

787
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:29,020
just a little under yeah I'll say I'll say it fast okay yeah because I was in

788
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:32,340
the small world holiday section of the Wikipedia which brought me towards the

789
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:36,900
bottom of the small world Wikipedia which had a little section about small world

790
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:42,980
in other media and it brought up in this section I saw a reference to a small

791
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:47,620
world movie that was planned but not made in the 1970s oh interesting and I'm gonna

792
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:53,060
read you this as copy pasted straight out of the Wikipedia okay although this this

793
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:57,980
might necessitate maybe we do need small small world holiday 2 or small world 3

794
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:02,900
whoa Raymond John Cassavetes was planning a devastating look into the

795
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:10,820
lives of the people around the world Disney was gonna finance a Cassavetes

796
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:16,380
that's pretty cool yeah no here we go in the 1970s a planned feature film was

797
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:21,140
going to be a Cold War tinged comedy adventure where the children of UN

798
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:25,820
leaders try to get their parents to stop squabbling through faking mass

799
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:31,340
kidnapping only for a war profiteer to try to take advantage of the fear and

800
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:37,900
start a mass conflict whoa what it's a small world the movie of a fake

801
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:44,220
kidnapping and war profiteering what the fuck what is he made movie no it wasn't

802
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:49,100
made but it was planned but Disney was going to make it I'm saying well I think

803
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,380
that might be too strong that might be further than it ever got here's here's

804
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:55,340
that I started exploring like what is the source on this and I clicked on the

805
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:59,420
source was Jim Hill media interesting this is a Jim Hill thing this is

806
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:03,780
something he published in 2003 and he published it because he seemingly knows

807
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:08,680
the person who had this idea this was a movie pitched by a guy named Larry

808
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:14,940
Pontius he was VP of marketing for the US parks in the 1970s and Jim Hill goes

809
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:20,060
into further detail about what this pitched 1970s it's a small world the

810
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:24,380
movie was going to be so let me weave the tale here really quick before we go

811
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:30,780
all right so to set the scene tensions are high internationally it was the

812
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:37,100
1970s you see only somewhat after the Cold War so a nine-year-old Russian boy

813
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:42,100
is captured and detained by the Chinese a Russian boy just goes into China just

814
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:46,460
to like look around and make some friends and China says no get out of here you

815
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:51,140
know flares up the conflicts between the countries big news story international

816
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:58,220
incident and this is the dream of a true villain named Alexander Bashillion he is

817
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:04,340
a despotic leader of a made-up country maybe Krakow from the terminal something

818
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:10,560
like that you know Russia esque and his sole export is munitions that's all

819
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:15,140
that's what he lives for is to sell weapons he Alexander Bashillion lives

820
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:20,460
for war you see so you know he's good he's gonna use this to stoke

821
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:24,420
international fears but there's one group of people who doesn't like any of

822
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:29,460
this and that is the kids of all the UN ambassadors because they all go together

823
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:35,900
to one UN elementary school you see and even the even yes you know the UN kids

824
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:40,340
all go to the same school huh yeah you got it you're with me and they all get

825
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:44,300
along great not like us adults with all of our weird fear mongering and over

826
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:47,700
thing you know kids speak the international language of love they all

827
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:52,140
get along so the kids of the UN ambassadors they all hatch a plan they

828
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:56,700
say I know how to make everybody get along in the world again we'll pretend

829
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:02,100
that we got kidnapped and then everybody will have to unite to come find us what

830
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:08,220
without why without us plucky kids what are we good like how can the UN possibly

831
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:13,260
move forward so they do that they go hide somewhere all the click one kid

832
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:19,700
from every nation Noah's Ark situation they all disappear and this becomes a

833
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:23,700
much bigger story than the one Russian boy who got captured so that story gets

834
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:27,140
wiped out mission accomplished so the kids have reminded everybody what's

835
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:34,380
important not so because evil Alexander Bashillion seizes on this and he says

836
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:38,420
all those kids who got kidnapped that was the fault of Russia and or China

837
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:43,220
they took them so now what we need to do we need to have a war and also I'm gonna

838
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:48,540
go kill all those kids that's the story of it's a small world the movie oh my

839
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:53,260
god a false kidnapping of one child from every country in the world all fake

840
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:59,900
kidnaps themselves and then a mean man sets out to murder them it's a small

841
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:05,340
world what the fuck what is this really I mean it's it's too specific it's got to

842
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:09,620
be real some yeah but when I say when when when you read Disney was developing

843
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:14,060
this were they really because think about the story that I just read now

844
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:18,160
now juxtapose that to what Disney live-action movies were like in the

845
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:23,980
1970s this would have come out right between you know cat from outer space

846
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:28,660
and candle shoe we would have had this movie about a false international

847
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:32,720
kidnapping incident you know Disney wanted just getting on the paranoid

848
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:38,460
thrillers of the seven parallax few three days of the condor and they're

849
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:42,060
like we want to get in on that money train Walker is wondering where's my

850
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:48,420
three days of the condor I don't this is such a bizarre I mean maybe it was

851
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:52,500
developed and written and then finally somebody went wait what because it was

852
01:54:52,500 --> 01:55:00,060
the 70s they didn't quite know what they were supposed to be certainly yeah so

853
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:05,220
maybe it did get written or developed like it's possible well as as Jim tells

854
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:10,180
the story a treatment for this was drafted and shown to then head of Disney

855
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:14,820
card Walker the feedback apparently was he literally he wrote on the treatment

856
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:20,060
interesting and that might have been maybe that is what happened but my

857
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:25,940
question beyond that then is okay we're gonna do it's a small world the movie it

858
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:32,300
is gonna be a paranoia thriller made in the 1970s is would they have just done

859
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:36,500
this with a bunch of kind of like you know like a couple tears down from Jodie

860
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:41,260
Foster like kind of mophead kid actors like those kind of bad musketeers from

861
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:46,860
that 70s special oh yeah my god gee we got to kidnap ourselves but I got to get

862
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:52,100
home for dinner is it like to like a Billy Moomy would have been too elevated

863
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:57,580
for this maybe yeah too good yeah no this is like the third new Mickey Mouse

864
01:55:57,580 --> 01:56:04,100
club I think so he's all playing kids around the world anonymous mop heads yeah who all have to learn some

865
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:10,180
accents that they probably can't soccer a blue Alexander but Chile on wants us

866
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:16,900
dead but then my but then my further question was and this is maybe still a

867
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:20,580
question if it was this or any story if you were gonna make it's a small world

868
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:26,780
the movie would you do it with the dolls you're saying me personally or just like

869
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:29,820
what you would have to do it with the dolls right well I don't know if you'd

870
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:36,220
have to it would be the scariest option but just imagine imagine a full movie

871
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:40,700
with puppeted dolls kind of in the vein of garbage pail kids oh well that's a

872
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:47,060
different story and it's genuinely scary it's like it's a living it's like you

873
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:53,660
know let's say Michael Caine is playing Alexander Bashillian like my way with

874
01:56:53,660 --> 01:57:01,320
you I will see I was gonna say don knots is Alexander Bashillian well now

875
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:07,460
we're talking about Fred McMurray is the heroic American ambassador Tony is

876
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:12,860
important because there are old movies that are like light and fun but there if

877
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:17,420
you really analyze what's happening it's a shot attempted child kidnapping child

878
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:22,900
murder like there are I could maybe see this is a little heavier than normal

879
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,020
movie I'm talking about but well but like you know the the Beethoven films

880
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:31,420
exactly about because Disney staple Dean Jones is in them the first one is like a

881
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:35,820
bunch of needles are gonna go into a kidnapped dog and the next one Beethoven

882
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:41,140
rescues his owner from a rape situation yes this is some very heavy yes subject

883
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:47,260
matters right so yes it's maybe maybe maybe on paper they didn't think okay or

884
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:51,060
in in pitch they didn't think oh this may be a little too much but in the way

885
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:55,820
that some people say like oh the last unicorn or bed knobs and broomsticks

886
01:57:55,820 --> 01:58:00,500
like there's some unsettling elements yeah this well they would have had to

887
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:05,820
you yeah with the 70s dolls though they would have had to use like 70s technology

888
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:10,020
to make puppet dolls that's what I'm if this is just imagine you know we've been

889
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:13,580
glorifying the Eisner era but if in that now that's where all the craziest stuff

890
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:17,140
came from but if this one is tweaked through wow yeah watch it's a small

891
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:22,780
world the movie and it's about like like a rifle is being held to the to the

892
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:29,260
temple of a little small world doll like there's like there's a little Russian

893
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:38,620
doll cowering next to a little a little Iceland imagine yeah please we speak but

894
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:44,260
don't you realize as much as we share it's time we're aware it's a small world

895
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:50,620
after all oh my god I never thought of it that way what have I become I'm a

896
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:57,060
munitions loving monster and then it takes his own life yeah splattering all

897
01:58:57,060 --> 01:59:03,900
over all of the doll Don nuts geez I'm a monster I tell you I don't deserve to

898
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:24,980
live wait you can change you can change mr. nods and that's really if only we

899
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:28,740
can get a blu-ray that this holiday season could we get Jim just to like do

900
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:31,620
does he have like just a list of everything that was in development from

901
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:39,500
1970 to 19 just we imagine all and we just said and when Jess was on because

902
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:44,020
she was talking about various projects and development at Disney all the money

903
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:49,940
they've spent not making every ride oh sure into a movie or TV show I wonder

904
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:53,420
because there's probably been several rounds of every single one every single

905
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:57,980
one of them yeah yes and I would be interested is is it does it picked

906
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:02,780
probably picked up in the last 20 years but I bet still before that obviously we

907
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:07,420
hear small world in the 70s like this one right yeah it's new to me yeah in the

908
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:12,820
1970s they tried to develop the Main Street omnibus and then you read the

909
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:21,500
treatment page one the omnibus crashes glass flies everywhere no survivors the

910
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:26,420
omnibus at the time was carrying one child of everyone in the UN delegation a

911
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:30,780
child from every nation in the world was slaughtered at the hands of a broken

912
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:39,820
omnibus starring Donnats oh god I was too drunk to drive the omnibus someone

913
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:47,100
got the brakes well if only you know it's it's it's not a world where you have

914
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:51,420
a great film like that but it is a world where a podcast toast can come back from

915
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:57,460
a big crazy adventure and reconvene with his with his podcast pals it's been a

916
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:02,580

919
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:20,740
welcoming but for now we all survived podcast the ride main feed 2024 what a

920
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:29,100
year a host departure all that d23 bedding and nonsense the the Orlando

921
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:37,540
Saga yeah yeah did we do that we did I believe we did it's hard to remember it

922
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:42,900
was several can I say a couple children ago for me in my mind since we did that

923
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:47,780
I was thinking like oh and that like I City Walk is gonna change so much in the

924
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:52,580
next five years I have a feeling we just I'm glad we did it to wrap up this

925
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,540
version of it I'm just saying but I in my mind since we finished that City Walk

926
02:01:56,540 --> 02:02:00,300
shouldn't change it should stay the same as it was when we did the sagas yeah

927
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:05,500
okay and any respect for our our great classic work but I think it I think the

928
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:09,980
toll story of the podcast that's where I think yeah but no it's gonna change and

929
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:16,100
hotels will come and oh you're saying we're gonna know the hotels are very

930
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:19,340
exciting but I'm just like we're gonna have to cover it in some way I don't

931
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:22,740
know but it doesn't I didn't we say we did it already right it's not like it's

932
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:28,820
not up to us ultimately it's really a matter if we get contacted by a ghost or

933
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:33,420
by a guy who's out in the world who resembles a ghost well I don't know what

934
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:38,720
whatever strange mechanism will cause us to have to go review a cafe in a hotel

935
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,140
yeah I know well we'll see in what year will that occur I don't know but 2025 is
