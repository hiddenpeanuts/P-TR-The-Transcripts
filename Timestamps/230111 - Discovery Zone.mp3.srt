1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,560
Hey, today we're talking DZ, where kids wanna be.

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,360
Here on PTR, where stunted adults are.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm Scott Caron here.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Hey, Jason Sheridan's here.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,480
Hi, first one of the new year, first recording of 2023.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,800
But one came out already, nobody cares about the order.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,360
Well, that's all right, you know, no one's say, you know,

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,800
I like to hear how the sausage gets made, you know?

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,200
Do they, do they really?

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,560
I think they do.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,920
I think you'll find that they do.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,920
You're confusing it because you love hearing

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,840
how actual sausages get made.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,640
I, literal and figurative, I love it.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,320
Sausage tours are your thing.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Mike Carlson, hi.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,440
Hi, I'm here, yes, and I wanna give everyone

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
the exact date and time that we're recording this,

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
just so they know.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,800
521, it's brisk out, we had to close the door

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,680
because of the rain, yeah, let's make sure you know.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,280
Google Earth coordinates are as follows.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Wait, hang on, I don't want people to know where I live.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,640
If they're vague, just leave the last few out

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
and we'll be okay.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,880
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,240
Hey, it's Discovery Zone today.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,520
This is a delightful one and it came out of a recent day.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,360
What do you wanna hear in the new year?

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,600
So thank you, Ryan Lovell, for suggesting this.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,080
What a delightful one and kind of an inevitable one,

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,560
but I hadn't thought about it.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,920
And if you don't know Discovery Zone in general,

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,600
this was a very 90s place.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
The 90s were the time to be this kid indoor playground

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,920
entity and the 90s were the only time

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,800
to be Discovery Zone, I would say.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,800
I might say a very specific subsection of the 90s

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,320
as the earnings and mergers quickly showed.

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, didn't make it too far out of the 90s.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
But I kind of think they're self-inflicted wounds.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,720
I think there's a world where DZ is still fairly popular

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,320
in the same way that Chuck E. Cheese is,

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,200
Chuck E. Cheese still feels like it's limping along,

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
but hasn't it felt like that forever?

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,920
I mean, it seemed like the pandemic

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,120
would have been the time.

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
Right. Right.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,720
Like anything that was kind of teetering,

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,520
hometown buffet fell into the pit.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
It didn't make it out of the pit.

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,400
And I think probably we might've all early on,

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
our thoughts went to Chuck E. Cheese.

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
Is it gonna make it out?

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
And it did somehow.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't think it's- Yeah, so far, yeah.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Fine.

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,520
And I actually go there without irony with the kid

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
and a lot of people do.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,120
Right. Yeah, I don't know.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,240
So I'm DZ, I think that, you know, we'll talk about it,

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,280
but there could be a world where Discovery Zone

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
is still around.

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,080
I think so, and especially being that it was a way

66
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,080
to kind of cheaply fill big retail spaces.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,120
Yes. And how do those places get filled today?

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,720
Well, through trampoline parks

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,960
and big kid run around areas.

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
It's like, it's just all splint.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,480
It's all a lot of independent Discovery Zones.

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Which is good.

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
We like that.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,880
But we also really love a huge bloated corporate entity

76
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,120
that is tricked into having to grow too fast

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
and then disappears entirely.

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Yeah.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
This one was interesting for me

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
because I feel like there was like a wealth of information,

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
like a full three act structure to the story,

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,880
the rise and fall.

83
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,880
I have no memory of ever being in the Discovery Zone.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, that's interesting. Really?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Okay, okay. Interesting.

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,680
Yeah, you never did it.

87
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Do you remember them being around though?

88
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,640
Faintly, I remember them kind of being in the ether,

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,640
but on the East Coast, there was also a glut of like,

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,320
yeah, we have kind of a big space.

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,720
We're gonna put in some arcade games

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,840
and an outdoor play set indoors

93
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,080
and sell the worst pizza you've ever imagined in your life.

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
And then eventually that would transition

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,040
to the scariest go-kart track you've ever been on your life.

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Laser tag, the darkest, deadliest laser tag.

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,640
Where you're worried about other real weapons.

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,160
There's bayonets. Behind some corner.

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Bayonets on the end of the guns.

100
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, like you know everyone in your party,

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,160
but you don't, there was that kid on the other team

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,840
that looked really like he might pistol whip you

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,880
from around the corner.

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, those kids, but those kids would hold their hand

105
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,080
over the receiver on their chest.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
Do you ever see this?

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Do you ever play laser tag?

108
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
To stop themselves from, very real.

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
I have not played a ton of laser tag.

110
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,640
It was cheating basically.

111
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,240
If you put your hand over the target on your chest

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
playing laser tag, you wouldn't get shot.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
So there was like a pro kid in there,

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,640
hand over his heart, shooting kids sideways.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
It's nothing because he just does this all afternoon

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,520
because his parents probably drop him off every day.

117
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,360
Yeah. Neat.

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
And you think the parents don't want that kid around?

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,560
Well, they created him.

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,720
They created his poor morals and ethics.

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,360
See how he plays laser tag with these little kids?

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
I was traumatized by him.

123
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,480
Maybe the kid gets it out with,

124
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,160
so maybe the aggression comes out

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,600
via his aggressive laser tagging.

126
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
He's gotta put it somewhere.

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,360
Mike, that's also the nicest version

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,160
of the way they could act out as opposed to like,

129
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,160
all right, I'm gonna climb to the top of that fake door

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,520
and jump off it.

131
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
You're right.

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm gonna ambush these little twerps.

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
But this was a traumatizing thing

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,320
when you would play laser tag against kids

135
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
not in your own friend circle.

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,800
You could play against older kids

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,520
or be some kid who knew all the ins and outs of it

138
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,560
and you felt like you were helpless to do anything.

139
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah.

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,560
I remember I haven't played a ton of it,

141
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,240
but enough to experience this syndrome

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,600
and you really feel impotent.

143
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Yes.

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Is how you feel.

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
You feel powerless. It's all feeling.

146
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,840
And limp and like you're not your full self.

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
Right. It's humiliating.

148
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,760
You feel humiliated.

149
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Yeah, a little.

150
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,240
When somebody's doing five times better than you

151
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,960
and you know, if I did 20 more rounds,

152
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,040
it's not gonna get any better.

153
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,680
And I would feel guilty cheating too with that,

154
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,240
especially back then.

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
You'd feel guilty like holding or like,

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
this is classic good boys stuff.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
We bring another shirt.

158
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,400
Some structure is in place.

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,240
I don't know.

160
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Maybe if I cheated,

161
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
it's somehow gonna get back to my social studies teacher.

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes.

163
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
And I'm gonna get a lower grade.

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,600
We should have brought another shirt

165
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,440
and put it over the receiver on your chest.

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,360
I, as a kid too, I didn't like the dark

167
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,760
and I did not like being startled.

168
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,560
So I just stayed out of laser tag.

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,920
Unless it was, there was one place

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,480
where there was a giant plastic pipe in the middle

171
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,160
and it was like side versus side, much more manageable.

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,320
And then there was also one place where you sat in a chair

173
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,680
and it was half the audience

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
versus the other half of the audience.

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,360
Whoa, hold on a second here.

176
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,200
No.

177
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,760
Jason Sheridan played seated laser tag.

178
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,560
I think this would be up his alley now.

179
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,720
This would be so up my alley.

180
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, ironically though, when I was in college,

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,840
there was a pretty popular laser tag place in Ithaca

182
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,600
that was really cheap.

183
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,720
So we would play it like sometimes.

184
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,160
And there, at least everyone agreed like,

185
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
okay, we're gonna be human beings about this.

186
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Like no one's hitting you with a gun

187
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,680
or like running and zapping you in the eye

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,480
or whatever bad boy things are going on.

189
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,720
They need to administer morality tests as well.

190
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Just like with different kind of

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,200
goofus and gallant scenarios.

192
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
Trick that you don't wanna give a test that's like,

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,120
would you ever butt somebody in the forehead with a gun

194
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,960
playing laser tag?

195
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,780
You have to trick that.

196
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,880
You have to do a little,

197
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,480
create some scenario with an old lady

198
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,280
with her pet walking across the street.

199
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
Or what would you do?

200
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Right, right.

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,060
And then you can tell.

202
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,200
And then if they can't play, then they get,

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,720
I don't know, get sent to a real,

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,880
some sort of real fight maybe, like a prison yard.

205
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
They're delivered straight to a prison.

206
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,200
I guess, yeah.

207
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
That's, I don't know.

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
I'm just spit balling here.

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
You get two minutes in the yard, go.

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,800
They should invent, Jason, they should invent a laser tag

211
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
where you get to lie in a twin bed.

212
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah.

213
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
And shoot at your opponent.

214
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,680
That's like some sort of a sensory deprivation tank.

215
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,340
Okay.

217
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,000
That's some sort of therapy for something.

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Yeah.

219
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
I think there's clearly a whole laser tag episode

220
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
to be done.

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,140
Well, of course.

222
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,280
And by the way, there's some laser tag components to that,

223
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,240
which I didn't realize that that was part of the evolution

224
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,220
of Discovery Zone.

225
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,720
But what it started as was this kind of kid

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
run around climbing gym.

227
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,420
And I think it might be helpful for multiple reasons

228
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,520
to let the place explain itself via an ad

229
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,120
and via a song that you almost definitely know

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,320
if you grew up going to this place

231
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,480
or just being aware of this place.

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm going dizzy at Discovery Zone.

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,240
Discover what I can do on my own.

234
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm going dizzy at Discovery Zone.

235
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,880
Hey, Alex, you're walking on the moon.

236
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,220
Discovery Zone fun centers are safe, colorful play zones

237
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,100
where kids can get exercise, have parties, and discover fun.

238
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,500
And where parents can relax and have fun too.

239
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,060
Alex, you can do that.

240
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,700
That's our daughter, the mountain climber.

241
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm going dizzy at Discovery Zone.

242
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,260
Easy.

243
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,660
Where kids wanna be.

244
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,820
That explains it pretty concisely.

245
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,780
It's nothing that other places hadn't done.

246
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,420
It's extrapolated from components of Chuck E. Cheese

247
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,500
or the McDonald's Playland,

248
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,940
but is fully devoted to climbing and play

249
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,940
and physical activity and mazes and tubes and environments

250
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,180
and slides and interesting kinds of slides

251
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,140
that would not be at your regular park.

252
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,020
And the very important marketing decision,

253
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,140
which they highlight in other commercials too,

254
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,500
you can be on your own.

255
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,980
Oh, there's a big play of like,

256
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,420
imagine what you can do without those parents around.

257
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,500
Or I can be on my own.

258
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is big.

259
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Yes, and I forget, there's another commercial

260
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,940
that might even have another funny thing

261
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,980
that somebody says in there, but that's a big part of it.

262
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,620
I guess to market to kids like, oh, I'm free here.

263
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,540
Now, was that something I wanted?

264
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,380
No.

265
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,220
No, no.

266
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,260
Yeah, I currently have a child who I have to do

267
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,460
all the climbing with him.

268
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,300
Yeah, right.

269
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,620
In general, I've been picturing my son

270
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,140
who's not quite at the age for this.

271
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,980
And I'm watching the ads and like, boy,

272
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,300
this would be his dream if there were

273
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
no other children in it.

274
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,860
And you were with him.

275
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,740
And I was holding his hand the entire time.

276
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,220
Yeah, which also seems like it was allowed

277
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,860
judging by the hours and hours of people climbing

278
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,780
through these things with VHS cameras.

279
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,620
Oh yeah.

280
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,260
And uploading those eventually to YouTube.

281
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,820
But not common, my memory of any of this stuff.

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,860
And I think Discovery Zone of the major ones,

283
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,380
and I consider the major ones,

284
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,340
Chuck E. Cheese, Leaps and Bounds,

285
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,100
which we'll talk about in a second here,

286
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,940
and Discovery Zone.

287
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,180
I think I went to this one the least,

288
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,860
but I don't remember adults in that play place with me ever.

289
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,700
Okay.

290
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,140
And not even now, you said this was not your dream,

291
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,820
but you did have Discovery Zone experience

292
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,700
and you did not force your parents to come in with it.

293
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,340
No, I was comfortable with my parents

294
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,460
not being in the tubes with me or in the ball pit,

295
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,580
but I didn't want them, I wanted them close-ish.

296
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, within, yeah.

297
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,580
I mean, when I get like 10, 11, 12,

298
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,820
I didn't need to be there.

299
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,660
Sure, sure.

300
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,140
But when I was younger, yeah, yeah.

301
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,780
There's the kidnapping fear.

302
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
Sure, yeah, and believe me.

303
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,980
That just there's somebody hiding in the ball pit

304
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,940
right at the bed, that you just get snagged

305
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,660
and yanked into some secret compartment.

306
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,860
Yeah, that's all I was told every day of my life,

307
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,420
is that you will be kidnapped.

308
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,420
Beware, you're going to, you will be kidnapped.

310
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,380
Anyone who you see, any adult that you see,

311
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,820
and maybe even a younger person you see

312
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,020
who you've never seen before is a candidate to kidnap you.

313
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,860
Yeah.

314
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Especially the people who work here

315
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,900
because that's an awfully good excuse.

316
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,100
Yeah, yeah, you develop this false persona of,

317
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,220
yes, love kids, love working with kids,

318
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,020
love not stealing, I mean, love helping kids.

319
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,100
I don't know what that was.

320
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,500
That was a hiccup.

321
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,340
So yeah, so I don't remember parents in there,

322
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,420
but yes, I think you could probably,

323
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
I don't know if they would take you out of there

324
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,860
if you got in there, but some of the Chuck E. Cheese ones,

325
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,220
especially, because Chuck E. Cheese was not as

326
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,060
like play place heavy as Discovery's own was.

327
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,140
Yeah, part of it, but a more minor percentage.

328
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,020
So especially at Chuck E. Cheese, it was like,

329
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,660
you're going to notice an adult man is in there.

330
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
I like to do the rounds at Chuck E. Cheese.

331
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,340
I liked a little show, a little ball pit, a little game.

332
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,460
Eventually, when my family got to the point of like,

333
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,060
okay, we can't eat this food anyway.

334
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,460
This food is not good.

335
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,700
This food is twice as much.

336
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,620
We got into a routine of,

337
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,580
we will go to a much better restaurant first and get pizza.

338
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,580
And then easy 30 to 40 minutes in the comic book store

339
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,460
next to the Chuck E. Cheese.

340
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,900
And then into Chuck E. Cheese,

341
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,140
you each get five or $10 in tokens.

342
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,020
We'll sit at the bar and watch the show in between playing.

343
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,580
And then we will,

344
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,580
then you can turn your tickets in for prizes.

345
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,580
And inevitably you will badger us into just buying a prize

346
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,900
that you don't have enough tickets.

347
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,820
You have half the tickets

348
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,020
and then they will assuredly let you pay cash

349
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,860
for the other.

350
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,700
Right, right.

351
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,380
This is, yeah, this is not, did I,

352
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,780
I always wanted like a month, like a little PVC

353
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,900
or like a munch little statue or something.

354
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,380
And I never had enough tickets for an,

355
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,820
my memory is it's like this big.

356
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,460
It's like a thousand tickets.

357
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,140
For a tiny little, for a three inch guy.

358
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,980
Yeah, right.

359
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,500
Somehow that's the ultimate dream.

360
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Something that retail price is $7 probably.

361
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Less probably.

362
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,980
I, well, okay.

363
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,340
So Jason did not actually go to one of these.

364
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,780
You did, do you remember the circumstances,

365
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,660
Mike, of your discovery zone?

366
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,420
Well, this is, yes, I do.

367
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,220
I went maybe a couple times to,

368
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,900
my memory is like three to five times really.

369
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,300
But the one that stands out is that I got in trouble

370
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,500
at this discovery zone.

371
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,340
Oh no.

372
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,460
We went with my friends and his brother,

373
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,140
my sister and I went and it was like the two moms

374
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,820
and then my sister and I, and then two brothers.

375
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,300
And I don't know if I've mentioned them before

376
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,060
because one of the brothers was my age.

377
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,420
One of them was a couple of years younger

378
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,820
and he was the bad brother.

379
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,500
He was the one who was like shooting BB guns

380
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,980
and like lighting a bottle rocket off in the laundry room.

381
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,820
Oh yes.

382
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,660
So we were in the parking lot.

383
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,460
I think we all drove together.

384
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,900
And all of a sudden the two of those boys

385
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,780
started running in the parking lot.

386
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,140
And my sister and I are children.

387
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,140
So we go, oh, I guess we're running.

388
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,180
So we ran after them in the parking lot.

389
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,020
And oh my goodness, if this isn't a story

390
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,300
that my mother will tell you

391
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,620
if you talk to her for 30 minutes.

392
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,540
That kid started running.

393
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,820
She pulled me aside, my sister aside,

394
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,700
yelled at us so thoroughly, you don't run in a parking lot.

395
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
You could be hit by a car.

396
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
You never do that.

397
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,300
I don't care who, blah, blah, blah, blah.

398
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,420
And then that's all I could think about the whole time

399
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,260
while we were at discovery zone that day

400
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,100
is that I had been bad.

401
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,420
A pit in your stomach.

402
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,260
Yes.

403
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,080
Oh my God.

404
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,420
I had been bad at discovery zone.

405
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,900
I think in some ways this experience

406
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,700
taints my feeling about discovery zone in general.

407
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,540
Wow.

408
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,100
And my voice did not shake because I was about to cry.

409
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,300
It was a dryness issue.

410
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,140
Yeah.

411
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,420
What explains the tears?

412
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,420
What explains those tears welling up in your eyes?

413
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,020
That's moisture.

414
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,860
Ah, yes.

415
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,220
Sometimes we're hearing a lot of drip drop right now

416
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,340
that is a rain that spiked a lot

417
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
and it's not coming from Mike's eyes.

418
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,180
Yes.

419
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,780
If you use that to fall asleep like I do,

420
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,860
pull the car over, switch to doughboys.

421
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,140
There's no.

422
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,060
It's true, a rain free podcast.

423
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,940
ASMR.

424
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,540
It's OK.

425
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Cut as a breaker.

426
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,500
Try to figure something out.

427
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,300
I think we've done it before.

428
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,620
I don't know if it shows up, but we'll see.

429
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,100
All right.

430
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,460
We'll see.

431
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,820
But anyways, oh my God.

432
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,260
So tainted.

433
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,900
I love also that that's a story today because the kids yell,

434
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,220
the kids ran and I yelled at them.

435
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,380
That seems like something that could happen every day.

436
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,580
Of course it does.

437
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,820
This is how good we were as kids.

438
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,300
Is that this is one of the top five

439
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,140
awesomest behaving stories and we'll

440
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,260
be told as if we like stole from a store.

441
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,380
Buying heroin in the dark.

442
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,060
We found a six year old Mike, her eight year old Mike

443
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,380
and a five year old Katie.

444
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,980
How do you think the running was?

445
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:36,100
I think it was like 15, not even by 10 cars, maybe less.

446
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,620
Wow.

447
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,180
Wow.

448
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,820
And I get it.

449
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,260
You're not so guess little kids.

450
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,020
You can't run.

451
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,900
Someone's pulling out.

452
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,420
Of course.

453
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,060
But it's pretty clear why we like these two maniacs

454
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,580
started running.

455
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,660
This one kid, especially, I won't say his last name is Alex.

456
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,940
Be on the lookout for an Alex in your life.

457
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,260
It could be this Alex.

458
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,860
I don't think he's going to listen.

459
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,300
Alex will take you for every penny you're worth

460
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,380
and we know he can run.

461
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,460
So it was clear why we did it.

462
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,420
We weren't doing that normally.

463
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,700
But no, we were punting.

464
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,220
We were yelled at and that felt so devastating to me.

465
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
But yeah.

466
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,420
I remember all mine too.

467
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,220
One was that my sister and I, you

468
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,980
see this a lot with kids and elevators.

469
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,900
Elevator etiquette is something that needs to be learned.

470
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,380
You want to get out of the elevator,

471
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,300
so you just start walking out of the elevator

472
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,700
and maybe you bump right into the people who

473
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,940
are waiting for the elevator.

474
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,540
And this happened one time and it

475
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,100
happened with some kind of harumphy old ladies.

476
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,260
And we just ran on.

477
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,340
We kind of bumped into them maybe.

478
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,020
And then before the elevator doors close,

479
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,460
one of the ladies turns to the other and says,

480
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,100
those are the rudest children I've ever seen in my life.

481
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,260
Which is not a thing to say in front of my mom.

482
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,020
She was so mad.

483
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
I think if there had not been a sound bite,

484
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,500
it never would have come up again.

485
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,380
That's not something you want to hear about your kids.

486
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,340
We'll see where I get.

487
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,420
By the time my son is older, I think I would give a shit.

488
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,940
I think I'd say, hey, don't do that.

489
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,180
And the quote would not be ringing in my head

490
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,220
like it's a Siskel and Hebert movie quote that damns the film.

491
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,500
Yeah.

492
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,380
They also like, OK, maybe you guys broke the social contract.

493
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,620
You're not supposed to run into people, especially older

494
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,340
people.

495
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,980
They're also supposed to shut the fuck up.

496
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,900
They're not supposed to be like these terribly.

497
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,100
You're not supposed to menace strangers, children or adults.

498
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,260
Give a review.

499
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,820
You don't review every but.

500
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,900
Now, these children were mild.

501
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,100
I didn't love them.

502
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,820
But they also didn't bother me.

503
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,900
Two stars for these kids.

504
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
Were they like, were you in Manhattan?

505
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,780
Were they like snooty old rich people from a movie?

506
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,460
That's how it felt.

507
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,580
It felt like Looney Tunes kind of.

508
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,820
It felt like they felt like the kind of old ladies who would

509
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,620
rightfully be bothered by the characters that we're rooting for,

510
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,060
which is how I feel about my sister and I in that scenario.

511
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,900
We were the fun characters.

512
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,300
Yeah.

513
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,620
Briefly running.

514
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,860
That's right.

515
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,820
And yeah, there you did.

516
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,940
You touch their mink stalls or something like what was it

517
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,780
that they got so upset?

518
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,940
Oh, I should have mentioned.

519
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,020
Yes, that I caught on to one of their stalls.

520
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,500
And kept running with it.

521
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,180
And it spun them around and around as if they were on a turntable.

522
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,180
And by the end, they were fully naked and had to cover themselves and go,

523
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
oh, I never.

524
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,500
And all of their pearls like rearrange.

525
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,260
Uh huh.

526
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,820
They seem justified then in their response.

527
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
I should have.

528
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,460
I guess I didn't tell the whole story.

529
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,660
It's important to be honest.

530
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,980
What did your mom say to you then when the ladies were out of your shot?

531
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,860
I don't remember that.

532
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,700
I think it was just did you hear that?

533
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,180
Did you hear what you said about you?

534
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
Clipped like that.

535
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,220
Uh huh.

536
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,100
But is that weird that how bad like other kids, I think, would have just a mountain

537
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,420
of these and we have like five and scarring to this.

538
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,820
Right.

539
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,700
And my mom still thinks they're as bad as they were.

540
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,900
That's what's interesting to me.

541
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,660
Wasn't kids being kids?

542
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,420
No, I have the lowest stakes version of that.

543
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,060
But thankfully, my parents are like, don't just ignore.

544
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,500
Don't do not be bothered by this.

545
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,100
And it was, you know, I my aunts and uncles were all pretty chill.

546
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,620
And so we got in the habit of just calling them by their first name, like Jimmy, Johnny.

547
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,420
You know, we didn't say on her uncle before it if we were directly addressing them.

548
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,500
My aunt Dolly, who was, I think, my grandmother's sister.

549
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,860
So a great aunt.

550
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,140
I said, hi, Dolly.

551
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,780
How are you doing at a party at like a family barbecue?

552
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,260
And she went.

553
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,220
And I said, Aunt Dolly, I am your great aunt.

554
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,620
And everyone's like blood chilled because everyone was also like, what are you?

555
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,940
What are you doing?

556
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,340
Like you are.

557
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,540
You are very old, granted.

558
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,220
And but there's a nice way to say that to an eight year old.

559
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,980
Like and my family was like, don't mind her.

560
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,940
She is very old and powered by hate.

561
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,580
Like this is all I have.

562
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,700
Yeah.

563
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Had you called her Dolly before?

564
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,060
I have no recollection.

565
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,180
I think I avoided talking to her before.

566
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
I was trying to be friendly.

567
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,740
Right, right.

568
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,700
You were like, I'm in a dog.

569
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,740
I'm getting older now.

570
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,500
And I crossed this member of the greatest generation.

571
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,100
Wow.

572
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,940
I have earned this title.

573
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,420
Great.

574
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,140
So highest rank of aunt there is.

575
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,540
It is a story we tell, but it's a funny story.

576
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,860
Yeah.

577
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,700
It's like that was really weird.

578
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,020
Right.

579
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,780
So what we've determined is that this place is a place of sour.

580
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,260
Yes, I don't have a good feeling about it.

581
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,020
I don't really either.

582
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,620
Mine is kind of not.

583
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,780
I don't have a story about it in particular other than it was OK.

584
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,740
Full context, it was at the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills, California, which is still

585
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,900
home to a Chuck E. Cheese with a full munch.

586
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,860
Listeners, if you're looking for a full munch, go to the Fallbrook Mall.

587
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,060
Still there.

588
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,820
And I think these things were concurrent.

589
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,540
So a place with the Chuck E. Cheese and a Discovery Zone.

590
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,020
Amazing.

591
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,220
And I think we didn't.

592
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,020
Although maybe they weren't.

593
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,900
I might not have had a Chuck E. Cheese that close to me.

594
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
So this was closer.

595
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,140
So it was a big deal.

596
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Basically, my story with it is just the ad that I played at the beginning.

597
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,980
And listener, you could only hear it.

598
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,700
But if you could visualize every type of play equipment in the world,

599
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,220
foam that looks so huggable, like seems like it'd be a delight.

600
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,260
Texturally, the brightest colors.

601
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,300
This place was so aggressive color wise.

602
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,460
It's just primaries, red, yellow, green, kind of don't super go together.

603
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,780
No, it's a real clashy place, but they gave it an aesthetic.

604
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,020
It's kind of like a box of primary color crayon aesthetic.

605
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,860
And of course, the ad is also like we spin the camera around.

606
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,340
And it's selling what should.

607
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,260
I think it's selling what the equivalent for me now of

608
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,100
do you want to spend three and a half hours in beautiful Pandora?

609
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
Do you want to be transported?

610
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,540
You can go not that far from where you live and be transported into another universe.

611
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,460
And when it's done, you're going to want to stay there.

612
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,140
You know, which you could keep being in there.

613
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,100
That's what I thought the Discovery Zone was at the time.

614
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,220
And I went and I just kind of like got tired.

615
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,060
There were a lot of elbows flying.

616
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,580
Oh, it was a little annoying.

617
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,100
And my parents clearly did not like it one bit.

618
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
So it kind of maybe I brought up one more day.

619
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,580
We haven't been to that Discovery Zone in a while and their vibe was so bad on it.

620
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,940
And again, good boy.

621
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,980
I'll go along with this.

622
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,300
Right.

623
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,380
I didn't like it enough to if they were insistent, I would have gone back.

624
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,780
Sure.

625
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,420
Anytime.

626
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,460
But I had to be the driver and I wasn't the driver.

627
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,860
Right.

628
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,340
I don't know.

629
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,300
Underwhelm me, I guess.

630
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah, I don't want this to be so negative of an episode.

631
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,100
But certainly not.

632
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,460
What was the history of Leaps and Bounds?

633
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,580
I liked better.

634
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,940
Did you have Leaps and Bounds out here?

635
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,620
I know they changed and I was there.

636
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,780
Some fascinating facts about it that I learned today.

637
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,340
I've I had never heard the phrase Leaps and Bounds until researching this episode.

638
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah, I was completely unfamiliar with Leaps and Bounds.

639
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,860
Yes, Leaps and Bounds was the one at least by us was bigger and better.

640
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,900
And I had like a fifth grade, not my party, but a fifth grade birthday.

641
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,220
I'm sure I've talked about, which is maybe my favorite thing I'd ever experienced.

642
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,460
Just playing around and running around that place.

643
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,340
That was really fun.

644
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,140
I don't know what I can't articulate what the difference was.

645
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,300
It felt like it was bigger, more expansive maybe than a DZ.

646
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,580
Was it more about the long tubes?

647
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,260
It seemed pretty tubby.

648
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,060
It's pretty tubby.

649
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,140
And I like the aesthetic more because it's sort of more in that zone of like

650
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,900
the Memphis style Taco Bells with the turquoise and the purple.

651
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,020
Yes, it was.

652
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,940
It's a color scheme I more want to run around today than the strong red of Discovery Zone.

653
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,420
Yeah.

654
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,020
Well, and the connection too.

655
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
I mean, it was started by McDonald's.

656
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,940
I'm so excited by this connection that I didn't know.

657
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,660
You didn't know this.

658
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,300
I didn't know.

659
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,260
I didn't know it either.

660
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,820
They were the ones who made the McDonald's Play Place.

661
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,620
Yes.

662
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,740
And they're like they set the standard for like the tube based play place.

663
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,860
Sly tube based entertainment.

664
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,740
That started with Leaps and Bounds of McDonald's in what?

665
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,780
87 is when the Play Place, I think the first Play Place went in.

666
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,900
Was it not till 87?

667
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,780
There was something around there.

668
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,260
So we grew up right in front.

669
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,540
They were all new even.

670
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,940
Yes.

671
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,500
Yes.

672
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,140
That's interesting.

673
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,940
But then there were like playgrounds, right?

674
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,140
Because those characters exactly.

675
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,980
I've seen ads from the 70s for those.

676
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,860
That's different.

677
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,340
The actual like tube stuff, not the like Officer Big Mac jail, I believe.

678
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,220
I think that stuff is older.

679
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,780
Yeah, the transition to the plasticky bubbly tubes and all.

680
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,260
Yeah.

681
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,900
That was in the way that all the McDonald's now are kind of being stripped of personality,

682
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,900
a lot of dark colors and metal and very modern.

683
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,180
Very sad.

684
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,460
A lot of them were redone to add the Play Place.

685
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,580
Play Places just started showing up in my memory.

686
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,700
And this is also the rise of like Happy Meal toys really starting to cook.

687
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,200
And heap.

688
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,140
They had them for a while.

689
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,460
But the Disney, the Disney agreement.

690
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,500
Characters you know, you feel like you're participating in the movie that you're excited about.

691
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,220
No, for sure.

692
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,940
Well, let's do history a little bit.

693
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,420
It'll lead us to some leaps and bounds.

694
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:56,660
So founded in 1989 is what I saw.

695
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,300
Three founders.

696
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,740
There was like a kind of a lot of sportsy people.

697
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,340
So I'm Ronald Match, somebody named Dr. David Schoenstadt,

698
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,060
who was the owner of the Kansas City Comets, which is an indoor soccer team.

699
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,660
And it all founded in Kansas, by the way.

700
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,660
And then a guy named Jim Jorgensen.

701
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,540
This is the guy.

702
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,780
Jim Jorgensen, yeah, I think maybe he's a light guy.

703
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,180
I think it's at least guy light.

704
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,340
We'd have to determine a little more.

705
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,780
But I say this because he has a Wikipedia with a list of the many, many businesses he started.

706
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,460
Referred to as a serial entrepreneur on Wikipedia.

707
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,140
I think serial entrepreneur might be a key phrase of any guy.

708
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,380
I agree.

709
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,340
That might be our way to keep finding more guys.

710
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,940
I think that's a good start.

711
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,180
Is there, I couldn't pull it and I couldn't search it.

712
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,180
There's an architectural Jorgensen that comes up a lot too.

713
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,660
With a similar name, like was involved with City Walk.

714
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,740
Who am I thinking of?

715
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,300
Well, City Walk is John Jurdy is the guy.

716
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
That's the guy.

717
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,740
Okay.

718
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,500
And it's just the name sounded close.

719
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,180
Jorgensen just probably sounds familiar because you've probably heard it

720
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,220
in a number of like improv scenes or sketches over the years.

721
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,140
I mean, it's a very funny name.

722
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,260
Jorgensen, get in.

723
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,260
Now Jorgensen.

724
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,180
Yeah, I know because Michael Jorgensen plays keyboards in Wilco.

725
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,460
Oh, there are real Jorgensen's out there.

726
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,500
I don't know if it's the same spelling.

727
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,700
I'm doing good work.

728
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,620
But this guy was Billy Jean King's business partner.

729
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,980
There's a lot of ventures of Billy Jean King, who was in fact an investor.

730
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,500
An investor in Discovery Zone.

731
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,460
That is so funny.

732
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,340
This guy reads, if you read all the stuff he created, whatever it was a part of,

733
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,140
it reads like a fake list of stuff you've never heard of.

734
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,700
Yeah.

735
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,820
And it's really great.

736
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,180
Yeah. What do you got?

737
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,180
I mean, there's one I really like, but some of the newer ones, he runs something called,

738
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,260
hold on, let me scroll and get it.

739
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,980
True Artists, which is the largest international organization of certified tattoo artists.

740
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,580
All right.

741
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,060
Fair enough.

742
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,620
We had to put all the tattoo artists in one place.

743
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,060
They all been running around willy-nilly.

744
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,940
We gotta organize it.

745
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,780
They run the annual tattoo awards.

746
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,980
I know nothing else about it and I don't have tattoos, but I demand that we host the tattoo awards.

747
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,260
I believe we should do that.

748
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,780
They scare me.

749
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,500
They scare me.

750
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,260
They thought of getting one.

751
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,760
Yeah.

752
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,940
It's scary and I'll get sick and I'll throw up.

753
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
It adds up with everything else we know about.

754
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,220
Western equity, all-American indoor sports, a chain of indoor sports malls.

755
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,100
The company built indoor sports malls in the Midwest.

756
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,340
That's a Kansas business.

757
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,540
There still is one.

758
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,820
Yeah. Some of them are around.

759
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,700
Some of them are not.

760
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,340
Women's sport magazine, Soviet Union national team, an entry in world team tennis in 1977.

761
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,660
My favorite one.

762
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,780
Do you know, did you look at this list?

763
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,380
Yeah, I'm sure I'm staring at things.

764
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,340
Is that the same one?

765
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,300
We're excited about this.

766
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,860
Yeah.

767
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,740
Ronnie's ranch.

768
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,620
Ronnie's ranch.

769
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,500
This is where I thought, God, maybe it's a guy.

770
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,780
You open Ronnie's ranch.

771
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,340
Ronnie's ranch.

772
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,700
The details of Ronnie's ranch.

773
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,620
Jason, do you know what Ronnie's ranch is?

774
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,860
I read this list really fast and then got upset with the VHS tapes.

775
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,580
You would have said it at the start of the episode if you knew what it was.

776
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,380
It's a restaurant in Los Angeles.

777
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,180
It was co-founded by this guy and Ronnie Burns, son of George Burns and Gracie Allen.

778
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,820
You mean I could go to a restaurant conjured up by Ronnie Burns?

779
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,100
The Ronnie Burns.

780
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,860
He was an actor as well.

781
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,980
I am blindsided because I'm like, there's no way it's Ronnie James Dio.

782
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,620
I wish.

783
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,140
You'd have to go Dio's place.

784
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,820
I use the first name.

785
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,500
Ronnie's ranch.

786
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,620
Could you find a picture of it?

787
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,260
No, no, no further information.

788
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,380
Only on Wikipedia.

789
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,540
Right.

790
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,140
This is the only place I could find it.

791
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,540
Yeah.

792
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,820
So devastating that.

793
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,980
Desperate to find Ronnie's ranch.

794
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,700
Also very frustrating because this place was listed as the last of three different

795
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,980
restaurants that Jorgensen tried over the years, all of which failed.

796
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,140
So where are the other ones?

797
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,420
They were in the list.

798
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,620
I need to know.

799
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,140
Was it other sons?

800
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,020
What other son?

801
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,380
Imogene Coca's son.

802
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,220
Billie Jean King's racket restaurant.

803
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,140
The big racket.

804
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,660
They serve everything on rackets.

805
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,160
Yeah.

806
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,340
Where was it?

807
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,980
Floreto on rackets.

808
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,020
I'll throw this out there.

809
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:39,380
I feel like finding restaurant stuff is often not preserved unless it has a real

810
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,460
diehard fan that is scan stuff.

811
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,220
Well, especially the old restaurants.

812
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,660
Old restaurants like stuff that's not around anymore, especially stuff that's more recent.

813
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,940
Like, you know, let's say a, a Bennigan's or a ground round.

814
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,380
You see that stuff on eBay.

815
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:53,880
Sure.

816
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,460
Womp hoppers.

817
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,460
But there's not a lot.

818
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,020
That's recent.

819
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,420
You're right.

820
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,380
It's kind of a, it is a black hole a little bit in terms of, in terms of pre internet

821
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,180
preservation.

822
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,340
Yeah.

823
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,780
Unless you loved the restaurant.

824
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,300
List of like every combination I tried, list of former discovery zone locations.

825
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,860
Cause it did not get up to like 300.

826
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,340
It's almost.

827
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,700
We got so many.

828
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,620
This was a massive chat.

829
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:21,860
Yeah.

830
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:29,860
The maybe the kind of exciting stat to say is it went from one store in 1990 to,

831
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,180
yeah, I saw a lot of 300.

832
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,260
I don't know if this is, I saw somewhere it said almost 500, whatever it was massive

833
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,620
within five years.

834
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,740
And then all dead again by 2001.

835
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,060
Yeah.

836
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,740
We're talking United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

837
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,620
There was a video I watched that was pretty good on the business side.

838
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,420
It's the channel is called company insight.

839
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:00,340
And they had like, here are all the business bad business decisions, like why this fell

840
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,660
behind, why this expanded way too fast to begin with.

841
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,780
And then here's all the stuff, Chuck E cheese did that kept them in the game and all the

842
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,580
stuff that like a discovery zone absolutely did not do.

843
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,060
Huh?

844
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,620
Huh?

845
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,100
Interesting.

846
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:22,020
So I guess they feel so similar and it feels like sort of cheap in its construction.

847
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,380
But I, yeah, I think just like the bit of the management fast.

848
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,620
Yeah.

849
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
That's what I was saying earlier.

850
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,140
This guy, I will say, this is one of those guys where like, I do feel like we could write

851
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,700
up a one page on our, we were pitching on last year, a podcast, hard rock cafe idea

852
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,380
where it's a podcast.

853
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,180
It's all the podcasts like a podcast restaurant.

854
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,620
This is a guy who would bite.

855
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:45,940
Yeah.

856
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,700
I think he would go, yeah, you know what?

857
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,500
You're right.

858
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,100
The only thing you'd maybe have to make, well, you don't want to undersell it.

859
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,940
You just might have to like be aware of the possibility that we're going to have to change

860
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,740
out these menu items a lot as different podcasters get canceled.

861
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,740
But as long as you're like, as long as we can just keep reprinting, just don't like,

862
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,100
you know, set it in stone.

863
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,940
Don't make the menus very expensive.

864
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,340
Yeah.

865
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,060
Cheap lamination because we're gonna have to slide those in and out.

866
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,540
Very good.

867
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,660
Very good point.

868
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,780
But I think this is a guy to send a proposal to.

869
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,180
Our fine.

870
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,580
Yeah.

871
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,460
Jorgensen getting here.

872
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,540
He does not mind having a business startup and flame out in six months.

873
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:21,860
Yeah.

874
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,300
That's, this is what we want.

875
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,500
The thrill of the chase.

876
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,860
Why else do you get in the Ronnie Burns business?

877
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,460
You're in the Ronnie Burns business.

878
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,060
Ronnie's ranch.

879
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,860
I know.

880
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,020
Ronnie's ranch in Los Angeles.

881
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,660
Where was it?

882
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,700
I don't know.

883
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
There's no other info.

884
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,900
That's a great point because there was plenty of Discovery Zones in Las Vegas.

885
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,060
Right.

886
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,700
Was Ronnie's ranch turned into a Discovery Zone?

887
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,020
Yeah.

888
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,300
I don't know.

889
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,060
You know what was a Discovery Zone was is the Burbank Chuck E. Cheese.

890
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,620
Oh, yeah.

891
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:51,940
Yeah.

892
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,780
And us was a Discovery Zone.

893
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,460
It's, it's hard to tell what.

894
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,940
A lot of them just become like sporting good stores.

895
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,580
Yeah.

896
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,300
Gyms or there's an interesting history to a couple of them, but I'll save that.

897
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,060
So starts as one thing, right?

898
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,740
And it's these, it's these kind of sports oriented people mostly who are observing

899
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,740
that children are in bad shape and a lot of them can't do very basic athletics.

900
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,420
Probably looking at some young Scott, Mike's and Jason's out there.

901
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,740
We got to do, we got to do something about this.

902
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:35,380
So, you know, sort of a fun kids gym and it starts in Lenexa, Kansas in 1989,

903
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,420
which incidentally is the town that Paul Rudd grew up in.

904
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,900
Oh, wow.

905
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,420
Young Paul Rudd moved there when in age, age 10.

906
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,140
Other interesting fact about Paul Rudd's Kansas years,

907
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,780
he then was in a city called Overland Park where he worked as a ham glazer.

908
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,380
Oh, Jason.

909
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,260
Oh, I like that for a honey baked ham or just a home grown ham place.

910
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,020
I might've been a more indie.

911
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,520
Okay.

912
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,540
You know, you get less of the prestige than working at a honey baked ham.

913
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,020
You get a lot more hands on experience, a lot sooner.

914
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,700
Jason, have you ever glazed a ham?

915
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,940
I mean, I've opened up the oven with a spoon.

916
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,380
Sounds like a no. Moving on.

917
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,740
No, you're not letting me finish.

918
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,020
I've opened up the oven and scooped the juices on top of the ham.

919
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,140
That's how you glaze a ham.

920
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,020
Is that all it is?

921
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,820
I think so.

922
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,460
I mean, if you're making it at home, like we weren't making hams from raw meat and stuff,

923
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,300
but you brought a honey baked ham.

924
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,700
So that's where-

925
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,820
Or a turkey, you just baste it. You just keep doing that.

926
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,180
So glazing is basting?

927
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,540
I think reasonably close to basting.

928
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,260
Don't quote me. I'm sure we have some great cooks in the audience

929
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,660
who can delineate this a little better than I can.

930
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,980
This is a tough area. I got the wrong-

931
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:50,260
I was trying to, early in pandemic, say what the ingredients were for a Carthay Manhattan,

932
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
and I had the one type of bitters and like-

933
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,700
This is different, but it's the same.

934
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,500
Immediately somebody pounced on me like, no, raw, no, no, no, wrong flavor profile.

935
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,740
Well, I will admit I know nothing about this.

936
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,420
But I don't mean to say that about you. You might be right on the money with your glazing.

937
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,300
It might be more DIY home cook, you know, kind of thing.

938
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,540
Let us know if Jason has glazed. From that description,

939
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,260
if you're a listener and you've glazed, if you're more of a pro glazer, let us know.

940
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,580
Was that a glaze? Did Jason glaze?

941
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,340
Hashtag did Jason glaze?

942
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,860
I mean, look, if you're buying a honey baked ham, a lot of the work is already done for you.

943
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,460
You're probably warming that bad boy.

944
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,460
Where maybe you're just taking it-

945
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,500
That's why I expect they glaze it before if it's a honey baked ham.

946
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,740
Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, it's got the sugar on the end.

947
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,140
That's got the brown sugar crisp on the outside.

948
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,900
That's already set. It's already made.

949
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,220
I'm going to say also that I looked it up. It's the honey- I'm sorry, the Holiday Ham Company

950
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,260
in Overland Park, Kansas, original.

951
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:55,380
I like that Paul Rudd's story involves studying drama at the British American Drama Academy

952
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,180
in Oxford and then soon after being at the Holiday Ham Company in Overland Park.

953
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,540
The Holiday Ham Company.

954
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,100
Now he's Ant-Man. What a journey.

955
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:12,180
So in Paul Rudd's backyard, it starts as one thing, but it booms because I think there is

956
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,500
an appetite for stuff like this because concurrent with the rise of Discovery Zone and them adding

957
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,740
locations is the rise of Leaps and Bounds and Leaps and Bounds is a McDonald's company.

958
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:32,420
That is a McDonald's subsect and I watched a video from the Bankrupt series by Bright

959
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,620
Sun Films, which is great.

960
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,020
Yeah.

961
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,220
And the implication there is that McDonald's is kind of like, well, let's do this Discovery

962
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,460
Zone thing. Who knows if that's correct, but maybe they were trying to like, they at least

963
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,900
had their eye on each other certainly and were competition and Mike, you preferred Leaps and

964
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:56,660
Bounds, but something about it didn't work out as well and soon enough Leaps and Bounds is dead.

965
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:56,980
Yeah.

966
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:03,460
And all the locations become Discovery Zones. This is a great little game of Thrones.

967
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,820
There's a couple more stages of this to come where the companies kind of-

968
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,140
Because McDonald's-

969
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,940
Conquer each other.

970
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,980
Yeah. McDonald's sells basically, right?

971
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,060
They sell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

972
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:21,140
And they end up with a huge investment in Discovery Zone. So this is a big Discovery Zone win. They

973
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,780
have more capital. They have more locations. They vanquished an opponent right away.

974
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,940
Serious XM radio versus Serious radio or XM was just like, okay, you're doing better.

975
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,100
I was like, well, they merged.

976
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,540
Yeah, they merged because it felt like XM wasn't doing as well.

977
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,780
And similarly like, you know, and Chuck E Cheese is all part of this. And we know that's the story

978
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,620
of Chuck E Cheese versus-

979
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,100
Chobis.

980
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,660
Rockaf- wait, what's the Rockafire rest? Chobis.

981
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,540
Chobis Pizza.

982
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,260
Chobis Pizza.

983
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,900
And then yeah, versus Pizza Time Theater.

984
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,380
Right.

985
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,780
Not all of which were Chuck E Cheese Pizza Time Theater.

986
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,260
Right.

987
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,500
This entire industry. And then when you get to the end of the Discovery Zone story.

988
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:06,260
So 45 Leaps and Bounds become Discovery Zone. They got 10- McDonald's has 10% of Discovery Zone

989
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,940
now. Things are going great. Lots of expansion. And then they meet the company that really takes

990
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,180
them to the next level and the company to tie in with if you've got your eyes on the future.

991
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,500
That's right.

992
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,300
Blockbuster.

993
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,980
Unbelievable when this came into play. I couldn't believe-

994
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,380
I didn't know that.

995
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:29,460
And then the other thing I did know at one point in time, I just blanked it out that Blockbuster

996
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,860
at the time, a division of Viacom.

997
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:39,460
Yes. Well, and I'm confused by this timeline a little bit because I think maybe the Blockbuster

998
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,660
interaction, I think maybe the Blockbuster investment with Discovery Zone is right before

999
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,900
Viacom. I also forgot how all these companies came together.

1000
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:57,940
That Viacom merges with Blockbuster. Huge deal. And then they set out together to buy Paramount.

1001
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,140
I forgot why Paramount is a Viacom.

1002
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:07,860
This is relatively recent. They're all in the mid-90s. So this all converges

1003
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,940
and it fills a niche for Blockbuster because they have been wanting to do

1004
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:24,500
this kind of big experiential arcade types of places. They have had their eyes on this anyway.

1005
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,780
This is where I stumble into the chain, the briefly existing chain called Blockparty.

1006
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,980
Are you guys aware of Blockparty?

1007
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,020
I did not know anything about this.

1008
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,220
I think this is their, what we would say now is it Dave and Busters?

1009
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,620
Yes.

1010
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:47,380
I think there are some videos on this online that I've kind of carefully gone through. I've

1011
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:54,180
watched really quickly, but I don't remember the specifics. It seems like they were trying to do it

1012
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,100
a lot. There's a big thing of this area, I guess, a lot of places. I mean, it's all sort of right

1013
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,380
before Disney Quest. This is clearly an area people thought was going to open up and it did

1014
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:12,100
not really open up. But there's a really good review. This is its own thing, but the channel

1015
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,860
Review Time did a great video about Blockparty. So it's more adult oriented. It's kind of like

1016
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,740
Disney Quest. They made two of them. It wasn't hypothetical. There was one in Albuquerque and

1017
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:28,740
there was one in Indianapolis. These bizarre, that they're Blockbuster theme, Blockbuster Blockparty,

1018
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,620
but then they're also video game oriented. And like, there's like a here, the restaurant part is

1019
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:40,340
like you're in a giant pinball machine. They seem, oh, and it's a Blockparty. So it's meant to be

1020
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,700
like that you're having a big outdoor Blockparty, but with a roof over your heads, but we want to

1021
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,700
make it feel like it's outdoors. So we're going to pipe in, in addition to very loud music, loud

1022
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,460
street sounds and like sirens going by. Oh, so hell. So like the level of hell.

1023
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:04,580
All the things we try to block out on this podcast when the garage door is open, they're like,

1024
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:11,380
we want it. This is part of Blockparty. Part of it. Indianapolis location open until 2002.

1025
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,060
That's wild. That is really crazy. You know about this before this? No, no. Maybe I passed by that

1026
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:24,820
video. And I was aware of the efforts to make a Blockbuster entire theme park. Right. So in

1027
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,380
Indiana, I believe, which if there's any infer the struggle with some of these to turn them into

1028
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,580
episodes, is there enough information to go off of? Right. But God, if there is, I would, I am

1029
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:42,100
fascinated by why Blockbuster of all places is trying to go into that sector. It might be a

1030
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:49,060
Blockbuster catch all, but not movies. No video stores have just all of the way when they were

1031
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:55,140
mad with power and mad with money. Yeah. Like there was, you know, West Coast video, video update,

1032
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:01,380
you know, there were, there were RC colas to this Coca-Cola, but I really can't think of,

1033
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:08,260
I guess Hollywood video eventually was kind of like a Pepsi. They were big number two. Yeah.

1034
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,580
But I don't think they tried to do anything but video store. Right. No, that's the insane thing.

1035
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,380
Like you're looking at concept art of a big outdoor Blockbuster theme park where there's a huge

1036
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,900
blimp with the Blockbuster logo going by. Who would like that? Blockbuster is like a place you

1037
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,620
have to go. I shut up the kids today. Let's rent something. Yeah. Go rent the page master.

1038
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,340
Whoa, I'm in Blockbuster land. As inconvenient as it was convenient. Cause you're like, oh God,

1039
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,740
it's Friday night. Is it going to be crowded? Is all the good stuff going to be taken?

1040
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,420
Yeah. We never went to Blockbuster. Yeah. We always went to the other stores. It's across

1041
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:48,020
the highway from the pizza place. And when I say highway, I mean a two lane road. That's 45 miles

1042
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:53,860
per hour as opposed to 35 miles per hour. That's right. Yeah. No, we never went. We would go to

1043
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:00,900
new wave video. We would go to a family video. Yeah. No way. Yeah. Or far more rented than the

1044
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:07,060
NES cassettes. No annoying. Yeah. Why would you want to go be in Blockbuster land? Anyway,

1045
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:13,060
I so weird. I think the impetus of it and the impetus that why discovery zone quote on, you

1046
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,540
know, we're well before the child obesity panic, you know, we're, we're well before that, but I'm

1047
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:26,580
remembering now a lot of emphasis when we were kids about like, well, it can't be couch potatoes,

1048
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,780
this television and these new video games like they need to get outside and play.

1049
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:37,620
And you remember this in your home. Yes. I remember my home, the local news, the local

1050
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:43,700
newspaper. Like this was the biggest threat. Yeah. This was the biggest threat. Because Nintendo

1051
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,900
was fairly new that we all have that there's this very engaging thing in our house and there's never

1052
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:56,180
been more like solid entertainment just pumped in front of us. And now there's VHA. Yeah. It makes

1053
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,620
sense why these things go together. Yeah. Was it correct? I don't know. I don't think so. Yeah. At

1054
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,340
least we can get them out of the house. There's something for the whole family. It's communal

1055
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,940
and there's food so we don't have to cook, you know. DZ though, I think DZ went wrong because

1056
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,620
it doesn't have as much like, I take this, I say this and I'm wrong, but a parents could at least

1057
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:22,820
in talk, Chuck E. Cheese enjoy a robot show. Yes. You could find some amusement in that even if you

1058
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:30,420
aren't weird irony hounds like us. Right. And also beer and wine. And this was not part of

1059
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:37,300
Discovery Zone probably due to the, you know, their health kick because we're about working out and

1060
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,820
so we're not going to have beer and wine. And now we are going to have still horrible pizza, still

1061
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:48,580
the worst pizza you could ever imagine. But then also like we have adult items like quiches.

1062
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:58,020
All right, mom, you're set. Eat your quiche. My mom loved quiche. Yeah, that's true. There's

1063
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,500
no doubt about that. They all love quiches, but you're going to the doctor if you're eating the

1064
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:09,780
Discovery Zone quiche. If you're not even all the way through one Discovery Zone quiche. You

1065
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,660
will negate whatever good thing you did by running around the Discovery Zone by eating a Discovery

1066
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,940
Zone quiche. Yeah, I know. If your mom had known there were quiches inside, she would have been

1067
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:26,900
running too. Yeah, that's a very good point. That's true. Very good point. I know grainy VHS footage

1068
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:33,780
lazily uploaded to YouTube like with a million layers of static is not the best way to immerse

1069
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,860
yourself like in what it was really like to be there. But watching all this back, I am like

1070
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:50,740
the DZ Diner, which that's what they call the snack bar. The DZ Diner looked rough. And I got to say

1071
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:56,500
equally rough. Some of these arcades were shit. Like some of these arcades were bad.

1072
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,340
This is what's weird. It's just like percentages. Like it is all the stuff Chuck E. Cheese had, but

1073
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,860
less robots, although not entirely. We'll get to that. But still arcades. It's like everything. But

1074
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,660
then kind of less of some of the good stuff. Right. Yes. So they are arcades. But what's

1075
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:21,460
shitty about the arcade? You just all remember. Just very few machines kind of all over the place

1076
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:29,220
in terms of timeline wise that more business focused YouTube channel emphasize like well,

1077
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,420
Chuck E. Cheese has had their ups and downs, but they've tried to stay current with the times. They

1078
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:42,420
update the machines a lot. They update the tick. They went from ticketing to like swipe cards and

1079
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:48,740
discovery zone. Just they, they went all in on lots of locations at the top, but they didn't keep

1080
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,540
them up to date. Okay. Yeah. There was, it was not as much variety. And then there was not,

1081
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,220
this is what I was the insight from the YouTube channel company insights of the video. I watched.

1082
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,620
That's the one. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Right. Yeah. Yes. It was like Chuck E.

1083
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,420
Cheese. And I do remember this. I do think this is true. You go to Chuck E. Cheese and go,

1084
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,780
I wonder what new arcade game they're going to have. Like there was a selling point for me as a kid.

1085
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,340
It's a possibility of new, which discovery zone is sort of, I think this factured into me,

1086
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,980
not really liking it as a kid. You feel like you went and then you did it. Right. So how do we

1087
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:29,620
keep a turnover and keep adding stuff so that it is different now, which might kind of tie into

1088
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:36,820
the next block of history in my mind, which is so yeah, it becomes part of this Viacom blockbuster

1089
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,500
entity. And as soon as you enter into that, it's this thing that we've seen a thousand times,

1090
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,060
which is, well, now you have to grow and grow and grow and probably everything we're saying is an

1091
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,980
issue. Why are people going back to discovery zone? If they've already done it, they've already been

1092
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:58,260
on the foam pyramid or whatever. And the answer starts to become, well, now we've got it's Viacom

1093
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,620
and block, or I'm sorry, and Paramount and these properties, we can put the properties into

1094
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,420
discovery zone. And this is stuff that I didn't know about. I always, I thought it was only just

1095
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:14,260
generic run around places. I didn't know that there were tie-ins and I was pretty delighted to

1096
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:20,100
discover the tie-ins, which you mainly discover via like halves of commercials, like the first 15

1097
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:25,380
seconds are general discovery zone. And then like now, you know, we got this and this. First one I

1098
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:33,700
saw Fred Flintstone, the rarest bird of a Fred Flintstone tie-in to a physical place for kids.

1099
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:40,340
Right. But I was very exciting to hear Fred Flintstone singing the song. They made custom

1100
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:47,220
animation for it. Hey, bond, we gotta go to DZ where kids wanna be. Yeah. But never do.

1101
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,940
And he does that at the end, like the two phrases tie together. So this, you got Fred Flintstone

1102
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:01,220
stuff going on. The one in the list that's like, well, this might have been good. This may, if I

1103
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:09,300
was too old by then, but if I was the right age when this happened, an MIB laser tag zone. Oh man.

1104
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,700
So they did expand into laser tag. I don't think all of them had the room for it, but there were

1105
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:22,740
laser tag arenas. And when I say MIB, I of course mean the animated series. So yeah, you're busting

1106
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:29,940
aliens with maybe the characters from the movie. It is. Jay and Kate, Scott. This is my time to

1107
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,860
shine. Yeah, okay. It's time to talk about some of the tie-ins to the most forgettable cartoons

1108
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:42,420
of the mid to late nineties. All right, black suits coming. Well, put that aside because we

1109
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:49,060
need to talk about Godzilla laser adventure. Oh yeah. Oh no. I'm where I was very excited

1110
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:55,380
because again, you hear that and you go, Oh, a Godzilla thing. I could see that. Oh wait,

1111
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:01,380
but then it would have to be that's Godzilla 98, the movie. Oh wait, no, it would have to be.

1112
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:10,660
Yeah, no, it was the very forgettable Godzilla animated series movie tie-in, but not,

1113
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:18,100
which again, I watched most of, if it was in the Fox kids block or the WB kids block, I was watching

1114
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:25,300
it. Sometimes I was watching the one channel and taping the other. And your mom wanted you to get

1115
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,900
out. I watched all of it, like the men in black animated show. It sounds like that was good.

1116
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,260
By the way, it was pretty good. There were some really great animators where he had some cool

1117
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:40,340
cartoonists and it kind of like expanded the universe. Although I consulted with the friend

1118
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,740
of the show, Andrew Grissom on this point. He seemed to be pretty into that one. I think he

1119
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:49,860
tolerated Godzilla, the animated series, but I don't know that anyone tolerated the mask,

1120
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:59,060
the animated series. That too. Yeah, that was, uh, that's very annoying. Yeah. That, that, that,

1121
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:04,740
that voice is a rough people trying to be Jim Carrey. I mean, how many things went wrong?

1122
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:12,180
All, I mean, literally all three of the big initial Jim Carrey properties, they tried to turn into

1123
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,300
other things that were just profoundly annoying and don't give you what you want, which is this

1124
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,300
one man, the funniest man, any of us, 10 year olds could possibly imagine. Right. Cause there was an

1125
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,260
animated Ace Ventura. I think so. Oh yeah. Yeah. And dumb and dumber. They did all of them. Pretty

1126
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,780
rough. Uh, this compared to like, again, the earlier, earlier nineties when they had to

1127
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,540
work a little harder for that, like the animated Beetlejuice, I remember liking. Yo, yeah. Yeah.

1128
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:47,300
I remember liking that just fine. But then when they were trying to pump out the animated

1129
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,380
giants where it's like, it kind of doesn't matter. I mean, am I being big hit? Uh, Godzilla, I think

1130
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,780
a reasonable hit, not well received though. No, no. I think it was a disappointment. I was sure it

1131
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,740
was okay on paper, but they were, that's post independence day. They're expecting like

1132
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:11,140
ginormous hit, which it makes me wonder, like, were they already tied into, they, like it must

1133
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,300
have been, the wheels must have been turning already on the animated series because why else

1134
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:21,460
when you have Godzilla as your main character, what makes you have to keep using the character

1135
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:30,500
Dr. Nico Nick Tadopoulos as played by Matthew Broderick, but then Ian Ziering,

1136
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:37,300
Ian Ziering, Ian Ziering in the, uh, in the show or like Vicki Lewis from news radio

1137
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:43,300
is in the movie and then her character is in none of them. None of them do the voices. Right. Dr.

1138
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:49,620
Elsie Chapman, of course in the, and these are not to be confused with the stars of the latter day

1139
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:55,140
Godzilla, but the more recent one, the 2014, which was of course, Lieutenant Ford Brody and then uh,

1140
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:01,860
2019 Dr. Mark Russell and then Kong versus Godzilla, which was Dr. Nathan Lind. Um, so

1141
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:08,580
how do you spell Lind? What's that? How do you spell Lind? Uh, Lind, L-I-N-D. Like Paul. Uh, no,

1142
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,780
Paul Lind is L-Y-N-D-E. Oh, right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, no, unfortunately,

1143
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:21,140
not. So anyway, yeah. Dr. Ted, Dr. Tadopoulos, Dr. Mark Russell, Dr. Nathan Lind, but it's, it's

1144
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:26,260
these we know, we know these and it's important that we only apply the name standard to Avatar.

1145
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:32,500
This is the only film ever made that we will ever hold to the name standard. Yeah. Um,

1146
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:41,060
anyway, um, these tie ins, I, I, I saw a few of these in that there's like a commercial from 1999

1147
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:47,140
and it's much more intense than the older ones. The song is gone. Uh, you get a little peek of

1148
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:54,100
the Godzilla laser adventure. And, uh, I also saw, I think they called it a video wall. Did you,

1149
00:56:54,100 --> 00:57:00,260
it was look like a bunch of TVs and a chain link fence. And if you know, do you, can you picture

1150
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:08,180
what I'm talking about? A few big TVs and a chain link fence. I am very curious if that was a,

1151
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:15,220
I feel like I've seen that I saw that in college for like, um, location art, like gallery video

1152
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:21,460
art. And I'm like, did they do that first or did some corporate dummy make this an aesthetic?

1153
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:29,060
Cause I have very 90s, like nine, like who was the first to do that? Demolition man or something.

1154
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:34,260
Like there's some scene somewhere like a bunch of TVs and a chain link fence. And that was like,

1155
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,860
I feel like when DZ started to make that turn, it was like, Oh no, because they can't ever,

1156
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,540
they can't fully go that way. It's too primary color little kid. You know? Yeah. I mean, that's,

1157
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,900
but that's, everything's going extreme. While cherry Pepsi's can is going wild. It's going nuts.

1158
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,700
You know, everything is getting a little bit harsher. Advertising is being as a very,

1159
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,220
that edgy can that can was very edgy. I like every wild cherry Pepsi can is a piece of art though.

1160
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:07,380
I will say this. I don't think it's ever been a bad wild cherry. Did you like the cherry Coke can,

1161
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,940
the red and white, like the classic font? No, like the nineties one. I think anything in the

1162
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:19,460
nineties that had cherry Coke or Pepsi was pretty great. I, I, I'd have to see all of them again.

1163
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:26,020
A while. Let's see wild cherry Pepsi. I think that's not, yeah, the new one's boring.

1164
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:33,700
It's not offensive to me, but it's yeah, it's all really good. You're just going to keep lost in

1165
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,660
your arch. Let me get lost in this. Yeah. WWF New York had that aesthetic of chain link fence TV.

1166
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:48,500
That's after the nineties. How few items can you use to fill a space? Yeah. So yeah, they were

1167
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:53,700
sure they look, they were flailing. They were trying so hard. It's interesting because I,

1168
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,900
this was not on my radar at all. These tie. I don't think any, any of us, I guess we were a

1169
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,100
little older. I never heard of it. Yeah. What do we wouldn't have in the audience? Although maybe we

1170
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,340
should, I think they were aiming for like 11, 12 year olds. I don't remember this at all. Maybe

1171
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,460
I now in these properties, like there was a little bit of implication of Nick tunes being an, like,

1172
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,580
sure. I'll go somewhere where the Nick tunes are, but Godzilla, the animated series or like the worst

1173
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:20,100
one lost in space rescue challenge. Yeah. I guess it's all the Lacey Shabir,

1174
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:26,260
Matt, William hurt and spade William hurt. Oh, well you think William hurt will be there?

1175
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,500
I was very excited to see Gary old boom play. Dr. Smith.

1176
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,300
I did like the movie that the tie-ins for that. I remember going like, all right, they're really,

1177
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:43,220
I don't know about this. Not good though. I have no recollection of really what happened in that

1178
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:49,300
movie. I saw it too. I remember, but I remember nothing about it. I got a free like, um, what's

1179
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:55,780
the robot's name? Uh, yeah, I can't think. What is the robot's name? It's just called a Ross in space.

1180
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,580
This is a big fail. We don't know the lost. There's somebody who was like, I thought these guys liked

1181
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:08,260
Kitschy bullshit. Cause it looked like the old TV show one. And then he gets like upgraded to a giant

1182
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:14,340
hulking one. And I like that. I like that as well. Um, but yes, I guess men in black,

1183
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,580
I didn't really watch that men in black cartoon. It might've been fine, but yes, you're right.

1184
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:25,220
It is like maybe with a better, stronger set of properties, you're getting kids. Maybe if it's

1185
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,820
based on like independent state of the movie, which I think every kid collectively who saw it

1186
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,820
were obsessed with it. We overthought it. Its name is just robot. Is it? Okay. Yeah. Well, thank

1187
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:41,620
good. I'm glad it's not a specific name because I would be very embarrassed. Robot, uh, robot model

1188
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:48,500
B nine. Everyone just remembers danger. Will Robinson. Yes, I remember that. Yeah. Well,

1189
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,860
so I guess what we're finding is that the paramount connection did not open all the doors.

1190
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:59,060
Kids are not like, we gotta go back to discovery zone to see lost in space rescue challenge. Where

1191
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:03,460
was my star trek tie in? Well, they had power Rangers for the first movie. That's true. Yeah.

1192
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,500
We're getting a big one. Yeah, that is true. That is on point. And it seemed like there was like

1193
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:16,180
risks things you would get. Um, uh, uh, it did seem like a lot of locations. It was mostly some

1194
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:22,580
cardboard cutouts of the power Rangers. Yeah. That I think you, I think the, the business model was

1195
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:28,740
like, if a regular party for like kids were $5 a head, if you want the power Rangers upgrade,

1196
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,380
it's an extra three. So that's the idea there. Um, it doesn't seem like they thought like they

1197
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:41,060
had some really cool things to do with the power. Like if you, the kids all got to dress up, I guess,

1198
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,420
like them. And then there was some sort of like organized game. Okay. A little more closer and

1199
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,340
you played the music loud. It's not, it doesn't take much. It doesn't take much. But from the

1200
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:54,660
sound of it, I don't think they nailed some sort of transformative experience that kids were

1201
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:00,420
desperate to do. It seemed like they were focused on making money by nickel and diming people.

1202
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,860
Cause you can't upcharge for the jungle gym. You know, you can't charge for the tubes. Well,

1203
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,980
if you're playing the power Rangers theme, you can, but you can, but like, it's hard to say. So

1204
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:16,340
this side's a few bucks extra, you know? Oh, right, right. There's certain parts of the jungle gym

1205
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:22,500
are more expensive. I was also what Disney's doing. Yeah. We're describing it is. And, uh,

1206
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:27,860
yeah, I there, but there was like, um, like there was a like unattended zip line at some of the,

1207
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:34,260
like a, a 10 foot like thing that you would hold and then drop into mats. Like what was your

1208
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:41,060
favorite part of these contraptions? Like to do pie, just as high as I can be. Yeah. I did like

1209
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:46,260
being high and these things. Yeah. You were a height miser kind of being, but it's this.

1210
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:56,100
Clear. Yeah. Not all being off the ground in a tube. I liked, uh, so that was the end and the

1211
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:04,500
ball pit for sure. But I, yeah, I mean, I'm trying to think like, I think as a kid, the ball pit

1212
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:12,820
seemed like the most fun in reality, not as much fun to do it. Yeah. Once you were in smell,

1213
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:18,100
certainly like kids in there. Yeah. And, but, but navigating it, especially with a bunch of strange

1214
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,540
kids, usually it was like, I gotta get out of here and in a different part of this. I know it's like,

1215
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:28,500
you really imagine like I will be, I'll be in there for two hours. That is going to be so glorious.

1216
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,780
And instead you sort of want out in three minutes. Yes. So that, so, but, but crawling through the

1217
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,620
tubes and stuff. And yes, I agree with getting a very high up in this thing, which is why I think

1218
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:44,260
the leaps and bounds is my favorite because you could get very high in my mind and look down,

1219
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:49,140
see the gains from that height, see him playing the gains, maybe see the characters. Right. Um,

1220
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:54,980
so yeah, I think that either care you, you liked seeing the characters from up high, not close to

1221
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:01,620
them. Well, no, I would, I would be, I would do every angle. Like describe one character that

1222
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:07,620
you liked seeing from up high as opposed to in the cab. No, I mean, if a Chucky is walking around

1223
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:12,260
and you see from the desk, like, Oh, there he is. There he is. You don't mean like seeing a street

1224
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:19,220
fighter. You don't mean see bison on a screen from above. I mean, it's nice if you're trying to clock

1225
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,780
like, Oh good, that machine looks as Simpson's games empty now. I see. I gotta get down there.

1226
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,140
Yeah. It would take a second to get down there though. And it would be easy to get.

1227
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:32,020
You know, that's part of the thrill. You would try to, I've said this before on the, on the

1228
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:38,020
playground equipment in elementary school, we used to come up with ways to play on it that you

1229
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:44,820
weren't supposed to stand on top of the tubes, like jump off the side of the slide as opposed

1230
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,980
to going down the slide. It's a good thing. Your mom yelled at you. She doesn't know anything about

1231
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,660
this. She doesn't know anything about this. She's going to listen to this. She will, but she will be

1232
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:59,140
so zoned out listening just to the sound of my voice that she's being discussed. I think so. I

1233
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:02,340
think she's still just going to be listening to how I know we're really protected. We're talking

1234
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,260
about you right now. This is Carlson. You don't even know. See, I didn't like, I was a little guy,

1235
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,940
so I didn't like being up high. If I could look down and see asphalt discovery zone, I feel there

1236
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:19,060
was some stuff watching this, these videos. I was like, wow, you can really climb up high on that

1237
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:25,140
net. And again, I wasn't a jump off things kid, but I'm like, I would have seen if I could have

1238
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,300
landed in that ball pit because my head would have been like, well, they wouldn't have put it here

1239
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:35,540
if I couldn't do this. Right. The, I think another thing is the Chuck E. Cheese. I don't,

1240
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:41,300
I don't believe I spend a lot of time in the play place at Chuck E. Cheese. I was more arcade and

1241
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:48,180
show, but it's because Chuck E. Cheese generally had a smaller one. So I liked if it was a big

1242
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:53,060
play place, I liked it feeling like you could get lost in the tubes a little bit. Yeah. That was

1243
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,100
something like fun. If it felt like you were on like a little bit of a journey,

1244
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:02,100
this was more of a maze sort of thing, like discovery zone or leaps and bounds see much

1245
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:08,180
more base. Chuck E. Cheese wants you to do a quick intermission in the tubes and then get back on the

1246
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:15,460
floor, buy some pizza, play some arcade games, get dad to get another picture of court slide.

1247
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,860
Getting fired up here. You had, you, yeah, you had your way of doing business there.

1248
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,980
Like you seem confident is the way to do it. I agree with what you're saying. The,

1249
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:32,260
the YouTube video we were talking about mentions that some franchisee of, of DZ felt that she had

1250
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,820
to buy Domino's pizza and Baskin Robbins ice cream because the quality of the normal stuff

1251
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:45,460
they would normally get from corporate was so poor. Oh my God. So she was losing money.

1252
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:52,980
There's like a six minute video of a guy, like clearly like an in mall entertainment thing. And

1253
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:58,580
he's like, Hey, I'm here checking out the discovery zone here at the South gate mall or whatever. And

1254
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:04,020
he orders one of everything on the menu and the tray they give him looks like, you know,

1255
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:11,700
I love garbage, but I was like, this looks disgusting. This looks bad. I'd like to see that.

1256
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:18,820
Um, so while we're just, we're finding the cracks here, we're discovered the Paramount library does

1257
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:24,980
not, uh, give them all the gifts, the treasure that they want. The food is not so good. The,

1258
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:31,540
the quality they open strong, but the quality does not increase. Um, and of course you're always

1259
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:38,020
fighting that look, I could go to Chuck E cheese and Chuck E cheese has robots. There are no robots

1260
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:46,900
at discovery zone. Well, unless, well, let's pay a little bit of attention to our new friend who I

1261
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:58,580
didn't know about before this, but the discovery zone robot whose name is Z Bob Z Bob. Um, now Z

1262
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:05,220
Bob has, well, maybe we physically described Z Bob for a little bit. If anyone has a photo of him,

1263
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:09,220
I mean, I saw him in the commercial. That's, that's what I realized is like, Oh, subliminally,

1264
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:16,660
they would indicate there is a robot spinning around. Um, though I don't recall if I saw this,

1265
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,140
I don't have a strong, I might've seen it not understood that it was a robot. I mean,

1266
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,740
I just thought it was a statue. Yeah. Well they, yeah, they, they, I are a video game. That's sort

1267
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:31,540
of just the casing looks like a robot. Yeah. Yeah, totally. That's kind of what I thought.

1268
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:36,420
It's just, it's very bright plastic. It's the color scheme that I described here earlier. It's,

1269
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:43,540
it's big, bold, bright primary colors, big yellow ball face and big blue nose. And then, and, and

1270
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:54,660
red body boxing glove hands like that. Um, and then kind of springy, uh, antenna with little balls up

1271
01:08:54,660 --> 01:09:00,100
on top kind of looks like a, like a children's drawing come to light. Like it looks like a kid

1272
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:06,580
tried to draw Ernie or Bert. Yes. It ended up off, but it's kind of cute in its own right.

1273
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:12,500
Right. It looks, it looks like a knockoff of some, it looks, there's a cheap quality to it,

1274
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:18,500
even though it's not poorly made, I don't think. I don't think so. It seems, it seems well made.

1275
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:25,380
Decent quality. Um, now one leg up that these robots have as opposed to Munch and Jasper in

1276
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:30,740
the gang is that you might be able to get right up close to this robot in the ads indicate that

1277
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:36,740
he might roll up and join you at your table. Terrifying, terrifying prospect. I would've

1278
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:44,020
down side for so scared. Touch my buttons. No, I know. No, thank you, sir. Oh yes. So that's part

1279
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:49,380
of it set of four buttons of the only colors at discovery zone. And I think you would press them

1280
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:56,740
and it would make like silly sounds. Right. That sort of thing. Curly from the three stooges made

1281
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:03,060
the sound. It would play one of those. Wow. A robotic curly every kid's dream. That's right.

1282
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:10,580
Um, so I don't know. You know what I have to, I gotta say nobody's tone really spiked when we

1283
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:17,220
started talking about Z-Bob. I don't like it. Nobody likes Z-Bob. Maybe I hadn't come to terms

1284
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,300
with it until I started describing him. I don't hate him. Look, I don't look, I don't want to make

1285
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,740
for the record. I don't hate Z-Bob. I would even if you were to say, is he cute? I might go, yeah,

1286
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:34,660
he's cute. Not enough to save the enterprise. No, no. Okay. There's a YouTube video just called

1287
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:41,460
Z-Bob eBay video. Yes, I found that. Yeah. Everyone find this. Yeah. And you can hear an approximation

1288
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:49,940
of some of the sounds and like what sort of shtick he would do at you. Right. Um, and it didn't help.

1289
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:56,420
Yeah. It matters. Yeah. I guess I don't, I don't know. It's kind of like it's, it's sort of

1290
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:03,620
my old party entertainment, which seems like where Z-Bob has ended up today. If you're looking for

1291
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:10,580
what happened to these Z-Bops, there are several things that I found. One is that, um, okay,

1292
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:16,260
well all of the information seemed to come from a listing on Worth Point, which we've come across

1293
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:22,980
before with, you know, weird old Arcania and like find old menus or whatever. Right. Uh, Theme Park

1294
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:29,140
relics. Um, recently got a lot of ads for that on Twitter. So things are going great at Worth

1295
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:34,420
Point. What happened to Worth Point? No, no, I'm just saying like if you're getting fed Twitter

1296
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:43,780
ads for in 2022, start at 2023. Oh, I see. Might not have high standards. Uh, well the listeners

1297
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,300
are all going to get Worth Point ads because they're listening to this podcast right now.

1298
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:52,820
That's how it works. Um, so listing on Worth Point says some stuff about, you know, kind of

1299
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:58,340
some technical momo jumbo. I didn't understand about the, the, the making of Z-Bop and his,

1300
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:03,620
his innards and what's in him. Like he's got, he's got a computer in his backpack and there's

1301
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:10,580
he's got two amps and, um, and, and it could work if you had somebody who knew what they were doing.

1302
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,140
And, um, and actually, um, there's a few of these around. One is used by something called,

1303
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:22,660
called Vaudeville Entertainment, not spelled the way that you know, but VOD, V-I-L-L. And, um,

1304
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:30,500
he's been repurposed and renamed Gizmo, the little boy robot. I went to the website for

1305
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:36,500
Vaudeville Entertainment and found this listing and I saw a picture of a, of a smiling man. His

1306
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,540
name is Richard and he works in the Kansas area and he seems like he would come around with a silly

1307
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:49,700
hat and stilts and be maybe your kid birthday party entertainment. Um, then I, the same listing said,

1308
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:57,060
oh, this Z-Bop actually has been on Pawn Stars. There was a Pawn Stars episode where somebody

1309
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:04,180
shows up and Z-Bop just rolls into the store and he's spinning around and showing what he can do.

1310
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:09,780
And it's a good sp- he's pretty like mobile. I got more on board watching him in action on Pawn Stars,

1311
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:16,980
but the Pawn Stars are not impressed. The guy is trying to get 2,500 for it. I believe he paid

1312
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:22,340
15,000. He claims, well, I want to get rid of this because I actually have another one. So I'm fine

1313
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:29,780
with the one Z-Bop and there is no deal. The Pawn Stars compare Z-Bop unfavorably to newer robots

1314
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:37,220
like Asimo. And so, you know, it just seems so old school. We don't think it's a fit for us and to

1315
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:43,380
have in the store. I put something together in watching this Pawn Stars episode that the three

1316
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:50,340
artifacts of Z-Bop, Worth Point, Vaudeville Entertainment and Pawn Stars, all the same person.

1317
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:56,100
Oh, really? The guy who walked into the store is the guy who has the website of I'll come to

1318
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:02,820
your party and bring Z-Bop or rather Gizmo the little boy robot. I'm not sure, like, why does that,

1319
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:09,940
does little robot boy sound better than little boy robot? That's a good question. Little boy.

1320
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:17,700
For some reason, why does that feel creepier to me? Is the little boy robot? I think it's lit. I think

1321
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:24,500
little little robot boy Jason, would you, would you, would you say that phrase in the way?

1322
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,860
Little boy robot. Let's not say the other one. Little robot boy.

1323
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:39,780
It rolls off. Yeah, it's cleaner. You have to stutter stop. Yeah. Right. Anyway, so there's one

1324
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:47,140
man, Richard Renner in the Kansas area who is trying to make some dough off of the, I don't know

1325
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:52,820
if he's ever unloaded one of them, but he's, he's certainly trying to turn ownership of Z-Bop into a

1326
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:57,220
business. And I wish him luck. Do you think he's ever had a bad night at the business and he's

1327
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:02,660
kicked Z-Bop? He's like, you're not doing anything for me. We were supposed to be in this together.

1328
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:08,260
This is supposed to be our ticket out of this town. She left and you stayed. He like kicks him

1329
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:08,980
and then you're like,

1330
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,820
come on, answer me. Give me a business plan.

1331
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:23,380
That doesn't help me. That's what you always say. He leaves him on the side of the road and then he

1332
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:28,580
comes back for him the next morning. I don't want to say this is a trap, but I feel if you push any

1333
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:34,820
further, like you're gonna like Robert Earl's gonna throw a net over you. Like you're gonna

1334
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:42,180
going to get more information about little boy robot and it'll be under like a big cardboard box

1335
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,980
held up by a pole and you will get, you're saying that you think there's a way like that,

1336
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:53,380
like this seems like a way to bait Scott Gardner. This could be a honey pot scenario. Yeah.

1337
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:58,500
Well, luckily my interest in Z-Bop is low enough. Are you saying that if you dig deeper,

1338
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:03,540
you're going to learn that this guy like legally adopted Z-Bop? No, no, I'm saying this is a trap.

1339
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:09,620
There you have the work point is set up to try to that a previous like enemy of the show is

1340
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:16,500
working in conjunction with the gizmo Z-Bop owner. Well, you didn't fool me today. Just like a pond

1341
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:22,580
stars didn't bite. I'm not fighting. I also liked the history that this robot was made by 21st

1342
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:30,020
century robotics in Atlanta, which is a company that previously existed to sell robots to the

1343
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:38,580
Atlanta police that are like robots that the phrase used is child safety ambassador.

1344
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:44,980
Oh my God. And there'd be a robot named NG one or I'm sorry, an ambassador droid named NG one,

1345
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:49,780
who may be a child would feel more comfortable talking to than a scary police officer.

1346
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,580
The ambassador droid look like it's, oh, I got to have to, I definitely saw a picture of it,

1347
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,340
but I don't have one in front of me. I'll see if I can find NG one really fast.

1348
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:05,940
As I recall kind of like scary and angular and like that one that was in Disney world slash

1349
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:10,980
Rocky four. It seemed a lot up in that neck of the woods. Yeah. Oh, the John,

1350
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:14,900
one that John Daffer out at the nightclub outside of Philadelphia.

1351
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:19,860
Daffer thing with that too. We did that episode so long ago. I, oh my God, I think that ties together.

1352
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:27,460
That's the robot Seiko. Seiko's the monomy Seiko. What are, what are our, our brains made of marbles

1353
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:34,580
today? We're forgetting the name of every robot. He's got to see, you're right. It should have been

1354
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,420
at the, it should have been that fast. There's just so many, when you're learning about new

1355
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:44,340
robots all the time, like I got the information about NG one, the child safety ambassador droid,

1356
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:49,860
and it shoved other roads shoved Seiko right out of my head. I have recently listened to that Seiko

1357
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:56,660
song monomy Seiko. Oh, right. Yeah. There's a single Seiko's on a single. I forget the artist

1358
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:03,060
that Seiko is singing with. Um, well, actually I'm sorry, Seiko. I'm sorry. I forgot your song.

1359
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,140
Um, and pretty good. It's scary. Can you see it off my computer? He,

1360
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:13,940
this NG one is much scarier than any human is going to be. Oh yeah. Trying to get a kid

1361
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:19,940
comfortable. This is not the way. I mean, I guess if we had a kid who was like an Ultraman enthusiast,

1362
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:25,460
that's true, but that's the only thing I could quick check. You ever seen Ultraman? No.

1363
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:34,260
Um, so I, all right. I mean, this is three strikes, Paramount properties and, uh, the, uh,

1364
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:40,900
new, wait, what was the other problem? Uh, robots, no good food, no good. And yeah,

1365
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:46,500
three strikes this come and all of this combined with expanded too quickly. They owe too much to

1366
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:52,420
the Sumner Redstone Empire, who this is part of why I'm saying maybe this was Blockbuster's dream

1367
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:57,780
and not Viacom's dream. I think they had to, I think Sumner had to deal with this in order to,

1368
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:02,260
all right, what's Blockbuster doing? I guess we'll put up with this and Sumner Redstone had to deal

1369
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:07,300
with this in his autobiography. There's a part of his autobiography where he explains, let me tie it

1370
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:13,460
all together that the, uh, uh, the Blockbuster indoor, the block parties, those were, those failed

1371
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:18,820
and then they were quickly converted into discovery zones. Um, although I think he was wrong about

1372
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,380
that because the other one was open until 2002. Sumner, maybe I'm going to say Sumner Redstone

1373
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:29,540
might not have had the vice grip on the Viacom Empire that he might've suggested. Preoccupied with

1374
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:41,540
some other things. Change my diaper. I'm organizing a threesome for me and Robert Evans. Probably.

1375
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:49,380
It's, don't worry. It's Robert Evans, another hot guy. Look at him. We don't have to explain

1376
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:55,940
more. You're going to want to take our shoes off all day. Look, I'm going to Redstone and ultimate

1377
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:02,340
guy. We should really find a reason to talk more Sumner. No, no, we love the tails. Clip my nails

1378
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:11,060
or else I'll drop you at this airport and not pick you up again. Really telling the line from

1379
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:17,780
guide a villain. Oh yes. Yeah. I don't know. Probably. Well, telling the only, he got his

1380
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:28,260
diaper caught on. Oh, he's doing the line. It's like a looney tooties. The diaper with the hole

1381
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:34,340
in it because he was getting an erection through the diaper. These diapers aren't strong enough to

1382
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:41,460
contain erections. I need a better brand. The Acme brand contractions. If you don't know what

1383
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:46,020
we're talking about is Google Sumner and any other words we're talking about. Find a picture of

1384
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:52,180
Sumner Redstone and you'll go, ah, and then you'll realize that that whatever photo you're looking at,

1385
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:58,420
he was still alive for like 20 years past that. He has the thing Bolsonaro has, the four president

1386
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,380
Brazil where it's like, are you dying? Like, oh no, this is your normal. Like,

1387
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:14,980
yeah, there might be more Sumner in our future. But anyways, oh, there, boy, I Googled it. There's

1388
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:22,900
great photos. Sumner Redstone. So anyway, I just, I did, I did not know that Sumner Redstone

1389
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:28,020
sometimes had to deal with discovery zone and that is funny is discovery zone is in his book,

1390
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:33,540
three times. What an interesting crossover. That's great. But ultimately it was not to be

1391
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:42,660
in the Viacom empire. I guess the, at the end of the day, discovery zone was an entity that

1392
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:53,940
met disaster after doing business with Viacom, much like my career. I wish I knew the full

1393
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:59,540
discovery zone story or I would have pitched my cartoon somewhere else. Are you in Sumner Redstone's

1394
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:09,060
book? Then there's this dumb cartoon, Nagel paintings. What's that? I want an alcoholic bottle.

1395
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:15,140
One of the poor, I know milk, but with like vodka and wine in it. One of the poor prostitutes,

1396
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,820
like watched 15 minutes of it and said she didn't like it and that was the end of your career.

1397
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:25,940
That's probably it. Do you like this? No, that's boring. That's what I thought.

1398
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:33,060
Get the guy who made it onto my plane and then I'll shove him out at 35,000 feet. And if we can't

1399
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,660
do that, I'll banish him to be making a podcast for the rest of his life. Playboy mansion. Watch out

1400
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:53,460
for the dog shit and all the hallways and my shit. Oh Sumner. Oh boy. So yeah, look, it went away so

1401
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,580
fast. They all started closing in 1990. They were, there were several passes at chapter 11.

1402
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:05,700
And then in 1999, a hundred stores just closed one day, which left all of the managers of these

1403
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:12,340
places who did care about kids and families all having to call dozens of families who have booked

1404
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:18,340
parties and say, I'm sorry. Like, Oh man, we need to find like a manager and be like, how many did

1405
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,500
you call and cancel? Cause you booked some of those at least Chuggy cheese. I remember we booked,

1406
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:27,540
my mom booked like my sister's party like weeks, weeks and then you have to really make sure.

1407
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:32,180
Oh yeah. I'm certainly into this area. We, you know, we have not jumped on it fast enough yet.

1408
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:37,940
I don't know how to do this yet. But the, yeah, like here's a quote from one from a manager.

1409
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:43,940
Let's just forget the children crying outside the school bus that arrived with 68 children.

1410
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:49,540
Why the 17 scheduled birthday parties for Saturday? I understand that this is a business

1411
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:52,980
and there's a way to do things, but a business that's supposed to be for the children sure

1412
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:59,940
doesn't seem to care about the children. Wow. School bus 68. All right, we're here. It's time

1413
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:04,820
to go. That's so much more traumatic than what I went through in the parking lot.

1414
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:11,940
Probably all ran. They all like, of course. And then they ran and they just ran into a brick wall.

1415
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:19,540
Summoner Redstone was outside where it closed. You go back on the bus. Step one, close a hundred

1416
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:29,300
stores. Let me see video feeds of all that crying kids. Put the laser zone, put the laser adventure,

1417
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:36,020
put it in the back, collect your tears. I want to save them. It's a whole weekend of tear drinking

1418
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:45,540
for me. Maybe I'll save it. A fine vintage. I'll open it when I'm still alive in 2018. Does anyone

1419
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:54,100
have some plasma to keep me young? Who wants to donate plasma? Early adopter of young blood.

1420
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:58,900
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Those are the tears from when I closed discovery zone.

1421
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:05,700
Those are tears when I closed the Paramount theme park. That is me. I'm sure there are lots of kids

1422
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:11,060
who grew up saying like Paramount's King's Dominion, you know, and thought fondly of like,

1423
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:16,100
look, the Nickelodeon characters here are Paramount. This is positive. Flushing it down the drain. We

1424
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:19,940
don't know the brand record. We don't need to eat. We don't need kids liking us. We don't need kids

1425
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:25,540
at all. I'll be alive forever. Let's stop all kids. I'll be around when I'm 300.

1426
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:33,060
Should have added a blood bank in each one to heart. I ran by that Jagged Metal thing.

1427
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:39,540
Oh yeah. Right. That's right. Maybe that kept Sumner alive for a decade. Jason Sheridan's blood

1428
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:44,420
was coursing through Sumner's veins. Well, you'd have to do it as a tie-in. Like I actually,

1429
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:51,380
earlier I had a list up of Paramount Pictures films from the 90s. So if you tied it into like,

1430
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:56,980
it's all right. It's the Harriet the Spy forensics adventure. Harriet needs your help. First,

1431
01:25:56,980 --> 01:26:02,020
just give her a couple drops of your blood so she can eliminate you from the suspects list

1432
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:07,860
and help Harriet solve the crime. I am Mark Wahlberg, star of The Italian Job. To pull off

1433
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:13,540
this heist, we need a few things. We need a crew. We need Mini Coopers and we need a pint of your

1434
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:21,220
blood. A pint? That's a lot. You can trust your DZ associates. They're friends of Wahlberg.

1435
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,180
Don't be scared of that needle. If you're too scared of that needle, then you're too scared to

1436
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:31,860
help me. This is no Italian job for you. They should have just made Sumner like the Chuck E.

1437
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:38,180
Cheese of DZ. You should have been in all the commercials announcing all this stuff. Then you'd

1438
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:42,500
have a face and kids would want to come back and see him in the show. Come see me. Give me your

1439
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:49,860
blood. Yeah. Oh wow man, I want to give this guy our blood. I'm waiting. He's like the Crypt Keeper.

1440
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:55,620
We mentioned Chuck E. Cheese and they came into play. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh yes, the final

1441
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:02,580
step. Yeah, yeah. They were given control or like they bought a handful. Yeah, they took over a lot

1442
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:08,740
of the spaces. Discovery zones and attempted to like frantically reschedule the birthday parties

1443
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:16,100
or fulfill obligations. Yeah, why not? Wow. Wow. Oh well, good for them. That transition time must

1444
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:20,420
have been interesting because there would be, they're having parties. They have obviously enough

1445
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:24,180
stuff for a kid to do probably in a discovery zone, but then they're probably starting to move

1446
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:29,300
Chuck E. Cheese stuff in there. So they're probably in like, it's like a half Chuck E. Cheese,

1447
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:35,700
half discovery zone. Like there would be hybrid situations during this magical year or two. Geez,

1448
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:43,140
wow. Crazy, crazy flavor combinations like you couldn't imagine. Yeah. So there might have been

1449
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:49,060
Chuck E. goofing around with whatever the hell the robot's name that I've already

1450
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:54,500
forgot because it wasn't good enough to wow. We have forgotten every robot today. Yeah. Z Bob

1451
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:00,260
is the name. God, imagine Chuck E. and Chuck E. and Z Bob. Imagine the possibilities. Just like how

1452
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:05,300
there were Chuck E. Cheese with Billy Bob from the rocket fire explosion photos when there was that

1453
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:12,020
transition as well. You really, boy, think about that. That's another, we didn't realize this was

1454
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:20,660
yet another, an enemy vanquished by big cheese. Yeah. He slid the throat of Z Bob. Well, well,

1455
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:26,580
well. I've done it again. Oh, a little kid's playground, huh? Wanted to get the kids exercising.

1456
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:30,980
That's a way to be different than the old pizza place. And now you come crawling,

1457
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:36,740
but maybe I'll buy your locations. Yeah. How about at one tent at a price?

1458
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:41,060
Hey, thumbnail. I don't need no hole in the front of my diaper.

1459
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:51,460
I don't know how to, where to possibly take it from there. Right. Turn out of that. I think,

1460
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:59,300
I think you survived podcast the ride. The second gate. Well, wait, real quick. Discovery

1461
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:05,540
zone is back. Oh, but it's not discovery zone. Somewhere else is just using that name and

1462
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:10,820
painting everything with bright colors. Basically. And, you know, this kind of came up with the great

1463
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:16,580
Wolf Lodge episode, but there's some language on the website that really rubbed me the wrong way.

1464
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:20,980
Oh no. There's no other way. What's wrong with getting rubbed the wrong way? Yeah.

1465
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:27,860
I need to do it for free for me thumbnail. I don't gotta pay. It's right when it's wrong.

1466
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:32,180
These are located in Union Township, Ohio and Florence, Kentucky. I just gave the lady some

1467
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:39,620
tickets. Both, both at malls. I guess a good use for empty anchor stores, you know. Okay.

1468
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:45,620
Just as a language I'm reading. General admission. Potty trained children, parentheses, not wearing

1469
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:51,940
a diaper or a pull up are $12 and permitted to play in the large play skate. Children still

1470
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:59,140
potty training are get ground level play toddler zone area for $5. The toddler area. If your child

1471
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:05,220
is in a diaper or pull up, we have you covered. Our toddler area is, is only your CEO. That was

1472
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:11,860
in a diaper. What is that? Well, they're writing the checks. So you, they get to go wherever.

1473
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:17,460
The toddler area, it's kind of, it's not a lot to write home about, you know. Oh, that's what they

1474
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:23,620
can do. They have that at home. It looks amateur hour. This is taking making kids stay out of areas.

1475
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:32,740
Every kid can go in our area. The VIP zone where is meant for 96 year old CEOs must prove your

1476
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:39,860
wealth, must prove at least 500 million in net worth and just, just for safety, for cleanup

1477
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:46,340
purposes, no holes in the diaper. Yeah, no, we don't care though. They do mention, you know,

1478
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,980
arcade games, straight in your tickets. We have everything from slime to sour candy,

1479
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:56,660
not interested in playing arcades. No problem. Buy prizes straight from the case for your little

1480
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:01,540
ones. Now that's got my attention. That's what I want. That's good advertising. That's good

1481
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:05,300
advertising. You'd have to, it was a secret thing with Chuck, with the Chuckie, you'd have to kind

1482
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:08,980
of make it, you'd have to like wink because they didn't say they didn't advertise it. You could just

1483
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:14,740
buy. Wow. Yeah. Prizes and off menu. Oh, yeah. I just had to know the code. Yeah. But there's

1484
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:21,380
nothing he loves doing more than winking. That's true. Under the table business, wimping, begging,

1485
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:31,860
just a rational solving. I break people down is what I do. You want that pack of Smarties? $50.

1486
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:40,100
$50. That doesn't seem fair, sir. You don't give a shit. You don't want your kid to cry,

1487
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:47,220
do you? I don't care. I love watching kids cry. Same as you, right? Yeah. That's right.

1488
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:53,140
How is my summoner voice different? It's 10% less Jersey. I'm already taking these kids' blood and

1489
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:58,420
staying alive with it. How do you think I got so big? We welcome people of all faiths because it

1490
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:06,100
doesn't matter in here. I'm the king and the god. All right. We're there now. That's it. You

1491
