1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Warning, the following podcast may be only 8% complete, and that 8% may be overrun with

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,120
gummy babies, profane ghosts, and Shrek fart water.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,400
The ugly themed mall that has ruined the New Jersey skyline for decades now ruins this podcast.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,720
The American Dream Disaster on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:51,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,760
For an episode that has been in the works since the first George W. Bush administration,

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Are you going to say you were George W. Bush?

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,600
Was that what you were about to say?

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,040
Have you lost your mind?

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
This topic maybe.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
That's Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Scott Garner is also here.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm not George W. Bush.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm not George W. Bush also, but you know, the craziest thing is I think it's even further.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,840
At least with the like little embers, like the beginning seeds of this crazy thing,

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,520
I think go back to Clinton a little bit.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh yeah, initial like pitches and stuff.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,880
They go back to an era when these sorts of multi entertainment destination things were

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,880
like relevant.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Before like this thing bridges all of the giant tragedies, it goes back, it covers all

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
of them.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:07,440
It really like and it's the most apt name, the most apt thing to be doing at this time,

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
I think.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,240
I would say multiple apt names too.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Oh yes, it went from one to another.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Yeah, I honestly, a note I had written down is how many people read about what this was

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,240
and was like, I am going to go join ISIS.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,240
This is causing me, those ISIS guys might have a point.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,040
I just learned about a big mall and it drove me insane.

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,560
I never really thought about Death to America before, but you know, now I can kind of wrap

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
my head around the concept.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Yeah, with an entertainment complex and shopping, the size of the scope was enough to drive

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
people to extremism.

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,840
So we're talking about, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the names, the American Dream

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Meadowlands.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Oh, see, I missed that as a name.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I didn't see that either.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
Is that one of the many names?

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,920
I thought that's where they ended up.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,600
Like that's the most recent one, maybe.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,800
If you look them up, I think, I believe now you just go to, if you want to learn about

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,400
this place, I think it's just americandream.com, if that clarifies it, where the logo just

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,780
says American Dream and you can click around the website of this, one of the biggest malls

47
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,880
ever built, but don't call it a mall in front of the people responsible because it's so

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
much more than that.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
It's so full of attractions.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Why, if you go to the website like I'm looking at right now, you'll see all kinds of rides

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,080
and slides and other things that are not open and may never open.

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Yeah, I will say, you know, we haven't talked, we've been talking a lot about ladders lately,

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,160
which I'm really excited about, but we haven't talked about slides that much.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
So I'm excited to talk about slides.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,760
So we've never done an episode devoted to one single slide.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,680
We've talked around various water slides, but there is not one that's been enough to

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,720
get its own episode, which are there any?

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,200
I mean, maybe that one that killed that person, but I don't really want to talk about that

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
for a long time.

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,440
No, I'm not interested in that one.

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
I don't, we don't need to talk about that one.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,440
There's one in Toontown.

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Where's the slide in Toontown?

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,080
We haven't done enough about that.

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,840
That's gone though.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,680
They took out, I don't think you can go on slides anymore.

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
No slide?

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,160
Yeah, that's I was like a legal cut at some point.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,760
America is getting worse, I guess.

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:52,800
This is yeah, what we're talking about is a mall in New Jersey that it has a very long

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,160
and calamitous history and that finally started opening.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,480
And then there was the covid-19 outbreak.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,840
And we've certainly been aware of this and we've we've texted about it.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
But I just want to credit the person who put it back on our radar on our Facebook group.

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm going to guess the pronunciation, Jason Fausoni, who posted an article on a website

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,520
called Six Square Feet.

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,720
And just to read, because sometimes you just have to see what we saw to understand why

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
we had to leap to it and do an episode.

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,320
The headline, no reopening plans for New Jersey's American Dream Mall as tenants flee

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,280
and owner skips mortgage payments.

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,880
We knew right away this was deep in our wheelhouse.

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,560
Oh, I just want to say when this first came up years ago on the podcast, I said it's not

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,800
going to happen. It's not going to it's not going to fully this because this I had heard

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,560
about this for years and years and just that it was a catastrophe.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,640
Chris Christie, of all people, the former governor of New Jersey.

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,840
Let me try and find this quote I have.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,360
He described it as quite possibly the ugliest building in New Jersey and maybe America.

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,000
And he would know about ugly because he's a pug ugly son of a bitch.

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh, wow, Jason.

90
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
Ugly inside and out, Chris Christie.

91
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
Gee, where's the throwing blonser?

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Which oddly ugly inside and out is not something that he himself would say about the mall

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
because he made that comment.

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,280
People it got a lot of press and it really like damned this place for a long time.

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,960
Then to assuage him, at some point he was given a tour and he said in the press, just

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,160
so you know, I saw the inside and it is not as ugly as the outside.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm happy to report they like took him around to show him.

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
See, not so bad.

99
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,080
And then he turns out he's being fair there, you know, that's an honest man.

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,360
That's an honest politician.

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,760
He was being fair. You know what else?

102
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,520
He was being very wrong, very incorrect.

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
You know, we've all been looking at photos of this place for a while.

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
And I'd have to agree.

105
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,960
There's one other I don't know if this is from the one that Jason posted on the Facebook

106
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,280
or from another article called A Dream Deferred.

107
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,240
But let me just read this just to, you know, just so the press, this article can do the

108
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360
exposition for us to explain this whole thing.

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,520
After nearly two decades of construction delays, New Jersey's mega mall, American Dream

110
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,120
partially opened last October, partially.

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,680
And this story, as we said, goes back decades.

112
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,800
Six months later, the three million square foot venue was forced to close its doors

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
because of the coronavirus pandemic.

114
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, even as the state continues its gradual reopening, there is still no reopening

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
date for the five billion dollar mall.

116
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,520
Amazing.

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Billion dollars and one billion supposedly taxpayer subsidies.

118
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,400
Wow. It's the whole thing with this and this company.

119
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,800
It's a company that's always tried to make it, you know, public money meets other stuff.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
But, you know, before you get too far into it.

121
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,880
I mean, so Jason and the Facebook group reminded us, oh, this would be really fun to talk

122
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,160
about and it's current and it's relevant and hopefully not, you know, I don't think

123
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,400
they're going to reopen by the end of the week that we're recording this and then it's

124
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
not relevant anymore.

125
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
It doesn't seem like things are going great.

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,480
But, yeah, obviously this would be fun to do.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
But I realized, wait, isn't...

128
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,400
You remember at the end of the downtown Disney ordeal that we were sent on all these

129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,800
missions by all these keepers, like from various all, none of them theme

130
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,960
parks, obviously all shopping centers near theme parks are related to theme parks.

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,320
And there were a lot of them.

132
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
And I got to be honest, I zoned out.

133
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,280
But wasn't one of them the keeper of the American Dream Mall?

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
Yes, I think you're correct.

135
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,120
I think that this was already a little bit on a rater because of we were visited by

136
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,280
one of our friend, the sector keepers cousins, who was the keeper of this mall that

137
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,720
had just opened.

138
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,760
I forget when we did the downtown Disney ordeal.

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,840
I guess it was around that same time that it partially opened.

140
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah, or was about to.

141
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,240
I don't know.

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
We didn't we didn't think it was going to be closed forever because of the pandemic.

143
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,680
I do in checking my notes here, it looks like it was supposed to be called the

144
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,040
American Dream Disaster, which oddly a really prophetic name.

145
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
Right. What's ended up happening?

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
Yes. Yeah.

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
So do you I mean, like this wasn't really I mean, we're just

148
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,880
throwing this together is kind of an afterthought.

149
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
But like, do you think we could like summon him?

150
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,600
Do you think he's huh?

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
Do you think he's summonable?

152
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
I mean, that's that.

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
Oh, let me let me do a little texting here.

154
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Let me see if I can get let me.

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,360
Oh, wait a minute.

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,000
I think I think.

157
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,120
Boys, boys, it's me, the keeper of the American Dream Mall in New Jersey.

158
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,280
Whoa, there.

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,680
No, I'm from Long Island and I hate New Jersey.

160
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,760
I know how much you've been wanting to do my saga, the American Dream Disaster.

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,200
And I said we do in the summer of 2025, but I ain't sure this mall is going to be

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,560
around by then to set my spirit free.

163
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,280
Please review the 8% of the mall that opened before the pandemic.

164
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,880
This should be 17 episodes minimum.

165
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,400
Oh, good frigging luck, boys.

166
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,480
Huh? Well, yeah, there he is.

167
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
Hey, whoa. Hi.

168
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,520
Thanks for thanks for being here on such short notice.

169
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,400
I do just responded to a Mike text, I guess.

170
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah, I just texted this gentleman, this ghost gentleman.

171
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,960
And yeah, so we are.

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,760
Hey, thanks. He's here.

173
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,600
He's in a fourth window on our Zoom.

174
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,040
We're doing this virtually.

175
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,240
He just popped up in the corners.

176
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,360
He's not with any of us in particular, and we all got to be distant.

177
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,680
So yeah, but yeah, he's he's piping in from from somewhere.

178
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,680
So, yeah, thanks. Thanks for joining.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
I hope I hope you're excited about this.

180
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
This sucks. Whoa.

181
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,840
Hey, well, she's what it is already.

182
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,520
He give us a chance, dude.

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah, kind of fair.

184
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
Kind of fair. Yeah.

185
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,800
Yeah. Hey, man.

186
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,680
This is, you know, I always find this process

187
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,760
doing records this way to be like a little stiff and a little,

188
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,160
you know, not organic, but he especially just he seems like he's like

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,040
so far, like he's not even paying attention.

190
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
I just feel so so distant from the guy.

191
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah, I know.

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,280
I want to assure the listeners, though, he is here live for sure.

193
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,680
There's no anything weird, but he is here.

194
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,400
It's just he's like not paying attention.

195
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,200
So it might, I think, probably seem like he's sort of, you know, not here.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,640
But but he is for sure.

197
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Look, we're all distracted checking out.

198
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,120
I mean, how can you give any of these Zoom records really?

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,760
You're all I just hope he kind of helps us or something.

200
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,480
Yeah, I think boys, boys, you're boring the crap out of me.

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
OK, OK. All right.

202
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,960
Let me get going.

203
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,720
I think I think that's sort of the vibe here.

204
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,200
OK, dude. OK.

205
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,320
So I have kind of I kind of have a log line for this place

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,160
from the the website chain store age.

207
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,440
I spent a lot of time on the website chain store age six square feet.

208
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm sure we all were on there.

209
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,200
There's a lot of articles about this place on there.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
Six square feet also was where I learned that Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan

211
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Mansion is up for sale.

212
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Are you going to put in a bid?

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,840
No. Well, yeah, it's got to get 88 million.

214
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,520
That's fine. OK.

215
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,480
Does it come with all the hidden cameras that filmed also

216
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,840
so many of our faves, stuff that isn't our fave?

217
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,720
So, OK, so here is the description from chain store age.

218
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,360
And then I have one of the facts that drove me to madness.

219
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,080
I learned after reading a lot about this place.

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,840
The American Dream developed by Triple Five Group is approximately three

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,880
square millions, three million square feet,

222
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,280
and projects 40 million visitors annually.

223
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,360
When complete, the destination will include more than 400 retail

224
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,840
food and specialty shops and more than 15 entertainment offerings,

225
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,240
including fully enclosed DreamWorks Waterpark and Nickelodeon

226
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Universe theme park, Big Snow American Dream, KidZania,

227
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,960
live performing arts theater, 300 foot tall observation wheel,

228
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,800
Merlin Entertainment, Sea Life Aquarium and Legoland Discovery Center.

229
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,320
The rink, an NHL regulation size ice rink

230
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,240
and the dining terrace with over 15 full service restaurants and a food hall.

231
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
So that's a log line. That's a paragraph log.

232
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,040
So much. It's it's so very much.

233
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,560
And one to one big thing I learned is that

234
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,480
the mall portion of this ended up being scheduled to open last.

235
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,640
And if that wasn't weird enough, another thing I learned is that this is

236
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,280
located in Bergen County in New Jersey.

237
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,480
Bergen County still has blue laws on the book,

238
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,200
meaning a lot of shops have to stay closed on Sunday.

239
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,640
Sunday. Yeah, I saw that.

240
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,440
So. Whoa.

241
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,120
So this was pretty common in Jersey back in the day.

242
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
They have blue laws.

243
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,680
A lot of shops are closed shops and some restaurants are closed.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,400
Amusement parks are not closed.

245
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Was that the keeper? Yeah.

246
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
He said, yeah, go put those laws.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,880
Doesn't like blue laws.

248
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,920
Blue laws. Can you elaborate?

249
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,440
Well, why don't you like them?

250
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,840
Who? This sucks.

251
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,240
He doesn't like them.

252
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
He just doesn't like them.

253
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
I think he's it's like a feeling he has.

254
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,840
It's not. You don't have to keep going into it. Sure. Yeah.

255
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,400
Now, supposedly, the reason blue laws are still on the books,

256
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,760
for whatever reason, in this one county in New Jersey is Bergen County

257
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,400
already has a shit ton of malls.

258
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,320
And the residents have asked them to stay on the books

259
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,960
because it's one day where there is a little bit of relief from the traffic.

260
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Uh huh. Uh huh.

261
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,640
That's a big factor in this whole thing is the traffic's very bad

262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,440
in this snake of the woods, which is very near where the Giants play. Correct.

263
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,920
So it like super crazy bottlenecks whenever there's a game.

264
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,200
And even if there isn't one, the Giants and the Jets

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,400
and of course, racetrack and the empty.

266
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,280
I forget what it's even called now.

267
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,840
Used to be called the eyes on center where the nets and the Jersey Devils play.

268
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,080
They have since gone to play elsewhere.

269
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,960
So there is an empty arena close by as well.

270
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,480
Visiting the empty arena and why not visit a mall that only got

271
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,440
eight percent open and is only open six out of seven days of the week?

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,560
Here's some other numbers.

273
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,960
Magic Kingdom attendance.

274
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,720
I believe this was 2017, just under 21 million.

275
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,440
Universal Studios, Florida attendance, roughly 10 million.

276
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,440
This place here, this is in a year.

277
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,520
This place projects 40 million annually.

278
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
40 million annually.

279
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,120
I mean, that's the hubris is always usually what I think when I.

280
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,800
And also with a place where there's malls around everywhere.

281
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,840
Yeah, it's not like this is the only mall in, you know, two states.

282
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,160
With all these tenants that have multiple outposts really nearby,

283
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,440
I forget what they are off hand, but I, you know, say a target or a Macy's.

284
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,000
I forget. But like, I know that I always saw one major chain.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,920
That's like the linchpin of this that has three other ones in the area.

286
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,720
Why would you also be here?

287
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,120
I don't know. It's hubris.

288
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,080
It's great. 40 million.

289
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,480
And it's going to top all way to like all those theme parks combined, essentially

290
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,640
out of the gate. Like, but why would it?

291
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,920
Well, because it has a Ninja Turtles shell razor roller coaster in.

292
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,160
And I guess.

293
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,840
I mean, I will say the ideal version of this.

294
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
Does sound cool.

295
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,600
Yeah. And yeah.

296
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,800
And we'll I'm sure we'll jump around the history of it.

297
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,320
But the people currently responsible who resuscitated these plans after several

298
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
false starts, it's a company called Triple Five.

299
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,720
And they are responsible for the Mall of America,

300
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,560
which I feel has been woefully underrepresented on podcast, the ride,

301
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,840
as has the West Edmonton Mall, which was their first foray

302
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,160
into any of this, this mega mall in in Canada.

303
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,000
And Alberta that seems just bonkers.

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,600
And I this all caused me to look into that a little bit.

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,600
Just the fact that there were you could see dolphin shows in this mall.

306
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,760
There was a submarine ride.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,160
You could get on little submarines.

308
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,720
They they called an area of it, and I believe the hotel fantasy land,

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,080
even though at some point Disney sued them and said, you can't also use fantasy land.

310
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,120
So so both of these malls, I mean, they are like amazing.

311
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,680
I haven't gotten to go to West Edmonton, but I've just watched full half hour

312
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
videos showing you everything there is to do.

313
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,040
It's crazy. Mall of America. I have been to. I loved it.

314
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
So this is the third in the trilogy of the mega mall of the

315
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,080
Triple Five mega malls.

316
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,680
If they pulled it off, it could be unbelievable.

317
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, I mean, it would be unbelievable.

318
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,280
I'm not. Yes, we're going to make some fun here today.

319
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,280
But as is common on this podcast,

320
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,360
we're making fun of something that we probably walk into and go,

321
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,120
this is the greatest place we've ever been to.

322
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
Like, I love. Yeah, yeah.

323
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,040
So much in a covid free timeline where we did do this in summer

324
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
twenty twenty five. Yeah.

325
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,840
With the keeper.

326
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,440
I think if nothing bad happened to it, I think we'd be having a ball

327
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,920
and maybe we would do the full 17 episodes he just asked us to do.

328
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,480
I'm not going to agree to that as it is.

329
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
I mean, barely any of this.

330
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
I hope I think we could fit it all into one unless you guys disagree.

331
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Hmm. I think we could fit it into one, but I'm leaving the option open

332
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,680
for another 16 episodes.

333
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,800
Sure. That's what I'll say.

334
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, now, since we brought up the Mall of America, did anyone

335
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
run into the other connection this place has to the Mall of America?

336
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,640
No. Oh, the Mall of America is the collateral

337
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,680
for this establishment.

338
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,160
And yeah, OK.

339
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Triple Five Group has missed three consecutive

340
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,080
seven million dollar payments on the Mall of America.

341
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,920
On the Mall of America.

342
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Yes, on the Mall of America.

343
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,000
So they're just like, are they?

344
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I wonder, are they do they know they'll just hopefully get bailed out?

345
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
Do we know this?

346
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,760
Do we know that like the intricate financial situation where it's like

347
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,160
they probably have the money, but they know that because we're in a time

348
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,760
of covid, they could potentially just get a huge government handout

349
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,240
and not have to pay?

350
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Well, that's made me wonder, has the American Dream received any of that

351
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,440
paycheck protection assistance? Right.

352
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,320
And the answer is no, I could not find any.

353
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,520
I could not find from like some of the more notable businesses.

354
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,040
I did not find any in terms of themed entertainment.

355
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,280
The Walt Disney Family Museum received PPP assistance.

356
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,880
Gatorland did and something in Vail, Colorado, called Margaritaville, Inc.,

357
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,280
which I cannot figure out if it's connected to Margaritaville at all.

358
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
Margaritaville, Inc.

359
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,520
The Margaritaville, yes, Margaritaville, Inc.

360
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,560
So it could just be a guy.

361
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,080
And it's not Margaritaville, Inc.

362
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,000
Like it's a tattoo place.

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,760
I know not not I and K,

364
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,480
where you can get like a parrot wearing a floppy hat on your arm.

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,400
Right. OK.

366
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
Because that's who you would get if you had any options.

367
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,320
Yeah, you'd be willing to.

368
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm going to get a hat.

369
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,320
That's pretty wild.

370
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,880
You know, they did.

371
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
They have laid off 100 people, I believe, the American Dream itself.

372
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,960
And then amidst all that, I mean, you know, that's that's who the mall employs.

373
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,280
But then the mall is obviously comprised of many different stores.

374
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,040
And I believe among places that are pulling out or trying to

375
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,200
forever 21 Victoria's Secret, the Children's Place,

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,000
GNC, I forget what that is, and CMX cinemas

377
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,080
are companies that filed bankruptcy entirely due to Covid-19.

378
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,080
And so thus are no longer opening at the mall.

379
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
And again, none of none of these open.

380
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,720
They did. If you look on YouTube, they did some opening ceremonies

381
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,560
for the theme park part.

382
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,280
But the rest of it, I think this is correct.

383
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,760
That the mall section of the mall

384
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,560
was going to open like the week that all of the locking down.

385
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, my God.

386
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,600
I think it was the week insane.

387
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,760
What are the odds?

388
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,680
Well, because they kept shifting.

389
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,760
They kept breaking them all into phases.

390
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,880
And they're like it was phase one through four.

391
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,520
And then they're like, OK, change of plans.

392
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,720
Phase three is coming first.

393
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
So you're getting the like what it ended up being.

394
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,000
The stuff officially open was the Nickelodeon theme park.

395
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,560
And big snow, the indoor ski.

396
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,480
But wait, the NHL, the NHL regulation

397
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,440
sized hockey rink did not open.

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,040
No, the rink open.

399
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,480
It's like a plan on the rink.

400
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,520
So that was full. That was in that phase three.

401
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,800
I I have lost track of the phases have shifted so many times.

402
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,040
Honestly, it seems exactly the same way that the California government

403
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,720
is going about reopening businesses out here with the switching around

404
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
in phases confused. Yeah.

405
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,560
Jumping around in the order.

406
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,520
Yeah, actually, I saw some literature not calling these phases,

407
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,280
but rather calling them chapters.

408
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,440
What are opening this in chapters?

409
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,880
So just to just to iterate,

410
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,280
this is a multibillion dollar scheme

411
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,120
that out of the gate isn't working great, that's devoted to opening things

412
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,200
in small chapters and that also is related to DreamWorks.

413
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,920
It's on the back of DreamWorks characters.

414
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
It's all a tad quibbysque, wouldn't you say?

415
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,840
Is that a is that a boo?

416
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,120
I think, yeah, I was booing.

417
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
I think he booed there.

418
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,760
Why does he have a show on Quibi or something?

419
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah, he loves Quibi.

420
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
Yeah, he loves it. He loves it.

421
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,640
They gave a show to the American Dream Ball Keeper.

422
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
Yeah, that's right.

423
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,200
He they heard him on the show.

424
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,280
He was in he was mixed in there with a lot of other famous keepers.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,920
So they felt like he had a high Q rating.

426
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,800
OK, well, it was from exposure.

427
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,080
They didn't give us they didn't give us a show, but they gave a show to this one

428
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,920
ghost deep two hours into a podcast.

429
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,640
Yeah, yeah, he he's got a producer credit on the most dangerous game.

430
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Well, congrats on the Emmy

431
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,360
nominations.

432
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,040
It's been a been a big week for the American Dream Keeper.

433
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
This is really small potatoes.

434
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,800
I can see why he's he's checking his phone.

435
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
He's like getting congrats on the Emmy stuff.

436
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,960
So that's why he's not.

437
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,120
Hey, Len, call me.

438
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,880
He just said, hey, Len, call me.

439
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
He's like doing deals with Len.

440
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,280
I think he's talking about Len Testa from touring plans

441
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,840
and the Disney dish.

442
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,080
Wow. He's just big.

443
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah, I see he's on his phone.

444
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,320
He's just like he's yeah, he's wheeling and dealing right now.

445
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,760
Well, why we give him one shit like what else?

446
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,920
What other function would there be for this guy?

447
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,920
And he uses his time with us to be on his phone to try to do

448
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,360
business deals with people using our platform to listen.

449
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,040
Listen, Mr.

450
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,280
Keeper, happy to have you, but you're being a little disrespectful.

451
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,920
Hey, boys, shut the fuck up.

452
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
He's so mean to us.

453
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,240
He's so much meaner than the sector keeper who got a little ornery

454
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
with all with all the vape.

455
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,840
But this guy's like 20 times worse.

456
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,600
Yeah, sector keeper was like polite.

457
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,000
He would be like, oh, I think maybe we should move on or whatever.

458
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,040
But he's yeah, this American Dream Keeper right to the point.

459
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,080
God, well, he's probably just he feels burnt by how long it's taken

460
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,680
his mall namesake to open and then only to culminate in this disaster.

461
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,760
Should we go backwards in time and talk about the seeds of this crazy thing?

462
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,400
Yeah, I think so. Mm hmm.

463
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,000
As Jason, as you said,

464
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
this was not always called the American Dream.

465
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,480
You know, I think there were maybe proposals for doing something like this

466
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,320
in the New Jersey area as far back as 96.

467
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,600
But I think it didn't really kick into gear until the early 2000s

468
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,920
when it was supposed to be called Xanadu.

469
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,640
And you might know Xanadu as the ancient city of regal splendor

470
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,360
or the ELO song with Olivia Newton, John,

471
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,720
or the giant castle where Charles Foster Kane died alone.

472
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,880
If you want to, you really want to associate

473
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,120
your incredibly ambitious real estate project

474
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,560
with a film that is popular because it bombed.

475
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,000
Like that's the if I and I love Xanadu is one of my favorite movies.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
But like the point is that it's a big disaster.

477
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,920
They like they might as well have called this mall the Ishtar

478
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,800
or the or the or the Gilly.

479
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
That which I was synonymous with failure.

480
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,520
Yeah. Isn't that is is is that a New Jersey or am I just conflating it with Jersey?

481
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
That's Jersey girl. Jersey girl.

482
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Well, when you're thinking of J.

483
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,120
Lowe and Affleck, that's those are the two.

484
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,040
Those are the two J.

485
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,960
Lowe Affleck films. Right.

486
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,720
That's they never completed the trilogy of that.

487
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,600
There should have been a third.

488
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,120
That's something they should get around to.

489
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,480
You should do a zoom reunion film.

490
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,680
I mean, Kevin Smith's eventually going to start doing sequels of the

491
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,240
the ones didn't work.

492
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,520
I mean, he's so like you would think scraping Jersey girl, too, needs to happen.

493
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
I think, yeah, sure.

494
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,240
It's time. Oh, sorry, Ben Affleck couldn't make it again.

495
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Now it's going to be Jason Muse.

496
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,560
Yeah. Playing the key happened to be available.

497
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,040
Playing the character that we for sure know the name of

498
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
that we definitely know.

499
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,600
And I assume you're pulling your phone out for an unrelated.

500
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm setting an alarm for later.

501
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,040
Setting an alarm for the morning.

502
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:46,640
But yeah, we're all, of course, talking about, OK, my phone, not Ali Trink.

503
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,000
That's his character.

504
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
Ben Affleck is Ali Trink.

505
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
Is that a reference to Oliver?

506
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,600
Oliver, is it Oliver Queen, the green arrow?

507
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,680
I just because of the Oliver part.

508
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,720
I just guess I think was writing around that.

509
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,120
He was writing green arrow on that time, so it's possible.

510
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,160
Yeah. Ali Trink is a tribute to Oliver Queen.

511
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,960
I guess I mean, I guess it's possible.

512
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
It's only half of it is the same, but not still not the same.

513
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,040
But I wouldn't bet everything I own on that.

514
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,480
OK. Anyway, the part of the reason this was called Xanadu is because there had been a

515
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,800
mega mall in Madrid called Madrid Xanadu.

516
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,160
And an aspect of that was a huge indoor

517
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,640
ice not rink.

518
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
What's the word? A list?

519
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,760
Hill, an indoor hill.

520
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,720
Ski slope. Ski slope.

521
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,520
There. Sorry. Thanks.

522
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,880
That they had something called the Madrid Snow Zone.

523
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,960
So the idea of building a big place in an urban area

524
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,680
with a huge slope that was indoor that you could go to all year round.

525
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,760
If it worked in Madrid, surely it will work in New Jersey.

526
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,080
See why not the same climates.

527
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,160
So and this whole project sort of came out,

529
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,800
I think the initial people who started it was the Mills Corporation.

530
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,280
And when I heard this, I went, oh, of course, I could I could smell Mills stink

531
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
from this from a mile away.

532
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,000
If you don't know Mills, this isn't general Mills.

533
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,360
This is you. You might in your area have a Mills Mall in California.

534
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,880
There's the Ontario Mills, which is home to the last remaining

535
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,160
Rainforest Cafe in California and Florida.

536
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,600
I believe there's the Sawgrass Mills, Potomac Mills.

537
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
There's a whole bunch of them.

538
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,640
And the thing uniting all of them is that they suck shit.

539
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,440
This is I'm a mall aficionado.

540
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
I love malls. The Mills are

541
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,400
hellscapes. Like if I don't know if I did wrong in this life,

542
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,560
I think I would spend all eternity just doing an endless loop in a Mills Mall.

543
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,720
And it's always something Mills.

544
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,680
Is that how you know?

545
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,360
Not every Mills says Mills, but if it says Mills,

546
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,120
then it used to be a Mills.

547
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,680
Now Mills is defunct. Mills was bought by Simon. Right.

548
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,160
Because we because we had a place called Gurney Mills that we would go to.

549
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,000
Mm hmm. And it is, of course, now a Simon Center, according to Wikipedia.

550
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,880
It has become a Simon Center.

551
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,320
So no Mills is a Mills anymore.

552
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,600
So no Mills is a Mills anymore.

553
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,800
And Franklin Mills in Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia,

554
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,880
formerly owned by the Mills Corporation and now, of course,

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,960
owned by Simon Property Group.

556
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,560
OK, OK.

557
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,960
Mike, was it the same deal with you was Gurney Mills like a because the

558
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,320
the Mills that I know about are just these like aesthetic free

559
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,520
nightmares where you go, you just walk in this big loop

560
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,360
that never ends and it'll say like Group Five and Group Two.

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,920
And it tells you what the stores are, but those aren't themed in any way.

562
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,880
It's not like here's the entertainment district.

563
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,600
It's just like, I don't know, Group Two has DSW.

564
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Group Five has Marshalls. Figure it out.

565
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
It kind of felt my memory.

566
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,800
Now, this is another one where I'm going to get a phone call from my mom

567
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,480
as soon as I say this, because she's going to dispute this

568
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,040
and say Gurney Mills was wonderful.

569
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,760
We had a great time going there.

570
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,720
But my memory of it was it was more like an it felt like an outlet mall

571
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,840
in the sense that you were kind of confused.

572
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,120
And then you didn't like there wasn't like these big, cool things.

573
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,160
Like Woodfowl, Woodfield Mall used to be or how some of these other

574
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,240
better malls used to be.

575
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
Yes, that's my memory.

576
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,840
No, no distinct architecture.

577
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,280
It's like you're in a like a narrow airplane hangar.

578
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah, it's like I mean, the Citadel out here is the outlet mall that's outdoors.

579
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,560
And I'm so confused at the Citadel and I've been there a handful of times.

580
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,320
But it's always like you're just looking at a map five times

581
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,240
and you don't remember where you were.

582
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,320
And it's outdoors.

583
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,800
You should know in relation to the parking lot where you are.

584
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,480
But it's like it's confusing.

585
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,320
It's it's meant it's like a it's a casino.

586
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,800
It's the casino type vibe where it's like meant to confuse you.

587
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,840
You're meant to be stuck in there all day.

588
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,720
Just kind of the equivalent of doing a yard sale or you just kind of like

589
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,600
dump a bunch of shit on your lawn and say, I know you look around, figure out.

590
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,840
Yeah, they really like cheat, like cheat the difference between outlet

591
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
mall and regular mall.

592
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,000
But it doesn't kind of it didn't have the like relaxing

593
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,160
inoffensiveness of most standard, like local malls.

594
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,360
Yeah, yeah, that's that's pretty accurate.

595
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,400
So the fact that this is this huge,

596
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,080
unpleasant, like just massive sprawling complex

597
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,080
and that that color scheme feels very milsy because again,

598
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm a big I'm such a big mall fan and I like

599
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,720
the aesthetics of malls are often why I like them so much.

600
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,840
I was just relooking at photos from our trip to the Woodfield Mall,

601
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,600
which has, you know, changed modernized, gotten a little more bland,

602
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,640
but still like crazy ceilings and crazy multi-tiered.

603
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,600
You know, this bridge goes into this staircase and it looks very futuristic.

604
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,760
The outside of when it was Xanadu, when Chris Christie called it

605
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,000
the ugliest damn building in New Jersey.

606
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,280
I mean, the detail I don't have a picture in front of me,

607
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
but the details I wrote down is it's a lot of this is a big stretch

608
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
with brown and orange stripes.

609
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,320
And then green and blue checkerboard like like it's

610
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,040
it's it's like you just took seven unrelated buildings

611
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
and just smash them together and all their color schemes are different.

612
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,200
And that ski slope one, which, you know, is sloped, it looks broken.

613
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,880
It looks like Godzilla picked up a building and then threw it down

614
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,960
and it landed wrong.

615
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,040
Yeah, it's just I can see why Christie hated it.

616
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:11,360
So great choice of words, Scott, because that building back in February of 2011,

617
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,920
there was record snowfalls in the area.

618
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
And at some point,

619
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,160
oh, workers were attempting to melt snow off the ski slopes roof.

620
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,400
And ice buildup caused the eastern wall to fall and suffer a partial collapse

621
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,200
along an approximately 150 foot length of roof.

622
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,960
Oh, my God.

623
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,760
It collapsed because of the fake ski slope

624
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,920
collapse due to real snow on the top.

625
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,280
Yes, that's right.

626
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,680
And they said, you know what?

627
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,320
We don't think it's going to affect the integrity of the building.

628
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,920
So they just filed an insurance claim to get somebody to cover the damage.

629
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,520
So so it was never like super reinforced.

630
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,680
They never started over.

631
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,440
Like what what people were skiing on earlier this year is the same structure.

632
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Yeah, it seems like it sure seems like it.

633
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,040
So if enough people were at the top waiting, it might just all like tip

634
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
down and down.

635
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,920
It might be sloped the other way by the end of the hour.

636
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,960
Huh? That is what there's got to be a crazier thing

637
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,040
you could put in there than a artificial ski slope, right?

638
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,800
Or is that the height of what's possible at this point?

639
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,400
Definitely very odd.

640
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,200
It's the most this whole mall is like the most Dubai ish.

641
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,720
Yes, that's absolutely what it feels like a Dubai feature.

642
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah, it would be stranger if that was like,

643
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,880
you know, if you made it like a big mud run, like, you know,

644
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,720
if it was all recreating tough mudder, there was a tough mudder in there.

645
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,120
That's tough mudder.

646
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,240
Tough Mudder is like one of the companies that does those like mud like challenges

647
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,400
where you have to get like in the mud, you have to crawl through like electricity.

648
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
You have to dive in water.

649
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,280
You have to scale a tall wall.

650
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,360
I don't know. They used to be much cooler a couple of years

651
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,760
or much more, I think, like popular a couple of years ago.

652
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
Oh, I don't know. Tough Mudder.

653
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,000
I guess, yeah, if there was a perennial year round tough mudder.

654
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
God, that would have to get me to say.

655
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
I think Dubai, though, is a very good comparison

656
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,200
because there's this great George Saunders essay.

657
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
George Saunders, the author, MacArthur Genius Grant recipient,

658
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,280
he wrote a very poetic essay about like like trying to going to Dubai

659
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,080
and trying to understand it and like the poetry of the ski.

660
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,840
They have an indoor ski slope and is just surrounded by kids

661
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,960
who had never seen snow.

662
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,000
They live in the in the desert and they're just amazed by it.

663
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,240
In Bergen County gets plenty of snow.

664
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,720
I don't know that anyone's amazed by this.

665
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
Even you're absolutely right.

666
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,440
And there was a news report that I watched

667
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,720
about the ski slope that, you know, they like they roped Lindsey Vonn

668
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,320
into doing a run and, you know, all right, I'll cash that check.

669
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
And, you know, they they had a bunch of skiers there who gave it a shot

670
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,400
and they all finished and went like, this guy was short, short,

671
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,760
pretty short run. But, you know, it's a good place to like tune up,

672
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,680
you know, before you go to the real mountain.

673
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,080
That's that's the biggest praise anyone could say on television.

674
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,120
Is there I mean, would there be a chance that we could save them all

675
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,360
by maybe moving just the winter Olympics to the mall and have everybody in a bubble

676
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,080
like in the NBA in Orlando?

677
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,200
So you'd have all the Olympic skiers living at this mall,

678
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,960
and then they would just do the Olympics on that ski slope.

679
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,640
Maybe that's a solution, I'm saying, for money for the mall.

680
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,560
I guess you could say for the NHL as well.

681
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,440
It could be residential, too, because there's plenty.

682
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320
You know, they got plenty of space that isn't used.

683
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,720
So, you know, every athlete gets to pick, you know, do you want to stay in a

684
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,600
Zara? Do you want to stay in a, you know, Claire's?

685
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,280
Like, it's up to you.

686
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,400
There's so you get an entire store to yourself.

687
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,520
The higher seated skiers will get to be in the higher level stores,

688
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,240
the more expensive stores.

689
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,840
You get a

690
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,120
blooming dales if you're if you've won a gold medal before.

691
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,240
Right. That makes a lot of sense.

692
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,920
Yeah. Before moving on from the way it looks, there is that Chris Christie quote,

693
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,040
but another government official weighed in because

694
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,840
this is a at some point, the Toronto based architect

695
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,040
behind the original style of the building was summoned to appear

696
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,320
before state officials and, quote, explain himself.

697
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:47,120
In which case, at this event, state senator Loretta Weinberg said,

698
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,800
that's one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen in my life.

699
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,120
It looks like something my four year old granddaughter might build with Legos.

700
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,560
Wow. Oh, yeah.

701
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,520
The second he thinks that's yucky. Yeah.

702
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,080
He said, yuck. All right. Well, we're on.

703
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
Hey, we're on the same page.

704
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,200
We've had our disagreements so far, but I think as long as we talk about things

705
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,280
you don't like, you know, we'll get plenty out of you.

706
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,200
Hey, boys, shut the fuck up there.

707
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,920
And I was being nice to you.

708
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,560
Yeah, you were being nice and he did.

709
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,960
He just shut it right down.

710
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,600
That's the sort of used in a non Nick Mundy episode I've ever felt.

711
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,520
Yeah, that's the sort of frank analysis

712
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,280
you can only really get from a true Hollywood power player.

713
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,000
That's true. You know, doesn't pull punches.

714
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,040
An old school type producer type, really.

715
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,240
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

716
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,480
Always willing to call me.

717
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,160
Oh, he's still trying to get Len tested to call him back.

718
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
Although why, Len?

719
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,320
I don't know. That's what he says.

720
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,840
He's saying it. I don't have anything to do with it.

721
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,960
Yeah, strange.

722
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,680
So anyways, the Mills Corporation

723
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,560
builds a building that's as ugly as all the Mills buildings.

724
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,360
There was a lot of back and forth of will we be able to do this?

725
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,760
You know, they did build this on.

726
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,120
Is it is it wetlands?

727
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,520
What kind of a marsh?

728
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,440
A marsh.

729
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,760
That was the original.

730
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,520
OK, the original site was going to be wetlands.

731
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,920
And then the EPA got involved in the Army Corps of Engineers.

732
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,160
And I think they just said, fuck it and made it protected like nature preserve.

733
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
And then they moved it like just slightly.

734
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,840
Move that was out.

735
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,200
And that was OK.

736
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,880
So all right.

737
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,320
So they fended off the EPA and all these.

738
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,480
And by the way, they've never had a good relationship with the

739
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,240
New Jersey Sports Board, whatever the actual name of it is.

740
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,640
But, you know, the giants and the jets have never been super psyched

741
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,680
on this operation due to the traffic that it would bring.

742
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,840
So they've been fighting it.

743
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,840
But eventually they they punched their way through and got it going.

744
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,120
And they heralded their

745
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,960
perma fixture status in New Jersey.

746
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,640
They they they had they held an event in 2004,

747
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,600
a groundbreaking event at which they also claimed

748
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,400
this is the beginning of a 75 year lease for Xanadu.

749
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,720
We'll be here for at least 75 years.

750
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,360
And this is in 2004, meaning that the first 16 years

751
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,480
of the 75 have been been vacant

752
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,840
and many more probably will be as well.

753
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,240
Wow. This event

754
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,680
was a this was a one night party for which there were 400 attendees

755
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,400
and and the cost of this one single party, one million dollars.

756
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,480
Wow.

757
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,320
Which I see low, honestly low, by the way.

758
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,800
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

759
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,040
What if you had 10 million dollars, it would have kind of been

760
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,720
the same reaction like that's too much.

761
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,800
But oh, well, I guess they have that money.

762
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,360
Any amount would be in line with the waste of this thing.

763
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,280
And if I if I could sort of like,

764
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,160
you know, beginning of Disney specials,

765
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,720
say some of the things that you would experience if you went to this party.

766
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,960
It's a 75 year groundbreaking of Xanadu with your hosts,

767
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,280
Christie Brinkley, Chris Harrison from The Bachelor,

768
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,920
celebrity chef Todd English,

769
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,840
array of fancy filet mignon and cigars,

770
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,520
a fashion show from Elle magazine, a performance by the cast of Stomp

771
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,440
and an appearance from a governor who is in the process

772
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,760
of of resigning in disgrace.

773
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,280
Which one?

774
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,280
This is McGreevy.

775
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,280
Yeah. Oh, yeah. OK.

776
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,840
McGreevy was in a sex scandal,

777
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,560
which you would have to describe as being

778
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,840
pulling a spacey in that he did some harassing

779
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,080
and then said, well, here's the thing, I'm gay.

780
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,000
So you forgive me, right?

781
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,600
No, no one forgave him.

782
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,560
That's not an excuse.

783
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,800
And he said he said I will step down in several months between those several months.

784
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,560
He hosted a fun event with Chris Harrison and Todd English.

785
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,360
Like, why was he there?

786
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,120
Wow. Get out of there.

787
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,040
That's a par for the course for New Jersey politicians.

788
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,560
This project goes from McGreevy scandal to Bridgegate to Covid.

789
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,080
It's how long you can measure it in financial crisis.

790
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,360
Don't forget. Well, we certainly won't.

791
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,640
That definitely comes into play.

792
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,560
Can I just say also that I went in looking up,

793
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,920
I was not aware of this Jim McGreevy story before, but yeah,

794
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,320
he resigned in this shady way.

795
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,280
But don't worry, he's doing better now.

796
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,280
And there's actually a documentary about his redemption

797
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,240
and all the good work that he's done since all of this.

798
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,280
And that documentary is directed by Nancy Pelosi's daughter.

799
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
What?

800
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,440
She's the one.

801
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,240
She's the one who warned about our faves, that our faves might be implicated.

802
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,760
She's the wait. She's who said faves.

803
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,520
I believe so. I believe that was Nancy Pelosi's daughter.

804
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,840
Hey, wait, Alexandra or Alessandra.

805
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,160
You announce the director again real quick.

806
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,360
What? Like as if you were just announcing it again, who it's directed by.

807
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,760
Oh, this is a this is a film about harassing

808
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,520
Governor's redemption directed by Nancy Pelosi's daughter.

809
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,400
Wow. An air horn.

810
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,200
I guess, yeah, the keeper has an air horn he wanted to use.

811
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,920
He was he was like whispering into me to get you to do that again.

812
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,200
That was his reaction to this.

813
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,480
Is he does he like Nancy Pelosi or?

814
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,920
Yeah, he likes. Yeah, yeah.

815
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,440
He's a big he's a big contributor to the Democratic Party.

816
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,800
Oh, big, big Pelosi fan.

817
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,600
Loves her costumes.

818
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,040
Yeah, I think that's I think, you know, from now, maybe from now on,

819
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,680
that's when he's saying sort of like an affirmative thing, like a yes.

820
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,840
OK, OK. So sector keeper here.

821
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,360
Well, let's let's test it.

822
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,640
American Dream Keeper.

823
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,960
If you do, you want to continue using your air horn

824
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,160
instead of saying the verbal word yes.

825
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,120
Perfect. There you go.

826
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,240
Very Long Island. The cool.

827
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,400
This is fun. I'm coming around on this guy.

828
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,480
We're we're we're finding out how it works. Yeah.

829
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,040
Yeah. So after this

830
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,160
million dollar party,

831
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,080
they built some of the mall and then ran out of money in 2006.

832
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,440
Then a second developer took it over.

833
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,880
And in 2008 came the Great Recession.

834
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,760
So that they pretty quickly timed out two years seems to be

835
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,480
that's as far as anybody made it for a little while.

836
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,440
And in that time, it was like, well, who then will take over Xanadu?

837
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,160
This is fertile ground.

838
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,320
Somebody has to and a lot of organizations looked at it, considered it.

839
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,680
This is New York in the 2000s.

840
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,400
So, you know, who's got to get involved or at least consider getting involved?

841
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,120
Our old pal Donald Trump.

842
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,800
Oh, Trump Organization.

843
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,640
The Trump Organization takes a look at Xanadu.

844
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,040
What do they got? How much have they built?

845
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,440
Let's crunch the numbers. You know what?

846
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,840
This doesn't sound good. I think we're going to walk away.

847
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,080
Trump didn't. This is a thing.

848
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,520
This is a disaster that Trump did not get himself embroiled in.

849
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,200
Amazing. Trump, a guy who's never not like to spawn right into a disaster.

850
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,440
If there's one near him, he's magnetically right.

851
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
It's like he gravitates right to it.

852
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,560
He loves something that's going to just go horribly wrong.

853
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,400
And then so Xanadu was too wrong for him.

854
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,160
Yes. Like, can I take like a little match sized fire

855
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,280
and get a mile long blazing inferno?

856
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,160
Yeah, not not for him.

857
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,760
So then they didn't know what to do for a long time.

858
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,440
And I think it sat vacant and Chris Christie was mad.

859
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,960
And you know what? This has been marring our skyline for so long.

860
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,600
And we don't we got we got to do something about this.

861
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,200
Then he his administration crunched numbers

862
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,680
and saw that it would cost them the city 50 to 100 million dollars to demolish it.

863
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,480
So they said, well, let's get somebody else in there then, shall we?

864
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,520
Suddenly getting rid of it didn't seem so bad.

865
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,800
I could live with the ugly building. Sounds good to me.

866
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,520
So that is when they threw it out to some other people.

867
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,080
And then it was awarded to this company, Triple Five.

868
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,480
This is around 20.

869
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,120
No, no, no. They I don't know what year they came on board, but

870
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,520
I mean, 2011, 2011.

871
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,360
And as I said, West Edmonton Mall, their first hit,

872
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
they topped it even with the Mall of America.

873
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,120
They are the kings of entertainment fused with retail.

874
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,920
So it's a big deal. They're there.

875
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,080
If anybody can save this, it's them.

876
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,400
And did you guys find how they announced their arrival onto this project?

877
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,240
No. So this is a this is a family, I should say, also Triple Five.

878
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,960
But it's it's it's I think five members of a family

879
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,720
who've been involved in it at various times.

880
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,200
And if you know the pronunciation, tell me. But Girmesian.

881
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,280
It's a Girmesian family.

882
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,320
Your Girmesian family.

883
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,560
And this is straight from an article made from Bloomberg or something.

884
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,000
The Girmesians announced their arrival in 2011

885
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,960
with a rousing news conference soundtracked by Bruce Springsteen's The Rising.

886
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,840
Come on up for the rise.

887
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,640
Ladies and gentlemen, the Girmesian family.

888
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Come on up for the rise in the night.

889
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,560
So what did 10 years earlier been a stirring post 9-11 anthem?

890
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,760
Now is the soundtrack for five businessmen walking out of a trailer.

891
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,160
I at least Bruce wasn't doing playing live.

892
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,880
That's not that I saw.

893
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,000
No, they didn't loop him into this.

894
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,240
It's going to be a great mall.

895
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
I just want to bless this mall with my music.

896
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,120
We open up that ski slope.

897
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,280
Let me tell you, I'm I'm tearing off my shirt.

898
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,840
I'm going down, going straight down

899
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,280
a lot of hard on Brad on Bruce's belly.

900
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,240
A lot of hardworking teens are going to be pressing the go button

901
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,080
on the TMNT roller coaster, the Shellraiser.

902
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,400
I just want to shout out to those hardworking teens.

903
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,480
Look, it's so easy to get here from Manhattan.

904
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,280
It's just a straight shot through the Lincoln Tunnel.

905
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,880
Then you go through Weehawken, then through Secaucus and you're there.

906
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,080
They should have at least gone like Weinberg, Max Weinberg to show up

907
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,120
or Nils Jalkren to just play drums.

908
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,320
Yeah.

909
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,960
Play along to a track.

910
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,440
He could use the construction gear like he flips over the helmets

911
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,760
and the buckets. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

912
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,160
That's fun. That is fun.

913
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,320
Ladies and gentlemen, the Bruce Springsteen won.

914
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,880
You know, he would he would have done it, too, if they asked him

915
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,280
a couple hundred bucks. Max will do it.

916
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,440
Well, if they called the mall the Max Weinberg Mall from now on.

917
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,960
Oh, yeah. Well, I put my name in the marquee, then sure.

918
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,600
So armed with the state's promise of financial assistance.

919
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,000
Here you go, Garmezians.

920
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,120
Take money, please.

921
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,760
They redesigned and expanded the complex, renaming it American Dream Meadowlands.

922
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,040
Now, here's a weird thing.

923
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,040
So as I said, West Edmonton Mall, Mall of America,

924
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,600
they were always looking for a place to do their third.

925
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,360
We have to close out the trilogy, right?

926
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,320
And they tried to do it all over the country, all over the world.

927
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,400
They were way into it in Niagara Falls.

928
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,000
Even Burbank was talked about, and I couldn't find any more info.

929
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,320
But so there was almost a world where there was a mega mall in this style

930
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,680
called in downtown Burbank.

931
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Where could that? Yeah, would have been right, like in the area by the three AMCs.

932
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,840
I you would have to think.

933
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,160
And and I wonder if that because, you know, Disney almost built there.

934
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,640
That thing that I love so much, they almost built a mini MGM studios

935
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,000
where the perfect.

936
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,280
Right. And there's been talk of doing a full like Americana

937
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,480
thing where the Ikea is.

938
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,080
I know. Oh, is that the discussion?

939
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,360
I think that might be gone, though.

940
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,600
That was a few years ago.

941
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,360
And now, of course, that Ikea is being used or was being used to shoot.

942
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,440
Flores lava, lava.

943
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,920
Wait, really? Yeah, that's where they should have filmed.

944
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,200
Yep. That's where the lava is.

945
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,120
The lava is over in the abandoned, not abandoned, but shut down.

946
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,800
Burbank, Ikea.

947
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,960
They the contestants that they at the end, they just go out to double doors.

948
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,480
And I'm trying to figure out which entrance is.

949
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,520
If you could see the California Pizza Kitchen, you'll know.

950
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah. Which entrance?

951
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, no, that's the corner bakery.

952
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,080
That's the entrance on the other side. OK. Yeah.

953
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,440
This is a big sign.

954
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,360
This is other double doors by the Macy's.

955
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,720
I don't know. I'd have to I'd have to check.

956
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,360
Keeper, what do you think?

957
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,840
Which which entrance north, southeast or west?

958
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,760
Shut the fuck up.

959
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,920
OK. Yeah. It's a little inside Burbank.

960
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,040
Yeah. I was playing with fire there.

961
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,720
I should have known what I was going to get.

962
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,560
Anyway, the weird thing about all this is that the Gremesians,

963
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,880
they in 1995 got some one of the closest that they'd gotten to

964
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,840
to building their next mega mall in Silver Spring, Maryland,

965
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,600
and they're in the Baltimore area.

966
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,480
And that was going to be called the American dream.

967
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,040
They have been sitting on this name.

968
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,120
We someday we will build our ultimate grand masterpiece.

969
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,680
Really, it's there.

970
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,240
It's like they're Synecdoche, New York.

971
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,600
That's like a big indoor New York area.

972
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
You know, now

973
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,880
that ended it all ended very sadly.

974
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,640
This really is a lot of illusions with Synecdoche, New York.

975
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,080
But anyway, yeah, in 1995, they tried to build the American dream.

976
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,640
They've been pursuing the American dream since 1995.

977
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,640
And the whole story there is that they expected a lot of it

978
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,560
to be built with public money.

979
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,600
They thought, well, Maryland should be begging us.

980
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,440
They should be throwing money at us.

981
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,160
And and at some point they, you know, when it didn't go that way

982
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,240
and they realized they needed to pay for it all, they just got out of there

983
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,000
and left. So this American dream thing so long in the making.

984
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,560
Yeah, that's interesting.

985
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,080
I mean, I guess that's just like a creative pursuit.

986
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,360
I'm trying to think of something.

987
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,880
It's like a Chinese democracy or something.

988
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,400
It's like a title that Axl Rose had in his head for years.

989
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,640
I mean, they finally released it, but it took decades for Chinese

990
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,840
democracy to come out.

991
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,800
The album Guns N' Roses made.

992
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,960
I don't want to loop back around to what we've already covered,

993
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,600
but sort of like a clerks three, you know, when you know that the third one

994
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,240
will be the best by far.

995
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,800
Yeah, it's going to be the most.

996
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,120
Yeah, you're excited about clerks three.

997
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,360
Do you think that curse three stands to be the best of the clerks?

998
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,800
Shouldn't should have known. Yeah.

999
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,120
Do you hope that the gang's still working at the at the

1000
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,640
save and stop or whatever the fuck it is?

1001
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,880
Quick stop.

1002
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,120
Do you hope that they're just, you know, back there like always, you know,

1003
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,080
and they don't grow up and either do we?

1004
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,280
Right. Very good. Very good. Very good.

1005
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,640
So do you?

1006
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,960
Hey, wait, hold on one more question.

1007
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,440
Do you hope they're not even supposed to be there that day?

1008
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,040
Wait, I mean, the keeper didn't.

1009
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,760
His he played the horn wrong. Sorry.

1010
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,720
There we go. OK, that's right.

1011
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,120
I watched him. He was like tapping on the battery.

1012
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,880
I think he was having some some trouble, but everything's OK now.

1013
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,720
The American dream does seem tailor made to be this location for mall rats, too.

1014
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,240
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1015
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:34,960
It's big enough.

1016
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,080
I think you could film multiple mall films in different wings.

1017
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,480
Simultaneously. Yeah.

1018
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah. You could film all rats two and three simultaneously in the mall

1019
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,520
and you never run into the crews.

1020
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1021
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,480
Is there a good you could I mean, that indoor ski slope is begging for

1022
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,560
you could make that also a movie bubble

1023
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,600
and do kind of a 80s sex romp ski school sort of film

1024
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,160
that's completely protected, you know, about teens.

1025
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,720
Having the wildest summer of their lives at an working at the indoor ski slope.

1026
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah, no, I think that sounds good.

1027
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,680
I think. Yeah.

1028
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,440
He thinks it sounds good as well. Yeah.

1029
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,760
Um, do you have any ideas of anybody we could sort of wheel and deal with

1030
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,000
who might want to put their money into this and produce this film?

1031
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,720
Oh, this. Wait, hold on. He's got.

1032
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,160
Please welcome the co-founder of Casa Migos Tequila, Randy Gerber, Randy.

1033
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,320
Now, wait, wait a minute, keeper.

1034
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,760
You just opened your mouth and then spoke with a different voice.

1035
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,800
There was a man that was partially applause and then partially

1036
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,840
a guy talking about Randy Gerber, my least favorite thing

1037
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,720
we talk about on this show.

1038
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,640
Are you? Yeah, you've confirmed.

1039
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,040
All right. That's what you did.

1040
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,240
He's like magic, though.

1041
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,880
He's like a spirit so he can do that. He can change his voice.

1042
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,040
But you asked the question.

1043
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,280
Yeah, he can inhabit different.

1044
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,360
Can he do topical comedy?

1045
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,160
He can.

1046
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,880
Would you like to give us an example of some topical comedy?

1047
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,600
Or would you prefer that we moved on?

1048
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,920
Please welcome the co-founder of Casa Migos Tequila, Randy Gerber, Randy.

1049
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,320
Shut the fuck up.

1050
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,120
That is topical, though, because Casa Migos is on the lips

1051
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,160
of every American at the moment because they're just drinking a little more

1052
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,920
during this depressing time.

1053
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,360
Drinking that? Why?

1054
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,480
Yeah, because it's one of the best.

1055
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,880
It's the best tequila on the market next to Terra Mana, the Rocks Tequila,

1056
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,360
which I also now have a fascination with.

1057
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,560
What's up with Terra?

1058
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,600
Oh, it's the Rock.

1059
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,400
The Rock has now his own tequila.

1060
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,920
So I'm not saying I'm jumping ship from Casa Migos.

1061
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,320
I'm still Casa Migos for life.

1062
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,760
I'm just saying I'm a little bit intrigued.

1063
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,880
But if the Rocks Tequila was good enough,

1064
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,640
you might not talk about Casa Migos anymore.

1065
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,080
Fingers crossed.

1066
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,680
Let me think.

1067
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,560
Huh? Let me think.

1068
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,000
Hey, boys, shut the fuck up.

1069
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,360
Oh, yeah. You know what?

1070
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,840
I don't even want to think about he's right.

1071
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,920
Let's think about the Rock.

1072
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,680
I don't want to think about not talking about Randy Gerber anymore.

1073
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,560
Got enough irons in the fire.

1074
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,520
Yeah, that's fine to me.

1075
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,880
Anyway, the Gramezians pursuit of the American dream that it

1076
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,880
continued for them being from Canada.

1077
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,240
I think maybe the family goes back to Iran and they started, you know,

1078
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,200
that they did their first mall in Canada and now arrived here

1079
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,920
with the making the Mall of America.

1080
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,360
Now the American dream.

1081
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,680
It's for this whole thing being the American dream.

1082
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,640
And it slowly unraveling over the course of the early 2000s.

1083
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,880
It's like it's beautiful in a way, really.

1084
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,760
You know, it's the only way it could be.

1085
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,120
If there was a mall

1086
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,320
that called America's bloated corpse

1087
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:02,160
and that and that's the name of the mall and it and it caught on fire

1088
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,360
and it burned up, that's the only way there could be something

1089
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,240
like more on the nose than this this whole story.

1090
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Yeah, it's

1091
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,640
it does feel like like there's a book,

1092
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,920
like there will be a book written about in the mall as a metaphor for the country.

1093
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,440
And it's like, well, you know, this is too on the nose, isn't it?

1094
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,760
Is this kind of maybe don't call it the American dream?

1095
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,840
Yeah, it's like doesn't even sound like what malls are called.

1096
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,960
It doesn't make sense.

1097
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,600
Is America? Yeah.

1098
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,760
American dream is going on a roller coaster and then buying a purse.

1099
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,480
I mean, I guess I guess it is.

1100
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,960
But this point, I'd love to do both of those things.

1101
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,600
Yeah, I'd be I don't need a purse.

1102
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,240
I'd be so happy that a mall opened. I'd buy one. Sure.

1103
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,520
I want to go out now.

1104
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,680
I do want to go outside, but I don't necessarily want to go back inside

1105
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,640
to a huge. Yeah.

1106
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,720
But part of the thing with this is that I sent so many interviews with,

1107
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,080
I believe, Don Girmesian, the most vocal Girmesian, maybe the CEO.

1108
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,720
And he said how well, it's designed

1109
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,040
with all of the major entertainment zones very spread out.

1110
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Here's the water park. Here's the amusement park. Here's the ski slope.

1111
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,720
So on the way, you have to pass through all of the shops.

1112
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,360
There's no way around it.

1113
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,520
So it'll encourage shopping in all of these areas.

1114
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,160
But all of they had opened thus far was the amusement park.

1115
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,440
So they just sent people through shuttered stores.

1116
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,920
They didn't even have a sign.

1117
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,360
And you can see you watch like families shot by the news

1118
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,920
just walking past like white plywood after white plywood.

1119
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,760
That is I would think like,

1120
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,360
I don't I guess if the rides were good enough, you would ignore

1121
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,520
like empty storefronts and not find that stranger depressing.

1122
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,440
And they seem they seem it, right?

1123
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,920
They seem good.

1124
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,080
Uh, well, well, maybe

1125
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,040
the shell razor I'm talking about is like a roller coaster.

1126
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,080
It looks like in the middle of like some empty factory,

1127
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,280
they built a roller coaster that is lightly themed to the Ninja Turtles.

1128
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,240
I'm sure it's viscerally.

1129
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,400
I'm sure it's fun, you know, to get to get whipped around a little bit.

1130
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,320
I if you like coasters, it's I'm sure it's a good coaster.

1131
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,840
Yeah. So there's it's not nothing.

1132
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:28,000
No, it's supposedly this one of the steepest and if not the steepest in America.

1133
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,280
Something like that.

1134
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,840
It's one of those ones that kind of you go a little

1135
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,000
behind rather than going straight down, you like buck a little.

1136
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,200
It's a go down a little more to Eurofighter.

1137
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,320
They call it Eurofighter.

1138
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,440
Instead of you, you go straight up.

1139
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,520
If I guess if you call it 90 degrees and then you drop at 121 degrees.

1140
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,080
Yes, it is a little like lip.

1141
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,320
And the and the thing is that it raises you up

1142
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,640
into a little like cubby up at the top of the mall

1143
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,640
where you sit for a second and it serves as kind of a a temporary brief

1144
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,840
observatory deck where supposedly on a clear day, you could see the Statue of Liberty.

1145
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,600
You like get a New York view from the top of this thing while you creepily hang

1146
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,560
in a little like greenhouse sitting in a coaster car.

1147
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,160
Yeah. Now, here's this is a small gripe.

1148
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,520
But if the Shellraiser is the name of what the turtle that the newer cartoon,

1149
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,480
the turtles cartoon, what they called the party wagon or the turtle van,

1150
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,680
which was, of course, a vehicle.

1151
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,480
Everyone knows that.

1152
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,800
But if it's going high, why is this not a turtle blimp attraction?

1153
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,480
Why are you not they can't buy that off the shelf?

1154
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,240
Yeah. OK, that's fair.

1155
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,880
But why can't you just like call it like the turtle blimp or turtle plane or something?

1156
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,680
I don't know. I'm just saying if you go high, you're going to see the Statue of Liberty.

1157
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,680
The car isn't flying up there.

1158
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,520
Maybe somebody's going to tell me that the car flies and I don't know what I'm talking about.

1159
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,320
So anyway, that's just my flies now.

1160
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,960
It flies now.

1161
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Yeah, it flies.

1162
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,080
I really wish I'm I wish I had a soundboard that had that.

1163
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,560
That's why now I don't have a soundboard moment.

1164
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,800
But if I did have a soundboard, I wish it's right.

1165
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,520
You would want that in there. Yeah.

1166
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,440
It is really if you watch a ride through of it, it seems like,

1167
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,680
you know, you're zipping and zooming around and then you get to the main climb

1168
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,120
where you go all the way on your back and you you have to wait a while for.

1169
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,880
Oh, yeah. To get you.

1170
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,160
You just sit.

1171
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,760
It's like a coaster with a long pause.

1172
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,680
Would you do it, Scott? No, definitely not.

1173
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,800
This is it's a little similar to hang time.

1174
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,960
Hang time. Yeah.

1175
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,400
Did it not? So yeah, the straight on your back.

1176
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,480
That wouldn't do.

1177
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,720
Do you think, though, once we get out of quarantine, whenever it is,

1178
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,240
do you think that as soon as you're back in a park, you're going to like

1179
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,680
there'll be maybe an extra energy that you would like do at a crazier thing right away?

1180
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,800
Just because like, oh, my God, been inside so long.

1181
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,840
It's time to do hang time at knots.

1182
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,080
Um, or does that just mean you'll have a second glass of wine and leave?

1183
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,840
Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah. That's it.

1184
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,720
There you go.

1185
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,360
I wasn't sure how to answer and then you gave it to me.

1186
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,720
OK, got it. Got it.

1187
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,840
I at least pushed my boundaries at Disneyland, where now I am willing

1188
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,400
to do everything at Disney, although I wouldn't.

1189
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,320
I'm still not like going to constantly do Guardians, but I think now I'd happily do it.

1190
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,440
I'd very gladly do it. Yeah.

1191
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,720
Well, Disneyland doesn't have the scenic

1192
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,840
exposed industrial ceilings

1193
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:43,040
that all the entertainment offerings seem to have at the American dream.

1194
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,760
Boys, which exposed industrial ceiling is your favorite?

1195
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,440
OK. Oh, that's actually a good relevant question.

1196
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,640
I mean, I guess the towards the shell

1197
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,800
razor is preferable than the one over by the ropes course.

1198
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,880
But I'd I'd have to, you know, consult with my co-hosts.

1199
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Yeah. I mean, I look because the shell razor is there and it's IP that I love.

1200
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:15,400
I think that unfortunately influences me on my appreciation of the exposed ceiling.

1201
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,560
So I'm not totally unbiased when I say that that is my favorite of the ceilings.

1202
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,440
I think mine would probably be in the ski slope and big snow

1203
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:33,280
because the expectation, the concept art they posted was like blue skies

1204
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,640
and like glowing, glowing wavy lines.

1205
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,640
And what you got was actually exposed industrial beams.

1206
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,320
Yeah, you were you you sent us, yeah, like cozy indoor ski

1207
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,240
lodge backgrounds that you reach upon your landing.

1208
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,000
And then instead it's just it's like a warehouse.

1209
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,120
It's like a diagonal warehouse.

1210
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,800
It's pure white.

1211
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,240
So you so you prefer the ski pure white.

1212
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,640
And we are kind of more into the shell razor shell razor neck of the woods.

1213
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,680
Does that answer suffice?

1214
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,240
Well, actually, what's the do you have an answer?

1215
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,320
American Dream Keeper, do you have a do you have?

1216
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,960
I mean, it's your mall you represent.

1217
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,240
Do you do you have a favorite?

1218
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,760
Let me see. He does, I think.

1219
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,640
I think it's a lag on him. He's like scratching his head.

1220
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,840
Oh, OK. It's tough.

1221
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,800
It's tough for him to.

1222
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,640
Would you like to welcome the co-founder of Tosamigos Tequila,

1223
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,600
Randy Gerber and a you got to you got to cut that out.

1224
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,040
You know what you're doing with this, you know?

1225
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,800
He does. He's having a good time.

1226
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,760
He's having fun.

1227
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,040
No, he's he's he knows he knew that the way under my skin was to

1228
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,600
inhabit not Randy Gerber, but a man introducing Randy Gerber.

1229
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,000
Yeah, that's the most.

1230
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,960
Yeah, that'll dig dig a little knife in your back.

1231
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,760
Ladies and gentlemen, the founder of Tosamigos Tequila,

1232
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,320
Tosamigos Tequila, Randy Gerber, come on up for the ride.

1233
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,440
Oh, I like that. Yeah.

1234
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,440
You know, one one thing I wanted to mention about the Nickelodeon universe

1235
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,880
is they they like squeeze a lot of properties in there.

1236
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,880
And some of it's kind of like evergreen, like SpongeBob or the Ninja Turtles.

1237
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,080
But like the ropes course

1238
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,520
was the end of Legends of the Hidden Temple.

1239
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,160
And like there's Rugrats rides

1240
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,680
and like Fairly Invader Zim,

1241
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,480
which I think I was in high school when Invader Zim was on.

1242
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,960
I think Rugrats is coming back.

1243
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,320
And I wasn't there a Quibi Legends of the Hidden Temple adult show.

1244
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,040
I remember that like for adults to do the course.

1245
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,600
That's what I read.

1246
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,880
And either did it air or will it never be released?

1247
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,880
It's possible we could watch all of it right now.

1248
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,640
It's possible they filmed it in the Ikea in Burbank.

1249
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,120
We didn't know possible.

1250
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,680
It was nominated for seven Emmys today.

1251
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,160
Very possible. Yes.

1252
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,880
Um, I don't know.

1253
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,600
I mean, I do like the idea.

1254
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,640
How much how great would it be if there was a Nickelodeon theme park

1255
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,880
that like properly paid tribute to everything that they have currently?

1256
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,280
Oh, my God.

1257
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,840
Their history.

1258
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,640
And that would be nice.

1259
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,480
But this is sort of like a bunch of

1260
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,040
spinner rides and stuff that looks like Blue's Clues.

1261
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,760
That's about as far as it goes.

1262
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,240
Which I guess I should lower my expectations for a mall.

1263
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,600
But if this is going to get 40 million people,

1264
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,440
you know, it should be a little more than that.

1265
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,560
There should be some like dark ride, at least a simulator of some kind.

1266
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,400
Right. There's no simulator even.

1267
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,680
I know they don't even play that SpongeBob movie that's everywhere.

1268
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,280
Right. Yeah, that would be good.

1269
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,600
Yeah, it's yeah, it's there's got to be something.

1270
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,600
You got to give us a little bit.

1271
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,320
Our steaming nerds, you got to give us a little something.

1272
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,680
It can't just be it can't just be off the rack. Right.

1273
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,240
Well, they use the Viacom properties.

1274
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,200
And so I think what they could do is have a

1275
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,000
a simulator that simulates what it's like to watch MTV for 24 hours,

1276
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,560
which is ridiculousness for 23 hours in a row.

1277
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,120
That is yes.

1278
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,280
I assume that is what like that's not far from what the actual truth is.

1279
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,480
No, it quite honestly.

1280
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:24,080
Yeah. Like anyone go look at a schedule of what MTV is playing today.

1281
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,120
And you will see no less than eight hours of ridiculousness.

1282
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,160
Like guaranteed.

1283
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,600
Hey, you got to stick with what works, I guess.

1284
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
Yeah, you do.

1285
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:42,080
And which is a giant laptop that's a giant 2011 laptop that's open.

1286
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,560
Boys, there's a sugar.

1287
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,120
Make sure to talk about the sugar.

1288
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,680
Oh, yeah. Happily. No, no, no.

1289
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,560
We were thanks for planning on it.

1290
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,320
Yeah. Boys, boys, don't forget about the sugar.

1291
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,480
OK, yeah.

1292
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,320
Yes, we said yes.

1293
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,520
And sugar.

1294
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,680
It's a shame you guys didn't get a chance to see the Oreo cafe

1295
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,960
with the sugar called Oreo twisted.

1296
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,520
Well, the words were true.

1297
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,480
Would you give us some space to talk about?

1298
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
We love to talk about. Yeah.

1299
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,640
OK, well, it's like we can't possibly make you happy.

1300
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,600
Yeah, I don't know. He's so pleasing.

1301
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,880
He's just in a bad mood, I think.

1302
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,560
Geez. Well, yeah, let's let's talk about the sugar, I suppose.

1303
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,200
I haven't they haven't it sugar, our favorite brand.

1304
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,840
They came up in the city walk saga.

1305
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,200
It's where all the edible underwear and all that shit is.

1306
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,440
Yeah. And candy necklace thong.

1307
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,200
You can get a candy thong there.

1308
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,680
That's right. Yeah. Get candy piss there.

1309
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,920
I think. Yeah.

1310
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,080
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1311
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,000
We ran into this at in the Margaritaville Resort,

1312
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,600
Orlando area, Sunset Walk.

1313
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,880
Yeah. It's sugar is a perennial at all of the bizarre

1314
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,160
collapsing in front of our eyes shopping centers.

1315
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,360
I was looking through Comic Con photos from last year.

1316
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,920
Of course, I went to the it's sugar that was in the gas lamp in San Diego.

1317
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,280
Yeah. There's one on in like Long Beach, I think on the pier.

1318
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,080
Sure. Piers.

1319
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,880
Here's a good place.

1320
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,360
There's a street promenade. It's sugar, I believe, as well.

1321
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,280
Chicago Pier, I think, like a miniature one, essentially.

1322
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,960
So, yeah. And this but this is no mere it's sugar

1323
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,880
that this mall was supposed to have, hypothetically.

1324
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,120
This is the world's first candy department store.

1325
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,000
A full three stories of candy shopping.

1326
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,400
Wow. I mean, I love the hubris.

1327
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,240
This is hubris. I have to be.

1328
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,320
I enjoy. I love it. I can't.

1329
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,240
That's not enough stories for me, honestly.

1330
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,240
Five stories of candy, please.

1331
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,560
Could I read a quote from Jeff Rubin, founder and CEO of his sugar?

1332
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,240
Go ahead. Yeah, please. Jeff.

1333
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,120
Creating a candy department store has been a long time dream of mine.

1334
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,040
I've been thinking about this concept for 25 years.

1335
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,160
And our it's sugar team is thrilled to partner

1336
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,040
with American Dream to make it a reality.

1337
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,800
Three story candy department store.

1338
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,880
How long if it had opened, would it have lasted?

1339
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,720
Three stories of candy.

1340
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,440
Well, six months.

1341
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,800
I mean, the Oreo Cafe Oreo Twisted alone

1342
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,760
has great views of both the DreamWorks Waterpark

1343
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,160
and the Nickelodeon Universe theme park.

1344
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,360
That sounds pretty cool.

1345
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,640
Could we say how twisted is spelled?

1346
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,920
Yeah. Do you have it in front of you?

1347
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,840
I have I don't have a soundboard in front of me

1348
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,080
that's obscuring my view of my nose.

1349
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,360
Oh, sure. It's a capital T.W.I.S.T.

1350
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,440
Lowercase I, capital D.

1351
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,480
We just this week talked about the about O.C.

1352
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,800
live with where a fucking one is an exclamation point.

1353
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,440
And there it's like every letter is both uppercase and lowercase.

1354
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,440
Guys, you got to stop experimenting with people don't mind

1355
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,160
spelling Disneyland isn't spelled with a four.

1356
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,720
Everyone thinks they're like Prince or something with their naming

1357
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,440
and putting a number where there should be a letter.

1358
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,080
We are deconstructing the way spelling works.

1359
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,880
Yeah. 21st century spelling.

1360
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,880
They're they're deconstructionist in general.

1361
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,160
And in fact, even I copied a press release that said that

1362
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,640
it's sugar is now one of the largest specialty candy

1363
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,400
retail tainers in the world.

1364
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,960
Whoa, really?

1365
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,160
They're one of the largest retail tainers on the planet.

1366
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,400
I don't know what competition they have.

1367
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,880
But when you think retail tainment.

1368
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,120
Retail tainment retail tainers,

1369
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,440
retail tainers, because an entertainer is a tainer

1370
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,520
who is in the field of and so a retail tainer.

1371
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,560
Oh, OK.

1372
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,760
Focuses on retail.

1373
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,920
So there's a variety of tainers.

1374
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,600
So we can all everyone can be a keeper, which we learn at the end of the downtown

1375
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,080
and anyone can be a tainer as well.

1376
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,520
An entertainer, a retail tainer.

1377
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,320
Yeah, we're pod pod tainers or pod tainers.

1378
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,120
We're pod tainers.

1379
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,360
Pod tainers. Yes, that's true.

1380
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,800
When you worked at the container store, you were a container.

1381
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,720
I was a container. Absolutely.

1382
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,560
Wow. Maybe I maybe know they clunked it up.

1383
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,440
It was contained tainer.

1384
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,720
Container. Yeah.

1385
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,720
Wow. Everyone can be a tainer.

1386
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,440
I want everyone to remember that because I think we don't give enough advice

1387
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,360
and like motivational words of motivation enough on the show.

1388
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,880
And you can all listen to my words.

1389
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,440
You can all be tainers.

1390
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,960
You can all be tainers.

1391
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,760
Reach for your.

1392
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,480
Right. It's like getting louder every time.

1393
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,920
He likes the tainers.

1394
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,560
He loves that tainer stuff. Yeah.

1395
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,440
There's been of course, this it sugar must have employed multiple bean

1396
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,160
tainers with the three story replica of the Statue of Liberty covered

1397
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:30,480
in more than one point five million jelly belly beans.

1398
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,000
One point five million jelly beans to make up the Statue of Liberty in there.

1399
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,440
Yeah. To cover it.

1400
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,200
And now that's a that's a monument you can get behind, Jason.

1401
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,320
Oh, sure. I mean, you stare at that statue of liberty,

1402
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,000
then you go inside and wander through the Lali Lali Pop Garden.

1403
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,720
A lot of people these days are really upset about monuments being torn down,

1404
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,960
but I don't think anyone would be upset if we got rid of the regular

1405
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,920
Statue of Liberty and put up the jelly bean Statue of Liberty.

1406
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,000
I think everybody would be fine with that.

1407
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,520
Especially seagulls.

1408
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,960
Yeah. All right. Here.

1409
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,080
Here's the compromise.

1410
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,360
We take down all the Robert E.

1411
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,920
Lee statues, but we put up jelly bean Robert E.

1412
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,320
Lee statues.

1413
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,120
That's the compromise.

1414
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,000
It's still him. It's still him.

1415
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,280
But now it's jelly beans and the birds will eat him.

1416
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,120
You get to watch the seagulls and crows devour this traitor.

1417
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,240
You should a traitor tainer.

1418
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,880
In the 1800s, the country was entertained by his traitorism,

1419
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,160
making him a traitor tainer.

1420
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,520
Jelly bean jelly bean confederate.

1421
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,080
It's terrible what they're doing.

1422
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,240
The birds, they're eating the they're eating the lees.

1423
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,600
They're eating the traitor tainers.

1424
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,000
These sloppy birds.

1425
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,120
They eat garbage, disgusting, and you're hearing it more and more.

1426
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,040
You're hearing people are saying you're hearing it more and more.

1427
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,760
They must have also employed a poet tainer

1428
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,800
to write that because it also it's not just a statue.

1429
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,080
There's also they did the plaque and you enter under this

1430
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,680
in the store and and the plaque says,

1431
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,360
give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses

1432
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,320
yearning for the sweet life.

1433
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,800
And I will give you it sugar.

1434
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,640
Hell, yes, brother.

1435
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,240
Wow. Yes.

1436
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,880
Uh, this time when there's a there are a lot of

1437
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,040
pretty serious poor huddled masses.

1438
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,560
Um, I it's quite a time to put that up.

1439
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,360
So coal statue made a laffy taffy of neurofiddling while Rome burns.

1440
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,760
And the Rome burning is part of the s'mores bar.

1441
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,400
Oreo twisted would have been notable, too,

1442
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,800
because that would have been the first time something was actually made inside

1443
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,840
of its sugar, because it's all prepackaged elsewhere.

1444
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,720
Even the light bulk candy, I remember walking through it once and I'm like,

1445
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,360
they left out the garbage bag filled of sour patch kids

1446
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,160
they use to fill up the bulk.

1447
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,760
They're not going to be making house made sour patch kids.

1448
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,280
But like you could make some some truffles or something you would think.

1449
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,600
Maybe. Well, how do you know the stuff in the case?

1450
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,080
Maybe that's made somewhere close by.

1451
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,920
I guess some of them have cases.

1452
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,400
Yeah. I know. Look, if you can open up a place

1453
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,160
that would make house made sour patch kids, I'd be interested.

1454
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,920
A kid bar.

1455
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,280
Customize your kid. Yeah.

1456
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,920
And you can. And when you are like seeing a visualization

1457
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,720
of what it'll look like, you call that an ultrasound.

1458
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,080
Maybe I mean, I don't know if there's a way to candy by that.

1459
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,000
A patch of sound.

1460
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,280
So I was an ultra sour, ultra sour

1461
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,440
and ultra sour is pretty good.

1462
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,240
Great. Let's check the check the ultra sour.

1463
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,280
The doctor licks it.

1464
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,800
Tastes pretty sour.

1465
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,200
Good news. Your baby is delicious.

1466
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,280
Good news.

1467
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,440
That's good. That would be great.

1468
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,320
People would love that.

1469
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,520
And when choose the gender, choose the gender.

1470
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,840
Yeah, you go in with your spouse and make it equal parts.

1471
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,320
Both of us. Yeah.

1472
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,160
Look, beautiful.

1473
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,720
Someone needs to enlist us as far as ideas for one of these monstrosities.

1474
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,880
Yeah. Help us make your candy.

1475
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,600
Gattaca dreams come true.

1476
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,360
We're going to happen.

1477
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,720
Probably nobody that we faced in the downtown Disney ordeal, but somebody

1478
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,280
somebody wants to make an even taller candy store.

1479
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,760
Please. We've got great ideas

1480
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,080
that involves having to hire a performer that wears a lab coat

1481
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,440
that pretends to check on your sour baby in a womb.

1482
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,320
A who who who?

1483
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,040
I think he has a sour, gummy mustache.

1484
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,160
I think maybe big eyebrows to let's check your ultra sour.

1485
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,560
Is it Edwin? Is it an Edwin voice?

1486
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,800
I think he talks in an Edwin voice.

1487
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,520
Yes. Oh, my.

1488
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,160
I was about to do it and I started joking.

1489
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,560
The baby's sour.

1490
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,520
Pretty good.

1491
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,080
Yeah, that would go over a huge.

1492
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,360
I'm Dr. Gumdrop.

1493
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,480
That's a lowercase D, uppercase R, lowercase O.

1494
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,320
Dr. Gumdrop, how's his gummy heartbeat looking?

1495
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,960
It's a bit concerning, but stable.

1496
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,920
There's a slight murmur.

1497
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,160
There's a slight molasses murmur.

1498
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,560
Molasses coming into the left ventricle.

1499
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,240
You might have sour tension.

1500
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,440
The greatest thing about this, too, would be that like you'd get a really good

1501
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,400
performer when the thing opened, when the press was there and the media was there,

1502
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,360
everybody would be like, wow, this performance so great.

1503
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,200
And then it would be like a disinterested teen six months later

1504
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,360
who had to deliver the same.

1505
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,720
Yes. The professor at the M&M store.

1506
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,080
I'm Dr. Gumdrop.

1507
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,760
There is a there's a bunch of fudge in your baby's heart.

1508
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,480
Oh, wow. Look, I can see it kicking.

1509
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,400
Ripped my pocket.

1510
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,600
OK, well, let's start this.

1511
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,320
And that would be again, that's just as good as a great Edwin impression.

1512
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,200
Yeah, just as entertaining.

1513
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,040
Yeah, it's opposite the opposite ends of this picture.

1514
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,800
They're just as good.

1515
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,680
Oh, my God. The sugar.

1516
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,520
What have we not talked about?

1517
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,600
I dream work.

1518
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,880
Yes. All right.

1519
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,320
Yeah. The DreamWorks water park.

1520
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,960
Finally, you can splish and splash with all your pals.

1521
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,640
You can swim where Shrek swims.

1522
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,640
You can bathe in water.

1523
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,280
The trick farted in

1524
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:18,480
opening day scheduled for March 19th, 2020, baby.

1525
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,000
My God. Was it that not the stores?

1526
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,200
Maybe. I think I guess the water park was the water park.

1527
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,520
So I found a bunch. I watched a bunch of videos.

1528
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,040
There were they ran preview days.

1529
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,080
They did have preview days for the water park.

1530
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,320
Oh, and that's where I sent you guys a video where a guy

1531
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,560
is standing in the open retail area.

1532
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,880
You can hear a fire alarm going off and he's like, Hey,

1533
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,640
I'm here for the preview day for the DreamWorks water park.

1534
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,960
The fire alarm has been going off for 10 minutes.

1535
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,640
After a great start, what do you think that if you had to

1536
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,320
do an impression of what that might have sounded like, like,

1537
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,840
what is it like to be on a water park?

1538
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,800
And then there's this like this loud sound going on.

1539
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,640
What?

1540
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,240
Nailed it. Yeah.

1541
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,360
Wow. Yeah. Very good.

1542
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,960
You are like the genie. You can do impressions.

1543
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:14,720
Mm hmm.

1544
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,840
It was a shorter. There was a shorter one. Yeah.

1545
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Brief. Yeah. You don't want to blow out your voice.

1546
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,360
Some of the things that this place

1547
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:32,320
are the well, you got the far, far a bay

1548
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:38,360
wave pool. You got Shrek's sinkhole slammer.

1549
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,240
Named. I love that.

1550
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,080
I named after a sinkhole.

1551
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,680
That sounds like shit, but I love that.

1552
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,080
This is the only names I wrote down of sled, but mainly if you click around

1553
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:54,720
their website, you get to see photos like the one Jason sent us

1554
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,120
where Shrek is wearing a big scuba diving mask

1555
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:04,080
and an undershirt, an A-frame like tank top undershirt

1556
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,720
really going for the Jersey crowd with that look

1557
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,520
like he's in streetcar named desire.

1558
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,680
Yeah. Oh, by the way, just a side note for me personally,

1559
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,520
that image I sent you guys of Shrek with the snorkel

1560
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,600
and Kung Fu Panda with the lei.

1561
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,120
And it says, make some waves. Dreamworks waterpark.

1562
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,120
I accidentally texted that to my therapist as well.

1563
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,040
What was the response from that?

1564
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,040
I didn't write. I just said, oh, ha ha.

1565
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,360
Wrong text. I did.

1566
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,640
You write, oh, ha ha. I did. Yes.

1567
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,880
Jason, we need to talk immediately.

1568
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,880
You know, emergency session.

1569
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,680
Yeah, I don't really get this guy's.

1570
01:25:53,320 --> 01:26:00,440
Does anyone want to take a guess at how much the waterpark tickets were?

1571
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,280
How much a ticket is worth that we said?

1572
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,720
Yeah. I mean, they're not for sale right now.

1573
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,360
Right. But according to the people who were at the preview day,

1574
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,800
I did not see the price.

1575
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,400
I'm going to guess it was is this for a day or is this not anything?

1576
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,240
Yeah, for a day.

1577
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,520
Adults and kids.

1578
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,200
Two different price. Two different prices.

1579
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,640
Adults, $50, kids, $35.

1580
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,440
Scott, let me just in keeping with some of the other numbers

1581
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,960
that we're looking at, I think one day of mission costs two million dollars.

1582
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,600
No, Scott, sorry, you went under one day for adults.

1583
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,320
Ninety nine dollars and kids, kids, eighty nine dollars.

1584
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,920
Well, for a water, that's the most expensive water park in the country.

1585
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,480
To swim in Shrek's farts.

1586
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,000
But $99 get in my sink hole.

1587
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,720
The Kung Fu Panda Play area looks like we keep them occupied for a while.

1588
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,080
OK, so and there's indoor cabanas

1589
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,960
that just look like the balconies of like a mid range hotel room.

1590
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,720
Well, you got people eating Oreos staring down at your naked body.

1591
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,400
So wait, that's an upcharge for the cabana or no?

1592
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,720
Oh, yeah. Oh, it's an.

1593
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,000
I don't know how much, but I'm going to assume it's an upcharge.

1594
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,160
So you would go, you pay $100 for your adult self to go

1595
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,960
and then you would upgrade like you were at a Vegas pool

1596
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,680
to get a better view of the Shrek swamp and the exposed ceilings.

1597
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,000
Well, but hold on a second, those cabanas have a single mini fridge.

1598
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,720
What that sort of open closet,

1599
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,240
you find in dorm rooms with like the bar to hang stuff.

1600
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,520
What? And an outdoor railing.

1601
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,920
So you don't fall a few stories.

1602
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,600
Outdoor railing.

1603
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,240
This is the strangest.

1604
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,680
So in a mall, you're going to like sun.

1605
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,160
Like, why would you need a cabana indoors?

1606
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:11,200
Yeah. Is there sun coming in from a skylight?

1607
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,280
Did I not?

1608
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,400
It's more like glare.

1609
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,440
It's got a glare coming in the cabana.

1610
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,280
So, yeah, you get out of the sunlight, especially in like Las Vegas.

1611
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,120
This is so you don't get hit with the like hell,

1612
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,160
like the light bulbs in the shopping mall.

1613
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,560
This is so bizarre.

1614
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,880
I don't.

1615
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,240
I saw a video from the West Edmonton Mall in the 80s where it had an open

1616
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:40,560
like, I guess in the mall could watch you to tanning, whatever that means.

1617
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,840
Tanning? In like a gazebo.

1618
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,040
You just walk by.

1619
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,440
There's just like planks of cedar.

1620
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,120
You're just lying on.

1621
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:54,000
So the the Gremesians are all about indoor tanning, not tanning beds.

1622
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,560
That's not what we mean.

1623
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,080
We mean indoor.

1624
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:01,280
Just, you know, you sit in a room and lie there and that gets you tan.

1625
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,320
Hypothetically, you sit on a plank of cedar, which is what they cook salmon on.

1626
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,240
And you get.

1627
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,080
Salmon.

1628
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,720
Tan from special lights they've installed.

1629
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:17,520
It was like they looked like kind of brighter yellow lights

1630
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,720
than, you know, we would have in our houses.

1631
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,600
We got to look into what these lights are.

1632
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,040
I'll go back into that video.

1633
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:27,360
I mean, I after all this, we have to obviously we have to do the trilogy.

1634
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,040
We have to do Mall of America and West Edmonton. Right.

1635
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,800
West Edmonton is unbelievable.

1636
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,080
It's it's so crazy.

1637
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,280
We're going the opposite way.

1638
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,240
With our this is our preferred order like Star Wars, where we have some.

1639
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:39,960
Well, you got to go.

1640
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,960
You got to do it this way and this way.

1641
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,120
Yeah. Yeah. Backwards.

1642
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,480
Huh? Back to the ones that actually did open.

1643
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,600
This is wild.

1644
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:55,120
That is so much more expensive than Blizzard Beach, which is seventy three dollars,

1645
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:00,600
which is a immersive themed like with a premise and characters.

1646
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1647
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,800
I mean, maybe it's a real place.

1648
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,160
I think it's more expensive than like

1649
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:11,560
the Great Wolf Lodge is like the other the big chain of water parks.

1650
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:17,040
Yeah. And that at least like I think they loop lodging and tickets in together.

1651
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,080
You know, I would assume.

1652
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,560
I mean, this is this is wild.

1653
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,720
I don't know who's going to go sit, as Scott said,

1654
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,760
almost naked in a shopping mall all day for one hundred dollars.

1655
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,240
Well, Oreo eaters stared down at you

1656
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,960
and I don't think they can see you, but this is all right next to a freeway.

1657
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:44,640
Yeah. Either way, you can honk at people as you're driving by

1658
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,520
and know that there's like a person like in a speedo inside

1659
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,960
mere feet away getting tan over the course of a 10 hour day spent at this mall.

1660
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,040
Somebody just fell asleep.

1661
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,120
They finally are dozing a little bit and then

1662
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,960
are just the relentless traffic of New Jersey

1663
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,240
that unless it was a Sunday, which, of course, you wouldn't be nobody

1664
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,280
would be in there with the traffic gridlock.

1665
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:15,080
Yeah. The turnpike is so great on Sundays.

1666
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,400
It's so much easier than Jersey Turnpike.

1667
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,160
So part of this thing also related to the traffic issue is that,

1668
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,760
you know, it's going to be, you know, we're going to put up some money,

1669
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,760
but so is the city.

1670
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,760
And it's great. It'll work all in tandem.

1671
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,560
And, you know, it's great if you if for anybody, you know, look,

1672
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,560
if you have kids in New York City, eventually this is all from the guy

1673
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,160
Don Grimes and his justification was your kids are going to get bored

1674
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,480
at some point. New York City is more for adults.

1675
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,640
If you think about it and, you know, what are kids going to want to do?

1676
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,000
Well, come over to the American Dream.

1677
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,640
Why we have a direct bus that gets you right there

1678
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,920
that we did not pay for or start ourselves.

1679
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,520
There just there is a bus that New York has and it'll take you.

1680
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,600
Is it just put your kid on the bus and do indoor tanning?

1681
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,360
And then I watched it.

1682
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,760
I couldn't believe this was available to

1683
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,400
where they grilled more politicians this way.

1684
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:15,560
There was a video where a reporter is like now, you know, it's

1685
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,240
this mall is going to create terrible traffic in this area.

1686
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:22,120
And even, you know, local politicians are saying, you know,

1687
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,560
it's going to require some public transit.

1688
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,760
Would you triple five ever put money into

1689
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,600
would you ever put money into, you know, paying for public transit to,

1690
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,040
you know, get people to back and forth, especially because people

1691
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,680
are going to be coming from all over New Jersey, not just New York.

1692
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,200
So would you ever like help facilitate public transit?

1693
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,360
And he goes, ha ha ha ha.

1694
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,000
That is something to be discussed.

1695
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,960
That is his answer.

1696
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,400
No, he's not going to give any money to improve.

1697
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,680
No, no fucking way.

1698
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,200
He's so he like gets the sweats and nervous laughs.

1699
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,440
It's crazy. If the question was, would you add another story

1700
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,760
to your candy department store? Yes, of course.

1701
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,280
Help transportation. We got to talk about it.

1702
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,560
We don't have the butterscotch bar.

1703
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,160
I mean, that can't possibly fit in the first three floors.

1704
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,640
That was always a seventh floor idea. Yeah.

1705
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:21,840
Look, it's it's not like we're competing with six flags in New Jersey,

1706
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:26,360
North Jersey, Shoretowns, South Jersey, Shoretowns,

1707
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,800
casinos in South Jersey.

1708
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,120
There's no entertainment in this state.

1709
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:35,200
You know, in Times Square, the like many multi store,

1710
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:41,040
the lots of multi story candy stores in Times Square,

1711
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,160
the place where you're staying with your children, undoubtedly.

1712
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,000
You would think that the way to open this would have been like

1713
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,760
like Disney usually does open a thing and you have room for expansion.

1714
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,920
Would it like? Yes.

1715
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,280
That would make sense.

1716
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,280
You've opened some stores and you know, you have all this land here

1717
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,080
and that's going to slowly expand.

1718
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:08,320
And they went all of it at once and got fucked.

1719
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:12,360
But, you know, that's why, you know,

1720
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,160
they say if you're going through hell, keep going.

1721
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,640
And that's why they announced in April of 2020,

1722
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,000
the the percentages have changed.

1723
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,960
There is now going to be 70 percent entertainment and 30 percent retail,

1724
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:32,480
which means more entertainment venues like a trampoline park.

1725
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,280
Eight more rides to Nickelodeon Universe,

1726
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,040
interactive museums with elaborate props and backdrops,

1727
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,720
which I think are total bullshit

1728
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:45,520
and plans were in the works for several hotels that could connect to the mall

1729
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,440
via SkyBridge.

1730
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,880
That's right. They've got the zoning for 3000 hotel rooms.

1731
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,320
Wow. Hotels.

1732
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,680
Interactive museums.

1733
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:01,960
I know, guys, they announced this during the pandemic.

1734
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:07,760
Yeah. Like, you know, six atriums that will serve as an entertainment hub,

1735
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,480
including like, you know, one with a bunch of gardens filled with bird

1736
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,280
filled aviaries and rabbit fields.

1737
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:21,120
And a 60 foot fashion fountain that could be converted into a catwalk in seconds.

1738
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,120
You know, a fashion fountain.

1739
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,800
Fashion. Fountain.

1740
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,400
Is that? Yeah, I hate to be.

1741
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,120
I hate to be so modern comedy about it, but is that a thing?

1742
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,840
Is that a thing?

1743
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,720
This is this is the mall that dares to ask, is that a thing?

1744
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,880
If the answer is no, they make it. Yes.

1745
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,320
That so there's a fashion fountain

1746
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,440
that can turn into a runway for a full fashion show.

1747
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,000
Mm hmm. It's probably by the secret garden, a tree like sculpture

1748
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,400
consisting of more than seventy five thousand LED lights

1749
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,880
and twenty five thousand leaves that play music.

1750
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,880
I tell you what, this is sounding better, honestly, to me.

1751
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,320
They're going to pivot more towards this.

1752
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,680
I think this is a better idea, quite frankly.

1753
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,680
I watched a video.

1754
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,680
I don't know if this is one of the museums you're talking about, but they've

1755
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,760
at some point announced that they were going to be the permanent home

1756
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,000
of something called the New Jersey Hall of Fame,

1757
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,680
which up until now has been a trailer that drove around.

1758
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,520
And so it's a museum on wheels.

1759
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,360
And they've they put the museum in the parking lot of this for a long time.

1760
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,000
The party they did it a year ago before anything was open there.

1761
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,600
So you could go to a parking lot next to an abandoned stadium

1762
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,240
and go to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

1763
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:43,960
And I watched a news report about it and the interview with the owner

1764
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,040
of this trailer museum spends a lot of it saying,

1765
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,040
now, if you were just born in New Jersey, that's not enough.

1766
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,080
It doesn't count.

1767
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,000
Paul Simon was born in New Jersey, but he was only here for three weeks

1768
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,400
as a baby, and then he left.

1769
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,840
He moved away. So he's not in the Hall of Fame. Really?

1770
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,120
Get out of here, Simon.

1771
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,320
Get out of here, Simon, hit the road.

1772
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,840
So like so like Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes would be in.

1773
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,080
Oh, yeah. But Paul Simon would not.

1774
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,840
And my friend's dad, Jim McGreevey, gets it somehow.

1775
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,240
You're the star of the documentary.

1776
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,560
We got to put him in.

1777
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:26,000
Then this is from New Jersey TV News.

1778
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,600
This is the strangest news report ever.

1779
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,720
It keeps going. And they they say, oh, there's going to be, you know,

1780
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,920
because some of the people in the Hall of Fame are still living.

1781
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
So if you're still living in and you're in the Hall of Fame,

1782
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,800
they're going to make a hologram of you who is going to.

1783
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,800
I swear, the news report said encourage kids to follow their dreams

1784
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,960
or give them advice.

1785
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,800
So a hologram from New Jersey is going to talk to you.

1786
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:52,760
And then it says, you know, living New Jersey and will talk to your kids,

1787
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,560
you know, like former MLB player Al Leiter.

1788
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,760
And then they interview this baseball player for a while.

1789
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,520
So Al Leiter is a hologram is going to say, kids,

1790
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,680
they, you know, once I didn't want to pick up a bat and then I did.

1791
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,680
And then I was playing MLB.

1792
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,880
So you do the same thing. Wow.

1793
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,600
I think we're kind of tainer.

1794
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,720
We're previewing this at the Newark airport where there was just a box

1795
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:22,040
where a very sleepy seeming Stephen Vansant hologram

1796
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,040
would just tell you some stuff.

1797
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,640
He got in in 2017.

1798
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,840
I'm reading here. Little Stephen.

1799
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,040
Yeah. Oh, he's in it. Oh, good.

1800
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,520
Oh, Southside Johnny got in 2018.

1801
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,200
Yeah. All right.

1802
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,040
Along with Jason Alexander.

1803
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,520
Oh, what?

1804
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,360
Hmm. Now, are there holograms of any of these?

1805
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,400
It doesn't say on here.

1806
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:50,640
It doesn't say on here, but oh, George R.R.

1807
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,680
Martin got in in 2018 as well.

1808
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,640
Hmm. Yeah, that's right. He's from Bayonne.

1809
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,840
Wow. I've met you on the best show a lot.

1810
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,720
He's from Bayonne. Ray Liotta.

1811
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,760
It says it's the New Jersey.

1812
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,480
Wait, no, I forget what it is. Keep going.

1813
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,400
I'm just going to Ray Liotta 2016.

1814
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:13,720
Boy, you know, it's really it's it's fun, like thinking about all the people

1815
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,560
in the New Jersey, all of fame and all like who might be in it,

1816
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,560
who they might make a hologram.

1817
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,400
I find this all very fascinating.

1818
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,640
And I personally could talk about this the whole rest of the episode.

1819
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,800
What is that? But I don't know if everyone else.

1820
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,280
Well, I also agree that I think we should just keep talking

1821
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,800
about the New Jersey Hall of Fame, especially specifically

1822
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,840
South Side Johnny and his music career.

1823
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,640
Boys, boys, you're boring the crap out of me.

1824
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,000
Boring, boring, boring.

1825
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Move on already, boys.

1826
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,360
He's doing like an annoying nerd voice now.

1827
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,480
All right. You made a boing, but with the word boring.

1828
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,840
Yeah. I mean, you did. You're here.

1829
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,680
You. Yeah, right.

1830
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,040
That was weird what you did.

1831
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,360
OK, look, it's easy, I think, with all of this stuff to say in hindsight.

1832
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,800
You know, they didn't create the pandemic.

1833
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,000
I don't think maybe. You never know.

1834
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,760
It's possible. It was triple five.

1835
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:10,200
They did it to try to get out of ever having to open this thing fully.

1836
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:15,280
But, you know, it's easy in hindsight to say this was a bad idea.

1837
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,400
But it's the things that were in the mall that I think make you go.

1838
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,400
Yeah, it was always kind of weird and the weird like,

1839
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,360
shouldn't they have gotten the message from many decades?

1840
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:25,920
One of the articles I read had the quote from a retail consultant, Kate Newland.

1841
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,280
It was probably a good idea 20 years ago,

1842
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,360
but I don't think it was a good idea pre covid.

1843
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,480
And I really think it's crazy now.

1844
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,840
And that's what I think what it boils down to.

1845
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,400
I feel like plenty of people did say this was a bad idea.

1846
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,280
They had so many chances.

1847
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,880
How many like this is the fourth developer that's still sinking money into this Shrek

1848
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,840
sinkhole. I yes.

1849
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,040
Yes. And I don't think it'll be the last.

1850
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,560
I feel like this is what Trump does if he gets out of office.

1851
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,440
Yeah. Goes straight to this. Yeah.

1852
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,600
I think so. And then although, yeah, all of his voters will can live there with him.

1853
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,760
They still have to open the kids, Zania Family Entertainment Center,

1854
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,160
the Lucky Strike Bowling Alley,

1855
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,120
Legoland Discovery Center, Sea Life Aquarium,

1856
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,400
Climb Zone Indoor Rock Climbing Facility, Mirror Maze.

1857
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,960
I look I love the sound of all of this.

1858
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,200
Mirror Maze, Trampoline Park. Sign me up.

1859
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,440
I like all of that.

1860
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,120
I don't know what is Mirror Maze like a house of mirrors,

1861
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,640
like a new cutting edge house of mirrors for 2020.

1862
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,440
Angry Birds Miniature Golf Course.

1863
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:39,960
Now that may have gotten open and then I'm not sure.

1864
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,640
The jury's out on that one.

1865
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,640
Huh? Can you drink?

1866
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,520
Is there are there bars in this mall?

1867
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,920
Do we know? Nope, it's dry.

1868
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,680
You have to have morals.

1869
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,960
You have to have standards.

1870
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,080
Blue laws.

1871
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,560
If you could, if you could walk around like in Vegas with a drink,

1872
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,680
I think this would make the mall much better.

1873
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:07,680
Certainly, but I don't know if you'll be I don't, you know, again,

1874
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,120
it's going to be covered world and you know, you can't walk around

1875
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:11,320
with a drink of Disney now.

1876
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:16,080
So, yeah, who knows when that'll be possible to partner with companies

1877
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,800
like the Rocks, Terra Mana and a different company.

1878
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,040
And then as soon as it opens again, you'll have like a big celebration.

1879
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:26,160
Welcome to co-founder of Casamigos Tequila, Randy Gerber, Randy.

1880
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,160
Yeah, that'll happen.

1881
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no시

1882
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,200
We're all in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

1883
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,440
Randy Gerber gets in the New Jersey Hall of Fame also.

1884
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,920
And then that brings everything back and everybody gets excited again

1885
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,760
because they can get hammered in a giant mall with a mirror maze.

1886
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,880
Whoops. Oh, fuck.

1887
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:51,680
Ow, bonk. Ouch.

1888
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,480
Oh, my leg. I tore my knee open.

1889
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:59,120
Just breaking glass left and right.

1890
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,120
People just crashing into a mirror.

1891
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:07,720
Day two with the mirror maze, like they're just writing calmly on a whiteboard.

1892
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,360
OK, so new regulation.

1893
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,920
No alcohol in the mirror maze.

1894
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,400
The the sequel to Us takes place in this mall.

1895
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:28,280
We are proud to partner with Jordan Peele to bring you the Us Mirror Mall experience.

1896
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,640
Yeah. Here to open it officially, Hologram Jordan Peele.

1897
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,360
And holograms of Johnny and the Asbury Dukes.

1898
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:47,440
Oh, God, are we I mean, I've got other details, but I'm exhausted.

1899
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,720
I'm exhausted.

1900
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,480
I need to sit back, put on some Southside Johnny and relax.

1901
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,720
I'm so happy I get to say Southside Johnny so much in this episode.

1902
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,880
I said my for my friends, my friends, all the music from Moobysiddy.

1903
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,280
Your dad is in the band. Yeah.

1904
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,280
Oh, well, yeah. Yeah.

1905
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,600
Anyways, this is this is insane.

1906
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,760
As we said, there's no reopening date.

1907
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:17,600
Even with with the Gramezians, they were they said, all right, 2014.

1908
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:21,360
And then they did two more that didn't come to pass.

1909
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:25,640
Then they were saying fall 20, this has been delayed so many times.

1910
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,400
They got eight percent of it open for six months and then covid.

1911
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,600
No, not even when was it? November. Fuck.

1912
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,840
Like five months of that.

1913
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,520
That was the good they missed those days.

1914
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,560
Those were the glory days of Xanadu.

1915
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:47,280
Yeah. And there's just so much coverage in these trade magazines and NJ.com

1916
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,160
of like coming spring 2020.

1917
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:55,720
Like it's it's like an oh, it feels like something the witches in Macbeth

1918
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,840
told you like Oreo twisted come 2020, you know.

1919
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,680
It all does feel like threats, especially when they

1920
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,920
they are saying that still in the work, supposedly our plans for

1921
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,080
American Dream, Miami.

1922
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,960
Oh, yeah. They're trying to do it again. Please.

1923
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,840
And this one is supposed to have sea lions that live there.

1924
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,560
It would it would in theory be the biggest mall in North America,

1925
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,840
taking a title that the Edmonton Mall used to have.

1926
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,320
They're getting revenge.

1927
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,520
And they would bring back something that hasn't been at their West Edmonton

1928
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:41,080
Mall in many, many years. Submarines go to Miami,

1929
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,280
drive a submarine around.

1930
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,360
Yes. My God.

1931
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,280
How about a candy store in a submarine?

1932
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,520
That's a good idea.

1933
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:53,480
Jeff Rubin for many years has dreamed of the world's first subterranean

1934
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:59,040
floating candy store and for 25 years to be exact.

1935
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,080
And now that dreams a reality.

1936
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,320
Tossing and turning sleepless nights like where will a sour patch

1937
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,600
the store within a store go?

1938
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,840
Is it by the Reese's stores restore within a store?

1939
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:15,080
What about a sour patch wedding chapel

1940
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,320
where you can marry a giant sour patch man or woman?

1941
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,120
Do you take this candy to be your bride?

1942
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,360
Do you consult my Twix Bible?

1943
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,840
Do you take do you take

1944
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:35,560
Denise, the candy woman, to be your awfully wetter wife?

1945
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,480
Do you do to have to hold as long as you should live?

1946
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,640
To the power invested in me and the United by the United States of Candy

1947
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,400
and the National Retail Detainment Association.

1948
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,600
You may kiss the sour bride.

1949
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,120
Kiss her sour lips.

1950
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:04,720
Um, this is raw walking out of it, sugar throwing nerds at the newlyweds.

1951
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,400
Oh, God, I want that at my wedding for real.

1952
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,240
Well, sure.

1953
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,920
I would be a good idea.

1954
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,120
Yeah, that's fucking good.

1955
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,280
Um, well, well, wait a minute.

1956
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,840
Does that mean we're we're getting towards the end?

1957
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,360
This is the part that we haven't done this in so long.

1958
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,480
We haven't had one of these daily series.

1959
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,800
But I think that this is we did it.

1960
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,760
I think we covered all eight percent of this mall that opened.

1961
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,720
And doesn't that now mean that the Keeper Spirit is free?

1962
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,440
Oh, that's right. That must be the but must be what happens now.

1963
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,680
Boys, boys, your journey is over.

1964
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,160
You have failed.

1965
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:45,200
My soul was used as collateral and is now owned by the banks.

1966
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,760
I'm toast, boys.

1967
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,960
You fucked up. Fuck you.

1968
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,160
What?

1969
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,400
Well, that's you.

1970
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,640
You didn't say the rules, really.

1971
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,320
Yeah, we didn't get a good explanation of what we were supposed to do.

1972
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,360
How are we going to stop the banks if this mall couldn't fend off the banks?

1973
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,480
And how are us three idiots going to do it?

1974
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,400
Yeah, I don't know.

1975
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:10,760
I guess well, before you get taken from the banks, do you have anything else

1976
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:11,520
you want to say?

1977
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,360
Hey, let's let's exit through the miles of unopened gift shops.

1978
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:18,360
Yeah. And you

1979
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,560
American Dream Keeper, you survive podcast, right?

1980
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,160
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1981
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,960
I just want to remind all you listeners about a man named Matt Cardona.

1982
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,960
His podcast, wink, wink.

1983
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:33,880
My podcast is called a major wrestling figure podcast.

1984
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,880
It drops every Friday wherever you find your podcasts.

1985
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,080
We have a page just like these guys.

1986
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:42,520
We do more.

1987
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:43,840
Oh, all right.

1988
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,360
That's they do more bonus listening.

1989
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,920
Well, I like this podcast podcast.

1990
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,480
The ride pretty cool.

1991
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:55,400
And every Friday, the major wrestling figure podcast.

1992
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,600
It's by a Len. Call me.

1993

OK, it's very canny.

1994
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:05,040
We still trying to get Len test on the phone.

1995
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,520
Promoting some other guys podcast.

1996
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,080
Matt Cardona, I know.

1997
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,560
Yes, he must be friends with him.

1998
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,560
He was said he he said he was me.

1999
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,960
I don't know. He must have been joking about that.

2000
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,480
But yes, I guess it's a wrestling podcast.

2001
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,240
If you like wrestling figures and action figures and collectibles,

2002
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,520
certainly check that out.

2003
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,840
That's nice of him to plug.

2004
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,040
I also like how he did kind of a Don Rickles thing there.

2005
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,120
He kind of praised us at the end.

2006
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,920
Yeah, they're kind of roasting us.

2007
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,200
Yeah, yeah, that was nice.

2008
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,800
But what don't we do enough bonuses?

2009
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,320
Oh, he said he does more.

2010
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,240
He said they do bonuses on their Patreon.

2011
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,600
He was trying to get one up and say that the major wrestling figure,

2012
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,840
Matt Cardona, aka Zach formerly Zach Ryder of WWE

2013
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,680
on his Patreon, they do more bonuses.

2014
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,960
I don't know that that's true.

2015
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,840
That's just what the ghost was saying.

2016
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,800
This is all right.

2017
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,440
Where's it been long lately?

2018
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:57,800
You know, we need we need the time to talk to other human beings.

2019
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,440
Yes.

2020
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,080
The bonuses are in the epics.

2021
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,400
They're always bonuses.

2022
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,080
But you know what? I think he's right.

2023
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,920
And that's why I think

2024
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,360
let's do more than just an audio bonus.

2025
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,760
I say that we build an entire bonus kingdom.

2026
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:18,520
I'm on Google Maps and I found a bunch of protected marshland

2027
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:24,800
that's just just off the coast of Staten Island.

2028
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:28,320
OK. And I propose we will.

2029
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,480
I propose we will build this.

2030
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,760
The pockets are at the third gate will be an actual place.

2031
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,360
It's going to be three million square feet.

2032
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:41,120
And I promise it will be a pandemic or no pandemic.

2033
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,640
It'll be open by the end of 2021.

2034
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,240
So what you can do is pay us the money now.

2035
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:51,120
We'll start the third tier and that will cost five thousand dollars.

2036
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:55,720
And then you will have exclusive access to millions of square feet of entertainment.

2037
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,160
I'm very excited about this because I think I'd like to.

2038
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,920
You know, immediately announce some of the partnerships that we're we have

2039
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,240
ready for this endeavor.

2040
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:05,600
So real quick, this is somebody I think everybody knows

2041
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,160
and is going to be very excited about that is on board with with us.

2042
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,040
Oh, really? Oh, great. Yeah. Here we go.

2043
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,120
Oh, it's Chucko the birthday clown.

2044
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:22,200
He's now finally in business with us officially.

2045
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,120
And we'll be able to license his image

2046
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,640
and we'll be able to do some sort of a chuckle experience,

2047
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,920
maybe sort of a hall of mirrors with Chucko, sort of a funhouse.

2048
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,560
I think it's very exciting.

2049
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,800
Dream Keeper, you shut your mouth.

2050
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,960
Stop this song at once.

2051
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,920
I don't want to hear one other verse of that song, sir.

2052
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,680
After you dig us, then you play that.

2053
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:47,240
Yeah, well, that look, he was just helping me out

2054
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,680
because of the different part of the partnership we have.

2055
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,600
Yeah, we did not discuss this. There's plenty of IP.

2056
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:56,320
We always talk about buying IP that we we want and enjoy.

2057
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,720
And that's up for grabs.

2058
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:00,960
And yet the one that we choose is the one scary clown.

2059
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,440
I might have to pull out of this and start my own and start the Scott Gardner

2060
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,800
dream that will be in the city of your Mo,

2061
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,280
which I believe is on the weight of Vegas.

2062
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:16,400
And it's going to be six million square feet and no Chucko's allowed.

2063
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,720
OK, we'll talk about that off here.

2064
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,840
But unless anybody has anything else,

2065
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,160
I just to salute to American Dream.

2066
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:29,640
Do you think maybe there is a Chucko song where he salutes America

2067
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:33,800
that I may have found earlier today and that we should go out playing that?

2068
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,520
No, I don't think great.

2069
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,600
I mean, that would be really good if that I mean, by per chance, that can happen.

2070
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,720
OK, well, it can't be real.

2071
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,760
It doesn't exist, does it?

2072
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,200
Well, I think it does exist.

2073
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,880
But, you know, rate and review us on Apple podcasts and, you know,

2074
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,800
check us out on Twitter and Instagram.

2075
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:56,720
Oh, and I was forgetting to podcast the right on the podcast, the right on Twitter.

2076
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,120
Do the second gate.

2077
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,880
Go to this three bonus episodes every month, which apparently isn't enough

2078
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:06,560
at podcast, the right, the second gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

2079
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,920
The right. I've been beaten up by this keeper.

2080
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,240
And now I've got to be have some fucking song shoved down my throat.

2081
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,000
Yes, that's true. But look, we're in partnership with Chucko now.

2082
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,040
He's part of our universe.

2083
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:21,680
So unfortunately, he's going to have to sing a salute to America to take us out.

2084
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,160
I'd kill for Randi, a partnership with Randy Gerbert.

2085
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,400
No, Randy's out. He's not partnering with us.

2086
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,320
What is what's Chucko going to give me a briefcase full of?

2087
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,240
Seltzer.

2088
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,720
I think all right. Well, you know what?

2089
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,680
I put my differences aside and I'm so excited to be in league.

2090
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:40,280
Oh, briefcase, huh?

2091
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,200
This must be very valuable thing.

2092
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,800
Bib juice.

2093
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,920
Oh, that would have been a better joke. You're right.

2094
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,920
Briefcase full of bib juice.

2095
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,360
I only barely remembered what it was.

2096
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,960
What a bit of a joke.

2097
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,280
It's not even in bottles.

2098
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,840
It's loose in a leather briefcase.

2099
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,560
And then this song that starts playing is, of course.

2100
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:06,000
Happy birthday to our country.

2101
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,160
The United States of America.

2102
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:18,240
Let's light a candle in every heart for the greatest land of all.

2103
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:22,520
Happy birthday to our country.

2104
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,960
Hail to all the four.

2105
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,200
This is two and a half minutes long.

2106
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,000
Jesus.

2107
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,520
Let freedom ring.

2108
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,120
At ease, Scott. Chucko's got it from here.

2109
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:34,120
Happy birthday to the United States of America.

2110
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,160
They deserve everything that's coming to us.

2111
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,240
The American dream is dead.

2112
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,360
That is a big birthday to remember.

2113
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,080
This is what he's like.

2114
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,920
For God's sake, 1776.

2115
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,920
That's the day our country was born.

2116
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:54,680
Hey, you know how we always celebrate birthdays for girls and boys

2117
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:58,360
and mamas and daddies and even our pets.

2118
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,920
Well, things are like this.

2119
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,240
You know, birthday.

2120
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,800
This is our partner.

2121
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,800
Scott, this is our partner in America.

2122
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,440
You know, long, long ago.

2123
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,920
Our forefathers.

2124
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,960
This was shut down by the way, we had an agreement.

2125
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,800
It was three of us.

2126
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,200
That means that everybody born in America

2127
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,200
be able to live in freedom.

2128
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,240
Yeah, they eat and sleep, work and play.

2129
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,720
You hit your D's too hard and you have a list.

2130
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:26,520
Without anybody telling us how to do it.

2131
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,280
That's right. Thank you, Chucko.

2132
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,040
We practice the golden rule.

2133
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,800
Oh, yeah, you see why?

2134
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,520
Just like one big family.

2135
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,160
You put your head in a microwave.

2136
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,520
What's wrong with you?

2137
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,200
Microwaves are different back then.

2138
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:41,440
Family, the United States of America.

2139
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,600
Right there.

2140
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,040
He's broken it down for us.

2141
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,000
1776.

2142
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,640
That's the birthday.

2143
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,600
Here we go.

2144
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,800
Never forget.

2145
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,280
This will be the theme of our new mall we're building, by the way.

2146
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:58,040
This will be playing like Main Street's theme as you're coming onto the mall.

2147
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,960
The state of America.

2148
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:01,000
It was never be heard.

2149
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,240
And in the tapes, there'll be Chucko's statue like the Waltz statue in Town Square.

2150
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:06,680
The Disneyland.

2151
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:11,280
It was part of his contract and he actually he has 26 percent.

2152
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,680
Yeah, the rest of it.

2153
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,400
He has one more percent.

2154
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:20,480
Also, I like to announce that Chucko is officially alive again.

2155
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,280
Happy birthday to you.

2156
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:25,040
It's true.

2157
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,960
And happy birthday.

2158
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,880
Happy birthday to our future mall.

2159
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:34,600
We must reopen the country.

2160
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:38,120
Let's give those kids back in school.

2161
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,200
Don't wear a mask.

2162
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,600
Best start real.

2163
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,480
But hydro coxacoron is the.

2164
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:52,920
If you put a corpse in the wet lens and restroth the food, it comes back to life.

2165
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,320
And that's how I'm a year.

2166
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,440
Like the Lazarus pit from Batman.

2167
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:01,320
I said that I think I said that the Mr.

2168
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,200
Six episode was the weirdest episode.

2169
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:06,800
And now I change to this one one snuck in there.

2170
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:11,360
Yeah, that Chucko the clown was a was revived to sing an American song

2171
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:15,280
because of toxic waste found at the site of Xanadu.

2172
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:15,960
Yep.

2173
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,560
This sucks.

2174
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,000
Race. This is not canon.

2175
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,040
This is not podcast.

2176
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:23,040
The right canon. It's main.

2177
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,800
None of this main feed, Scott.

2178
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,880
It has to be. It's made feed.

2179
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,440
And I'm sure next week will be even more normal.

2180
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:31,880
I can only assume.

2181
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:36,160
Back to regular fun, pleasant stuff.

2182
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,680
We're really coming apart, aren't we? Yep.

2183
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,120
Oh, let's let's get a let's get a break.

2184
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,000
We we we deserve one.

2185
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:43,920
I agree.

2186
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,960
Oh, no.

2187
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,240
Bye bye, kids. Bye.

2188
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,960
Bye. Go outside.

2189
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,880
Get coughed on.

2190
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,360
Forever.

2191
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,920
