1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That was the, there's the bell on the door, not the door bell,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but the little jangly bell on top of the door of the charming little PTR post office.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's the sound of letters being delivered.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They just came in and we're going to sort through them and make you part of the show.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you for your questions.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, we still have to introduce ourselves and that kind of thing.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So we've done that and we have culled some questions.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And this process gave me a question to ask everyone.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We've discussed this internally a tiny bit and now I'm going to pose it generally to the audience.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How we have always done this in the past is on Twitter.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But as we know, Twitter is a corpse now.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Twitter is a terrible place and it's becoming, like when we're aware of this,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know how much longer we want to conduct our primary business on this horrible ash heap of a platform.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Look, it's always, we've all, everyone has been called, you know, I heard it called a garbage fire.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I heard it a number of years ago, in fact.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But you know, at least it was still like functioning.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now it's just like, I posted the question, like, can you even reply anymore?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is Elon going to like just eliminate, you know, all right, no more W's we realize?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
W's are not conducive to, it's not cool.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So yeah, it's the letter next to X.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we bumped it.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It kind of got in the way.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So you can't use W anymore, but otherwise it's the same.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So it sucks.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We don't want to be, we asked questions on Instagram too.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here's my question.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Where do you want us?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where are you actually, where's the listener actually going to be?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because you hear blue sky and you hear threads.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Personally, I'm not getting on any of this shit as Scott.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But the podcast, I would like the podcast social media has always made me very happy interacting with you guys and making jokes about theme park news.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'd like to do these things.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That stuff's fun.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But where are you audience?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where should we be?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where you are?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which one of these consolation prizes are you taking?

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I wonder if there's any, I bet there's not even a consensus, but I'm interested to see what people say.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, because I've been poking around on blue sky and I haven't set up the show account yet.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I own my personal account.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I posted a silly little jokey other day and it got more likes on blue sky than Twitter.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I was like, oh, is this the turning point?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is a sign.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can I ask what the difference was in likes?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like 30, 30, 40.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OK, that's a lot.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's a lot.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait, well, that means you had a hit blue sky.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Did you have a viral blue sky?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I guess I did.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A viral.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do they call them skeets?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that a bit?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know what's going on.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do they call them skeets?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I feel like I kept seeing people refer to it as skeets.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Doesn't seem right.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That doesn't seem right.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know if that was a joke that got out of hand or what.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, I guess it makes sense in a way.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's like the skeets that you shoot at, they go flying up into the blue sky.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everyone look at that skeet shoot by.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Congrats on your viral skeet, first of all.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh my God, I'm looking at our questions and they're all about Jason's viral skeet.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How did he think of it?

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Is he proud of it?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is he going to rest on his laurels and never skeet again?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, maybe.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's always a possibility.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll say this on the Instagram, the question box you get on stories, the answers come in

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
in a very organized fashion.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know if I've ever seen it.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's just a really nice line of like, here's the people who wrote in.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So you're saying, so for you, for your purposes, looking at it.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For our purposes, for mail back purposes.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Comfortability wise.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, I did an old person thing and immediately screen grabbed the ones I wanted so I didn't

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
have to look in the app.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't see, I have all the complaints I have about Twitter.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
One is not that it's not organized.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh no, I wasn't saying about Twitter.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was just like, oh, this looks very nice.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hadn't tried this feature yet.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, great.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Enjoy your, look through your organized pile of now screenshots and I'll see what I can

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
grab.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you looking at Twitter too, Mike?

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I should have had one ready to go.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I had one.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I had one.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's a one that got sent in on our Patreon that I just screen grabbed.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And it's a simple one.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I've pulled up pictures of toys.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's not what I wanted.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That says Brianna sent you a message.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the question here is, during Celebriary, Jason talked about his plan at Hollywood Watch.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Did he ever get his?

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Did I ever get, well, I think it's probably back, I did have a plan at Hollywood Watch

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for a number of years.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The band started to rot at some point.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh wait, I have screwed the, during, okay, did he ever get his watch guy to fix it?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, I still haven't found it.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, I haven't taken it to the watch guy yet.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wow.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is somebody who fully knows the story.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Better than we do.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We didn't remember.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry, I obviously got confused too there.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I apologize.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So no, you haven't gone to the watch guy.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So I haven't dug it out and got it.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But you have a watch guy.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, Tulik Lake has a watch repairman and batteries.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We have talked about this.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's right across from the old Bob's Big Boy.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is the watch repairman, is it like a 90 year old?

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, it's actually a pretty young guy.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Damn.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Man, that sucks.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Find a new guy.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Find an older guy.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think there's an older, there's a watch.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What does this guy know?

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's a kid.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Does he have a co, do you have a cobbler or anything?

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In Burbank?

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I, I don't know.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are the dry cleaning people, are they elderly?

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do they hang it on a line outside?

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, do they hang it on a line?

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Run it through the little, the washer?

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Jason, who do you see for goods or services that are pushing 80 or 90?

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Anyone in Burbank?

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's a good question.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I feel like.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It seems like the answer is no.

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, I don't, I mean, cobbler, you like, uh, I feel like I mostly have bought shitty shoes

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
over the years that are not worth repairing.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Right.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know?

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You haven't needed a cobbler.

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I haven't needed a cobbler.

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
All right.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then Milneadies, it's just a small army of people who work at that.

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Famous dry cleaners in Burbank.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Of course.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Famous?

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Famous.

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It is kind of famous.

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why?

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Huh?

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Huh?

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Follow question, why?

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That doesn't make it famous.

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why is it famous?

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The studio, customers go there, stylists go there.

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe locally famous.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Locally, no.

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Locally notorious.

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Locally famous.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like, why does someone in Indiana know about Milneadies?

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, no, no, not someone in Indiana.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But like, if you're driving around the valley, there's a giant pink building.

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do they have hot dogs there?

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Huh?

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think on Fridays they still do hot dogs.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They do have popcorn.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They have free coffee and cookies.

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well.

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know?

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What more do you need?

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, maybe it should be famous.

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It should be nationally famous, if not internationally famous.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sure.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do they cook the hot dogs near the chemicals to do the dry cleaning?

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it's like one of those machines.

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've never smelled chemicals there, honestly.

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's all.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's all in the back.

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, it's all in the back.

203
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a pretty big operation.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it's not interfering with the hot dogs.

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hope not.

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Where have you been where you can smell chemicals in the.

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The dry cleaner?

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In the block?

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sometimes.

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Maybe I'm crazy.

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It just smells fresh.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Good chemicals.

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The chemicals are kind of dangerous, some of those places.

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think you need to go to a less stinky dry cleaner is what you need to do.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Maybe that's the problem.

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The hot dogs I've been eating at my dry cleaner are really smelly, too.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So these hot dogs smell like the cleaning fluid.

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I mean, they're free, so I'm going to eat them.

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But still, always life hack.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Always eat a free hot dog.

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ask no questions.

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's like the army.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You eat and sleep when you can.

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You know, you never know when you're going to come across a free hot dog.

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

229
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Anyone got one?

230
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ned Mulca asked on Instagram, has the term e-ticket run away from its original meaning?

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The pack mules were once e-tickets.

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Pretty good specific there about the pack mules.

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know.

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I feel like most big new rides people refer to as e-tickets, you know, unless it's like a flat ride, like a spinner ride.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, yeah, but what does he mean?

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He means that e-tickets were once...

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's saying that we don't acknowledge our mules and celebrate our mules.

239
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is this question mule based or is it more of a broader point about what we've recontextualized e-ticket or redefined it, I should say?

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think the redefined, yeah.

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like now it means like the best, biggest thing is my guess.

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
At the time, I think it was mules.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And now it's not.

244
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now, unfortunately, it's not mules.

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I think times change and mules used to be a little more exciting, which I find sad.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There were probably many, maybe centuries on this earth where a mule ride was the most exciting thing available to do anywhere.

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So you get to go to Disney and go to a mule ride and that was a big deal.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I'm saying like the year two.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What was better to do than ride a mule?

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right. That's true.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, yeah, obviously it's changed.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, does it?

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, like we've talked about this on the show.

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
E-tickets.

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I said something along the lines of I wouldn't make pirates an e-ticket anymore because of the way I feel about e-tickets, which I know people think is insane.

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, you got some bad feet.

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
People were mad at me for saying that.

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Was that the one that pirates isn't an e-ticket?

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I said pirates in Haunted Mansion aren't e-tickets anymore and I think people are very mad at me.

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's crazy to me.

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, just the way that e-ticket now feels, it feels like it has to be some crazy blockbuster.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Like the vehicle itself is like something you've never experienced, like is mega high tech.

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I just think scope.

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think scope is what always.

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

267
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But then that begs the question, due to scope, does that require then that you define Spaceship Earth as an e-ticket?

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right.

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Because that doesn't feel right to me.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, but it is as there has as much scope.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's just not as quite as beloved as those other two rides.

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think it's not.

273
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know what kills Spaceship Earth in the e-ticket?

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And let me say, I love Spaceship Earth.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I make a point of going on it every time.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm so happy when I'm in that line, when I'm in that building.

277
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I agree.

278
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Second half, I think we've all maybe had as much fun as we're going to have with the terrible, your future.

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In the future, your face will be very spotty in a photo that was taken terribly.

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh yeah, it sucks.

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, that sucks.

282
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If that, what was that second half?

283
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The jib-jab part of Epcot, of the Spaceship Earth.

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Jib-jab was the future at one point in like in 2006.

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But today we've maybe moved past jib-jab.

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, it's bad.

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, they know it.

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sure that was part of the defunct.

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If at some point we're recording this still in the sag strike, and AI is obviously going to be an issue all the time.

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But if you saw one of those tweets go around, maybe I make this joke on Twitter already.

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Look what's possible with AI and then cut to that.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Cut to you, cut to Guy with half his face caved in skiing.

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You see, they just took this photo and then 10 minutes later a fully animated sequence.

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Actors are fucked.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He's got eight fingers on his hand.

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, but you're not as good as the other two.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But yes, scope-wise and history-wise, and it would have been considered I think a neat ticket at one point.

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So it's tough because I now think there's other things that are there's a lot of different qualifiers for you.

300
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Take it as Big Thunder and ticket.

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thunder Mountain Railroad is at an e-ticket.

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You say yes.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I say, Jason, I guess so.

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where do you draw the line to be ticket?

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's the first one that that feels like it's right on the cusp?

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Obviously, Splash Mountain was an e-ticket.

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think Space Mountain is an e-ticket.

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They were done with tickets by Space Mountain.

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just mean in the sense, I think it's more of a feeling.

310
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's a feeling, it's not a fact.

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think what I might be pulling into it at this point is like e-ticket feels like this historical Disney term in this way.

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So in some ways, so I almost like is Big Thunder high tech, not necessarily, but it's like Disneyland primary basic beloved got to do it.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think if there wasn't the nostalgia for the term e-ticket right tied into it, it's Star Tours and e-ticket.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, but not Millennium Falcon.

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's tricky because Millennium Falcon so much more impressive.

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Maybe I'm docking it points historically.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So your tickets are more historical than they are sort of more impressive rides necessary.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You know what I'm pulling into it maybe is that like I think most rides that have the, what is all that shit called now, Lightning Lane, whatever.

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, yeah, right.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If it has Lightning Lane available, that feels like that.

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, that's an e-ticket then I think.

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, Genie Plus Lightning Lane access or individual Lightning Lane purchase.

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know and I hate your question.

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm so sick of this stuff.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't want to learn it.

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's getting worse.

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They're charging more money.

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like they are really testing all of us.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They're testing us every day.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How far?

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They're daring us.

332
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't come here.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fuck.

334
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's worked.

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I haven't been like all year.

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know and they're testing me.

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going because my friends are in town and I'm excited on some level, but like they're making us madder every day.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's making me want breaks.

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I want absence to make the heart grow fonder.

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will be back.

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We're recording this as we're going to Florida.

342
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We'll be in Disney World.

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We'll be in Disney World.

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They are making us madder every day and they're trying.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's a whole other conversation.

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But it's tough because Mickey and Minnie now has been absorbed in Genie Plus, I believe.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They don't have a Lightning Lane, but that's an e-ticket, of course.

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's right.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's very cool and impressive.

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But I think that so many.

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But I don't think you buy that definition.

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Doesn't Millennium Falcon have to be?

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's what I mean.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But then everything is almost an e-ticket.

355
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Really then you really should just.

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think it's a stacked category.

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then you should just have e-tickets and D and C and C is teacups and then D is the dark rides.

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Then you eliminate A almost.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like getting rid of the penny.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Almost nothing is an e-ticket.

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because if we're talking historical, Peter Pan should be an e-ticket.

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because of how long it's been around and how beloved it is.

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Not anymore though.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think you.

365
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You think that one's changed.

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is a pan bias.

367
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But I think.

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But those waits.

369
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It sells in insane wait time.

370
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have family visiting where it's like well it's only 40 minutes.

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's do it.

372
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know.

373
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because we're not.

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because if Pan and Big Thunder I think should be in the same category.

375
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't think.

376
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Historically.

377
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Literally.

378
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't think Peter Pan's flight was any ticket.

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If that tells you.

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't think it was either.

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah.

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I kind of in the hindsight now feel like Big Thunder and Peter Pan should be in the same category.

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Not the other dark rides necessarily.

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I disagree.

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Big Thunder goes fast.

386
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Big Thunder's a fast ride.

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ultimately like Peter Pan I think is like it's nostalgia and it's a nice I think gentle.

388
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't think almost anything gentle is an e-ticket.

389
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's interesting.

390
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well I think there is something to that in my definition of e-ticket.

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Because I think it's a cleaner definition of like big fast impressive.

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I would still put space like in this definition it's like still Space Mountain.

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's Guardians.

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's cars.

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's Rise of the Resistance.

396
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Falcon is on the cusp of it.

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think Falcon.

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And the Context.

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And credit coasters on it.

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

401
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But the Context Falcon was introduced was always the secondary ride to Rise of the Resistance.

402
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Even though they didn't get them both open at the same time.

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It almost felt like a D ticket.

404
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So a D ticket.

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's automatically number two.

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's also not though because it's impressive.

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Obviously people don't like it as much as they should.

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But the technology is insane.

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The line is insane.

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Peter Pan's flight was a C.

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was a C ticket.

412
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I hear you.

413
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think I don't understand not shying that up to e.

414
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I know I hear you when I just said nothing gentle and yet I have ranked Haunted Mansion Pirates as e.

415
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But I think you got more.

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The only other thing I think is scope and the scope is enormous.

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know what else is an e-ticket?

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Country Bear Jamboree.

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well in that definition absolutely I agree.

420
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But my definition of what e-ticket is, which I think is at least simpler, is just the biggest big stuff, newish stuff, impressive, fast.

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I feel like you can put that.

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I feel like I can make the sense of that easier than having a really like wide ranging criteria for an e-ticket.

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you think about this Peter Pan issue?

424
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think it's tough because it's like I don't think it was designed to be like that.

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It was designed to be an e-ticket.

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But I think organically so many people took to it and it often has some of the longest waits in the park.

427
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I don't think waits has anything to do with it.

428
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think the ride itself.

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you go off, they get off that ride and in this way this like the parlance of is that way that was a real e-ticket.

430
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't think you come off, you got to come off the thing with kind of blown away.

431
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How do people feel besides little children on Peter Pan's flight?

432
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think though there is some Peter Pan is doing something different than the other dark rides.

433
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a reason not just it's slower loading, which it might be, but there is something it's still doing after all these years that make it the most popular one.

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Now, obviously it's not the big scope of pirates, but I think there is something about it that is still wowing people or making them excited.

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's a sensation I think of flying.

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's the track above you that makes it unique.

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If something in Fantasyland had to be pegged as an e-ticket, it would probably be that because I don't know that it has that much competition.

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know what it was in reality was Small World apparently.

439
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Was an e-ticket. Right. Yeah.

440
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah. That I kind of I believe that it's a long ride.

441
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
A lot of puppets.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Scope.

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A lot of sets.

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah. A lot of scope.

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Here's where I come on your opinion, Mike.

446
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't think I can't square a world where Peter Pan's flight is e-ticket and not Haunted Mansion Pirates of the Caribbean.

447
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I agree with that.

448
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, no. I was saying that if Peter Pan, it's Haunted Mansion and Pirates 2.

449
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Then you let them all in the door.

450
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I say they all go in the door if that's the criteria.

451
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But my definition I think that I'm sticking with is sort of what I just said is like the big fast rides.

452
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Newish. I certainly bias toward new.

453
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Sure.

454
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But.

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And I know I'm bringing my bias into this.

456
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't think Peter Pan's flight should be an e-ticket and I don't think a meet and greet with Chucko the Clown should be an e-ticket either.

457
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm bringing my personal issues into.

458
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Fair enough.

459
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We can all have the Disney is not defined this in the year 2023.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So we all are sort of grasping at our own straws.

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
OK. I have another good one here.

462
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This more personal kind of based.

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Eric Terry Moore asked worst date at a theme park or have you had a date at a theme park?

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What is this question?

465
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That just went odd.

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Date?

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I think this is funny.

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I just haven't had a lot of dates admittedly at theme parks.

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Exactly.

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was interested. Yeah, because I haven't either.

471
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Unless you got.

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, no.

473
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I thought you were going to say, well, I have a story.

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No, the answer, sir, is no.

475
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I wanted to hear if anyone else had.

476
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No, because I.

477
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I told it on the Club 3, my story.

478
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The most humiliating story ever told for this level.

479
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That was like that was like that was like like we almost had to like give an X rating to that story.

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's how crazy that story was.

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's a lameness you're dealing with on this on this show.

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, I just never had like because my dating history is very low.

483
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I had two regular girlfriends and then my wife who have been with forever.

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So that just doesn't give me a ton.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I would just I would go I was never like a single date that went to a theme park.

486
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I went with a girlfriend, though, who I mean, I very I clearly remember.

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Wow, I'm going to Disneyland with my new girlfriend.

488
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I get to say some of the stuff that I know.

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So we're walking down Main Street and like now look, those windows up there, those are the names of imagineers, people who helped build the rides.

490
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I think she said, who cares?

491
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, and I'm like, OK, well, I guess I better not build an entire years long project around saying facts that are more arcane than that.

492
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, that's rough.

493
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't even know if I have anything like that good to say.

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I wonder if listeners have had that story where like they've really I guarantee there's a lot of people listening to this right now who have tried to set to said to somebody they love somebody.

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's not even an ex or the like somebody they're like life partner.

496
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
They have repeated something from our show and gotten a who cares.

497
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's not a literal who cares than like a just a blank way like sorry, we're talking.

498
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah, yeah, that happens constantly with the show.

499
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere. What?

500
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What was that?

501
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know what happened.

502
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just drifted away.

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The person they said it to, their brain was just doing the turkey in the straw that Homer's does.

504
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Little old cartoon.

505
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

506
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I've been like on a Tilted Whirl in like sixth grade with a girl that I thought was cute.

507
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But I didn't say anything.

508
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't just like, well, I hope Serendipity works out.

509
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And we end up married.

510
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Like there was no nothing.

511
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If I may for a minute, that was her name.

512
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Sarah.

513
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
My Sarah.

514
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, that was the girl.

515
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I was with her in sixth grade.

516
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Her name is Sarah.

517
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And yeah.

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And then we kissed.

519
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, that's what we did.

520
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Interesting. What nationality is that?

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, American?

522
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want a Shire King.

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I want a big stuffed plush.

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I want a bigan at the carnival for her.

525
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I was playing for another bigan.

526
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
See, in that story at 12 years old, I would have been like, well, I see them at school all the time.

527
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But how often do I get to ride a Tilted Whirl?

528
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know, I would have been purely focused on the Tilted Whirl.

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, I see.

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was going to say, because that energy seemed weird because you're like shaking around.

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
How often do I get to ride?

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I would have been so excited.

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So I was like, whoa, wait, you really want to get them.

534
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But you're saying you don't want a girl in the way.

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You want pure Tilted Whirl.

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I would have been happy to join, but I would have started talking about like, you know, if you close your eyes, sometimes sensations feel stronger.

537
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You were horny for the Tilted Whirl.

538
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Huh? Oh, yeah.

539
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I was torn up for the Tilted Whirl.

540
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
My coming of age story was just riding the Tilted Whirl.

541
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Jason, do you want to go on the Tilted Whirl with me?

542
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No.

543
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Why don't we get our own cars?

544
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We get our own cars.

545
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I get to slide around back and forth.

546
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The vibration of the Tilted Whirl are better when you're solo in a car.

547
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Wasn't there this upsetting thread about a woman who like was in love with coasters?

548
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, there was a deranged thread.

549
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, I like that name, yeah.

550
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There was a deranged thread where someone was sexually attracted to roller coasters.

551
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And then the further you got down the thread, the person doing the thread revealed like, now I have a buddy who's part, who's like, you know, has an attachment to this roller coaster.

552
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And it was that like they were mad at the person sexually attracted roller coasters because they had normal friends who were romantically attracted to roller coasters.

553
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, okay.

554
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's not a true rollercoaster. It's not a taking advantage sexual relationship.

555
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, it takes all kinds, I guess.

556
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Jason's first crush was the Tilted Whirl, it sounds like.

557
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Mine was Chase Meridian and Jason's was the Tilted Whirl.

558
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
She twirls like a beautiful ballet dancer.

559
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, yes, they weave in and out of each other.

560
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh, the precision.

561
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Look at this, the grace, the beauty of the Tilted Whirl.

562
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We're only I to tame her.

563
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Summer ends and we say goodbye at the Jersey Shore for love shall come again next spring.

564
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Why is Jason dressed in a little tux in his sixth grade going to the carnival?

565
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He brought a heart shaped box of candies.

566
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
For what?

567
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
For roses as well.

568
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
For who?

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
He said he was going to dance the Tilted Whirl like Gene Kelly danced with the vacuum cleaner.

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He's been taking ballroom dancing lessons.

571
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Leading up to the carnival.

572
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

573
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, he just got bodied by a Tilted Whirl.

574
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh, he did it to the machine.

575
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He's hitting between the cars.

576
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Do not exit the car when it's in motion.

577
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, he landed on the pavement outside.

578
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He cracked his head open.

579
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He's so injured, but he's still trying to kiss the side of the car.

580
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Oh, no.

581
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I think he's saying, I get a kick out of you, but there's so much blood spurting out of his mouth.

582
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh, man.

583
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then when they put your brain back together, suddenly you were attracted to human women.

584
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
They got scrambled up on the pavement and rearranged everything.

586
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm regular now.

587
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Good.

588
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm normal.

589
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Thank you for hurting me, sweet lady.

590
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Thank you, sweet lady.

591
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:49,000
My actual answer, I think I used to be far too practical of like, well, we had to be dating at least for a few months to know if we want to go to a theme park together,

592
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
because you're going to be with the person for hours and hours, often in line, having to make conversations.

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So that'd be terrible for like a first or second date where you're just getting to know each other.

594
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's a big ass, the giant all day.

595
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If you drive down there together, assuming you're far away from one.

596
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

597
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah.

598
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's a little easier if you live in LA and it's like, oh, we both have passes to Universal and we're going to go over and then eat at City Wall.

599
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like that's a little more low key.

600
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And City Walk, of course, the best place for a date in Los Angeles and the state and the world.

601
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, you can't spell City Walk without romance.

602
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I've got I've got one.

603
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Sorry, Scott, this question and I are going to really get.

604
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, I saw, you know, I was almost saying, yeah, pick it because I could take a break here.

605
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, you can leave if you want.

606
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah, you three were put in charge of putting an X-Men ride in Disney's California Adventure.

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But the ride has to be a re theme of a ride that is already in the park.

608
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Which ride would you re theme?

609
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Thanks, Zach McCowen.

610
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But I don't know why you said three and not two.

611
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
He should have said two, but he didn't want to be mean.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
He didn't want to leave you out.

613
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Thank you.

614
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know, you know, it's Hugh Jackman.

615
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You've seen some of the specifics of this.

616
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But this is look, this is a shockingly little, you know, Hugh Jack.

617
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I said Hugh Jackman.

618
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I do know who that is.

619
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You know, he was a great showman.

620
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, so OK, this is a tough one because the X and a beautiful X-Men ride is all what Jason and I have dreamed of our whole lives.

621
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We're going to build a big, beautiful X-Men ride.

622
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Beautiful.

623
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And this is all we've ever wanted, I think, as far as properties.

624
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't know. Maybe there's something else.

625
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Maybe I wanted like a song.

626
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Maybe I wanted a Mario ride earlier, a Sonic ride or something.

627
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But X-Men has been the one that's never really happened.

628
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, the Storm Spinner ride at Islands of Adventure is just not enough.

629
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It is not enough.

630
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It is not there.

631
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So this is an interesting test because you have to re-theme a current ride.

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And I would obviously prefer one built from scratch.

633
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But we're going to need to do some real construction on stuff because nothing, nothing like pops out immediately as, oh, that's the perfect option.

634
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Because I would want if we were doing Disneyland, Rise of the Resistance, gone.

635
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
X-Men in.

636
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh my God.

637
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's what I would do.

638
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
100%.

639
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Jason's with me on this.

640
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Do you start, it's a school?

641
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, do the quick version.

642
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Do the quick version.

643
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay.

644
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You are a new mutant arriving at Xavier's school for gifted youngsters.

645
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's the mansion.

646
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
What?

647
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hold on.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You actually are maybe somewhere else.

649
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You're actually sort of like, you're going through the first part of the line and then you get on a little mini Blackbird.

650
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You re-theme the Lieutenant Beck ship into a little mini Blackbird and then you end up at the mansion.

651
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
At the man, doors open.

652
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Doors open.

653
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's the hangar in the mansion or whatever.

654
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Or you just see like the mansion in the distance and then you go and you go into your room.

655
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Guys, I understand that this has become an anti Rise of the Resistance podcast.

656
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No, no, no.

657
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's not anti, it's not anti.

658
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But you guys are, you're frothing at the mouth.

659
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You're thrilled to bulldoze.

660
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I am thrilled to bulldoze.

661
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You're going to go in with the bats and just smash every stormtrooper in the head.

662
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I would be happy to do it because of how much I love X-Men.

663
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This isn't my anti Rise of the Resistance.

664
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No, you're famously, famously a big fan.

665
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
No, it's separated, but it's separated from it.

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is separate.

667
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Because he loves Rise of the Resistance and he's doing the same thing.

668
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's how much people love X-Men.

669
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The prison cells could easily be orientation and then the ride, ride part is like, it's a big battle.

670
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's become not interrogation rooms, but regular classrooms.

671
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes, classrooms.

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Where you learn, where your mind grows, you learn how to use your powers.

673
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You get Emma Frost in there, you get Hank McCoy, you get your different teachers.

674
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Hank McCoy?

675
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Now I'm on board?

676
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The Beast, the Beast.

677
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Hank!

678
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Get far fucking good.

679
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

680
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Get Ray out of there.

681
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Fuck Ray.

682
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Hank McCoy, Emma Frost.

683
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And so maybe the ride itself starts as just a tour through the school, but then a battle breaks out and then the very end, you're dropped.

684
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The drop portion, it actually reveals, oh this is all a danger room simulation.

685
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Of course.

686
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Welcome to school.

687
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Perfect.

688
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You're okay.

689
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Everyone's okay.

690
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This is a simulation?

691
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That sucks.

692
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It didn't happen.

693
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's a sitcom.

694
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It was all a dream.

695
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Normally I would agree with that, but the danger room is such a main part of the X-Men.

696
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This is an inverse of, in Men in Black, you're in a simulation.

697
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Guess what?

698
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's real.

699
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You're pitching a flip where none of that happened.

700
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That stinks.

701
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Well actually the Men in Black ride does kind of trick you into like, oh never mind.

702
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because they erase your mind, but it all happens.

703
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's a cute little bit.

704
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It doesn't reverse it.

705
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I would normally say yes, but if you had the affection for the X-Men and knew about how cool a danger room is, I think you would be on board with this.

706
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But then the X-Men actually go to fight, don't they?

707
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
They fight some crazy shit.

708
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
They fight in the danger room, everyone and everyone.

709
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's true, that's true.

710
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The trouble with Rise of the Resistance is that it's happening.

711
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
What if we could create a ride, a simulation of a simulation?

712
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But it's so iconic that people would still be thrilled to be in the danger room.

713
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's the thing.

714
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And McCoy is there?

715
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Hey, McCoy is there.

716
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The name McCoy, before is DC like questionable actions in the last few years.

717
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't care about that.

718
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Throw that out.

719
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Can you go back to the original question?

720
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Was it asking for anything at Disneyland?

721
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Redoing DCA.

722
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
DCA.

723
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So now we haven't answered the question yet.

724
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Thank God.

725
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank God they said DCA.

726
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What's happening where all of Galaxy's Edge is gone and it becomes Marvel?

727
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Now, in the year where, boy, Star Wars is starting to shit the bed.

728
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Where's the future?

729
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Marvel.

730
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
People want as much of this as they can get.

731
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
1990s X-Men.

732
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

733
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
1990s X-Men.

734
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So I think it is, if you redo either Radar Springs Racers or Soarin'.

735
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I think you gotta get Radar Radiator Springs.

736
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You monsters.

737
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You could pick anything.

738
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You could take, you could leave good rides and replace and take a bad ride and do an

739
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
overlay that makes turns a bad ride into a good ride.

740
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And you are removing the star rides of both parts.

741
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm not, this isn't a slight of the actual rides.

742
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm just thinking, I'm just on a lark of like, oh, the beats of this ride, if you had to

743
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
theme it, you could do Radar Springs Racers similar, arriving at the school and then a

744
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
battle breaks out.

745
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's just a school again.

746
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's a big rock canyon.

747
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,880
What's it gonna get turned into?

748
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,200
What is the outside now?

749
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,400
Could it be Krakoa?

750
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
Could you turn the rock into Krakoa, the living island?

751
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It could be Krakoa.

752
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It could be the living island they live on.

753
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,480
Okay, I don't know what that is, but this sounds better.

754
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
There's a living island.

755
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
There's a living island.

756
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm not, you tear down rocks and make it a school.

757
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,800
As an outset, I'm glad I'm here to regulate you.

758
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I wouldn't know.

759
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I wonder if I were to tell you the school's in Westchester County, New York.

760
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,120
Pretty interesting.

761
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,600
I think on Radiator Springs though, you change the cars into what, little jets, little Blackbird

762
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
jets?

763
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Yeah.

764
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Okay.

765
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Cause they're going to have a race at the end or though that doesn't, that's not as

766
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
fun.

767
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
There should be something more fun.

768
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Or sometimes they have sports cars.

769
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,080
Can you make Radiator Springs like ancient Egypt?

770
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,920
Like in their fighting apocalypse or something.

771
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Cause apocalypse and Sabaner, of course, played by Oscar Isaac in the bad movie X-Men Apocalypse,

772
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,400
all of your not favorites will be there.

773
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Yeah.

774
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Well, characters from bad movies.

775
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
It's not going to be the movie version.

776
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,000
It's going to be the 90s X-Men version, of course.

777
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah.

778
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It can't be the current version because he's an ally of the X-Men.

779
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.

780
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It can't be that either.

781
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's got to be, it's got to be when Jason and I were kids.

782
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,720
That version, that's what the version is.

783
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,840
Soaring is the cleanest for like, oh, you're soaring through a black, you know, in the

784
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Blackbird jet.

785
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah.

786
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,120
And then a battle breaks out in the air with, it's actually just the E-ticket that was supposed

787
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,320
to go to Avengers campus, which is devolving every time we see concept art.

788
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
The ride system though, is not what I want.

789
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,480
I think it has to be, I think it has to be Radiator Springs Racers.

790
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,400
And I think it, like, you're going to have to find like a jet, like you're going through

791
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,120
like basic mutant training or something.

792
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Sure.

793
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
It's going to have to be.

794
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,000
And we'll have to use the existing track.

795
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

796
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And Radiator Springs Racers.

797
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,760
So we've zim cars land to the Westchester, New York.

798
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,320
That's now no longer Route 66 or whatever.

799
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Welcome to Westchester.

800
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
It's Westchester.

801
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,880
And, and now, yeah, you change you.

802
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,080
So use the rock formation to be, because there's a famous Jason Aaron run of X-Men, the writer

803
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,240
Jason Aaron, of course, who he had Krakow under the mansion, the living island, sort

804
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,360
of the mansion was on top of it.

805
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,000
So like the, the Island would be sort of a character as well.

806
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,920
It was kind of a Magic School Bus meets X-Men kind of a run, which I really liked.

807
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,260
So that'll be the mansion will be there.

808
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,560
But then the sort of mountain range of Radiator Springs will be Krakow, the living island.

809
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,920
And then it will just take you through dark ride scenes of all the characters we like.

810
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Hank McCoy, Aurora Monroe, Jubilation Lee, Jason, feel free to draw.

811
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Remi Labu.

812
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Remi Laboe.

813
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I always thought of his name.

814
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I always get it wrong.

815
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
And it can be Maggot.

816
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,000
I forget Maggot's real name.

817
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,520
And then at the end, it's Maggot.

818
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
It's Maggot.

819
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:11,160
He's got a big nineties coat and his digestive system can come out of his body in the form

820
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,960
of metal slug Maggot and it eats things.

821
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
Come watch Maggot shit Maggot's.

822
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,400
Yes, exactly.

823
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
So you can see that.

824
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,960
And yeah, you get so, so you do get like kind of slower intimate moments with the different

825
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,040
X-Men because of how much dark ride space there is in Radiator Springs.

826
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,480
Everyone gets a personal slow dance with Mystique.

827
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,400
Oh, yes, absolutely.

828
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,880
And she will, she will allow a kiss on the cheek if you ask nicely.

829
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
That's good.

830
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,600
And then she starts mutating into like people, you know, maybe they pass, maybe they project

831
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,560
at you because she's fucking with your head.

832
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,720
We're using new technology where she can pull out people you know from your life and her

833
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,920
face will change into like an old girlfriend.

834
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,280
The people who've scorned you the most.

835
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Yes.

836
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm actually your ex-girlfriend, Sarah and Dippity.

837
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,560
And then you go in with Emma Frost and she will have a psychic affair with you like she

838
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,800
did with Cyclops 20 years ago where she has an affair in her mind because she's a telepath.

839
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,680
Can that happen and still we're getting people in and out of this building in 30, 45 seconds?

840
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,880
When you're in your mind, you can, time can slow down so you don't necessarily know how

841
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,240
long it's been when you're having a psychic affair with the robot Emma Frost.

842
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Yeah.

843
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,680
Also, in more recent storytelling, it's kind of alluded to that like a lot of the mutants

844
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,040
living on the island are all Polly now.

845
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Sure, yeah.

846
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,680
That'll be in there too somehow.

847
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,560
I don't know how, but it will be.

848
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,160
It's on the warning sign when you go in.

849
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,280
Warning, this loud, this right is loud, sound, sudden movements, every character you will

850
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
meet is Polly.

851
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Yeah.

852
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,800
So if you're not down, just, you know, kind of just look away.

853
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,160
But if you're in, you know.

854
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,760
Wolverines eyeing up Ms. Marvel and Cyclops.

855
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Not Ms. Marvel.

856
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,960
Ms. Marvel's a child now.

857
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,080
Oh, oh, Captain Marvel.

858
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
From the early?

859
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

860
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh, no, Ms. Marvel.

861
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Sorry, Marvel Girl?

862
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Marvel Woman?

863
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,880
Carol Danvers you're talking about?

864
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
No, Jean Grey I was talking about.

865
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
She's at 788 Phoenix.

866
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Oh, so yeah, so sorry.

867
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Jason and I got ourselves confused.

868
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,040
Is Carol Danvers going to be part of the ride?

869
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
She's part of the ride as well.

870
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Okay.

871
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Well, Kamala Khan is part of the ride, but Carol Danvers is not necessarily part of the

872
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
ride.

873
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Okay, fine.

874
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
We'll be arguing about this off the ear.

875
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,000
And then the end is just sort of a race through Krakoa and you can have Quicksilver sort of

876
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,160
running alongside Pietro, of course, the brother of the Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff, a child

877
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,440
of Magneto.

878
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,680
And you can have, who else is fast?

879
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Who's fast?

880
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Hmm.

881
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Rogue's pretty fast.

882
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Rogue is fast.

883
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Storm is fast.

884
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
These are all flyers.

885
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,480
They all fly so they can all sort of be flying alongside your vehicle.

886
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Oh, North Star is a speedster.

887
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
North Star, yeah.

888
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Can Siren fly?

889
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Banshee's daughter Siren?

890
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Yeah.

891
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Can she fly?

892
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
She can fly.

893
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
Okay, so they're all there.

894
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,680
All the robots are sort of like suspended somewhere and they're all kind of flying along

895
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,800
with you and then you see who wins that race at the end.

896
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,120
And the very end of the ride where they tell you, like in the current ride, it's Mater and

897
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,640
Lightning McQueen telling you who won the race.

898
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,200
It's all the X-Men having a picnic and playing a baseball game.

899
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Yes, baseball game.

900
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:29,440
Because that's often like the interlude bottle episode issues are like the X-Men play baseball

901
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,960
and then a calamity happens.

902
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
That's right.

903
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
The tone of this, the tone.

904
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,160
Because they like, they play, because the X-Men, I love they play baseball.

905
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Yeah.

906
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
That's what my X-Men like to do.

907
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,520
I love any issue where the X-Men play baseball against each other.

908
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
It's like, I love it.

909
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,320
Jason and I are in agreement on this one.

910
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Yeah.

911
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
So there you go.

912
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Great.

913
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
We've done it.

914
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,600
I have warm memories about X-Men baseball games and some family events.

915
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
I just want to make it clear.

916
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Extended family events.

917
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,640
I want to make it clear that date question, what the type of response it got from all

918
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,320
of us and then what this response got and I want to make it very clear who we are and

919
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
what we're.

920
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,000
I'd say you wouldn't have a lot of opportunities for first dates at the Disney theme parks.

921
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Interesting.

922
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah.

923
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Almost like all of you could find.

924
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Okay.

925
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
A lot of breath.

926
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm tired.

927
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,480
I was going to say thank you, Zach, for giving me a break.

928
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,320
It was nice to rest the voice.

929
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Here's one.

930
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,600
Nick D'Ambrosia, now that two thirds of the men in their 30s are childhood, have your

931
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,040
park going habits changed at all other than placing a high value on grass and benches?

932
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,000
Do you find yourselves going more or less the same?

933
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,880
Well, I think Mike can speak to this.

934
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,120
We started this before we had kids and even maybe had fully fleshed out plans to have

935
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,520
kids but it occurred to both of us at some point like, ah, now we can go to theme parks

936
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,800
and it is for work.

937
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,880
For work, yes.

938
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,320
We must, you see.

939
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,560
This is for our job.

940
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,680
With all the haunts, I had to go.

941
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
You had to.

942
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I had to go to haunts for work.

943
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
There was no other way.

944
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
There was no other way around going to Shacktoberfest.

945
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
That's right.

946
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
I'm sorry.

947
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,800
I must depart you, my son.

948
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:17,880
But it's kind of at this age for me, which is three and a half by the time this comes

949
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,280
out, wow, I guess it's, you know, we've had really nice moments.

950
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,600
We've had true magic at the basic theme park because now he's been to Disney and Universal

951
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,600
and there is a whole new, I mean, for sure, it's what you might think where the magic

952
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,680
comes from some mundane, I've said it a bunch of times, but from pushing chairs around or

953
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,680
hitting umbrella tops or just that he sparked up, but he likes the white, the shuttle that

954
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,480
we take to Disneyland more than any of the Disneyland rides.

955
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,000
And now if I'm down there, I'm like, oh, there's the hotel with the shuttle.

956
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,080
It gives me this entire new layer that's very simple.

957
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
That's the opposite of the e-ticket.

958
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,160
And I do love that.

959
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,800
I guess it makes me, I don't know that I go less exactly, but like I definitely am like,

960
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,080
you know, it's made it more viable to like, let's go to the outlet mall with the big chess

961
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,800
set because there's no long security line there.

962
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,400
We can get out of the car and be right there and playing and not like the hassle you definitely

963
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,800
feel with one kid.

964
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,520
I can only imagine with a bunch of kids, which some listeners may have experienced what a

965
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,960
production it is, but genuinely, sincerely, like the way it's like lit up the simple in

966
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,080
theme park going has been lovely.

967
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,240
But as we record this, you haven't done it yet.

968
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,680
You know, we're not there yet.

969
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,240
You haven't done your first Disneyland.

970
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Yeah.

971
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,640
So for sure I'm going like, look, I'm going like the old days of, hey, I'll go.

972
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,080
Well, first of all, there's two things working against that.

973
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,360
The Disney company itself preventing me from just going down on whims.

974
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,560
Side issue.

975
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,640
I don't know how to get a magic key pass.

976
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
I have no clue.

977
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Well, it's not been on sale for months.

978
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Yes.

979
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
And then what's happening?

980
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,680
This is a product that I want to buy from the company that is unavailable.

981
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,040
I'm getting close to now.

982
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,480
I haven't been like all year.

983
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,960
I kind of am starting to get the hankering to do it and I don't know how to go.

984
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,240
All they announced is they were raising the prices on them.

985
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Great.

986
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,280
Maybe one day we're going to make them available soon.

987
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Maybe they will.

988
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
I renewed it.

989
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
I renewed it right before they announced they're raising prices.

990
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,120
That's the only way you have to renew.

991
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
Well, I tried.

992
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
I have, there was a, my friends are coming.

993
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,440
They can't go on a day where my pass is viable because I have a lower pass.

994
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,440
And then there was, yeah, we're going to probably try to do a family trip.

995
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,960
And I go, I may as well just upgrade at this point.

996
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,460
You can't upgrade.

997
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,360
The passes aren't on sale.

998
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
The whole thing.

999
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Remember when you upgraded to the one that gets you all the parks in the country?

1000
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
Because it literally made financial sense.

1001
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Yeah.

1002
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,120
You used to, I went down with you for you to see, you could go to a booth and say, I

1003
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,760
only have California.

1004
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,280
Can I please have Florida too?

1005
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,960
And it took a minute, but they did it.

1006
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,280
Now you can't upgrade in the state.

1007
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,760
They are, it's, the company is in such disarray.

1008
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,800
The articles about Bob Iger didn't even realize how bad a shape it was in.

1009
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,760
He's frustrated and overwhelmed.

1010
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,160
And what they're doing is taking the part of the company that has been doing so well

1011
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,200
for so long and they are continually turning the heat up on everybody.

1012
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,600
That is what their decision making right now is that everything else is doing so poorly

1013
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,880
that what they're going to do is take the business that's good and try to get us, try

1014
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,600
to turn the burner up so the lobster boils so much that it goes, ah, fuck it.

1015
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I don't want to do this.

1016
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I'm so annoyed.

1017
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,120
I have a big heavy question.

1018
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
Not to tangent too much.

1019
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,320
What would you rather, because you're saying all this and I'm like, why is it happening?

1020
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,900
Streamers, streamers, streamers are why strikes streamers have gutted everything.

1021
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,380
What would you rather get rid of on this earth?

1022
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,180
The streamers or social media?

1023
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
Yeah.

1024
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,500
Well, does it go, is it, is it retroactive?

1025
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,580
Does it get rid of the streamers before all this shit?

1026
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,580
Butterfly effect.

1027
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,580
It's all gone.

1028
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
Uh, yeah, I guess streamers.

1029
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,180
Streamers more than social media.

1030
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
Yeah.

1031
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,900
Cause there's still some decent stuff about social media.

1032
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,740
I don't see much of a positive in hindsight.

1033
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,740
I guess.

1034
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,740
Yeah, I know.

1035
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
I've like built, yeah.

1036
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,700
I mean, it made it, it makes something like this more possible to get out there.

1037
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,100
I built my career on like YouTube videos and sharing links and stuff and I don't know if

1038
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,060
I were, if it would have worked as traditional.

1039
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,860
So I'm, I'm, I'm fond of social media.

1040
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,260
I have like, I have like my space.

1041
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,260
You know what?

1042
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,700
Everything but my space is gone.

1043
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Back to my space.

1044
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,700
That's what I say.

1045
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,100
My space was a janky looked bad.

1046
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,900
I see like, it's so funny.

1047
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,300
Everybody's like dumb member, my space.

1048
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
Look at dumb Tom.

1049
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,260
Well, Tom didn't like destroy the fabric of the earth as much as all the other ones.

1050
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,540
The friend ranking was a little weird and would get you into a little trouble.

1051
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,540
Now you're having a little tips.

1052
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,700
I know, but what a dramatic move.

1053
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,940
Cause I had the, you know, my first, the, what led to Aaron and I, my wife hanging out

1054
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,020
for the first time was a my space message from her.

1055
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,340
And then like, what a dramatic move to move her from not even being in the top eight to

1056
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,060
number one.

1057
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,340
How great that felt.

1058
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Wow.

1059
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,260
What a number one in my life.

1060
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,220
It was wonderful.

1061
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,220
That is nice.

1062
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,820
It was a nice little message to broadcast.

1063
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,820
Yes.

1064
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:20,180
To exes perhaps, but all's more to maybe to the ex who said the thing about not being

1065
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,220
interested in the sign.

1066
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
Yes.

1067
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,700
But mainly the magic of a number one.

1068
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,700
That is magical.

1069
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,900
All my exes live in nine and below.

1070
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,340
Would Jason answer that question?

1071
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
Streamers versus social media?

1072
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
Streamers, social media.

1073
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,340
I, yeah.

1074
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,180
Yeah, I think keep social media.

1075
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,100
Cause I feel like-

1076
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,020
Start regulating it like years ago.

1077
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,900
Start like doing something.

1078
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,900
I don't know.

1079
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:57,220
But like I just, a streamer says, I feel like I watch less than when I would actively make

1080
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,820
my Netflix DVD queue.

1081
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,820
Yeah.

1082
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,340
You know, what would be coming the next few weeks?

1083
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:10,540
I've converted, like an old man sounding theme here, but like I've just, I've gone back to

1084
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,540
that.

1085
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,540
Now I go to the library.

1086
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,540
Yes.

1087
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,540
One disc at a time.

1088
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,540
It's nice.

1089
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,100
It feels like Blockbuster again.

1090
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,340
Really want to see a movie.

1091
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:24,580
I figure out which library branch to go to and I get it there because inevitably if I

1092
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,380
really want to see something, it's not streaming anywhere or it's streaming on like Starz Plus

1093
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,820
and it's like, I'm not making a fake email to make it Starz.

1094
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,100
This is so much extra work.

1095
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,660
Are you the one who reserved Panic Room from one of the Burbank's?

1096
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,660
Cause I want to watch it cause of a blank check and Eva was talking about it.

1097
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,660
No, I'm so sorry.

1098
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,580
It's at the area branches, haven't made it over there.

1099
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
So you aren't reserved.

1100
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,060
It says it's on hold for somebody.

1101
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:58,540
I have four movies I have under the silver lake, Mission to Mars, V.I. in the candelabra.

1102
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,580
Cause you want to watch De Palma's, what was it?

1103
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,740
You want to watch De Palma's Bridget Spies.

1104
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,740
No, I don't want to.

1105
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
Oh yeah.

1106
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
I stepped in it.

1107
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,740
I stepped in it.

1108
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,740
I've heard about it so much.

1109
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,260
Griffin made a poor Griffin God in the text.

1110
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,260
He was right.

1111
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,260
He was right Griffin.

1112
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,260
You were right.

1113
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,460
Behind the candelabra and what was the fourth one?

1114
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,460
Oh.

1115
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,460
They have a hard copy of Behind the Candelabra.

1116
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,460
They do.

1117
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:27,060
And Jane wanted to watch cause neither of us could remember if we had seen Death Becomes

1118
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,060
or.

1119
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,580
I watched that really early pandemic.

1120
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,060
That's a fucking awesome movie.

1121
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,060
That's so fun.

1122
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,060
Hell of a run in the 80s.

1123
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,060
Yeah.

1124
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Yeah.

1125
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,060
Zemeckis killing it.

1126
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,060
Zemeckis.

1127
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,060
All right.

1128
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,060
Now you know Jason's what DVDs.

1129
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,060
If you want any of those from the Burbank system, check that out.

1130
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,860
Do we satisfy, was there anything, we got down to a tangent.

1131
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,860
Was there anything about kids and we got mad about things instead of child enjoy?

1132
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,460
I haven't done it and I haven't gone a lot and I was going to say it's partly cause of

1133
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,700
the very young child and then partly cause Disney is a big pain in the ass.

1134
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:01,140
But yeah, well when she gets older for sure, I think it'll definitely be more frequent

1135
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,740
cause there's so many good options around.

1136
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:10,420
So I don't know that there's a rule of thumb of like the age to, but we had just pure magic

1137
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,860
with our kid at L through two.

1138
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,860
Two was just like theme parks are killing it with him and it was great.

1139
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,860
And Six Flags has those with Looney Tunes.

1140
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,860
I thought of a dying Looney Tunes.

1141
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,860
They've got more stuff than Universal.

1142
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,700
Scott, let me throw this to you cause Mike, I'm assuming you haven't taken your child

1143
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,500
to nuts yet either.

1144
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
No, no, no, no.

1145
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,660
So he said, Kevin of the Road said for the Disney daddies, what is your favorite Camp

1146
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,660
Snoopy ride?

1147
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,820
Well, you know, we talked about this.

1148
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,420
I couldn't remember the name of it just to remind people.

1149
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,420
Camp Bus.

1150
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,420
They eliminated the one.

1151
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,420
Is it gone?

1152
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:53,540
I eventually said in an episode that Camp Bus was like a truly euphoric moment.

1153
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,780
I plucked it randomly as something in pandemic that I wanted to do with my son and then it

1154
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,540
like could not have gone better.

1155
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,540
It was like delirious.

1156
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:05,580
He's just like rocking his head like Wayne's World and he'd lost his mind.

1157
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,780
It was so great, but they got rid of it.

1158
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,780
I think that's what I saw.

1159
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Yeah.

1160
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,420
Is there a Camp Bus kind of ride at Six Flags?

1161
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,420
Did you look at it?

1162
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,420
Probably.

1163
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,420
It's a very like off the shelf.

1164
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,300
Oh, it came up because I went to great America and they had a much lesser, like a jankier

1165
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,300
version.

1166
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,380
It's the exact same mechanism, clearly.

1167
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,780
I think it was even peanuts also.

1168
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,260
And it was not nearly the magic of Camp Bus, the magic of Knott's.

1169
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,940
But you know what?

1170
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,460
But of ones that are there, the balloons are really nice.

1171
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,460
We had a really good time on them.

1172
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,860
I remember that from like 80s commercials from Knott's Berry Farm and I'd never done

1173
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,860
it.

1174
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:49,700
And yeah, there's just like a little simple glide and a little like not a straight round

1175
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,700
and round.

1176
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,380
And there's kind of an inherent like 80s-ness to those balloons.

1177
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,380
Right.

1178
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,780
And you know, little sights to see.

1179
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
Just trains.

1180
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,380
This is making me, I need to get to Knott's again.

1181
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,380
Yeah, you gotta get back.

1182
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:10,060
I thought of this watching some Soren stuff when we were doing that episode.

1183
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,100
You guys ever been in a hot air balloon?

1184
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
No.

1185
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,100
No.

1186
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,100
No interest.

1187
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,100
I haven't either.

1188
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,660
I haven't been in one, but I'm like, boy, that'd be fun to do sometime.

1189
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,300
They have that like control, like the downtown Disney one in Orlando.

1190
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,300
That's a start.

1191
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,300
Yeah.

1192
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,740
It's not a full on, it's tethered.

1193
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Yes.

1194
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,860
It freaks me out a little bit.

1195
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,140
So I don't know that I'll ever do it.

1196
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,140
Fair enough.

1197
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,140
I think you'd get bored.

1198
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,140
You think I'd be bored?

1199
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,140
I think I'd be just like tense.

1200
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,140
Tense.

1201
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,140
Tense.

1202
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,140
Yeah.

1203
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,140
Anything else?

1204
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,140
One more?

1205
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,140
Yeah, I have one more.

1206
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,180
Because I'll say this one because we started talking about movies.

1207
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:50,940
Aaron asked, what are the PTR canon movies?

1208
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,940
I think that's a bigger thing, but I think if we could toss out some.

1209
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
Late Shift?

1210
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,620
Late Shift is one.

1211
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,620
Clifford?

1212
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,500
Clifford is one, a movie that one out of three of us like.

1213
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
That's the thing.

1214
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,700
I swear to God, I think everyone needs to, I love the idea of it.

1215
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,900
I love that we've embraced it.

1216
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,660
I love the dinosaur world sequence.

1217
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,740
I still think this is kind of a rough movie if we're being honest with ourselves.

1218
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,740
That's what I said.

1219
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,740
I watch it.

1220
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,740
I like everybody.

1221
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Jason, I know you disagree.

1222
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,740
I think you're fully front to back.

1223
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,740
I'm in the Tom Sharer link.

1224
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,740
I think it's delightful.

1225
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,020
But then we all flipped on Country Bears.

1226
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,540
Yeah, that goes the other way.

1227
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,820
I wouldn't put that in a canon though, still.

1228
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,060
I need to give it another chance.

1229
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,260
Behind the Candelabra is, I think, in some ways.

1230
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,260
I think so.

1231
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Well, you'll find out soon.

1232
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Behind the Candelabra is.

1233
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,260
Yeah.

1234
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,740
I don't know.

1235
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,740
It's not really.

1236
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,740
What's on all of us?

1237
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,740
We all love being the Ricardos.

1238
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Obviously.

1239
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,740
Clearly.

1240
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,740
A movie we all read that I the other day was like, oh, remember that movie?

1241
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,740
I forgot about that movie.

1242
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Yeah, we did an episode about it.

1243
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,380
Well, it's while on the Sarkin front.

1244
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,220
I think Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.

1245
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,260
If TV shows are allowed in the canon.

1246
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,260
It's all the movies.

1247
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,420
Very other than the Country Bears, all the movies we've watched on this, I feel like

1248
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,420
we've not.

1249
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,420
Almost all that is true.

1250
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,620
Or maybe we need to celebrate movies more.

1251
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,860
We almost did just scheduling wise, a bunch of other stuff was going on.

1252
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:34,360
But in the wake of Olivia Newton, John's passing, I was proposing a Xanadu because that Xanadu

1253
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,860
is pure pure joy for me.

1254
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,460
Yeah, I like Xanadu.

1255
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,580
That is a fantastic.

1256
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,900
Because I got Covid that kind of threw a schedule in flux.

1257
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:53,020
And I watched that movie while I had Covid and was one of the highlights of being stuck

1258
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,020
inside.

1259
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,860
So you're saying Xanadu was better than like shitting your brains out.

1260
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,860
Yeah.

1261
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:06,340
The movies I watched were Xanadu and The Heartbreak Kid, which is a real surreal.

1262
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,340
Like what an odd.

1263
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,420
Oh, I like that movie.

1264
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,500
Yeah, it was a recent watch for me.

1265
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
The original one, the original.

1266
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Of course.

1267
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Elaine May one.

1268
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1269
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,100
I don't know if it's not.

1270
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,540
It's not so strong.

1271
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,660
I feel like Back to the Future 2.

1272
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Is that just me?

1273
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,140
Oh yeah, I like Back to the Future 2.

1274
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,740
Back to the Future 2 is a really like.

1275
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,980
Back to the Future 2.

1276
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,980
What's that?

1277
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,980
First 20 minutes.

1278
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,980
Only?

1279
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,980
Well, I like the rest of it, but the future stuff is the stuff.

1280
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,300
I actually think if you watch it, I actually maybe struggle a little more with the first

1281
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,300
20 minutes.

1282
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,820
As a kid, I was like, this is aesthetically everything I want.

1283
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:45,100
I love this weird, too silly looking 80s future.

1284
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,140
Now like some of that's here, like what is the scheme that they're like?

1285
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,860
Are you in or are you out?

1286
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:56,340
But I love the going back to the 50s and alternate 85 so much.

1287
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,380
But I think maybe that works as a canon.

1288
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,380
What's that?

1289
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,380
Trump Biff.

1290
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,380
Yeah.

1291
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,380
Oh, Trump Biff.

1292
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:12,340
So I'm going to the Plaza Hotel, the one in Vegas by Fremont, which is Biff's Casino.

1293
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,780
That is the top of the.

1294
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,940
Because they just redid a lot of that, including putting feed in the ground floor of pink box

1295
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
donuts.

1296
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,660
So casino with a donut shop, fancy donut shop.

1297
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:29,140
Are these all the same people that are making like the dirty sounding place like pink taco,

1298
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,420
like are these all the same like.

1299
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
I don't know.

1300
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,460
Plush Pile Pastries.

1301
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,740
Well, I'm starting that one.

1302
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:43,060
That's a whole thing that I'm doing with what's the guy, the guy who played Wayne on the Wonder

1303
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,780
Years.

1304
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
What's his name?

1305
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
What?

1306
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,780
Harvey, Jason Hervey.

1307
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,780
Why him?

1308
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,780
Why?

1309
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,060
Because he has a lot of business ventures with Eric Bischoff, professional wrestling.

1310
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,060
Oh, the godman.

1311
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,060
Yeah.

1312
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,060
This is over my.

1313
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,060
I did not know.

1314
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,060
Jason Hervey who played.

1315
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,060
Jason Hervey is the guy's name.

1316
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,780
He had a lot of failed business ventures with former wrestling promoter Eric Bischoff.

1317
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,420
Is this a new guy?

1318
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,420
Is he a guy?

1319
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,420
Let's put him in the pile.

1320
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,420
He's a guy.

1321
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,420
We'll talk about that.

1322
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,860
Mine's another episode of failed.

1323
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,860
Put him in the plush pile.

1324
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,380
He's in the plush pile.

1325
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,380
Eric Bischoff plush.

1326
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,380
Yeah.

1327
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,620
Well, does that does that do it?

1328
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,060
Does that cover enough?

1329
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,060
I think.

1330
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,260
Let me acknowledge the question situation.

1331
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,660
You're stuck in a room for 24 hours and you have to choose between Randy Gerber and Chucko

1332
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,780
the Clown joining you in the room.

1333
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,140
Which do you choose and why?

1334
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,660
It's from Jamie Trash Fitz.

1335
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,340
I think in 24 hours I could avoid hearing the story.

1336
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,980
I think Randy wouldn't want anything to do with me and would just stay on his phone.

1337
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,980
Probably.

1338
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,960
You know, because I'm not like from Hamptons land.

1339
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,940
So he would just like, I would just look like a bug to him.

1340
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,940
Right.

1341
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,540
And then speak for the 24 hours, which sounds better than being with like a piss drinking

1342
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,540
clown.

1343
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,300
What was that thing called?

1344
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,300
What is he?

1345
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,300
Yeah, the juice.

1346
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,300
Bib juice.

1347
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,300
Bib juice.

1348
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,300
I like the point of their both name Randy.

1349
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,420
Randy Runyon, of course.

1350
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,900
I would probably, I would be too intimidated by Gerber.

1351
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,620
So I think I would go with Chucko.

1352
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
Yeah.

1353
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,820
You could ask, but you could bond with him over his favorite band, U2.

1354
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,820
That's true.

1355
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,700
That's your favorite.

1356
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,700
God, Randy.

1357
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,700
Hey, Randy, you like the Joshua Tree?

1358
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Wow.

1359
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,700
Wow.

1360
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:36,580
Do you think like, just spit balling, do you think the Edge's guitar sounds are cool?

1361
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,780
Boy, Randy, you are a fascinating man.

1362
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,740
I can see why so many people talk about you so often.

1363
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,740
That's right.

1364
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,460
And then you tell me the briefcase story.

1365
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,900
Cause I want to hear it.

1366
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
Just stretch it out.

1367
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,500
If you can make the story take 24 hours, take it as many as, embellish as many details as

1368
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
you can.

1369
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Yeah.

1370
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Jason?

1371
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,500
I think Chucko.

1372
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Yeah.

1373
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Why?

1374
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:06,500
I feel like he, I feel like Randy Gerber would be that kind of Hamptons level square.

1375
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,660
Like I feel like Chucko would be a little more garious, not in the clown persona.

1376
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,660
Don't get me wrong.

1377
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,020
Oh, you think he's going to be out of character?

1378
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,220
Yeah, that question implies the character.

1379
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,220
Oh, you, um.

1380
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,220
I think.

1381
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,700
To maybe entertaining you with the, like the horn and the rubber chicken.

1382
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,380
Well, he's making, yeah, if he's doing that and making balloon animals.

1383
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,060
I don't know how big the room is, but if the, if the room is small.

1384
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,060
Four foot by four foot.

1385
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,060
Oh boy.

1386
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,060
Oh, then definitely it's right.

1387
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,500
Cause Chucko just pure volume wise, that hair is going to be bigger.

1388
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,500
He's going to have props.

1389
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,340
That just takes up more of the space.

1390
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,940
Randy probably smells pretty good too.

1391
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,780
Cool, smells good.

1392
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,140
Interesting music tastes.

1393
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,140
Yeah.

1394
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
Randy's got it all.

1395
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,300
Chucko is really working hard, so he's probably a little sweaty.

1396
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,500
I'm just being, this is just reality.

1397
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Come on, laugh.

1398
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Why you laughing?

1399
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Yeah.

1400
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,140
That 50s grease paint probably stinks.

1401
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,140
Oh, gotta stink.

1402
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,140
Yeah.

1403
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,140
That's invading your pores.

1404
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,140
Something's here.

1405
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,140
That's just, that's pure tar.

1406
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,140
That's never coming off.

1407
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,140
Yeah, it's Randy, I guess.

1408
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,140
I guess it is.

1409
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,140
Yeah, even for me, we do all agree.

1410
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,140
Well, maybe not.

1411
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,140
Jason's.

1412
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,140
I guess it's Randy.

1413
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,140
Well, logic, I guess we landed at Randy.

1414
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,420
Well, I think that'll do it.

1415
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,900
I think you survived podcast, the ride.

1416
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Post office.

1417
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

1418
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,540

1421
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:30,140
Let us know what, wait, I answered it a few minutes ago.

1422
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,820
My space listeners.

1423
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,780
All we need you to do is go backwards to my space.

1424
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:40,100
That is where all future social media activity will be from podcast, the ride and don't know.

1425
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,060
Let's all reserve the name before the episode comes out because somebody might grab it and

1426
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,620
list which of your hosts is your favorite friend.

1427
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,620
Oh no.

1428
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,620
Oh, now I'm scared.

1429
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,820
I had Lee.

1430
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,220
I hope we at least I'll make it up.

1431
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,220
I hope at least Oh no.

1432
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,060
She's Shuko over me their all these years.

1433
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,060
It's one.

1434
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,740
This user just has a Choco's psycho.

1435
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,740
I don't want you to listen to the show anymore.

1436
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,900
Your door rate, you should be put behind bars.
