1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The following haunt cast may contain

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Scrim Talk,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A Hall of Ill Presidents,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hypothetical Robert Downey Jr. accents,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Pat Sajak,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The Actor?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yep, we're still doing this.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Haunted Mansion 7 on today's haunt cast,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Fright!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All right, everyone.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Cappy!

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Cappy, yes.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, you knew it.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Cappy Lewis!

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You definitely, you were ready to go on that.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Cappy Lewis!

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, okay, all right.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now Jason, be honest, were you ready to say Cappy?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because it seemed like nobody was on the same page as me just then.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I was ready to say my favorite track, Umbrella Man.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wow!

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You've just spun around your iPad with a photo of Umbrella Man.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You have been getting happy with Cappy all year.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It turns out you're the most listened to artist now.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, recently-

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, Cappy Lewis!

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right, and recently played on my Apple Music is, well, where is he?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's on there somewhere.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Cappy, I was listening to him on the way over.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wow.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes!

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, in the most recent, okay, okay.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Look, I took that delay as, which was an in-person delay.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We're not doing this over Zoom.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No, yeah.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I took it as a sign that we did not remember the assignment from last year, but I'm ready

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to pounce on that stuff.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know, I understand.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm worried, but I guess I shouldn't be, because last year you guys fulfilled the assignment

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then some, the yearly assignment that we leave here on these Haunted Mansion episodes,

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'm thrilled with that.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe we should listen to one of these really briefly, but for now, let me officially say,

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
welcome to Hauntcast the Fright with three grim grinning hosts who in high school rarely

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
came out to socialize.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm the garewolf over there is-

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I forgot my name already and I can't pull it up.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Jason, then, great.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Go, Jackal Scarridan.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jackal Scarridan.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll find it later.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Uh-huh.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mike Capison.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Capison, yeah.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I guess it's going to have to be for now.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because he plays the trumpet.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, great.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, here we are.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Spiky Snarlgun.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Spiky Snarlgun.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, great.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It rolls off the tongue.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know how you could have gotten that.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Perfect.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, it's perfect.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a perfect name.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're just so excited to talk about this graveyard jamboree and all the many ghosts.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, yeah, and that's what we're here to do this year, and it's also, I mean, this

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is more for me than for you guys.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This year is kind of a year of picking up the pieces for me, and we're still grappling

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
with what happened last year.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Last year, we did the Haunted Mansion live on stage at Dynasty Typewriter, and at the

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
end of the show, I'm just going to get ahead of it.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There was an unfortunate incident that I take 100% responsibility for.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I acted as if it was possible to finish the Haunted Mansion entirely within 30 seconds.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I conveyed this via a video, and then I danced around like a fool.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I made an ass out of you and me in doing so, and the year has just, it's been a tough one,

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and it's brought me to this point where I have a lot of regrets about what happened,

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
about the toxic display in which I embarrassed myself.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I say myself, but I feel like it was a different me.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've done a lot of work, and I don't think that's the same me that you're getting today.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't want to go so far as to say that this was a Michael Richards-esque incident, because

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I didn't say anything as hateful as that, but the spirit was hateful.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think the spirit was in just as bad of a place.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jump in.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't pile on me, because I've been trying, or do.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you need to work through things about what I did, then feel free.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Obviously, at the live show, I sat on stage and just dryly went,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not funny, for a while, and then everyone was laughing more because I was doing that,

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and then my fury was sated by the many different types of candy they have backstage at Dynasty Typewriter.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We sat with some candy, and we talked it over, and we realized maybe that was not the venue.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Obviously, they were laughing because they associate me with comedy and with physical comedy,

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
even though they shouldn't, but they knew they were witnessing a grim display.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What I'm able to cop to now and admit to today more fully is that at the time,

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I was grappling with an addiction to speed.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Not the drug speed, I mean with speeding through topics,

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which is an energy I feel like I've brought to the show even in non-Halloween episodes.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's true, yeah.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That unfortunate spirit of trying to move things along

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and make sure that they aren't too dry or cumbersome or whatever, but that's not me now.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a new me. This is a changed me, as you guys know.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You've seen it probably less in the episodes and more, hopefully, in my personal life,

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and we've talked through these things.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, and I appreciate the work you've done.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you, thank you. Personal work, a lot of personal work.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I canceled myself, and now I'm back to hopefully un-cancel myself,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but that's up to the audience, ultimately,

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
because if I could paraphrase the film Ferris Bueller,

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
what I've realized is the haunted mansion moves pretty fast,

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're not going to be in here forever. We're not going to be in the graveyard forever.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We're not going to be in the ride forever, so what am I doing trying to rush through?

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We're going to look back on these times as the greatest times in our lives.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We're going to look back on a haunted mansion series that was mostly done in our 30s,

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but by next year, all of us will be 40.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's true.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Not just one of us, and it's also not the new me to call out the one of us who is 40 currently.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you, yeah. I appreciate that, too.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Jason, you should say thank you, too, so that nobody's sure which one it is.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, thank you.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you for doing that, for obscuring what the actual truth is.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think that should throw everybody off the trail.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wow.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But anyway, what I'm excited about is that this is going to be the first,

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
after a lot of haunted mansion episodes, this is going to be the first one with a reflective Scott,

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
a subdued Scott, a serene Scott.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Any of the adjectives that were applied to Trump by New York Times editorials after the shooting,

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you could apply all of those to me.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am changed Scott, and as such, here's what I want to do.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We are taking our time. There is no rush.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And in fact, any role that I've ever taken on of being the person setting the pace in these episodes,

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
my hands are off the steering wheel.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is entirely on you two guys at this point.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I do want to make sure this is not an act and there's not a minotaur about to burst into this room.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's changed Scott, yes.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Old Scott consorted with nefarious minotaur types.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But that was last Halloween and then again in January or so.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But that's a long time ago.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As with Donald Trump, who was a completely changed man within two days, which stuck.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
As you're hearing this, we're so much deeper into an election site.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We spent so many weeks cozying up to the changed, subdued, non-polarizing Trump.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And it's the same thing.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if the minotaur had happened two days ago, that's a different man.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So relax everybody. That's what this is going to be about, is relaxing.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's up to you. We don't need to leave the graveyard.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My hands are nowhere near the steering wheel.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm in the second back seat.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I couldn't reach it even if I had a gripping pole.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's let Jason steer the ship today, I think.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's my preference.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I feel like you've always been a little bit of a moderate in this effort.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You've found common ground with both of us.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jason has been the primary one saying, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And actually, I think if anything, today I'm going to be the one saying, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Asking for more details, making sure that we really enjoy this time together.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because we're not going to have it forever.

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wow. That's very profound.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm taking a lot of work to get there.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know what? You know what I'll say is this is perfect because I want to talk about a couple things that aren't where we left off.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They are back. They're going back.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because I just went on the Haunted Mansion.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It is Haunted Mansion Holiday, of course.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We don't even have a plan for how to do it or when to do it.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We don't know how this factors into this yearly series.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Right. So Haunted Mansion Holiday just went on a couple days ago.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I want to praise the original mansion.

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We're not haters of Haunted Mansion Holiday.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We're like a general Disney fan who wishes it was just a little shorter of a window for Haunted Mansion Holiday.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Even this time around, it's been that since July.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Something like that.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Strange. I love the Halloween season I want to spread, but it feels weird, does it not?

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes. And this occurred to me as I was going through Pirates, funny enough.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That section where they took away the mist and the hologram.

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was going through there and that is maybe my new favorite part of Pirates is that dark tunnel.

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because it's mood. It's like serene but scary.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And as soon as I started Haunted Mansion Holiday and it's like,

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that Jack was here and then blah, blah, blah.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was like, the mood is gone.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The complete first part of the Haunted Mansion with the mood and the still and the somewhat,

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
there's the ghost hosts but there's silence.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And you really kind of melt into the scariness of it.

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's gone.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I really appreciated the regular Haunted Mansion for it setting a mood,

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
which is missing in our modern film, our modern TV, a lot of rides.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They want to pummel you with things, dialogue.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is what change Scott has been saying. Everything is so fast paced.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are we doing it? What are we gunning for the destination and not enjoying the journey?

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Exactly.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's funny you say this because it's a thing I've been thinking about lately,

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
going through the big book, going through the Jason Searle coffee table book

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and seeing clips of Haunted Mansion Holiday.

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
As we must do, old Scott would have said,

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
why are we slavish to reading this one book and repeating what we see in it

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
page by page every year?

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why do we just copy the work of Jason Searle and put it in a different form?

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But change Scott would never say that.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's not fair. We also look at do muggies a lot.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And Wikipedia. No insult to Wikipedia.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And Wikipedia. I haven't gotten to the Fox Nolte book, but once again I've been told it's very good.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The Haunted Mansion, stuff that came after the movie,

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the Haunted Mansion, the popular consciousness and derivatives of the movie.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The movie is a lot more grotesque, I feel like.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Which movie are you talking about?

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Nightmare Before Christmas.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, not a Haunted Mansion movie. I see.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The actual stop motion one is a lot more eerie.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, for sure.

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I feel like then the kind of whimsy of the, you know, Haunted Mansion holiday.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's whimsy, but it's a little bit more messed up.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's a little bit more off kilter. Yes, that's true.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's almost like they took the energy of the delivering presence sequence and made it entirely that.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's not the, yes, the more foreboding. Yeah, that's a little of a slower movie, actually.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's not a lot of the insane doctor scientist character in the ride.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In fact, I don't think there's any of him in the ride.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I also wish when they built it, I don't know if this is a Bob Gurr thing,

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
they should have built it so that the ride could only go a certain speed.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Because they moved that thing so fast, and they still were doing that up until a couple years ago at regular mansion.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That thing is motoring through the Haunted Mansion.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Those doom buggies should be going slow, slow, slow.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And they should have prevented it from happening in the early days, is what I'm saying.

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It should barely be a ride. What is the slowest it could possibly move and still technically be a ride?

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes, so I was like, ah, this is going too fast, and the movie is gone.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There should be individual people pushing each doom buggy, because how fast could a person make those moves?

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's the speed. It's a very belabored, back-breaking pace for one person to push.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, so that, yes, I appreciated the original mansion in a different way when I was on it.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I also want to say this. Last year, I was hoping that we could do a whole section on the new Haunted Mansion queue and gift shop.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's right.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I kept saying this in the live show.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We did.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
People were excited about it.

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
People were excited about it.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Scream Beatles-esque shriek every time the notion of discussing the new queue, the new landscaping gift shop.

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They had recently shown art, I think last year, I mean, of this.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And it was like, oh, they're really doing the graveyard up outside, and they're going to be a little gift shop.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And of course, foolishly, I'm a foolish mortal.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I thought, oh, this will be built in a year. This is just a change in the line around, and they're building a little shop for the merchandise.

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, wrong. They just went vertical on the gift shop.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There's literally steel beams I saw three days ago.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Finally, it's just like four beams and like a roof outline.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I went, this is just starting now?

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So, I mean, it's almost like believing hypothetically that if the Disney company comes out on a stage and tells you that everything that a lot of plans they've announced are all going to be wrapped up in five years.

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's almost like believing that completely with no hedging of bets.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's true.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, that's why they want you to do dreams and wishes and magic.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So, like, get them into the fantasy because the reality is going to be construction walls for a decade.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They should say, yeah, wishes, imagination, and then believe us.

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They should say, like, believe us. They should slip it in and there's like little presentations.

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They might say it subtly if you listen, if you crank up that sound. We're hearing it subliminally.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Believe us.

255
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I know. Well, that also is what, you know, because it changed me who wants to take his time with this.

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I was looking forward to that cue so much.

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And it's why I have to institute the policy of just taking our time in the graveyard because I want to be talking about each bush.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You understand?

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You know how much I want to change me wants to be here talking about the height and width and depth of every bush and what kind of what kind of bush they are.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then the full history of how long has that bush been grown in America?

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If at all. Maybe we discover they're foreign bushes.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, I think.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Brought here for the first time.

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Right. We could have done a little, like, we could have, like, taken a little piece off each bush and then taken into a forensics lab and figured out exactly which bush, where each bush is from.

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, kind of an ancestry.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, for plant life.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Jason knows a bush.

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You know a bush guy probably that could do that?

272
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, I could probably get in touch with a bush guy.

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay, because they could.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, they could date the leaf, the leaf that you give them.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, I'm sure they could figure out a lot of things about the leaf and then we could do a whole leaf episode.

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But not, we can't now.

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We can't because it's not built.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I'm sure they're still moving headstones.

280
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, yeah.

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So there's a virtual queue going on at the Haunted Mansion right now in the year 22.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If you're listening to this in the far future, it's 2024.

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's a virtual queue for Haunted Mansion holiday.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And it's just a mess.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Really?

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's the only way you can do Haunted Mansion right now.

290
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, God.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You have to get in either at the 7 a.m. or in the noon slot, you have to get a reservation.

292
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's the only time.

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So everything's more complicated, more expensive, and the whole resort is the construction site.

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And there's only a little bit on the lawn you can walk through.

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then the line goes fastish, but it extends out all the way almost into like Pirates,

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the virtual queue line.

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So it's a big mess.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So it's still, yeah, you pay a lot of money.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's tough to get reservations and impossible to get annual passes to get into the Disneyland

302
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that still has the issue of the Pirates crowds and the Haunted Mansion crowds just like bash

303
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and bash.

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

305
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like a giant West Side Story gang fight.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And yes, the logic of not completing the queue for the Halloween season to me, I don't know.

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How much money did they save for not finishing?

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And it's like they weren't thinking about us.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Well, they certainly weren't thinking about us.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And they never do.

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And that's what we complain all the time.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They never think about us.

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We weren't at D23 front row cheering daddy on.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, they also knew that we would have been there, that they would have said, all right,

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
new Stark flight test attraction.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Boo!

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's up with the queue?

321
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What's up with the new garden?

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What kind of bushes are you using?

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Josh, what kind of bushes are you using?

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There should be a world.

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you didn't see D23, they did this presentation with the Stark flight where it was Bob Iger

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and then they revealed it was Robert Downey Jr. next to him.

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In that world, there should be a third reveal that Jason is next to the two of them in the

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Stark flight lab vehicle.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I got a notepad in my reporter fedora with the press thing in it.

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And I'm like, are you here as Tony Stark or is Victor Von Doom?

331
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The people want to know.

332
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, then it would have been a video in this instance, not a photo.

333
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You would have said that in real life.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I mean, I could have held up what I was asking him.

336
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Is he going to have trouble keeping the parts straight in his head?

337
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If Disneyland is asking him to return to Tony Stark, a role he's probably long forgotten

338
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
how to play because he is so in Von Doom mode.

339
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And he's been, you know, that amount of money that he's making, that means you are getting

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
a what, an 80 million dollar performance.

341
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You said 80 million last time.

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I under guessed before.

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I think it's at least a high rate, at least a hundred.

344
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Great.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And so he's putting he's he's putting a hundred million dollars worth of effort into his Von

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Doom.

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And then and then Disney's asking him to go the other way and also be this character that's

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that's dead to him.

350
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's ash to him.

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
How is he going to do that?

352
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We can only ask so much of this one man.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think maybe they should, you know, see all the different variants of Tony Stark and

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
maybe one of them's like a whimsical 18th century, you know, scientists who can talk

355
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
to the animals.

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, smart.

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now, this is another one of those where it passed me.

359
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You might have tried to move past Doolittle very quickly, but I feel like my new spirit

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
should be, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, guys.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Tell me something else about Doolittle.

362
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know.

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's let's let's milk this tangent a little bit.

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's talk Doolittle.

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I think you know everything there is to know about Doolittle.

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You know, but it's OK, because let me see.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He can talk to the animals, squawk to the animals.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah.

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's OK to be scared.

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, that's right.

372
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's OK to be scared.

373
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then there's the like French horn in the butt at the end.

374
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, yeah.

375
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's but that's really what you need to know.

376
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
To fart.

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Spoiler alert.

378
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah.

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So that's the finish.

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's the finish of the movie.

381
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So there isn't much more to say about that.

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But I'm hoping for an accent for Vig for Von Doom.

383
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's what I'm hoping for.

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, yes.

385
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I am really hoping for an accent from Robert.

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Make him Welsh or something.

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It is.

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, now that we're OK, tangents are all right.

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I am hoping I'm hoping that there's no like connection to Tony Stark.

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He just like kind of looks like the guy, which to me is a funny decision.

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Because everyone's going to be like, well, what you look like.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And they're like, no, no, I'm not him.

395
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And then that's it.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't imagine that's what they're going to do.

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We'll see.

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But to me, that's a funny narrative choice of like everybody's going, oh, my God, you're

399
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the guy.

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And he's like, I'm not.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I am a different guy.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And then you're like, OK, and then we'll fight him.

403
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And you're from Transylvania is the idea.

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He should do like a Darth Vader thing where his underlings go like, you know, you look

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
like and he just vaporizes them.

406
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Maybe.

407
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And it's a little gag.

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's a funny little bit.

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I what I think I what I think will happen.

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And this is I'll make a big prediction now, because what is this?

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Twenty twenty six is the first one or twenty twenty five?

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can't remember.

414
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

415
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Twenty twenty six.

416
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But we will still be weak when it comes out.

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We might potentially still be in the graveyard.

418
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So I want to make a prediction that Victor because they said he will be Victor Von Doom.

419
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
My prediction is that it's a variant Tony Stark that was kidnapped by like my

420
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
mama Von Doom when he was little and then raised as Victor.

421
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But he actually he was Tony Stark and he has good inside of him.

422
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And at the very end of like Secret Wars, he flips and does something heroic and either

424
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
he dies or he lives.

425
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And Iron Man 4 happens a year later.

426
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I mean, I think whatever the solution is that gets the most movies in him back together.

427
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So I think he will be related to Tony Stark, but we'll see.

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's my guess.

430
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Can change Scott say no, no, no.

431
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Slow down really quick.

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And just can I just ask for you guys to just name five Marvel comic artists off the top

433
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
of your head?

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Just say five names really.

435
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And don't you say anything.

436
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Sure.

437
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Back and forth.

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
However you want to do it.

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Again, your hands are on the wheel.

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Say five names and don't add any jokes or do anything funny.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, in the history of Joe Manarera, Andy and Adam Kubert.

442
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

443
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, that's two.

444
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So we're moving a little faster.

445
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Slow down.

446
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Herb shrimp.

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
OK, good.

448
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Wow.

449
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Mike.

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's not herb shrimp.

451
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You're not.

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're not just thinking about herb shrimp.

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No, I'm not.

454
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So something you can get at a restaurant.

455
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
No.

456
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll say Mike Waringo.

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Rest in peace.

458
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Rest in peace.

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Great.

460
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wow.

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Mike Waringo.

462
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Peace and love.

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Peace and love.

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He would sign Ringo as his signature.

465
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, wow.

466
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, yeah, he would.

467
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

468
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Jason, you want to?

469
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, OK.

470
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wasn't that five?

471
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

472
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, that was five.

473
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sorry, sorry.

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

475
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,560
But again, at any point in the episode, if you want to just say the name of an artist,

476
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
feel free.

477
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Great.

478
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Thank you.

479
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,560
And with that, Jason, you're steering.

480
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Yeah.

481
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm not even sure exactly where we start.

482
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,880
I think it's up to you to plan us in that mansion and take us on a ride.

483
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,040
Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find out in the live show, I did mention the Garret

484
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:21,160
Ticker Gravedigger lit with real lighting, UV lighting, all other ghosts lit with black

485
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,520
light to distinguish.

486
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,680
So I did cover that in the live show.

487
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Great.

488
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,680
And I made a note that, hey, look, I was surprised.

489
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,840
What we didn't cover is the giant scrim with the ghosts flying up in the sky.

490
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Yes, very good.

491
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Yeah.

492
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Very good thing to catch.

493
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
Yeah.

494
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,200
It is an old, like, magician technique known as the magic lantern.

495
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,360
So yeah, when you're leaving the attic and your doom buggy is tipping over and you look

496
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,840
over and there's ghosts flying out of the graveyard, that's what Jason's talking about.

497
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Yes.

498
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,520
And it is a very cool effect.

499
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,720
Every trick, when you look into it, it's just like, ah, it's some old magician thing.

500
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Yes.

501
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,520
It's some old 100-year-old trick.

502
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,320
It doesn't like, other than like maybe those new, like, the beast effect in Japan and other

503
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,960
things, which maybe those are still old magician tricks and we just don't know how they work.

504
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
They might be based in some way.

505
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Most things, you go, ah, it's Pepper's ghost.

506
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Most things are like, oh yeah, Houdini did that 100 years ago.

507
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Yeah.

508
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Houdini made it up.

509
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Yeah.

510
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,360
Pepper really, we owe everything to Pepper, ultimately.

511
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Sure.

512
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,480
When I hear Pepper, I think of Robert Downey Jr., because you go, Pepper?

513
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
That'll be...

514
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
That was the character.

515
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,800
I thought you were saying that once he's finally free of the $100 million burden, that then

516
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,600
he'll make a movie where he's Pepper.

517
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Oh, that's good too.

518
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
You get to find out how he made the ghost.

519
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,280
So yes, because he'll say then, because he says Pepper Potts is the name of Gwyneth Paltrow's

520
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,320
character in the Iron Man movies, and he says Pepper a lot.

521
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,400
So it'll be a similar thing to like Michael Douglas in Ant-Man saying Scott, with Behind

522
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
the Candelabra.

523
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh yeah, right.

524
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Where he calls...

525
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
R.I.P. Scott Thorson.

526
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
R.I.P. Scott Thorson.

527
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Thanks for the memories.

529
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Thanks for the movie.

530
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Yes.

531
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,360
So hopefully he will make a Pepper's ghost, or he'll be Houdini in total.

532
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:16,080
Well, what needs to happen is he plays Pepper, and at the end, he posts credits, he meets

533
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,960
Hugh Jackman prestige, and he meets Ed Norton illusionist.

534
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Oh wow.

535
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,080
And he's back in his shared universe again.

536
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Of old moustache.

537
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Ed Norton.

538
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Of old magicians.

539
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Of old magicians.

540
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,360
Yeah, magicians or just guys who have a lot of mirrors.

541
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:40,640
And then they can recruit the name here, Etienne Gaspard Robertson, who kind of was famous

542
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:50,120
for his magic lantern illusions, a trickery made famous by a Belgian magician, Etienne

543
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,760
Gaspard Robertson, in shows in which he would project ghosts onto gauze, which was thin

544
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,800
enough to see through and masked by smoke.

545
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,160
That's from doing buggies.

546
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,840
So that's another old magician.

547
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,520
I think part of the appeal, part of what makes the Houdini Mansion special is you just layer

548
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:17,000
trick on top of trick on top of trick, and it adds to the unease and the spookiness.

549
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Let's slow down.

551
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,400
I don't mean to put you on the spot, but can you just find a list of 10 French names and

552
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
say them all please?

553
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Any French names?

554
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Wait, hold on.

555
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
He's Belgian.

556
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Oh, sorry.

557
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Belgian.

558
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Belgian names.

559
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Thank you.

560
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
I do not know where to start.

561
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,880
I do know that name is pronounced Etienne, I think.

562
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Okay.

563
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know off the top of my head.

564
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,400
Next year maybe we'll start with the list of 10 Belgian names.

565
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Any name.

566
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Any Belgian.

567
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,280
They could just be regular people living in Belgium today, you could make them up, wherever

568
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,380
you want to get your Belgians is fair game.

569
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,040
This will be a real test because usually we say the assignment at the end of the last episode,

570
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,040
you listen to the last episode before you start and you go, oh, that's right.

571
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,720
So now this one we'll have to remember, it comes at like a half hour into the episode,

572
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
not at the end.

573
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Well, and mainly Jason.

574
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Jason, we're getting off easier.

575
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,400
Jason has to say 10 Belgian names.

576
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah.

577
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Okay.

578
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,480
As long as it's clear, I was just happy that the Cappy thing was simple because I didn't

579
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,640
finish last year's episode until about eight o'clock class and I was listening and I was

580
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
like, I hope I don't have to scramble to acquire something.

581
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Oh yes.

582
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,600
Oh no, I forgot.

583
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,040
I was sent on a mission.

584
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,000
I have to find, there's a map.

585
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,320
Time is the perfect target open until.

586
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Can I?

587
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Wait, wait.

588
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
They sent me into the sea.

589
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,640
I have to go, I have to take an old map and then it like connects to a part of a broken

590
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,320
watch and I have to put them together and then fuse them somehow and then magic's going

591
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
to shoot out of that.

592
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,280
And I have to have that at the top of this fucking podcast.

593
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,840
Honey, do we have any Pacific ocean water sitting around?

594
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,840
It's the only way to activate the magic watch.

595
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,880
Cappy also is the name of Mario's cap in Mario Odyssey.

596
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,480
So that is like, we have to get a sentient cap with eyes and wear it.

597
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Oh yeah.

598
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Listen, before the next episode, get a cap and bring it to life.

599
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Bring it to life, yeah.

600
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
So.

601
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,080
Then we're all like, what do we, oh god, the only solution I could think, because I don't

602
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,280
know any magic, the only solution I can think of is to masturbate into this hat.

603
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
That's how you bring it to life.

604
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,440
That's the only way to bring it to life is to give it living beings to like bless it

605
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,120
with living organisms.

606
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,400
And the only ones we can produce are sperm.

607
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
We've made life happen.

608
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,120
That's ultimately sort of that way.

609
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,160
Yeah, sure.

610
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,280
Can I say something serious about the scrim?

611
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah.

612
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah.

613
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,400
As a kid, especially, I think when you look over to the graveyard, the scrim like takes

614
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,560
away even you wanting to look at the ceiling to notice how big, like I feel like it's a

615
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,360
good trick to move your eye to prevent you from like going, oh, we're still in a room.

616
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,320
It really makes you, helps make you feel like you're in like outside, basically in outside.

617
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,880
You're in outside.

618
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,480
And it's still like, you're like, oh, look at that.

619
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,320
It's still like such a good trick and it still looks good.

620
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,040
And the scrim itself is like hazy, like you can tell it's a scrim, but also it makes it

621
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,800
look like it's foggy out there.

622
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Yeah.

623
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Yeah.

624
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Like you can tell, oh, there's something going on there, but it kind of just looks like it's

625
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
fog or haze.

626
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,280
It might be like the entirety of the atmosphere throughout the ride, but especially this part

627
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,440
of the ride is the use of scrims.

628
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Yeah.

629
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,240
Scrims are the secret weapon of the Haunted Mansion.

630
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Now, there is a story, and I don't remember if it's this part of the scrim, but I saw,

631
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
it might be closer to singing bus, but according to the book More Mouse Tales, there was a

632
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,080
grad night one year where some teens trampled the graveyard, got out of, somehow removed

633
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,320
the safety bar, got out and destroyed the scrim among other things.

634
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,720
This happened, this must have been by the, when that book was published, that must have

635
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,280
been early 90s.

636
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,080
And I'm thankful I didn't know about that before.

637
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,760
It might have made me not want to talk about the Haunted Mansion at all.

638
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
How upsetting.

639
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Too painful of a memory.

640
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Yeah.

641
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Too upsetting.

642
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Yes.

643
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,280
Teens, if they knew the history of Etienne and all of that, they wouldn't have dared

644
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
touch those screens.

645
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,440
This is why we need more magic education in schools.

646
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,840
That's, yeah, that's true.

647
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,560
We do need a whole hour of magic.

648
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,120
I'd like that as a parent.

649
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,080
If you guys had high school and then had magic class.

650
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Magic 101.

651
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Yeah.

652
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
That's true.

653
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,200
That's funny, because that's what people thought the toadins would do for Mr. Toad.

654
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,280
They thought, oh, people are going to steal the Mr. Toad cars or destroy the ride.

655
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,200
Not realizing that if you're a Disney fan, if you're enough of a Disney fan to be posting

656
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,440
a word about it online, that means you are so scared of ruining anything.

657
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Right.

658
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,000
You would never, you would never go near any of these precious items made by the coats

659
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,720
and the henches of the world.

660
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,800
There are a lot of people online currently upset about the Rivers of America closure

661
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,520
and they post every day about what's going away.

662
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Yeah.

663
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Now, I am scared of some of them.

664
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
That's a new, that's a different-

665
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Not all some.

666
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,920
Some are a new breed.

667
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,320
Well, if you say, I like the water and I like the boat and I don't want them to go away,

668
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
of course.

669
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
We agree with that.

670
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Yeah.

671
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,040
When you say, Disney is destroying our heritage or Disney hates America.

672
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,840
Disney hates America is my favorite one.

673
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,520
Then perhaps we're on a different side, we're on a different viewpoint.

674
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
Something deeper is going on.

675
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,480
I like the water and then also what, this is, again, I'm glad you gave me permission

676
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
to talk-

677
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Good.

678
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
No, no, no.

679
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Wait, wait, wait.

680
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,000
Ultimately, and I see this in a lot of spheres, fan spheres, people upset for corporations

681
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
making various decisions, ultimately, a lot of these decisions are made because of capitalism

682
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,560
and how corporations are continuing to just try to maximize profits out of every square

683
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,680
inch of land or every IP.

684
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,000
They're trying to, well, there's no IP on Rivers of America, we should just shove cars

685
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
there.

686
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's water.

687
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,720
That's a runaway capitalism decision, that's not a hating America decision, but it's funny

688
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,240
because the people that are the most pro-America and are worried about the history of America,

689
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,800
they don't want to put those two and two together and realize that the capitalism is really

690
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,080
what is making Disney decide to replace their beloved river with cars.

691
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,760
That's what I would say, but no, it's like Disney hates Benjamin Franklin and all he

692
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
did for the country.

693
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,640
Disney doesn't give a shit about Benjamin Franklin, that's true, but you are not tying

694
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,120
these two decisions together, you're finding scapegoats and this happens everywhere, it

695
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,760
happens in Star Wars, it happens everywhere.

696
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,800
Well, I mean, it's tough to talk about hating America because in a few, in mere days, we

697
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,480
might elect two people who hate America, their names are Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, we need

698
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,880
to do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen.

699
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,400
The two biggest America haters might be steering the ship in days.

700
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
It's tense.

702
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
It's always tense doing these.

703
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
I know.

704
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Elections right around the corner.

705
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Of course.

706
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,840
But let's, Jason, feel, you don't have to steer us anywhere, but if you want.

707
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Oh.

708
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Hmm.

709
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,360
No, I wasn't prepared for that, were you?

710
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Well, no, I was just thinking, well, let's, we talked about scrims a little, I don't think,

711
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm sure I learned this fact at some point and forgot it, but there are more, I guess

712
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,240
there are technically scrims throughout the graveyard party, you know, dividing all the

713
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:02,760
ghosts, all the little scenes that are going on, I think to prevent light bleed and also

714
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,840
to help the illusion of making it look like the graveyard just goes on forever.

715
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes, there's like depth, like messes with your depth of field a little bit, your vision.

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,040
It does lead, and I've said this, I don't know if I've said this on a Haunted Mansion

718
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,360
episode, it does lead to like, kind of like squinting to try to make out some of these

719
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
ghosts.

720
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,880
And I think some of that is good, but then you see Hapox Ghost, which is a new animatronic,

721
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,600
and you go, could they replace all of these with this figure, this type of figure?

722
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,680
And would it ruin it?

723
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,480
Would all those ghosts being clear ruin it in some level?

724
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,560
Or could you have a couple close like that and then keep it as is for the rest of them

725
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
or the farther away ones?

726
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,800
I don't think it would bother anybody if there were some bright ghosts.

727
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,520
I don't think so, but maybe you want the bright ghosts up front, but then would that distract

728
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,400
from the less bright ghosts in the back?

729
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,120
You want a crisp loot player.

730
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
You like one.

731
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,920
Well, I just, you get a little spoiled by how crisp the Hapox Ghost is, because it's

732
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,320
such a new robot and it looks like a ghost, but you get so close to him.

733
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,800
And then you're led into a room full of non-crisp ghosts.

734
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,440
Yeah, uncrisp, non-crisp ghosts is what you're viewing for the rest of the time.

735
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,080
And it's fun because it gives you, they're ghostly, but you're like, I bet there's some

736
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,560
features on these faces that I would enjoy looking at.

737
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
They're whimsical characters.

738
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Or they're not.

739
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,840
Or the scrims hide that they never made any features.

740
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
That's true too.

741
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,760
The scrim could be hiding the lack of features.

742
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,800
A real question that is going to dictate how long we're in the graveyard is, how much do

743
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,360
we care or like any of these specific graveyard ghosts?

744
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,520
Or is it just about the atmosphere and that there are a bunch of them?

745
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,320
But are there are there individual ghosts as we assess the scene that are like, well,

746
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,440
that we have to really give some love to?

747
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
Well, there are flowers.

748
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,440
There's definitely ones that deserve that are doing fun stuff.

749
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,760
And there's also ones that you just discover because there's so many like the ghosts on

750
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,520
a bike and stuff like things that you go, oh, maybe I didn't notice that for the first

751
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
10 years of going.

752
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,120
So I don't know that I have a specific favorite one that deserves its own episode, but we

753
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,960
can definitely like list some other favorites, different effects, because really what it

754
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,280
is, is there more effects or what they're doing versus they're actually like, oh, that's

755
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,880
character suggests a fun guy like the middle pirate who's singing on Pirates of the Caribbean.

756
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,040
When you get to that barn, that guy is great.

757
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,720
That guy deserves maybe his own episode.

758
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't know. You're talking about it.

759
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
And he you've thought of it.

760
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,600
You just went on it and you thought middle pirate is its own thing.

761
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,400
Well, right. And because he's the one who, if you catch the right part of the song, stop

762
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,840
singing the yo ho, yo ho.

763
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,360
And he starts going like one pirate sings this funny little background like warble.

764
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,840
Yeah. And I'm like, that gives him his own little unique thing.

765
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,800
Yeah. So but I you don't get that from all these ghosts.

766
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,040
You can't tell who's singing what necessarily.

767
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,280
You can't tell who's like you can't tell what their faces look like.

768
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,920
That middle pirate's burned into my brain.

769
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,560
I know his face. I wake up thinking about him sometimes.

770
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
You do. I didn't know the relationship you have with the middle pirate.

771
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,080
Lindsay actually one who pointed him out.

772
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,120
She's like, oh, I like this guy because he's saying he does that little singing part.

773
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Now, anyone feel free to to say, hey, wait, wait for your turn.

774
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
We get back in the order.

775
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,720
But when you talk about that crazy musical improv, that is apparently a thing with the

776
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,600
opera singers who are towards the end of the graveyard scene that this via an interview

777
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
with Buddy Baker put the music together.

778
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,160
Now I don't have the name. The last name is Norman, but I didn't cover the first name.

779
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,800
But there is the female opera singer who they brought in had like perfectly trained on

780
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,280
the melody that she was given and could nail it in this very studious way.

781
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,960
And then during the recording, Buddy Baker said, you're this character is supposed to

782
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,880
be a nut. So just ad lib all over the place.

783
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,720
And then and but it was she was kind of resistant to it because she knew it one way, not

784
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,760
willing to depart and improvise.

785
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,200
But then she ultimately did do this very wild, much like that pirate, which is sort of what

786
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,480
people like about this sequence, that it's a bunch of crazy nonsense.

787
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,880
Yeah. The full name, Lou Lee, Jean Norman, Lou Lee.

788
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,840
Yeah. Soprano, Lou Lee, Jean Norman and tenor Bill Reeve.

789
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,560
OK. Now, is this good license to just talk for a while about our feelings about the series,

790
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
The Sopranos? Jason, what do you think?

791
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,240
Oh, it's been a while. I do think about restarting it recently.

792
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,320
Yeah, I would like to. I don't have any time.

793
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,400
But when I do, when I will have time, I would like to rewatch.

794
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,240
Sure. Great. I watched it.

795
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,640
These are some excellent sopranos.

796
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,840
I liked it. Great.

797
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,000
Polly Walnuts is a funny guy.

798
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Rest in peace.

799
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,160
He's in the Haunted Mansion.

800
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,920
He was a real mobster. Did you know?

801
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,000
Pio Mai is one of the hazy horses.

802
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Maybe you can see.

803
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,240
Wrestler Tommy Dreamer is his kids are in The Sopranos is that little kids.

804
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,640
Really? Yeah, they're in the car.

805
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,440
Lin-Manuel Miranda is in The Sopranos as a bellhop.

806
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
Yeah. Will Arnett in The Sopranos as well.

807
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,720
FBI agent. This is very good.

808
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,800
Have you seen The Sopranos?

809
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,920
Some. I haven't finished it.

810
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,760
I know I should. That's a bad thing to admit.

811
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,160
That's all right. I've liked it.

812
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,560
I've seen it. I'm not mad.

813
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,720
This is great. We got a list of names.

814
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,680
We got a list of names. This is wonderful.

815
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,160
I feel. Can I admit this?

816
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,640
I feel like we're being set up.

817
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,160
I feel like something's coming.

818
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,200
Oh, what do you mean?

819
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,840
The axe is going to drop. I know that about an hour ago.

820
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,000
The hammer is going to come down.

821
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Here, I'm trying to make you guys relax,

822
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,600
but at this point, it's a boy who cried,

823
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,640
well, you're just so. Too good to be true, I think.

824
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,440
Something's happening. I don't know how.

825
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,160
I don't know. I'm trying to think what could.

826
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,480
No, it's so good that it is true.

827
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,720
I've changed. I've changed, Scott, and I'm allowing it.

828
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,440
And let me throw one more in.

829
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,840
If you guys want to take any time in this episode

830
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
to talk about any complaints that you have

831
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
about the internal messaging system

832
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,480
of a health care app that you're using,

833
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
take as much time as you want.

834
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,080
10 minutes, 15 minutes.

835
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,800
I want to hear everything that's not functional about it.

836
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,840
What's good about it?

837
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,120
I have thoughts about that, but I'll save it for later.

838
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,720
Okay.

839
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,920
Look, the health care system is broken in this country.

840
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,720
I hate to go. I went off on capitalism

841
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,920
a couple of minutes ago.

842
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,520
Look at this. I cut Mike loose, and suddenly we're getting.

843
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,880
You're tearing down all the pillars of our society.

844
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,600
Doesn't make sense. I think you hate this country

845
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,200
as much as Tim Walz does.

846
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,200
I don't know about that. He hates the country a lot.

847
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
He really is very of it.

848
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,720
Now, you talk about he's the one running the long.

849
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm saying I'm making you guys nervous.

850
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm nervous about this guy pretending I'm a football guy.

851
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,040
Running the middle, I eat chili.

852
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,720
Fuck you. I'm on to you. I'm on to you, man.

853
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,480
Jason probably has some gripes with him

854
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
just about the different state fair meats he eats

855
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,000
and his feelings on that,

856
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,400
because he's such a folksy guy goes to those state fairs,

857
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,000
and he has certain types of meat.

858
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,720
And he has not come out with his stance on pork rolls.

859
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
There's meat he's been mentioning,

860
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,960
and I go, I've never heard of that before,

861
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,760
and maybe Jason knows.

862
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,640
Governor Walz, did you eat the deep-fried ranch

863
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,280
in the Minnesota state fair or not?

864
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,440
That would be, if we could get you, yeah,

865
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,560
maybe to question him before the election,

866
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,680
you could do a little sit down with him.

867
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,120
Yeah, on all meats interview.

868
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,440
I think that's an interview they wouldn't hide from.

869
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,080
Can I say, sometimes you look at pictures

870
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,720
of the graveyard scene,

871
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,000
and it doesn't look like it does

872
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,360
when you're on the ride live.

873
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,080
This is just a photo from mice chat,

874
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,720
and it's like, the effect is really cool.

875
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,360
It looks kind of almost neon in a way

876
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,680
that this doesn't look like the mansion

877
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,520
when you're on it.

878
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,360
I think it's hard to photograph.

879
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,880
This is a very difficult thing to photograph.

880
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,320
Is that even a, did somebody take that while writing it,

881
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,920
or is that a pose for a photo?

882
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,880
I don't know, but it's almost like

883
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,440
it gives it a different vibe.

884
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,360
I don't know that I necessarily need the vibe

885
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,840
to be more neon,

886
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,720
but you can definitely make out the faces easier.

887
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,560
Well, and then if you photograph with the lights on,

888
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,600
this photo of two of the goofy band members,

889
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,640
it's like, oh, they're all kind of baby blue and cream,

890
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,840
because that paint has to show up.

891
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,880
Can you show me that photo again?

892
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,320
I want to see what it's baby blue and cream.

893
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,440
I mean, sky blue, I guess.

894
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,960
That could be, yeah, no, I guess,

895
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,400
I see what you're saying.

896
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,280
Baby blue and cream is just a phrase

897
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,120
that seems like it'd be your album or something.

898
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,520
Yeah, yeah, it's a bit of a trick Princeton released.

899
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,320
Jason Sheridan, baby blue and cream.

900
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,280
Yeah, I covered the Neil Young track,

901
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,960
baby blue and cream.

902
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,400
It's a Neil Young.

903
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,960
I was thinking more like a jazz thing,

904
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,800
but it's a Neil Young.

905
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,240
Kind of a cappy kind of song.

906
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,440
It's more of a cappy thing.

907
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,800
I guess it's more of a cappy thing.

908
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,680
This guy I really like, and maybe I missed his name,

909
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,360
Jason, help me out if you know it,

910
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,240
he's sort of sitting in the casket,

911
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,120
and he's got a little cup of tea,

912
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,720
and he's a little guy, and I don't know,

913
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,560
he just like, he's got kind of like a little grin

914
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,520
on his face, and I don't even really know.

915
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,600
He just almost looks like a rankin' and bass elf.

916
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,280
He looks like the heat miser or the snow miser or whatever.

917
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,040
And I really like him.

918
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,360
He's got a top hat on.

919
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,960
He looks like, shoot, the guy from Laughin'

920
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,440
who's in Wedding Crashers.

921
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,560
This is great, this is exactly what I want to be.

922
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,080
If last-minute cast members are being discussed,

923
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,800
Shane Scott is so happy.

924
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,640
And if Mike has taken a bunch of time

925
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,320
to not talk and look him up,

926
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,440
this is a, oh, old me would have been so frustrated.

927
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,760
Thank God he's dead.

928
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,320
Thank God he's gone.

929
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,720
What is this name?

930
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,520
In fact, let's all not say anything

931
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,760
until the name comes up.

932
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,720
He's so great, and I can't think of his name,

933
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,600
but he's a funny.

934
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,680
You can't think of the name of a great guy from Laughin'?

935
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,520
You can't think of the extended cast of Wedding Crashers.

936
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,880
You know what, for years and years,

937
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,720
I can never remember who did Piglet's Voice,

938
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
who was on the Bob Newhart Show.

939
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
John Fielder, and finally I remember it now.

940
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,760
I've remembered it so often now

941
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,960
that my daughter's watching so much poo.

942
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,280
But Henry Gilbert, Gibson,

943
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,960
Henry Gibson is my indicator.

944
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,800
No, Henry Gilbert's our friend.

945
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
Henry Gilbert's the guy who's been on our show.

946
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,520
We just talked at the Simpsons show.

947
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,200
But no, Henry Gibson is the guy I'm thinking of.

948
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
He looks like Henry Gibson to me,

949
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,920
which makes me happy.

950
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,200
Jane and I just ran into Trap.

951
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,680
We saw Trap and-

952
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,520
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

953
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,600
Via what service?

954
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,680
What streamer did you rent it from?

955
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,000
I had a credit on Amazon.

956
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,960
How much of a credit?

957
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm tired of you speeding through this, Jason.

958
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,800
Six dollars.

959
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,640
Good, wow, that's a big credit.

960
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,320
So I rented it on Prime.

961
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,960
We're watching the opening credits,

962
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,960
and the name comes up, Hayley Mills.

963
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,800
Oh yeah.

964
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,800
And she is an older FBI profiler in the movie.

965
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,280
This, by the way, we're gonna be,

966
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,920
this is gonna be, and this is more of an old Scott complaint,

967
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,840
this October series is gonna be so full of discussion

968
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,480
of the months old film Trap.

969
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,360
That is true.

970
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,200
Several episodes now.

971
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,040
But that's an old me thing, I'm sorry Jason.

972
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,160
I think it's probably out at theaters by this point,

973
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,800
so it's reasonable to rent it, you know?

974
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,640
Yeah.

975
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,460
Anyway.

976
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,300
It was reasonable to rent it.

977
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,480
We were like, is that parent Trap Hayley Mills?

978
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,040
And sure enough, it was.

979
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,880
That's her, yeah.

980
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,800
Yeah.

981
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,440
She's back, she was at D23, she was singing the songs,

982
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,920
the old Let's Get Together.

983
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,880
Let's Get Together?

984
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,720
Yeah.

985
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,920
So she's back, Hayley Mills is back.

986
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,760
Yeah.

987
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,760
This is the kind of thing old Scott would not have stopped

988
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,040
to smell the roses, we wouldn't have landed at points

989
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,320
like Hayley Mills is back.

990
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,760
I feel like you're gonna kill us by then or something.

991
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't understand, here I'm coming at you

992
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,040
with nothing but kindness.

993
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,000
You're gonna attack, like physically attack us

994
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,120
to end this episode.

995
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,360
You're acting as if I've wired the building,

996
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,040
and when I take a convenient bathroom break,

997
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,880
that that is when the building will implode.

998
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,720
There's like checkoffs.

999
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,640
And layers of bricks will crush you both.

1000
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,840
This is more stressful than a Lady Raven concert

1001
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,680
that turned out to entirely be a trap.

1002
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,000
This is like checkoffs.

1003
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,360
Yes, this is, I have not trapped you, this is no trap.

1004
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,680
I've tried to say this joke three times already.

1005
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,760
And people are gonna be hearing me,

1006
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm gonna do it again.

1007
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,920
It's like checkoffs niceness or something.

1008
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,200
It's like the niceness is like lingering

1009
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,560
and like when is it gonna,

1010
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,560
no checkoffs, it doesn't really make sense.

1011
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,160
It's not a really good joke.

1012
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,800
I shouldn't have said it, I'm gonna edit it out.

1013
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,920
No, this is like, this could be like Shakespeare,

1014
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,080
Shakespeare Bob, I was gonna say say Shakespeare Bob.

1015
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,280
This is the famous Simpsons character.

1016
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,520
Sideshow Bob, when he's nice in the one with,

1017
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,480
Sideshow Cecil.

1018
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,320
Yeah.

1019
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,480
And he actually is nice.

1020
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,680
There'll be a shoot, yeah.

1021
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,920
Well, we'll see.

1022
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,600
We'll see, Jason, just stay on your toes, Jason.

1023
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,240
For once, I'm not trying to kill you.

1024
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,240
Stay on your toes.

1025
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,760
Keep your eyes open, Jason.

1026
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,640
Get off your toes, kick up your feet.

1027
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,160
Don't even worry about what your little toesies are doing.

1028
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,680
All right, okay.

1029
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,080
And this is, how great does it feel?

1030
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,560
Because at this pace, I don't think there's,

1031
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,800
I'd be shocked if we got done with the graveyard today.

1032
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,600
It felt right, which, yeah.

1033
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,600
I don't think we've talked about like two things.

1034
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Which is what James Scott is all about.

1035
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,960
My little guy we talked about.

1036
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,800
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1037
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,320
Well, who else are we talking about?

1038
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,400
Jason, you got a character?

1039
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,320
Well, there's cats and owls in the graveyard.

1040
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,320
They make noise that kinda adds to the sonic symphony

1041
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,600
going around.

1042
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,440
So the meows and stuff in their hoots.

1043
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,880
The meows and the hoots, yeah.

1044
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,840
Now, are those ghost cats and ghost owls

1045
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,200
or are those living cats and living owls?

1046
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,720
That's a good question.

1047
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
I think they're living.

1048
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,760
I think they're living as well.

1049
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,600
Scott, what do you think?

1050
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,000
The pictures that I'm looking at,

1051
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,920
they seem to be lit with just like regular lighting.

1052
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,760
Right.

1053
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,160
I'm seeing photos of just graveyard cats.

1054
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,520
Yeah, I think we're dealing with just regular cats.

1055
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,960
Right, cause they have the pet cemetery in the queue,

1056
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,640
but I think those animals are alive.

1057
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,480
Yes.

1058
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,280
So, that's good.

1059
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,080
There's a lot of tea drinking happening in the graveyard.

1060
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,800
With a floating teapot.

1061
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,280
Yes, there's a lot of tea drinking.

1062
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,600
I think these characters are drinking more cocktails.

1063
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,720
There's characters at a little table here.

1064
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,040
These are more like circular,

1065
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,240
almost like a glass you would have the Carthay Manhattan in.

1066
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,480
You know what they kind of look like?

1067
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,080
They're gloatini's.

1068
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,880
They do look a lot like gloatini's.

1069
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,720
It's like a drink I would have at the Tron Electronica

1070
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,000
Festival, whatever it's called.

1071
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,680
Not a festival, but it should be a festival.

1072
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,520
It should be a touring festival.

1073
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,360
It should be early.

1074
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,760
It should replace Coachella.

1075
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,760
But yeah, these guys are all having spots of tea.

1076
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
This is like a bigger cup here.

1077
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,400
So, it's like people are having different types of parties

1078
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,240
in the graveyard.

1079
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,040
Everyone's not having a sort of unified party.

1080
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,320
Everyone's having their own little gatherings

1081
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,400
and it leads to this one sort of

1082
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
grim grinning ghost sequence.

1083
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,160
But all, appropriately you say that

1084
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,320
because it's all like the music track.

1085
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,800
It all kind of ties together.

1086
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,040
There's like the one bass track of grim grinning ghosts

1087
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,560
and there's all the weird instruments

1088
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,320
just as there are like.

1089
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,960
Yeah, there's the music.

1090
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,200
There's the instrumental and then there's the singing bus.

1091
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,280
Slow down, slow down.

1092
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,320
We're not at the bus.

1093
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,320
Old Scott might say the singing bus

1094
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,280
would be an interesting thing to talk about this year,

1095
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,120
but no pressure.

1096
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,080
We'll get there.

1097
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,920
We'll get there.

1098
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,740
We'll get there.

1099
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,580
Slow down.

1100
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,400
You ain't racing yet.

1101
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,240
You ain't racing yet.

1102
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,840
Yeah, I'm giving a slight suggestion.

1103
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,680
That's the kind of thing that you should.

1104
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,960
I'm not opposed to going there.

1105
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,040
It's up to Jason, really.

1106
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,880
It's Jason.

1107
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,720
Sure, yeah.

1108
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,920
Well, what would you like to talk about

1109
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,200
before we discuss the singing bus?

1110
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,480
Well, you ain't racing yet reminds me.

1111
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,280
I hope with the new cars coming next to Haunted Mansion,

1112
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,360
I hope you get a made or fart.

1113
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,400
I hope you can hear made or farting

1114
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,680
from the Haunted Mansion line.

1115
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,520
That's all I'll say.

1116
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,400
That'd be a nice thing to add to the atmosphere, absolutely.

1117
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,240
Yeah.

1118
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,880
Do you think that, look, that is on topic

1119
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,280
because the proposal right now

1120
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,960
is moving cars to Rivers of America,

1121
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,080
but that is right by a Haunted Mansion in Florida.

1122
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,840
Well, I mean, folks might say that we are keeping,

1123
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,120
listeners, in all this time,

1124
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,960
we have never discussed the Disney World Haunted Mansion.

1125
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,800
Right.

1126
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,620
It's not, it's related.

1127
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,460
It's related.

1128
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,040
There's an offhanded comment here and there.

1129
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,320
There's an offhanded comment here.

1130
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,120
We make offhanded comments once in a while.

1131
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,960
Once in a while.

1132
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,800
But it hasn't been a fully dedicated

1133
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,720
Disney World Haunted Mansion yet,

1134
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,800
and which has different things,

1135
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,920
the Escher Room and various different things,

1136
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,080
and I don't know.

1137
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,360
What are you turning into?

1138
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,200
I don't know.

1139
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,080
Look, we have a lot to talk about

1140
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,880
because they just threw the hat box ghost in there,

1141
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,720
sort of willy-nilly.

1142
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,680
Oh, that's happened now?

1143
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,440
Yeah, he's just hanging out in one of the early rooms.

1144
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,040
But yes, there's gonna be like cars racing

1145
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,840
in front of the Haunted Mansion,

1146
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,680
which I guess they'll try to.

1147
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
You always say this, but do we,

1148
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,720
we're all acting as if Disney doesn't.

1149
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,640
Sure, we don't know the,

1150
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,480
we don't know how they'll hide it.

1151
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,760
It's probably a tree line.

1152
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,160
We don't know how it'll hide,

1153
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,040
but it does feel like you'll hear.

1154
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,640
Because that's a point of view I've seen,

1155
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,560
is just like, you know, loud exhaust pumping cars

1156
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,640
ruining the Haunted Mansion.

1157
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,480
I hope it's not exhaust.

1158
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,640
You're a professional Disney blogger or whatever.

1159
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,160
You think they're not gonna do anything

1160
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,840
to make this a pleasant area transition.

1161
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,080
I would think so.

1162
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,440
And I don't think the cars pump exhaust either, but.

1163
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,200
Should we make, I mean, we could make bets,

1164
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,880
because we'd love to bet now.

1165
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,120
We could make bets.

1166
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,840
Will you be able to hear,

1167
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,600
I wanna say made or farting, but maybe we expand it.

1168
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,760
Will you be able to hear any of the cars

1169
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,120
from the queue of the Haunted Mansion in Florida?

1170
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,960
I don't think so.

1171
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,780
Should we bet?

1172
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,620
You think, no.

1173
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:06,200
I think they will try to soften it,

1174
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,080
but I think you'll hear people screaming,

1175
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,840
which actually might fit for a Haunted Mansion.

1176
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,680
Okay.

1177
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,160
Also, like though, you think about it,

1178
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,920
you said earlier they're not making the connection.

1179
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,760
That is capitalism.

1180
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Like a big, fast car next to a dilapidated old building

1181
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,480
is very American.

1182
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,800
You mean like it's actually more American

1183
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,120
if there's cars next to a Haunted Mansion?

1184
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,240
If there's big nasty cars zooming by

1185
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,240
the regal old mansion next to the Colonial Street.

1186
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,400
Actually, if they could use gasoline

1187
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,720
and they could make the whole thing stink.

1188
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,440
You want them to make it like Autopia from the 1950s.

1189
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Yeah, like a freeway built next to a historical landmark.

1190
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,600
I see what you're saying.

1191
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,720
So the one thing is like a protected landmark,

1192
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,040
but because the 10 feet over isn't,

1193
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,340
America will throw cars there.

1194
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,180
Yeah.

1195
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,000
Okay.

1196
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,760
Maybe like, maybe it's time to flip Liberty Square.

1197
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,280
Like maybe it's time to make it Little Vegas.

1198
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,120
Maybe it's time to put up some neon and stuff.

1199
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,240
Put some slot machines in it?

1200
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,520
Oh yeah.

1201
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,080
That's the one thing this world is missing.

1202
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,400
Some progressive slots.

1203
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,760
Here's what I, okay, I will bet $5

1204
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,040
that you will be able to hear some car noises

1205
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,520
from zooming around in the distance.

1206
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,560
I don't know if they'll be farts.

1207
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
I hope they are, but at least zooms.

1208
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,680
And then I believe within 25 years

1209
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,440
there will be a slot machine on the grounds of Disney World.

1210
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,280
So this one we gotta hold on to for 25 years.

1211
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,440
This is gonna be a long time, yeah.

1212
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,680
But I do believe. 25 years,

1213
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,480
which is when probably we will make it

1214
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
to the Disney World Haunted Mansion

1215
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,960
and how it's different.

1216
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,760
I'm gonna be a full Benjamin Button baby at that point.

1217
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,600
What?

1218
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,420
I age backwards.

1219
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,260
Is this the reveal that you, oh no.

1220
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,440
Yeah, I age backwards.

1221
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
God, we've all been trying to place our finger on

1222
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,600
like why is Jason somehow,

1223
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,720
he's the one who knows about like what songs

1224
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,140
from the last three years are,

1225
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,080
but also he's from the 1800s.

1226
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,600
That's why you've been Benjamin Butting the whole time.

1227
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,440
Benjamin Butting.

1228
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,360
I shortened it.

1229
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,840
Jason is Benjamin Butt, not Benjamin Button.

1230
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,440
That's just a little nickname

1231
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,280
he picked up along the way.

1232
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,560
That's why I want me here to fart.

1233
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,220
It feels homey to me.

1234
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,420
Benjamin, call him Benjamin Butt from now on, folks.

1235
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,060
That's what he'd like to be referred to

1236
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,340
now that he's revealed it here.

1237
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,980
This is now, what I'm, it's not like I,

1238
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,500
look, talking about ghosts,

1239
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,940
I haven't fully exercised old Scott.

1240
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,460
You know, he's in me somewhere.

1241
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,540
And I just have to tell you that he's,

1242
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,520
I am receiving these vibrations reminding me

1243
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,020
that talking about the singing bus might be fun this year.

1244
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,500
But again, I can, it's on me to suppress those.

1245
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,060
I can push those down.

1246
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,900
We do not have to listen to that guy.

1247
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,740
We do not have to listen to that guy.

1248
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,560
Shove those down, please.

1249
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,400
That asshole.

1250
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,220
Old Scott, I have to agree with you

1251
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,900
because there's a lot of good names to be said.

1252
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,740
Wow.

1253
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,860
Oh yeah, please, yeah, give us the good names.

1254
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,380
Okay, we're talking about the singing bus.

1255
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,580
I haven't talked about the ghost island.

1256
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,740
Oh yeah, please.

1257
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,820
I always forget this there,

1258
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,540
but the executioner and his victim.

1259
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,540
Oh yeah.

1260
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,820
That's a pretty good visual gag.

1261
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,660
Okay.

1262
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,540
So isn't that after the singing bus?

1263
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,420
We really, I throw it to you guys

1264
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,980
and the whole, the order situation.

1265
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,900
I thought it was you who were adherent

1266
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,660
to the moving through it in order scenario.

1267
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,500
And now it's all willy nilly now that you're in charge.

1268
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,340
It's a cocktail party.

1269
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,180
Well, that's what happens.

1270
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,740
Remember, you're looking around.

1271
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,660
Like, this might be the most,

1272
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,600
is this the busiest in a good way,

1273
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,460
I guess, some of the big pirate scenes.

1274
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,300
I guess so, yeah.

1275
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,060
That you're very much looking around.

1276
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,260
Well, there's all the presidents.

1277
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,220
I guess they're all blinking and coughing and shit.

1278
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,340
This is, yeah.

1279
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,540
They are coughing.

1280
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,380
They're all ill.

1281
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,220
I wish the olive fries,

1282
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,300
I wish they all coughed in a manner appropriate

1283
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,060
to the ailments of their time.

1284
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,340
Now that would plus up that, right?

1285
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,940
If you could watch them all die

1286
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,940
the way that they actually died,

1287
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,740
it'd be dark for some of them, but.

1288
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,420
The one getting the cherries,

1289
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,300
eating the too many cherries

1290
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,220
and getting beef bullion shoved up his butt.

1291
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,060
Who died of cherries?

1292
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,980
One of them, one of them ate.

1293
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,460
The president died of cherries.

1294
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,940
Like he ate too many cherries

1295
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,780
or he was prescribed them.

1296
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,740
The president ate too many cherries and died?

1297
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,580
Is that right?

1298
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,020
There is a president, there's a thing.

1299
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,060
I think one of the presidents who was shot

1300
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,460
got a bunch of liquor and bullion shoved up his butt.

1301
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,660
Zachary Taylor, what I'm reading is,

1302
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,460
let me find cherries.

1303
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,620
For 4th of July, it was a big outdoor celebration

1304
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,020
and he was very tired.

1305
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,820
Hot and tired, he drank iced water

1306
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,820
and consumed large quantities of cherries and other fruits.

1307
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,180
He suffered severe stomach pains for the next five days.

1308
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,220
This is very much like Jason and the bananas.

1309
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,580
This is why it's good that Jason's careful with the bananas

1310
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,420
because he could die in five days.

1311
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,020
I love ice water too, oh no.

1312
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,980
Jason's a big supporter of ice water in general.

1313
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,580
Yeah, we did just learn that, yes.

1314
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,620
Lemon and ice water.

1315
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,180
Diagnosed to suffering from cholera morbus

1316
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,380
by his physicians, Taylor ate slivers of ice for relief

1317
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,260
until his body began rejecting fluids.

1318
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,940
And then five days later he said,

1319
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,700
I have always done my duty, I am ready to die.

1320
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,820
And he died. My God.

1321
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,900
It's kind of out of nowhere, so there you go, wow.

1322
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,220
There was a president cherries death.

1323
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,100
But I think that's different than beef bullion

1324
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,620
being shoved up your butt.

1325
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,420
Well, if you're shot, what are they gonna do?

1326
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,820
Could all, okay, there's been so much talk of,

1327
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,340
if I want to mention, of all the presidents going away.

1328
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,220
Instead, could they just add each president

1329
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,460
holding a bloody rag and they hold it up and cough

1330
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,540
a couple times during the show?

1331
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,580
Because that would plus it up

1332
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,420
and then give it a little more realism.

1333
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,740
That would be amazing, yeah.

1334
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,500
So they all, and then they look, they examine the rag.

1335
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,740
Yeah, they have to look at it.

1336
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,900
It looks stricken.

1337
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,140
Can I say something about the band?

1338
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,980
I know we're going, oh, we're jumping all around.

1339
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,940
And I will say we kind of talked about the band last year,

1340
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,460
but that's an old Scott thing, he's still in me.

1341
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,860
And I don't know, maybe I'm forgetting

1342
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,940
if we actually address this.

1343
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,340
What's funny to me about the band

1344
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,660
is the band looks like they're made up

1345
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,980
of different time periods.

1346
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,020
They're not all uniform.

1347
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,700
So they maybe all didn't die at the same time.

1348
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,020
They didn't know each other when they were living.

1349
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,940
It looks like there's one guy from the Civil War

1350
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,980
playing, I think, drums.

1351
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,700
Then there's just a guy in his pajamas

1352
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,300
playing that long horn.

1353
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,540
I really like the idea that all these guys came together

1354
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,540
to form a band in the afterlife.

1355
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1356
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,940
No DJs, though.

1357
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,980
There's nobody who's died recently.

1358
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,860
That would be a very good addition.

1359
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,260
They should, yeah, this would be a good way to,

1360
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,500
yeah, just to keep modding.

1361
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,460
He doesn't have to do much,

1362
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,180
but you throw a little bit of scratching in there.

1363
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,020
Right.

1364
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,980
Because assuredly, there's, I don't know for a fact,

1365
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,020
but I bet hundreds of DJs die every year.

1366
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,100
I pay tribute.

1367
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,260
Let's look at the census.

1368
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,100
Let's look at and see what the grade is.

1369
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,860
So you want a ghost with a ghostly MacBook Pro

1370
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,700
in front of them.

1371
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,980
In the back, yes, in the back.

1372
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,020
And I guess it maybe would ruin the flow

1373
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,140
to like all of a sudden change it,

1374
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,780
like change the Grim Gritting Ghost song to like dubstep,

1375
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,140
but it would be what that DJ might do.

1376
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,100
Or I guess you could even just add in a few scratches

1377
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,500
like a Limp Bizkit track.

1378
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,660
Well, yeah, you just add some random ones here and there

1379
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,420
because they had so many tracks

1380
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,300
and they were like cherry picking.

1381
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,120
Yeah.

1382
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,960
Zachary.

1383
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,780
Careful.

1384
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,620
Careful, Zachary.

1385
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,300
They're cherry picking what to use

1386
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,740
and then recording tracks in reverse

1387
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,700
and then flipping them so they were correct.

1388
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,180
But sounded a little off, you know.

1389
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,740
We should not, they should not put in the ghost

1390
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,620
of any of the members of LMFAO,

1391
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,200
who we, as we have learned a lot,

1392
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,040
they're not dead.

1393
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,860
They're not dead, yeah.

1394
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,700
As Jason questioned.

1395
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,180
Yeah, yeah.

1396
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,020
If we open for this.

1397
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,860
He said not dead, yeah,

1398
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,180
but I guess that is technically true.

1399
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,180
We all have to go at a certain point.

1400
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,700
So singing bus, singing bus.

1401
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,660
Oh, sorry, he's in me.

1402
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,740
I have to shove him down.

1403
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,100
Singing bus, singing bus.

1404
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:15,940
Shit, fuck.

1405
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,060
You guys, that's the threat.

1406
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,460
It's not current, Scott.

1407
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,160
It's that old Scott might come back

1408
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,000
and take over the episode.

1409
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,840
Oh, no.

1410
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,660
Just get down there.

1411
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:25,220
No, guys, please, talk about something

1412
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,380
that has nothing to do with the Haunted Mansion, fast.

1413
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,540
Well, you know, at the very last LMFAO show,

1414
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,700
they both said, I've done my duty

1415
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,740
and I'm ready to die.

1416
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,980
You've now switched.

1417
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,600
Now your theory is that they have both died.

1418
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,180
Well, they said that in unison.

1419
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,300
It was crazy.

1420
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,940
You can't find the video online.

1421
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,780
It's illegal.

1422
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,320
We were sexy and we knew it.

1423
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,060
I think somebody online figured out

1424
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,620
what you were confusing it with, though, right?

1425
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,020
Wasn't it somebody from Migos died?

1426
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,060
The somebody from the group Migos died.

1427
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,940
I remember someone from Migos dying separately.

1428
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,060
And there was like an uncle connection in that,

1429
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,860
like there is an LMFAO.

1430
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,620
It's an uncle nephew band, the rare uncle nephew band.

1431
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,020
Well, that's funny that you're not just taking this

1432
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,380
and going, yes, that's what I meant.

1433
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,380
I mean, I'll take the, I forgot about the uncle.

1434
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,580
I think he's still convinced

1435
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,740
that somebody in LMFAO was dead.

1436
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,580
I think he does not want to admit he's wrong.

1437
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,140
He's like still, he already, he declared both of them dead.

1438
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,940
It's there's now that now it's two.

1439
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,020
The numbers are climbing.

1440
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,620
He's going to declare that three of them are dead

1441
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,740
and there aren't even three members.

1442
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,860
Trying to get something a little more hip

1443
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,500
and current in the Haunted Mansion.

1444
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,220
Mike was trying to get the Jared Leto ghost in there.

1445
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,180
Now they're docking his pay on this Tron movie.

1446
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,340
So Haunted Mansion did so poorly.

1447
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,700
Yes.

1448
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,540
So you were, wait, we were going to read names,

1449
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,180
but do you want to, you're holding off on the names?

1450
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,020
Is that what you're doing?

1451
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:54,180
Oh, I mean, I think we'd cover the party.

1452
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,020
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1453
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,180
The graveyard band.

1454
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,020
Wow.

1455
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:57,940
I think we could get to the bus,

1456
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,260
sign stuff on the bus.

1457
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,100
Oh my God.

1458
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,500
All right, wow.

1459
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
We're going to talk about the singing bus in this episode.

1460
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,340
You know what?

1461
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,180
Hold on, hold on.

1462
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,300
I want to make a point in general.

1463
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,140
Fuck you Michael.

1464
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,540
Michael, I'll kill you in the end.

1465
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,500
Shit, fuck.

1466
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,340
And I've seen a lot of people make.

1467
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,420
Old Scott, be careful.

1468
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,780
I know, I'm trying, I'm trying to get through it,

1469
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,980
but like this is such, this is to me,

1470
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,380
this is the quintessential scene, the graveyard scene,

1471
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,700
the pirates setting the town on fire.

1472
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,380
This is the stuff you think about

1473
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,700
when it's like foundational Disney ride stuff.

1474
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,580
And this is what they don't want to do as much anymore

1475
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,420
because it's all IP stuff and it's all like single scenes

1476
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,140
and they point you in a direction of some action happening

1477
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,060
versus just floating you into the room full of,

1478
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,900
or floating you, yeah, floating both ways works,

1479
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,740
into a bunch of robots and you pick where you're looking.

1480
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,340
That's what, you're going to decide what you want to see.

1481
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,860
And I feel like we're not getting as much of that anymore

1482
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,460
and it's really hard, especially when it's movie stuff,

1483
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,420
because they just want to show you the famous scene

1484
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,180
from X whatever movie their ride is based on.

1485
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,980
So I mourn the loss of sort of these party scenes

1486
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,900
because I feel like this is such an important thing.

1487
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,740
This is such a fun thing.

1488
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,540
And I think it's good to reflect and focus

1489
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,020
on what ambiently is bad today,

1490
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,260
instead of talking about the thing we like

1491
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,180
that is in the graveyard scene

1492
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,500
that we could be talking about at any second.

1493
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,260
But I think it's good what you're doing.

1494
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,100
Thank you.

1495
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,460
I don't know that I'm feeling

1496
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,300
your sympathetic vibrations correctly.

1497
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,540
I'm feeling vibrations.

1498
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,300
You heard the words I said.

1499
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,060
I didn't hear the words,

1500
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,300
but I don't know that I felt them.

1501
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,220
I don't know that I felt the sympathetic vibrations.

1502
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,060
Yeah, I want to get all of the negative

1503
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
feelings that you have out before we can say

1504
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,100
the five funny names of the singing bus.

1505
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,180
Okay, all right, all right.

1506
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,420
Jason, you want to say the names of the singing ones?

1507
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,260
Sure.

1508
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,900
Well, Scott, you're so excited.

1509
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,620
I feel like you should say,

1510
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,780
do you want to say the bus names or the actor names?

1511
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,620
We can split them.

1512
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,300
Yeah, let's split them.

1513
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,580
Let's split them, yeah.

1514
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,420
I don't know.

1515
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,380
Do we know the order?

1516
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,380
But I don't actually know if it's a left to right order.

1517
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,380
I mean, I know which one is the broken one.

1518
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,060
Throw me whatever.

1519
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,420
Why don't you say these names and I'll say the actor.

1520
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,260
Okay, I'm going from left.

1521
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,300
Rolo Rumkin.

1522
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,340
Yeah, that's Vern Rowe.

1523
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,180
Great.

1524
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,660
Uncle Theodore.

1525
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,420
That's the great Thurl Ravenscroft.

1526
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,820
Of course, yeah.

1527
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,820
Cousin Al.

1528
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,620
Well, I'm seeing it as cousin Algernon.

1529
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,460
Algernon?

1530
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,620
Flowers for Algernon, of course, the story.

1531
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,900
I know where that name from.

1532
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Chuck Schrader.

1533
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,580
Ned Nubb.

1534
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,460
Ned Nubb, J. Meyer.

1535
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,740
And let's get this out of the way.

1536
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,060
Ned Nubb is not Nine Numb.

1537
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,700
Right, from Star Wars.

1538
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,540
How do you say if it's N-U-N-B?

1539
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,300
Nyan Numb is always what I've said,

1540
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,660
but I actually was calling him Neon Numb for years and years,

1541
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,620
and I've heard Nyan recently.

1542
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,940
Ned Nubb is a real precursor to that.

1543
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,300
Yes, for sure.

1544
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,580
And finally, Phineas Pock.

1545
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,900
Now, I'm seeing it as a Phineas P-Pock.

1546
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,100
I'm getting a middle initial in there.

1547
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,260
This is why it's good that we consulted

1548
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,420
several different websites.

1549
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,620
Ned Nubb, by the way, J. Meyer.

1550
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,980
I said that, but sure.

1551
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,980
That's an old Scott thing.

1552
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,500
Why didn't I?

1553
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,060
Oh, god.

1554
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,460
I'm still getting used to it, guys.

1555
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,460
Irish tenor, saying at the Golden Wars shoes.

1556
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,060
Old Scott would also say he didn't even

1557
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,540
say the name of Phineas P-Pock, which is Bob Ebrite.

1558
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,020
But that's, again, that's a, you know,

1559
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,980
it's like I'm still breaking in these shoes.

1560
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,300
Well, we're trying something new.

1561
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,460
We're sharing the names.

1562
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,340
We're doing it on our feet.

1563
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,300
We're finding it live.

1564
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,900
Yeah, we're doing it live.

1565
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,420
Yeah.

1566
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,180
Yeah.

1567
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,660
Dwayne, you were saying J. Meyer is what now?

1568
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,380
He was an Irish tenor, saying, for many years,

1569
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,940
at the Golden Wars, he wrote a few years.

1570
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,340
Tor a lor a lai.

1571
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,540
No, let's, all right, so we just jumped right

1572
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,460
into those names.

1573
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,420
But let's say a couple things, bigger picture

1574
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,340
about the singing busts.

1575
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,820
One is, and I don't think I realized until last year

1576
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,180
when I did this research, foolishly,

1577
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,540
that you are looking at the faces of who is singing

1578
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,820
the song, that these were not actors hired later

1579
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:19,660
to pantomime.

1580
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,780
And I remember putting that together

1581
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,500
as I became a fan of Thurl Ravenscroft,

1582
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,020
the rich baritone voice who is throughout all these rides

1583
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:27,980
that we love.

1584
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:30,100
And once I clocked what he looks like,

1585
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,180
I'm like, oh, that's him.

1586
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,420
That is him on the bus singing.

1587
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,300
So I wonder if that's true of all of them.

1588
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,820
And in fact, it is.

1589
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,620
They think they, I don't know if this was coordinated

1590
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,820
or if they recorded the vocals and then realized,

1591
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,740
hey, these are five weird looking guys.

1592
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,740
They all kind of look like ghosts as it is.

1593
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,340
Why go hire five other people?

1594
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,620
Let's get, but that gets you into a different place

1595
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,620
than Madame Leota, a character from 2021 or so

1596
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:04,340
on this series, who that is one face

1597
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,100
and then a different voice dubbing, correct?

1598
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,460
Right, yes.

1599
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,660
So yeah, you are looking at the faces

1600
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:13,500
of these odd singers that is who's doing it.

1601
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,380
And the second fact, that of course answers.

1602
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,140
And I think if you're listening to this show,

1603
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,180
this one's not true, but this is very urban legend

1604
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,700
that not one of these five men is Walt Disney.

1605
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,540
Yeah.

1606
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,060
Something that a lot of people believe for many years

1607
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,980
that he snuck in there.

1608
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,300
As a kid, I thought it was,

1609
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,900
because I think Thurl specifically,

1610
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,540
because he's got the mustache.

1611
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,700
That's who people think it is.

1612
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,420
And that's who I always is up until,

1613
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,940
I'm sure, my early 20s or later.

1614
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,460
I don't know, I was too old to learn.

1615
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,500
I needed to know that before.

1616
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,340
But it seems like, it just looks like an old man.

1617
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,940
But we're all still improving and bettering ourselves

1618
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,620
and turning new leads.

1619
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,340
So I'm admitting, I'm comfortable now admitting that,

1620
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,540
that I didn't know. That at what age, 29 perhaps,

1621
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,180
or even in your 30s. It's too old,

1622
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,940
too old to learn that Thurl was not Walt Disney.

1623
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,100
But yes, it would make, it feels very, I don't know,

1624
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,620
it felt right, it felt so right.

1625
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,780
So I understand why so many thousands

1626
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,540
and millions of people think that.

1627
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:17,540
Thurl, I used to mistakenly think that was the ghost host.

1628
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,620
That's Paul Fries. What?

1629
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,300
Paul Fries. Yeah.

1630
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,980
Thurl's other, but then I did it again with Thurl.

1631
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,860
That's a fact we haven't said since 2020, at least.

1632
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,580
Maybe 2019 even.

1633
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,100
So I can't blame him. Probably, yeah.

1634
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:37,140
Thurl's other big career notes,

1635
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,060
Tony the Tiger. Of course, of course, yes.

1636
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:45,060
And sings the You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.

1637
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,380
Again, doesn't narrate, narrator.

1638
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,940
Old Scott, I'm sorry, New Scott is not gonna allow you

1639
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,740
to say we've discussed all of this many times.

1640
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,780
Not on my watch.

1641
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,620
All right, I apologize.

1642
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,540
But no, this is me thing. Shut your mouth, Michael.

1643
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,380
Sorry, sorry.

1644
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,580
Sorry, that was mean of New Scott.

1645
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:01,820
This is me thing.

1646
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,580
I used to think Thurl was the singer and the narrator,

1647
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:10,580
but the narrator of The Grinch is Bella Lugosi, right?

1648
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,740
Boris Karloff, isn't it?

1649
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,740
Boris Karloff.

1650
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,740
I'm confused.

1651
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,740
Borlows Karloff.

1652
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,580
Inspiration for Bobby Boris Pickett,

1653
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,900
who we discussed in the Monster Mash episode.

1654
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,300
Yes, we've been threatening Thurl episode in general

1655
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,140
for years, and we should do it.

1656
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,100
You know, it doesn't feel like,

1657
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,540
I don't think this one's a threat.

1658
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,300
There's episodes that are certain, you know,

1659
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,340
Jay Leno acting career might be a threat.

1660
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,420
Jay Leno's wrestling career,

1661
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,300
which we still haven't made it to,

1662
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,700
that one's a threat, sure.

1663
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,780
But Thurl Ravenscroft, I think, will be a joy,

1664
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:41,780
because this is a wonderful man, a man of faith,

1665
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,820
I think a big presence in like Orange County churches.

1666
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,780
I think that's where he started singing in churches,

1667
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,620
and then got all career out of it,

1668
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,180
because the voice was so unusual.

1669
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,940
And this quality that nobody had,

1670
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,820
I don't know who, you know, you hear that like,

1671
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,180
all right, this actor, this current actor

1672
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,380
has taken over all the Paul Freeze parts, or whatever.

1673
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,100
I don't know who's doing any of these Thurls.

1674
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:07,300
I mean, clearly there's people doing Tony the Tiger today,

1675
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,100
but, you know, there's a,

1676
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,740
I just don't think they make them like that.

1677
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,700
I don't think voices can get as deep as that anymore.

1678
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,540
It does feel like that, doesn't it?

1679
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,300
They're that guy from Boyz II Men.

1680
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,020
Maybe, yeah.

1681
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,260
If they ever have to re-record any of this,

1682
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,340
they gotta get that guy.

1683
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,260
There is something, yes, that feels very unique

1684
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,700
to like the generation of like voice actors.

1685
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,100
A true opera singer, also.

1686
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,300
That's in my notes, yeah.

1687
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,340
Yeah, that'll help.

1688
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,740
But yes, they're all...

1689
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,580
In their appearance, too.

1690
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,700
Doesn't it, now, if you find,

1691
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,820
and I don't think this is true,

1692
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,260
if you found out that all five of these guys

1693
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,980
were Walt's best drinking buddies,

1694
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,580
and that when they filmed this,

1695
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,620
all of them were 35 years old,

1696
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,580
I would believe it.

1697
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,420
Yes.

1698
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,220
The apocryphal story I heard about

1699
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,780
is that they cast all these guys for singing,

1700
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,780
and then they were emoting so much

1701
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,620
when they were singing,

1702
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,900
and they're like, let's just film them, too,

1703
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,980
and that's how it ended up.

1704
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,100
Of course, they could only emote

1705
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,580
with their mouths and eyes,

1706
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,940
because they were in such intense,

1707
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,340
okay, don't move, they put them in a brace,

1708
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,060
so they captured them correctly,

1709
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:20,860
so it would match the projection correctly.

1710
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,380
It's really creepy, in general.

1711
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,900
I think that adds to the creepiness

1712
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,780
that they had to just keep the head still.

1713
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,420
The Phantom Five, I don't know if we officially said

1714
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,260
the name of the band.

1715
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,340
Well, there was discussion last year

1716
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,220
of whether this is the Phantom Five

1717
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,100
or the other band is the Phantom Five.

1718
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,100
No, I think it's these.

1719
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,380
See, I saw it with the other, I don't know.

1720
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,300
It's where I get mad, where old Scott would get mad

1721
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,420
about the hazy, half-thought-out mythology

1722
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,300
in which everyone is named Phineas or something,

1723
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,940
but new Scott recognizes this is great.

1724
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,140
It's figured out wonderfully,

1725
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,420
and it was part of the design

1726
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,780
that nobody knows which one is the Phantom Five.

1727
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,900
Oh, yeah.

1728
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,260
But I think the effect is fantastic.

1729
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:05,260
I think it's great that it's not perfect.

1730
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,420
Because now we know, obviously,

1731
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,300
they can projection map in this precision way,

1732
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,340
and they do so much of this in the parks now,

1733
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,020
but I like that it doesn't feel like these busts

1734
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,580
are perfect to the centimeter exactly,

1735
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,260
the faces and noses and cheeks of these guys.

1736
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,620
And I think it adds to sort of an eerie feeling

1737
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,460
whenever you see them.

1738
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,380
That was gonna be my question.

1739
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,300
Do you wanna keep the effect as is,

1740
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,140
or would you sign off on an upgrade for these?

1741
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,620
Because it looks, yeah, it looks weird,

1742
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,180
and I don't, it's not at all like the weird bride

1743
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,740
at this point with the projection face.

1744
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,460
It doesn't stick out like that, where it's like tired,

1745
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,980
but it does, I feel like, oh yeah,

1746
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,940
you could really nail this now,

1747
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:44,780
probably with the same footage.

1748
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,620
I think don't nail it.

1749
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,660
I think it's, yeah, and also you'd never wanna take away,

1750
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,060
the real problem would be, and this,

1751
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,180
I don't think they would do this,

1752
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,700
but you don't want them to ever make it modern people.

1753
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,180
There's something about this where you can,

1754
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,660
even with digital projection,

1755
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,600
which at some point it was updated,

1756
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,460
you can just feel that these were just odd,

1757
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,900
interesting, craggy face guys filmed in the 1960s

1758
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:13,140
on 60s film, and I'm glad that retained

1759
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:16,500
in the digital plus up.

1760
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,180
Other than just maintaining visibility and brightness,

1761
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,900
I don't want anything to happen to these bus.

1762
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,380
Right, here, maybe I'll save this for the end.

1763
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,740
I'll save it for the end, actually.

1764
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,580
Okay.

1765
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:31,260
But I was, yeah, looking at these and going,

1766
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,980
yeah, I wonder, would it take it away?

1767
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,780
Because it's interesting when we talk about upgrading

1768
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:41,020
any of these old rides, because they've upgraded them

1769
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,300
in little ways over the years,

1770
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,300
but sometimes you're thinking,

1771
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,100
when you see Hatbox Ghosts, you go,

1772
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,160
oh, wow, they could really plus this thing up

1773
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,900
in a crazy new way, but if it was all Hatbox Ghosts

1774
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,940
level stuff, would some of the magic be gone?

1775
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,780
Would it feel weird?

1776
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,720
I kind of was like, maybe these bus could be upgraded,

1777
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,560
and that would be cool,

1778
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,140
and you could do some effects with it,

1779
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,300
but I don't know, will it?

1780
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,800
What do you want them to do?

1781
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,420
I guess they could disappear and go different places.

1782
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,260
I don't know, like you could,

1783
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,420
like you could do Hatbox Ghost type effects with them.

1784
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,320
I don't know.

1785
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,500
But.

1786
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,260
I don't want any of them to not be visible to me

1787
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,200
in that part.

1788
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,460
I want to see all five of these weird faces.

1789
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,020
You could have them switch faces.

1790
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,780
You could have, like that might be interesting.

1791
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,020
I don't know.

1792
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,220
But would some of the modern stuff,

1793
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,180
would it not age well,

1794
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,260
and would it get rid of some of the magic?

1795
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,940
I mean, I think the different eras of technology

1796
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,700
throughout the mansion,

1797
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:48,700
in addition to the 100 or 200 year old magician techniques,

1798
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,580
I think it all kind of adds to the weirdness.

1799
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,860
It does, but some things age worse than others.

1800
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,700
That's true.

1801
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,620
The Bride effect aged worse.

1802
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,700
I'm confident that Hatbox Ghost will look great in 20 years.

1803
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,660
I could be wrong, but I think that will look good.

1804
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,100
Yeah, as long as it's not married

1805
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,900
to the technology of the era too much.

1806
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,740
Right.

1807
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,980
Some of the stuff that came out of Pirates was, I'd say.

1808
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:10,820
Right, okay.

1809
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,420
The other thought I'm having, I'm gonna save till the end.

1810
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,260
Okay.

1811
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,080
Okay.

1812
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:15,920
Got it, all right.

1813
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,700
I wanna put you guys on your heels now, or your toes.

1814
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,700
Keep on your toes.

1815
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,380
He's gonna throw in whatever you say.

1816
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,620
It might be so controversial.

1817
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,740
It brings old Scott out.

1818
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,140
It is gonna be a little controversial.

1819
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,660
I just keep rocking back and forth

1820
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,420
between my heels and toes, and I'm tired.

1821
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,860
Well, so I'm sorry, but that's just-

1822
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,140
You're getting your steps in while you're still here.

1823
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,300
I am getting my steps in.

1824
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,140
Who's gonna get you?

1825
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:34,960
Scott or me?

1826
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,940
I'm working.

1827
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:39,420
I got lots of stretches I'm doing these days, so.

1828
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,660
Now, we just named the people who,

1829
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,580
the first set of actors who played

1830
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,820
the part of the singing busts,

1831
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,980
but we have to acknowledge who else

1832
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,780
has played these five roles.

1833
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,620
Oh, sure.

1834
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,180
And I'm talking about when the singing busts do a cameo

1835
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:03,300
in the fairly recent film Muppet Haunted Mansion.

1836
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,200
There is an appearance from the singing busts,

1837
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,560
and they pulled out all the stops.

1838
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,280
For these iconic parts,

1839
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,240
they got the five biggest stars in Hollywood

1840
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,300
who all fit together as naturally as the Rat Pack.

1841
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,160
They are all thick as thieves.

1842
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,240
They make so much sense together,

1843
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,920
and I'll kind of do this with a leisurely pace

1844
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,440
so that the listener can shout them out with me

1845
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,360
in your car or on a walk or wherever you are.

1846
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,880
Henry Gibson.

1847
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,200
No, all right, the five who are the Muppet Haunted Mansion

1848
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,400
singing busts, and I know it's obvious, but here we go.

1849
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,080
Skye Jackson from the Disney Channel show Jesse.

1850
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,200
Canadian video game journalist Jeff Keighley.

1851
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,400
Pat Sajak.

1852
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,640
Justina Machado from One Day at a Time.

1853
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,600
And Craig Robinson.

1854
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,800
Phew, okay, you know, it just had to be said.

1855
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,160
That's just fan service.

1856
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,800
I mean, I know we all, we all know that.

1857
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,800
We recognized them as soon as we saw them,

1858
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,640
and they make so.

1859
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,080
I don't believe they could be in the same room

1860
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,800
with each other anymore.

1861
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,160
Well, it finally proves they aren't all the same person,

1862
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,000
you know?

1863
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,680
So Michael Janet Jackson thing.

1864
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,200
Like, can there really be two stars

1865
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,760
as big and electric as that?

1866
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,840
Why, no.

1867
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,680
Pat Sajak is different than Jeff Keighley.

1868
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,160
The natural, this is the, it's the most natural set

1869
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:31,080
of first people offered.

1870
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,680
Clearly, if you've, I've never seen more of a group

1871
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,880
of first, first offers in my life.

1872
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,120
And I'm so glad we have this Sajak now,

1873
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,480
that he's stepped down.

1874
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,320
Right, right.

1875
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,760
So all we, the only, you know,

1876
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,920
we used to have him every day,

1877
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,320
and now we only have him on Halloween.

1878
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,840
I think he's acting in a play,

1879
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,240
but that's not permanent.

1880
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,120
Pat Sajak is acting in a play?

1881
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,920
I could be crazy, but I feel like I saw him,

1882
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,560
Pat Sajak Theater plays, Google that.

1883
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,840
So he's no longer Pat Sajak, he's Play Sajak.

1884
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,280
New Scott, change Scott, that brought a tear to his eye.

1885
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,440
That was so wonderful and so perfect.

1886
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,200
Oh, that tear looks like a drop of blood

1887
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,520
that will make you burst up.

1888
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,360
Oh, he's ripening her act with it, yeah.

1889
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,520
I'm still grappling with it.

1890
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,920
There are ghosts inside me.

1891
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,600
They are scrunching my organs

1892
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,160
and making me bleed in surprising ways.

1893
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,320
It appears that he is in something.

1894
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,600
Wait, what the hell?

1895
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,960
He's in, the play is a play of Columbo.

1896
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,400
This is a, in Hawaii.

1897
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,280
Pat Sajak, just retired, boy.

1898
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,120
Well, it wasn't said in the title.

1899
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,800
Is he playing Columbo or is he the killer?

1900
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,640
No, I believe he is the, I think he's the killer.

1901
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,760
The play is, this is so,

1902
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:47,000
what layers unveiling themselves like a Columbo mystery.

1903
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,560
This is happening in Hawaii.

1904
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,680
It is called Prescription Murder

1905
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,760
with Pat Sajak and Joe Moore,

1906
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,360
the original Columbo mystery thriller

1907
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,120
by the William Lincoln Richard Levinson,

1908
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,160
the creators of the show.

1909
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,760
This is a live on stage Columbo in Hawaii

1910
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,320
and whoever Joe Moore is,

1911
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,080
Pat Sajak's longtime buddy is Columbo.

1912
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,240
So you can, it says buy ticket, just one.

1913
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,360
I'm gonna, I'm gonna wanna bring my whole family to this.

1914
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,280
Don't tell me I can only buy one.

1915
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,240
When is this, oh, well buy, you know what?

1916
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,000
This is gonna be applicable even way after this comes out.

1917
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,160
Buy these now.

1918
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,040
This is happening in summer 2025.

1919
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,720
You can right now buy a ticket to go to Hawaii.

1920
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,920
Well, that's a separate ticket.

1921
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,760
You can go to Hawaii and see Pat Sajak

1922
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,120
play the Columbo murderer at 2 p.m. on a Saturday in August.

1923
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:36,960
Wow.

1924
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,160
Prescription Murder is the pilot.

1925
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,600
It was the first Columbo,

1926
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,920
so I think it's an adaptation of that.

1927
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,000
Do we know who was, is that what,

1928
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,120
which actor, is that the I Spy actor who I can't remember?

1929
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:48,960
Do we know who the murderer was in that?

1930
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,120
It's Gene Berry, Catherine Justice.

1931
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,360
It's the one where Columbo looks very young

1932
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,320
because Peter, I just read this yesterday.

1933
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,560
Peter Falk was 39 filming the pilot,

1934
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,320
and when he filmed the final one

1935
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:11,040
of that first run of Columbo, he was not yet 50.

1936
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,640
Wow, wow.

1937
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,520
So we, next year, Jason, wait, I don't know,

1938
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,160
two of us, bleep that, two of us will be older

1939
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,200
than Columbo when he started.

1940
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,760
That's wild.

1941
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,200
On the topic of the merger

1942
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,120
of longtime television personalities in theater,

1943
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,400
there's something that I wanna head towards,

1944
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,920
but in order to do that,

1945
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,920
I think we have to talk a little bit about the song itself,

1946
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,920
Grim Grinning Ghosts, because if we're talking singing bus,

1947
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,160
you know, this is finally,

1948
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,520
it's not until this part of the attraction, correct,

1949
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,920
that we hear the lyrics of the song Grim Grinning Ghosts.

1950
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,160
We've heard, obviously, instrumental themes the whole time

1951
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,800
for many years as we've been talking, but now.

1952
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,280
Yeah, slower versions.

1953
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,840
Yes, sturgy versions, and we even, and last year,

1954
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,120
we talked about our kinda like

1955
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,920
hoppin' graveyard jamboree version,

1956
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,400
but now we are to the lyrics.

1957
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,680
First of all, general feelings about the song

1958
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,120
and the song with, I mean, it feels like

1959
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,440
we must have sort of talked about it before,

1960
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,080
but are we, and there's probably some broader conversation

1961
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,600
of best theme park original songs ever,

1962
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,200
but do we put this in the top five?

1963
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,880
Do we put it in the top two?

1964
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,880
How do we feel about Grim Grinning Ghosts?

1965
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:29,480
Yeah, I think top five for sure is fine.

1966
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,360
It's hard, cause like, stuff like Tiki Room,

1967
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,960
I really, I enjoy a lot of that music,

1968
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,560
but it's like, is that even,

1969
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,120
has that penetrated the culture

1970
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,600
like Grim Grinning Ghosts says?

1971
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,600
I don't think so.

1972
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,480
So it's like, I have to kind of also give it credit

1973
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,400
for probably being pretty, like well known

1974
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,960
amongst regular folk.

1975
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,000
People that don't go to the parks all the time.

1976
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,840
Sure, sure.

1977
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,800
Once in a while maybe.

1978
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,840
Yes, yeah.

1979
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Yeah, do we, do lyrics jump out in anyone?

1980
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,920
Is there a part that you like?

1981
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,080
Is there a turn of phrase?

1982
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,480
Because I always liked it, you know,

1983
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,520
we certainly talked several times

1984
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,120
about the creepy performance by the very wet Maleficent

1985
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,400
from the Disney sing-along tape,

1986
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,120
which is, you know, was at the time

1987
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,960
the best way to experience the song

1988
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,160
outside of being on the ride itself.

1989
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:30,600
And with the lyrics on screen and the, you know,

1990
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,480
I forget if it was a bouncing pumpkin

1991
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,560
that let you follow along with the lyrics,

1992
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,360
I liked it as a, like, you know,

1993
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,240
little snooty like to learn kid,

1994
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,120
because I'm like, these are words I do not know.

1995
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,960
Oh yeah.

1996
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,640
These are big old words

1997
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,960
and I want to know what they mean.

1998
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,840
And they have to get real clever with the etherealize

1999
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,400
and that's all of a vocabulary word

2000
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,680
that I had to learn just because I like theme parks

2001
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,960
and I'm nine years old.

2002
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,240
Yeah, it's, it does make you,

2003
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,600
it's like watching Star Trek when I was younger,

2004
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,200
when I would just like, they would say instead of like,

2005
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,960
to make a human, they would say procreate.

2006
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,160
And I was like, ooh, and I remember I used the word procreate

2007
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,040
in my like sixth grade and recess once.

2008
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,120
And I was like, oh, look who's Mr. Smarty Pants.

2009
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,280
He learned his word from Star Trek.

2010
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,280
And you still, that's what you still call it today.

2011
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,120
Procreation.

2012
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,440
Yeah, that's the only reason you would participate

2013
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,760
in the act, which makes you very uncomfortable.

2014
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,760
I participated in procreation.

2015
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,760
That relieves the entire thing

2016
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,640
is you start calling it sex and there's a tawdry association.

2017
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,480
No.

2018
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,840
When you're doing it to have a daughter

2019
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,240
and then close up shop.

2020
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,040
Clinical, yes, clinical.

2021
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,000
And it takes all the, all the grossness out of it.

2022
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,120
It's just, it feels so functional.

2023
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:44,960
Yeah.

2024
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,360
And that's what it should be.

2025
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,840
Sexual stuff should be functional.

2026
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,680
You gotta done it.

2027
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,440
Hopefully there weren't so many tries

2028
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,680
that you had to participate in gross sex

2029
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,160
more than you wanted to.

2030
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,640
I've done it once to make a kid.

2031
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,680
And then the other urges, I just do a little prayer

2032
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,520
and those go away.

2033
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,360
That's the hell, that's what I do.

2034
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,840
Pray them away.

2035
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,520
Little prayer, sing like a fun, funky song

2036
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,160
like God bless America or my country.

2037
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,000
A funky song?

2038
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,840
A fun, funky song.

2039
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,480
Yeah, or my country tis of thee.

2040
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,640
You give it up for America.

2041
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,800
Those are funky, I suppose.

2042
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,520
Yeah, anything that's not the Star Spangled Banner

2043
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,760
is a little funky.

2044
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,320
Well, it lets people kind of improvise

2045
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,520
and have a little too much fun.

2046
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,360
Yeah.

2047
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,280
Those songs keep you on track.

2048
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,840
The song I like a lot because of like the call and response.

2049
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,640
Like there's like different voices in the song.

2050
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:35,480
So you'll get like,

2051
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,000
Like it's up and down.

2052
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,840
Yeah.

2053
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,480
And like that always feels like a fun.

2054
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,920
High highs, low lows.

2055
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,760
Yeah.

2056
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,600
It's Greek and the tombstone, it's one of the best,

2057
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,520
most iconic, thorough voiceovers.

2058
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,240
Yes, and it feels, I think that element also adds

2059
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,160
to the party feeling.

2060
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,800
Cause even if you're not thinking about it consciously,

2061
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,640
there are so many like voices popping in and out

2062
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,560
that it feels like, oh wow, there's like,

2063
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,640
there's so many variations.

2064
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,520
So I think that's helping give you the party feel

2065
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,640
is the way they recorded that.

2066
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,840
Very different personalities of ghosts

2067
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,680
you feel just within the ones who were singing.

2068
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,080
There's like, it's like almost like queen backup vocals

2069
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,440
or something where.

2070
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,280
That's true.

2071
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,520
And with kind of like weird effects on them

2072
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,320
and echoes and what have, wow.

2073
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,160
Yeah.

2074
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,000
It is kind of a,

2075
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,600
but maybe there's no Bohemian Rhapsody without.

2076
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,760
Stop being dumb.

2077
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,920
Like stuff for somebody to love or like,

2078
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,280
it is similar in the like,

2079
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,080
oh, there's like kind of interesting background singers

2080
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,560
or little parts that are different from the main vocal.

2081
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,760
I kind of, you know, I will never,

2082
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,120
now I will like think of queen the next time I go on this.

2083
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,800
You're not incorrect.

2084
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,640
Yeah, yeah.

2085
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,640
So think of queen when you're on this.

2086
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,040
It's kind of the original queen.

2087
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,600
Yeah, and if Disney hadn't fully sold the queen catalog,

2088
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,440
there would be a chance they would put queen on the ride

2089
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,520
just because it's an IP they own.

2090
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,360
But it's not gonna happen.

2091
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,640
It's kind of a good idea to do like a live,

2092
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,240
like just to experiment,

2093
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:08,160
to do like a live Wizard of Oz Pink Floyd kind of situation.

2094
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,440
The Bohemian Rhapsody takeover of.

2095
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,280
Oh wow, yeah.

2096
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,800
Let's see if you sync up to Bohemian Rhapsody.

2097
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,640
Right.

2098
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,460
Maybe you'd have to do some other.

2099
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,520
You have to put in like some of the,

2100
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:20,040
you have to put in like the intro of Flash Gordon.

2101
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,880
Oh yeah.

2102
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,720
To cover some of the early part.

2103
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,360
So you could score each room with different queen,

2104
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,120
but I imagine it's Bohemian Rhapsody in the end.

2105
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,600
A full, I mean this is a good idea,

2106
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,080
like a full like rock and roller coaster

2107
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,320
that is part dark ride that goes along with a famous song

2108
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,880
like Bohemian Rhapsody would be actually pretty cool.

2109
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,240
I mean we obviously got it with Knights in White Sadden.

2110
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,080
Yeah, that's the pinnacle right now.

2111
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,260
That song we can sing every word of.

2112
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,100
Don't even.

2113
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,280
Oh yeah.

2114
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:49,440
Even I won't make you guys do an impromptu

2115
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,800
Knights in White Sadden.

2116
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,640
Right.

2117
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,600
But it's almost, did they do,

2118
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,960
did Dark Dark Park have a Bohemian,

2119
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,560
oh it was a Bohemian Rhapsody firework show is what it was.

2120
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,620
But yeah, some song that Disney owns

2121
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:03,760
that's like a top 10 rock radio hit

2122
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,400
that everybody knows potentially could be cool.

2123
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,440
I don't know if that'll happen,

2124
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,320
but it is an interesting idea I think.

2125
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,280
Well you know they're clamor,

2126
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,840
they're gonna strike, if Epic Universe is a big success,

2127
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,800
Disney's gonna strike back

2128
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,400
and get an exclusive deal with The Weeknd.

2129
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,880
They're gonna steal The Weeknd

2130
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,440
from his Universal Association.

2131
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,280
Right, right.

2132
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,120
In turn, and what?

2133
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,160
What's up for grabs?

2134
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,000
Hey, you know what?

2135
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,840
Song wise or other artists?

2136
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,080
Or ride wise, you know.

2137
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,440
You turn living with the land

2138
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,120
into blinding lights, the ride.

2139
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,160
Okay, yeah.

2140
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,640
Starboy, what could that be?

2141
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,480
I don't know, anything.

2142
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,640
The restaurant. The Space Mountain, yeah.

2143
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,000
The Space Mountain, yeah, Starboy.

2144
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,440
That would be good actually.

2145
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,020
And then take all of those,

2146
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,600
take those theaters where they don't do much of anything

2147
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,680
anymore, the movie theaters,

2148
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,360
and just play episodes of The Idol.

2149
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,080
Don't be a crowd pleaser.

2150
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,720
Yeah, yeah, a couple of edits here and there I suppose.

2151
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,440
But yeah.

2152
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,920
Just check IDs at the door.

2153
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,080
For time, right?

2154
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,920
For time, yeah.

2155
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just to get audiences in and out.

2156
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,360
In terms of Grim Grin and Ghost lyrics,

2157
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,360
I always loved Spooks Come Out for a swinging wake.

2158
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,120
Because I knew with swinging,

2159
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,080
like when I was a kid, I think I learned what a wake was,

2160
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,800
and then later on I heard that lyric

2161
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,520
in Haunted Mansion, and I'm like,

2162
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,040
oh, because they're all dead,

2163
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,560
because they're, yeah, they're deceased

2164
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,080
and they're having a party.

2165
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,480
I thought you were heading towards

2166
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,520
that you like the use of swinging,

2167
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,480
because it's an area you've always been interested in.

2168
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,080
Oh, well, just academically.

2169
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,400
Again, it's a studious, it's more about the way

2170
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,920
people intermingle. Sociologically, you know.

2171
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,240
Thought experiment more than anything.

2172
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,920
It's interesting how people do that, isn't it?

2173
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,800
It's a thought, you know, thought exercise.

2174
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,400
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes, yeah?

2175
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,240
Yeah.

2176
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,960
Because there's two, the alliteration twice,

2177
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,560
the alliteration there, that's good.

2178
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,720
These are wonderfully dense lyrics,

2179
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,680
but don't feel overdone.

2180
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,160
I think that maybe the funniest thing

2181
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:11,440
about the lyrics to me is that now that, you know,

2182
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,360
in talking about the narrative of the ride six years ago,

2183
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,680
we probably last discussed the notion of segueing

2184
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,760
from dark and spooky to fun and funny,

2185
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,920
and the lyrics are clearly where they are getting,

2186
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,760
you can feel a note given at some point of like,

2187
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,520
you gotta represent both, because here's where we get

2188
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,200
these kind of bet hedging lyrics about,

2189
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,720
it's silly spooks and they pretend to terrorize.

2190
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,560
Right, right, right.

2191
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,400
Yes.

2192
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,720
Was there a first pass which went more all in

2193
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,080
on the terrorizing?

2194
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,840
Yeah, because the pirates.

2195
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,520
They murder you and terrorize.

2196
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,720
Pirates are doing the bad things on the pirates,

2197
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,680
but this one, it feels like they're making sure,

2198
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,000
you know, these ghosts are not going to hurt you.

2199
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,840
But there's no agreement with you and the pirates.

2200
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,640
They may hurt you.

2201
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,120
So that is a difference between the two.

2202
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,280
Obviously the ghosts, like this could be anyone

2203
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,360
from any walk of life, pirates have, you know,

2204
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,800
dedicated themselves to a certain lifestyle.

2205
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,040
So I do think that I guess that there is a difference

2206
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,440
in just the clientele of the ride, but.

2207
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,440
One of them might really hurt you by busting out a guitar

2208
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,040
and doing some covers with Jeff Beck.

2209
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,880
That's the biggest threat of how one of them could hurt you.

2210
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,080
He's played with so many people.

2211
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,320
I just got recommended like him and Gene Simmons

2212
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,680
out of makeup doing what, rock and roll all night

2213
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,240
or something.

2214
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,640
Gene is trying to get him to sing with him

2215
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,960
and he keeps like not paying attention.

2216
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,920
I don't know where they are.

2217
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,280
I don't know how old this video is.

2218
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,320
America's ancient rock stars are trying the best they can

2219
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,880
to rehabilitate Johnny Depp.

2220
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,560
I know they are, all of them.

2221
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,480
Yes, every single one.

2222
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,600
I've seen him with every old guy over a certain,

2223
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,800
like 65 or something.

2224
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,600
They're all hanging out and they're doing their best.

2225
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,200
They're doing their best to get him back.

2226
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:10,200
But yeah, this is a fun party.

2227
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,720
I almost wish that the ride vehicle would kind of

2228
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,360
bump up and down.

2229
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,360
I want it to have, I guess like a low rider, a car.

2230
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,400
Because it's such a little jaunty little song

2231
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:24,640
and I'm like, I want to kind of,

2232
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,280
I bop naturally I feel like to it.

2233
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,920
I don't know if you guys bop naturally

2234
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,640
when you're hearing Grim Grinning Goose.

2235
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,960
The listener can't see this,

2236
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,720
but can you, what is bopping to you?

2237
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,800
Like a little like this, like I'm bopping up and down.

2238
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,040
A little bit like, it makes you want,

2239
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,520
so I wonder if there, like a newer version you could like,

2240
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,520
kind of the vehicle, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2241
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,600
You'd feel like that bass,

2242
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,840
because that bass, like that stand up,

2243
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,240
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2244
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,280
Like that really just makes you want to move.

2245
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,680
Bass makes you want to bop, yeah.

2246
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,920
Makes you want to bop.

2247
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,280
So you don't want to provide your own bopping.

2248
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,880
You want some of the vehicle to be doing the bopping for you.

2249
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,080
Right, and as you know, I like a ride vehicle

2250
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,840
to fuck me up a little bit.

2251
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,800
And this is just still too smooth maybe.

2252
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,640
And I want to bop a little during the Grim Grinning.

2253
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,720
So you want it to go way slower,

2254
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,560
but also fuck you up.

2255
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,560
Yeah, well then this, I don't really want it to jostle me

2256
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,040
like Transformers or anything.

2257
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,640
I just, you know, if it could dance,

2258
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,200
if the ride vehicle could dance a little bit,

2259
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,880
you want to have a swinging wake when you hear this song.

2260
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,320
And Pirates is a very much, oh, it's a fun song to sing,

2261
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,760
but it does not make you want to move

2262
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,000
like Grim Grinning Ghosts.

2263
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Grim Grinning Ghosts makes you want to move.

2264
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,600
It's jaunty, it fits with the more whimsical Mark Davis

2265
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,080
kind of second half of the ride.

2266
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,920
Yeah, yes, so I guess that's a plus up.

2267
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,760
I want the ride vehicle to dance a little bit.

2268
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:42,120
Okay, so notes, beginning of the ride,

2269
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,680
you move so slowly you aren't even sure that you're moving

2270
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:48,160
by the end up and down.

2271
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,480
Up and down like a low rider, yeah.

2272
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,960
If it gets to get you close to your head

2273
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
hitting the top of the thing.

2274
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,400
Yeah, now they've done things where like you could,

2275
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,400
there was like you could eat dinner in one of the rooms,

2276
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,400
you pay like a grand or something.

2277
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,360
I really want the ride vehicle to stop here

2278
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,360
and you can get out and dance.

2279
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,640
You are jealous of those teenagers causing a ruckus.

2280
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,800
Well, I'm jealous of, well, no, I'm not jealous

2281
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,680
of their like desecration of the room,

2282
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,320
but if I was a teenager in the 90s,

2283
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,720
I would have gotten out and just danced.

2284
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,760
They would have had to pull me away

2285
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,800
because I was like skinking or something like a ska,

2286
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,200
like a ska concert.

2287
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,320
Going to town like that extra mighty, mighty Boston's guy.

2288
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,760
I've been like the yo, Boston's guy.

2289
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,800
In this bumping, do you foresee them installing

2290
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,520
a totally new ride system or are they retrofitting

2291
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,880
the existing one? That's a good question.

2292
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,960
I think you, could you install a seat

2293
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,680
that bumps up and down, just a seat,

2294
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,840
although where your head hit then

2295
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,360
because it like is too elevated.

2296
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,600
Probably.

2297
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,240
I think I'll get Bob Gurr on the line

2298
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,480
and I think Bob could figure it out.

2299
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,640
Bob figured everything else out

2300
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,240
and Walt would tell him, well, here's what we need.

2301
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,080
Here's what you got to do.

2302
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:56,920
And he would just figure it out

2303
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,600
because he's an engineer and he knows what he's doing.

2304
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,520
So I'll say, Bob, make these seats dance.

2305
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,280
Well, what I would do if I were you would say,

2306
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,560
because he's not, I don't know if he's going to listen to you,

2307
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,320
my Carlson, a guy he's never heard of,

2308
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,800
but if you say, Bob, it's Walt from beyond the grave.

2309
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,480
I forgot one thing.

2310
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,240
I had one last wish.

2311
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,880
That is for the seats to Bob.

2312
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,720
Okay. Get on it.

2313
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,320
Oh, yep, yep, got it, skip.

2314
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,920
Well, I'll do that. What are you doing here, Bob?

2315
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,960
Ghost Walt called me.

2316
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,040
I'll put a bust, I'll put like a bust outside his house

2317
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,800
and I'll project my face onto it.

2318
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,640
Oh, that's good.

2319
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,240
And then I'll tell him to make it Bob.

2320
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,040
But again, as in the spirit of the song,

2321
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,200
you're only pretending to terrorize.

2322
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
Yeah, of course.

2323
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,520
Your hope is not to scare the hell

2324
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,840
out of elderly man, Bob Gurr.

2325
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,680
Yes, of course.

2326
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,480
You're just trying to provoke some more great work

2327
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,320
from this great man.

2328
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,160
Of course.

2329
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,480
And this is another room.

2330
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,080
And I know I was, I often, I've said this on the,

2331
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,880
hold on a minute, on the Small World episode

2332
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,640
that I didn't like that you could sort of see

2333
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,640
that you're in a big room.

2334
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,920
And you guys, I think you guys convinced me on that

2335
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,480
now that I've been on Small World a lot recently.

2336
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,920
I do like that it's kind of like boxy

2337
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,160
and you see the, like you don't need the illusion

2338
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,560
that you're in some other place.

2339
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,720
Cause Small World is all, it's little dolls.

2340
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,760
Like that's kind of almost like you're in a big toy box

2341
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,360
or something or you're in a big doll house on Small World.

2342
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,440
But Haunted Mansion, I really like

2343
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,120
that it feels pretty outside.

2344
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,440
Like you do feel like you're outside in the scene.

2345
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,280
Yeah, no visible ceiling, yeah.

2346
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:28,000
Which you don't on the Jack Skellington version.

2347
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,960
You can, it's lit up very, what is the word?

2348
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,800
It's brighter.

2349
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,240
It's brighter, that's what I meant to say.

2350
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,200
Did you mean to say it's so weird?

2351
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,600
No, I was just, couldn't think of a good word

2352
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,880
and then Jason said it so then I did like a big moose voice.

2353
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,960
It's brighter.

2354
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,160
It's brighter.

2355
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, that's what I meant to say.

2356
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,840
And yeah, as a kid I would always like,

2357
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,120
I would look for it, I remember.

2358
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,840
I would look for like, this has to be a room,

2359
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,440
but like sometimes you couldn't see it.

2360
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,240
Oh, so you'd be on a night, maybe you are outside.

2361
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,280
Here's something I didn't know.

2362
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,840
Grim Grinning Ghost comes from a Shakespeare poem,

2363
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,440
Venus and Adonis?

2364
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,440
It does indeed and this brings me to a point

2365
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,800
that kind of influenced by where this series is gone,

2366
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:19,080
where Haunt Cast the Fright this year has gone.

2367
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,120
I would say that Shakespeare has not come up on the show

2368
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,280
terribly much over the years,

2369
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,960
but it has in this series because,

2370
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,320
and this was a second gate thing,

2371
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:34,440
so let me fill in anybody who is not subscribed to that

2372
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,960
and you should be, patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2373
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,880
Nice.

2374
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,400
Yep, fit it in there.

2375
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,240
But Reese, in one of these other episodes,

2376
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,440
there was discussion of Shakespeare because

2377
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,800
Mike here was giving some consideration

2378
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,800
to taking private Shakespeare classes and why?

2379
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,160
Because he's suddenly interested in the,

2380
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,960
not private, but a small,

2381
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,160
a small limited time Shakespeare class.

2382
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,560
Was this to broaden his horizons as an actor?

2383
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,520
Well, possibly, you'd have to ask Mike,

2384
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,160
but one of the things influencing this notion

2385
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,560
was the teacher and would you like to tell us

2386
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,680
who the teacher of the class,

2387
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,080
you happen to be considering taking?

2388
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,040
I thought about it last night.

2389
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,200
I really, I forgot to even look into it.

2390
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:21,080
I think it is too late for you now, this round.

2391
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,800
But Armand Shimmerman who played Quark on Deep Space Nine,

2392
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,440
Star Trek Deep Space Nine in Glendale

2393
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,560
said he was teaching a Shakespeare class

2394
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,880
at a theater up there.

2395
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,600
I went looking into this, it definitely stuck with me

2396
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,840
and I found his Twitter in which he just posts

2397
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,160
the phone number to call to sign up for the class.

2398
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,000
I love that.

2399
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,920
This is at the Antaeus Theater Company in Glendale,

2400
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,720
which, and in my case, as an aspiring Shakespeare fan,

2401
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,440
had you heard of Antaeus before?

2402
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,280
Mm-hmm.

2403
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,120
Of course.

2404
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:51,960
Oh yeah, I know.

2405
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,240
You thought, well, you moved here

2406
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,400
and you were like, huh, UCB or Antaeus?

2407
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,080
Antaeus or UCB?

2408
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,280
Yeah, yeah.

2409
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:03,280
This class, and it is now too late for you to have done it,

2410
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,560
but this would have been $425 for six weeks.

2411
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,400
Sure.

2412
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,680
A small price to pay to spend time around the actor

2413
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,520
who played Quark.

2414
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,360
That's a pretty fair price.

2415
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,200
That's like UCB.

2416
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,440
Yeah, that's cheaper than UCB.

2417
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,280
It is, and for sort of a higher, all right,

2418
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:21,360
but I thought it'd be valuable to read to you

2419
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,320
what you would have been signing up for,

2420
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,240
because I don't know if you read the synopsis.

2421
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,280
Of what would have been asked of you

2422
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,820
if you were to spend six weeks learning Shakespeare

2423
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,660
to be around Quark.

2424
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,760
Don't have the time right now, but you're going on.

2425
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,800
Uh, so, Armand Shimmerman,

2426
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,240
the esteemed Shakespearean scholar and teacher,

2427
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,040
offers a six week class at the Antaeus Theater.

2428
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,960
He is looking for new people,

2429
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,520
so far you qualify, you're new,

2430
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,980
interested in learning more about Elizabethan rhetoric.

2431
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,200
You with it so far?

2432
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,840
I hear you, I'm understanding the language you're saying.

2433
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,680
Yeah, yeah, I mean, and you, I don't, you would,

2434
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,960
I think you could stand to know more

2435
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:58,480
about Elizabethan rhetoric, as far as I could tell.

2436
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,000
Which he considers the Rosetta Stone

2437
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,760
to not only understand the playwright's language,

2438
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,900
but also acquiring techniques for communicating

2439
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,160
arcane language to a modern audience.

2440
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,680
This is exactly what Jason said would be required,

2441
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,300
that it's not just learning the text,

2442
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,200
but it's how to update the language,

2443
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,800
which is a little obtuse, and modernize it.

2444
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:22,800
And I thought I had some very good teachers in high school,

2445
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,760
and, but I feel like there was not enough context

2446
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,520
when we covered Shakespeare.

2447
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,720
It was just kind of like, learn this, but don't,

2448
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:35,320
like, it can feel very stiff if you're on about, like, the.

2449
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:38,680
Yeah, here's the plot, here's the kind of stiff language.

2450
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,360
It made more sense when I watched, like,

2451
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,360
there's an Orson Welles Hamlet, there's also,

2452
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,320
which I really do love this movie,

2453
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,600
the Ethan Hawke modern Hamlet.

2454
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,440
Oh, okay.

2455
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,200
Julia Stiles, and Bill Murray,

2456
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,480
and, like, a bunch of other actors.

2457
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,840
Right, right.

2458
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,040
Well, this is, again, this is why you signed up

2459
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,780
for the Shimmerman course at Antaeus,

2460
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:04,100
is to learn about Elizabethan rhetoric,

2461
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,640
which is the Rosetta Stone to unlock all of it.

2462
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,160
And that's what it's about,

2463
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:12,280
not about getting to look at cork for several hours

2464
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,360
for six weeks.

2465
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,120
And also, you're gonna get his insights

2466
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,040
into Elizabethan culture, medieval history, religion.

2467
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:19,880
That sounds interesting.

2468
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,400
What are some things you've always been interested in

2469
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,240
on this show?

2470
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,720
Well, I'd love to get into all of it.

2471
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,680
It sounds interesting.

2472
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,720
Maybe it wasn't something that previously

2473
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,440
I've ever expressed interest in, but, but.

2474
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:34,300
Given the right, you know, it makes sense.

2475
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,720
You're into a music artist, and he delves into this genre.

2476
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,720
Suddenly you wanna go down the path of this genre

2477
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,560
and find out more.

2478
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,960
And it's, yeah, hey, if, look, I'm a fan of his work,

2479
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,240
his cork, maybe I do wanna learn about medieval history.

2480
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,080
Right, maybe I wanna know that.

2481
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,360
Maybe in a different life, or a different one,

2482
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,600
different decade of our lives,

2483
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,320
Jason and I would have taken this together.

2484
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,160
Wow.

2485
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,920
Do you think you would have agreed to this?

2486
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,760
Ah, I think I would try.

2487
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,240
If I paid for it, I paid for it.

2488
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,080
Huh?

2489
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:00,920
If I paid for it.

2490
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,440
I mean, that certainly would have been

2491
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,760
the icing on the cake, but I would have gone with you.

2492
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,840
Look, I need a wingman.

2493
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,720
Are you, like, wait to go on dates?

2494
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,400
No, no, no, to get me in with Armand Shimmerman.

2495
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,800
I think he's gonna be able to tell

2496
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,520
I haven't even seen the Ethan Hawking.

2497
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,360
The real problem.

2498
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:17,800
I need somebody who knows 1% of a Shakespeare to join me.

2499
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,760
The real problem is I would have had to work so hard at this.

2500
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,920
It would have taken so much extra time out of it,

2501
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,360
and I don't wanna disappoint him.

2502
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:31,040
So, ultimately, I can't, unless I have the time to devote

2503
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,560
to practicing Shakespeare.

2504
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,840
But you could, you know, you just, like,

2505
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,360
well, I don't know, you're more engaged.

2506
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,200
I'm still picturing you with a little baby.

2507
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,240
That's not what you have.

2508
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,360
You're engaged with your daughter.

2509
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,200
It's hard, you can't exactly be like,

2510
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,080
all right, I'm feeding her in one hand,

2511
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:48,560
and then in the other, I am learning about

2512
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,280
what religions were thriving in the Elizabethan era.

2513
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,880
Yes, exactly.

2514
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,160
It's not quite that, but, you know,

2515
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,440
there's still a limited amount of time.

2516
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,520
And going, first of all, it seems hilarious,

2517
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,680
me underprepared or trying to cram in the car on the way

2518
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,120
into Armand Shimmerman's Shakespeare class.

2519
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,040
You're eating Taco Bell in one hand,

2520
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,840
you're trying to, you're, like, up on the dash.

2521
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,880
You have, like, a really tiny type.

2522
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,440
Your entire dashboard is taken up with a full soliloquy

2523
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,000
you have to go do in six minutes.

2524
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,400
I'm eating, shoving a Crunchwrap in my mouth,

2525
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,640
and I'm trying to, like, memorize words I don't know,

2526
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:21,480
like, words that are unfamiliar.

2527
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,600
What has?

2528
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,560
And then I'm just, like, I start crying.

2529
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,680
I'm like, I'm gonna disappoint Clark.

2530
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,560
Clark's gonna be so upset with me.

2531
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,240
You see, I don't know the show.

2532
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,680
Would Quark be, if he was upset,

2533
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,880
is he a character who was upset a lot?

2534
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,280
No, not really.

2535
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,080
I mean, he was the bartender, essentially.

2536
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,840
He's a Ferengi, and he's always kind of, like,

2537
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,280
up to something, and, like, he's, you know,

2538
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:43,760
I think he's ultimately a good guy,

2539
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,040
but he, you know, he's up to some mischief,

2540
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:49,640
and he's up to, like, deals, and he's bartering and stuff.

2541
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,800
So he's not, like, he wouldn't be upset,

2542
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,120
like, he wouldn't be upset in the way

2543
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,360
I am worried Armand would be,

2544
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,080
because just looking at Armand's Twitter and the posting,

2545
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,280
I feel like Armand would be somebody who would call me over

2546
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,120
and be like, Michael, I am so disappointed in you.

2547
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,400
What you have done here today is a disgrace to the theater

2548
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,280
and to William Shakespeare, and I don't say that lightly.

2549
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,440
I've been teaching for over four or five decades,

2550
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,200
and I just think that, quite frankly,

2551
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,680
you should quit acting, in general.

2552
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,000
Like, I feel like he's very, he takes care of-

2553
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Shakespearean or not.

2554
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:22,840
The tweets.

2555
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:27,840
I don't, I've never banned anyone from the Antaeus before.

2556
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,800
There are no faces, do not admit this man,

2557
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,840
but you will be the first.

2558
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,560
We will make room at the box office door,

2559
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,400
and your face will be the first plastered,

2560
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,400
shamefully, on that wall.

2561
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,240
But you don't think- I despise you.

2562
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:44,240
There's room to fail and to soar in this class.

2563
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:45,880
No, what?

2564
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,720
No.

2565
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,800
No, acting class, I hear you meant to-

2566
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,520
We got a lot of work to do before he soars.

2567
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,640
When you brought this up, I think the timeline,

2568
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:57,440
if you had signed up for it, I think it had been like,

2569
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,040
maybe it's two weeks before the first class,

2570
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,520
and then you've only got a week in between,

2571
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,720
in which you're very busy, you've got a lot going on,

2572
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:08,240
and I think, yeah, I just don't think the time to soar

2573
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,560
and to learn this complex language is gonna be there.

2574
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,760
But I'm sure he would've been given a monologue

2575
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,040
or a poem or something to practice.

2576
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,760
I don't think you had to come in prepared.

2577
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:20,640
Well, on each class you do, I'm sure.

2578
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,480
By the time of week two, I'd imagine.

2579
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,960
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

2580
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,400
Mike would get away for a little bit

2581
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,080
just doing kind of the free, like, what brought you here?

2582
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,840
You would have to lie your way through that,

2583
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,320
but that's acting.

2584
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,640
That'd be, if you could get through the opening

2585
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,400
where you kind of imply that you're interested

2586
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,680
in Elizabethan culture,

2587
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,360
and never say the word quark or Ferengi.

2588
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,880
If you could survive that test,

2589
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,400
maybe you could soar in the rest.

2590
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,800
And then he would, like, mention an episode

2591
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,880
or something where he had to do some of this

2592
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,360
or some other character had to do some of this,

2593
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,360
and I'd go, oh, excuse me, what,

2594
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,040
were you on Star Trek, Deep Space Nine?

2595
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:54,880
Oh, okay.

2596
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,280
Oh, under the makeup, they under the,

2597
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,160
you were one of the, what do they call those guys?

2598
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,440
So you were swinging way too far in the other,

2599
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,280
you're like, you're swinging between extremes.

2600
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,840
This is the kind, maybe this is the kind of note

2601
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,080
that Armin would give, is that you can't run,

2602
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,800
every performance, including lying to an actor

2603
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,800
you want to be around,

2604
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,960
instead of just going to meet them at a Q&A,

2605
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,040
the character has to be based in reality.

2606
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,120
You know, this is a sort of comical deception

2607
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,800
present in Shakespeare's comedies.

2608
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,480
All right, well, you would have thrived in this class.

2609
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,040
I think I would have loved this class.

2610
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,520
You gotta say, well, maybe, well, you could still do it,

2611
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,640
and then you just gotta like, you know, I don't know,

2612
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:40,440
be there as some sort of like, Jason Helper,

2613
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,640
you have to act like, oh, yes, he's my young ward.

2614
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:46,400
I never go anywhere without my man servant, Michael.

2615
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,240
Sure, yeah, yeah.

2616
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,400
And he was mentioning he's aware

2617
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,480
of some of your television work.

2618
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,760
Did you fit in any television work in your time?

2619
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,840
So he, am I his ward or his man?

2620
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,120
No, I'm your ward.

2621
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,760
No, no, you have to do Shakespeare.

2622
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,600
Okay.

2623
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,240
And as part of the plan, you have to pay for it

2624
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,080
just to keep up,

2625
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,640
because the name on the credit card,

2626
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,480
it has to be Jason Helper.

2627
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,040
It's gotta match, the three-digit code, too.

2628
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,520
If you wanna pay him back later, fine,

2629
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,560
but I think probably Jason just should pay the $425,

2630
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,720
but then, yeah, you have to learn all the Shakespeare,

2631
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,440
and Mike gets to hang out,

2632
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,120
deal with your bags and personal effects,

2633
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,120
and then you get to watch all of the classes

2634
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,400
and stare at Armand Schimmerman for six weeks.

2635
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,520
Look, I think if Jonathan Frakes was teaching a class,

2636
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,760
it would be much more of an easy vibe,

2637
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,880
where it'd be like,

2638
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,720
Mr. Frakes, I didn't do any of the homework.

2639
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:34,400
Ah, it's all right, don't worry about it.

2640
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:35,840
Does the class wanna go out and get a steak

2641
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,640
and I'll tell old TV stories?

2642
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:41,560
Like, that's maybe more what I'm looking for.

2643
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,680
But the seriousness, the passion,

2644
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,600
which clearly are from that bio

2645
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,320
that Armand has for Shakespeare,

2646
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:50,120
but this is where, why I brought all of this up,

2647
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:52,920
is that he's gonna do other sessions of this.

2648
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,560
This will be a possibility for you in the future,

2649
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,600
and I figured at some point,

2650
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:02,760
saying grim grinning ghosts in context,

2651
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,080
that was gonna happen anyway,

2652
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,120
and it occurred to me this morning,

2653
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,720
why not have Mike read it

2654
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:10,320
and give you the opportunity to prove

2655
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,960
your potential prowess as a Shakespearean actor,

2656
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,760
which could then flesh out the entire illusion

2657
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,720
of you just wanting to be around cork for a while.

2658
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,560
Oh my God.

2659
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,160
Oh, I truly thought this was going to end with me

2660
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,600
having to read this poem.

2661
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,720
You know what's funny?

2662
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:26,800
I was my, again, this was in my notes from last year,

2663
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,680
and I was like, probably I'll hand it to Jason,

2664
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,520
and that'll be something.

2665
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,360
And then I was like, wait a minute, no.

2666
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,240
Jason is not the aspiring Shakespearean actor,

2667
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,080
it is Michael.

2668
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,640
No, and much like the class,

2669
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:39,760
I've been sitting here reading it over and over.

2670
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,000
In preparation?

2671
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,920
Yeah, because that's how I dress.

2672
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,480
Now you're like, this is what Scott's leading to.

2673
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,040
This is what that weird tone's all about.

2674
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:46,880
No, no, no.

2675
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,200
This is how I prepare for acting class.

2676
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,120
I end shows and stuff, I beat stuff into the ground

2677
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:56,280
till it's meaningless to me.

2678
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:57,800
But I can do it.

2679
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,640
All the spurks.

2680
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,480
By instinct.

2681
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,480
It's also hard to know even what you would,

2682
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:05,320
what a voice do I affect for Grim Grinning Ghosts

2683
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,160
and a Shakespearean.

2684
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2685
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,720
And you have a question when you arrive at it,

2686
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,440
which is kind of in the middle of the stanza

2687
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,880
from Venus and Adonis,

2688
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,720
that do you kind of blow past it?

2689
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,800
Do you not act like it's the name of a song

2690
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,960
that you like from a ride that you like?

2691
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,200
Or do you really hit it?

2692
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,760
It's really up to you, but I think this is,

2693
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,680
if you ever had to point, if Armin got you in a corner

2694
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:28,640
and said, you don't care about Shakespeare, do you?

2695
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,720
And you'd say, sir, I have nothing but respect for you,

2696
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,240
but you're incorrect.

2697
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,560
I, in fact, have performed Shakespeare in an audio medium.

2698
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,200
I will produce this tape for you if you wish.

2699
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,440
Flavor, style.

2700
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,520
I also like, one of my favorite things

2701
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,880
is so many people on Star Trek

2702
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,640
are very accomplished actors.

2703
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,480
Yeah, right.

2704
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,960
And they do know all this stuff

2705
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,960
and they can recite their favorite passage

2706
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,160
or maybe a whole play or whatever.

2707
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,760
And then you're cut and they're like,

2708
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:58,240
hey, you want some Romulan ale?

2709
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,240
Give it to me, I'll get you.

2710
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:04,000
And like Patrick Stewart, very accomplished.

2711
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Mr. J. Todd, the Romulans, what do they want?

2712
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,440
And you're like, I worked so hard.

2713
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,680
But pronouncing Romulan and Ferengi correctly

2714
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,120
is kind of like saying some of the

2715
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,200
Shakespeare terminology correctly.

2716
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,480
So I leave it to you now to regale us.

2717
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:20,320
So this is Shakespeare.

2718
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,480
Yes, this is part of, it's one of his early poems,

2719
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,680
Venus and Adonis, that happens to have a phrase

2720
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,440
that we know and have talked about in this episode.

2721
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:31,480
Here now, Shakespeare aspiring Elizabethan actor.

2722
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,120
Could I do it like Quark?

2723
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:33,960
Yeah, I think it's up to you.

2724
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,440
Hard-favored tyrant.

2725
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,320
It's totally your call.

2726
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:42,320
No, hard-favored tyrant, ugly, eager, lean,

2727
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,880
hateful divorce of love.

2728
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,880
Thus chides she death, grim grinning ghost.

2729
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:56,240
Earth's worm, what dost thou mean?

2730
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:01,200
To stifle beauty and to stealth his breath?

2731
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,320
Who, when he lived, his breath and beauty set?

2732
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:11,440
Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.

2733
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:16,400
That's a cold read, folks.

2734
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,080
And then what do you, if you, I mean,

2735
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,520
Jason, feel free to do this, but you could,

2736
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,440
does anybody feel like they could do what Armin,

2737
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,600
or actually what Quark would say in response to that?

2738
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,560
Can you do a Quark?

2739
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,880
I cannot do a Quark.

2740
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:32,680
Also, is that the, that's the second A from the poem?

2741
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,920
I don't know, some of it.

2742
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,760
It's part of it.

2743
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,480
You might say I did a little Control-F

2744
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,960
to find the word grim.

2745
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:39,800
Oh, sure.

2746
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,000
Got it from there.

2747
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,800
What do you think he would think?

2748
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,160
Who cares?

2749
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,600
Bunch of nonsense, that is.

2750
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,480
I can't do a good Quark.

2751
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,000
I really should have a better Quark impression.

2752
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,240
It's pretty good.

2753
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,080
Give yourself some credit.

2754
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:54,920
No, I don't want to give myself credit.

2755
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,640
Wow, well, I don't know.

2756
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:57,960
Did you think it was moving?

2757
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,000
I thought it had a lot of range.

2758
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,840
Like the song, there was some low and some high.

2759
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,120
It had dynamic spikes.

2760
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,160
I thought it was pretty good.

2761
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,840
Maybe you could sell your way into doing this class.

2762
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,720
Yeah, I would love, if he does it again, we'll see.

2763
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,600
If he does it again, I mean, look,

2764
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,920
it's good to test yourself sometimes.

2765
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:18,840
And yeah, maybe, is it helpful to test yourself

2766
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,880
when you're around somebody who was on one of the Star Treks

2767
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,600
from the 1990s?

2768
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,040
Yes, that's extra good.

2769
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,200
It puts the heat on you.

2770
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,480
You really want to perform.

2771
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:29,320
Now what'll happen is that some podcast,

2772
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:32,640
The Ride Superfan, is gonna keep an eye on the classes

2773
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,480
at the Antaeus Theater.

2774
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,840
They're gonna pretend they're interested in Shakespeare

2775
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,360
just to be around you.

2776
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,520
So then we got a class, we got a little chain

2777
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,000
where there's Armin up on stage,

2778
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,160
and then you're staring like a wide-eyed puppy at him.

2779
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,520
And then right next to you is some guy

2780
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,440
who doesn't want to admit, I'm assuming guy,

2781
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,560
who doesn't want to admit.

2782
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,400
Yeah, let's be honest.

2783
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2784
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,200
Doesn't want to admit that he knows you

2785
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,720
from podcasts, The Ride.

2786
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,000
Yes, I'm the Shakespeare, I've always loved Shakespeare.

2787
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,280
Yeah, I love that guy.

2788
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,680
Oh, do you love a podcast?

2789
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:04,520
Shakespeare Bob.

2790
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,880
Oh, I see you on Star Trek?

2791
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,720
I don't know.

2792
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,560
This is wild.

2793
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,840
I'm learning stuff.

2794
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,440
Geez, I'm so blinded by my love of Shakespeare.

2795
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,840
This hypothetical person has taken every,

2796
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:17,800
there's so many Star Trek classes at this point.

2797
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,080
LeVar Burns teaching a class in there,

2798
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,600
and like Marina Surtis is teaching a class.

2799
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,480
Scott Bakula has one from Star Trek Enterprise.

2800
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,640
Oh, I love Bakula.

2801
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:30,160
Bakula, Avery Brooks is materialized,

2802
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,440
he's teaching a class.

2803
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,280
Yeah, so every year.

2804
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,000
Are these all in LA?

2805
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,880
This is a joke.

2806
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,720
Oh, okay.

2807
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,680
I truly thought you were tracking all of the acting classes

2808
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:45,280
from Star Trek. I wish it was just the Star Trek theater

2809
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:47,120
teaching acting classes all from the cast.

2810
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,320
I think you could find it.

2811
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,680
Well, like, I mean, I follow these people on Twitter,

2812
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,640
but I don't know that any of them are teaching acting classes

2813
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,000
other than Armin right now.

2814
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,880
To sleep, to sleep, a chance to dream.

2815
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,760
Look, I will take an acting class

2816
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,480
from anyone who was on Star,

2817
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,800
I mean, there's still a couple original.

2818
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,400
George Takei acting class, forget about it.

2819
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,240
Shatner, Walter Koenig, come on, the three.

2820
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,480
This is the chance that you have.

2821
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,240
Unless some of these other people start classes,

2822
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:18,000
and I just thought, you gotta follow your dream now

2823
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,840
while this one is present.

2824
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:23,680
Well, your dream is just mere miles away at the Antaeus.

2825
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,000
I hope I got you closer to being here.

2826
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,320
Thank you, yeah, I appreciate that.

2827
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,880
Look, the media landscape, popular culture

2828
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:33,480
is always shifting, but the theater is eternal.

2829
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,640
Much like the Haunted Mansion.

2830
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,480
This guy, yeah, this guy needs to take

2831
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,920
Shakespeare classes, I think.

2832
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,160
I mean, yeah, I think you excel the most.

2833
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,680
He's the one who randomly in some episodes said,

2834
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:48,160
we tread these boards as a defense

2835
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:50,560
when you said something we didn't understand.

2836
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,800
We tread these boards.

2837
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,320
I said something equally archaic, yeah.

2838
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,880
When somebody, he throws Shakespeare at you.

2839
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,800
That doesn't sound like me at all.

2840
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,160
He throws Shakespeare at you when he's cornered.

2841
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,840
He's the weirdest dick when he gets nervous,

2842
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,280
he gets Shakespearean.

2843
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,520
He throws Shakespeare at you.

2844
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,320
Well, that's all something, do you wanna close out,

2845
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,000
you had this controversial idea.

2846
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,720
Well, I don't know if we should do it next year

2847
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,360
or the year after.

2848
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:22,160
We did an episode recently about fixing Tomorrowland,

2849
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,280
and I said, we gotta do more of this.

2850
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:27,040
And I think we should do the same exercise

2851
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,480
where we each take different assignments

2852
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,840
and we talk about the Haunted Mansion.

2853
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,320
Some of, and I don't know if we figure it out later,

2854
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,320
but walk through the Haunted Mansion

2855
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,520
and what do you change, what do you keep the same,

2856
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,600
what do you fix, what don't you fix,

2857
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,600
what do you make worse?

2858
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:45,320
Now, I think old me would have been on edge about this

2859
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:46,920
because what you've just described

2860
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,120
is an excuse to go all the way backwards

2861
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,200
and do everything again, even though I'm not sure

2862
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,480
we are out of the graveyard now.

2863
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,720
We're not, necessarily. It doesn't seem like we are.

2864
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,720
But new me, changed Scott is touched by this idea.

2865
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:05,840
Oh, great.

2866
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,840
I think that as, now that I'm backed into a corner,

2867
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,640
yeah, let's, now I know I didn't have any ideas

2868
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,200
about how to change the bus,

2869
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,200
which I think are great as they are.

2870
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,280
I welcome this.

2871
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,560
I say, let's go all the way back.

2872
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:24,840
Next year, when we have, now that we're taking our time,

2873
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,600
let's go through, let's look at every hedge.

2874
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,920
Let's go through the gift shop and let's talk,

2875
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,280
why not talk about every single item again

2876
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,320
and point to it and say change or keep it?

2877
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,480
Maybe, because there will be,

2878
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:40,240
I think the queue will be ready next year

2879
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:42,200
and the gift shop will be ready next year.

2880
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,560
Maybe we could do queue, gift shop,

2881
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:49,400
and then hitchhiking ghosts and the moving walkways.

2882
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:52,720
Finish it out and then the following year.

2883
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,840
Changed me is into this declaration.

2884
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,760
We go through, just because it's a tidier way to do it.

2885
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,760
Then we go through and we each maybe figure out

2886
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,040
a different assignment.

2887
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,200
Budget, we each have a different budget.

2888
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:06,920
Then we go through the Haunted Mansion

2889
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,800
and propose our different changes to it.

2890
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,920
Sure, sure.

2891
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,840
We'll do another version of this sometime

2892
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,520
in the next 12 months.

2893
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,880
Not Haunted Mansion related, because I enjoy the exercise.

2894
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,680
But, 2026 is fixing Haunted Mansion.

2895
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:24,360
So we have now delayed doing,

2896
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,960
presumably, the Disney World one.

2897
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,800
Yes, delayed.

2898
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,080
We've delayed doing Phantom Manor.

2899
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:29,920
Yes, we've delayed it.

2900
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,760
This all gets delayed.

2901
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,080
Delayed nightmare.

2902
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,080
We haven't talked about if Phantom Manor

2903
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,000
is technically a separate thing

2904
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,480
that we could do elsewhere in October.

2905
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,200
We'll talk about that in 2026.

2906
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:43,080
We'll do a lot of planning and how this will work.

2907
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:48,320
Great, well, Changed Me cannot wait for this excuse

2908
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,800
to go all the way back through and do it all again.

2909
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,400
Now, I can't promise that I'm not gonna change again.

2910
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,240
We'll see.

2911
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,720
Two years is a lot of time.

2912
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,560
It is, yeah.

2913
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:01,680
I just hope you dab that blood coming out of your eye,

2914
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,920
like the tears are.

2915
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:07,080
It's a lot of them, and it's a real steady stream now.

2916
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,040
You'll have seen it, Robert.

2917
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,680
I'm better, I'm improved.

2918
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:12,280
There's increased blood flow in my head.

2919
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,720
I want it to be coming out of me.

2920
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:15,520
This doesn't indicate any rage

2921
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,120
that I've been suppressing unhealthily

2922
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,080
for this entire interminable episode.

2923
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,040
You'll have seen if Robert Downey Jr.

2924
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:25,120
is doing an accent or not by then, by 2026.

2925
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,440
So you could be different.

2926
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,280
You'll be different.

2927
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,640
Maybe I'll be talking like that accent.

2928
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,920
Maybe we all will.

2929
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:34,440
Oh, $100 million to do like a Boris Batonov voice.

2930
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,280
I hope that is what it is, yeah.

2931
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,680
I hope.

2932
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,520
I think he doesn't know.

2933
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,160
He'll be talking like Rodney Dangerfield.

2934
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,120
Wow, he took it.

2935
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,320
Boy, actors take inspiration from the weirdest places.

2936
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,240
It's Dr. Doom, it's like Rodney.

2937
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,840
Dr. Doom does not get any respect.

2938
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,400
He kinda doesn't, though.

2939
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,520
He doesn't get any respect, that's true.

2940
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,560
So, yeah, we'll see.

2941
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,880
Yeah, that's what fuels the character,

2942
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,640
and we can't wait to meet him.

2943
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:00,320
Well, a lot happening in 2026.

2944
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:03,640
A lot happening in 2025, in which Mike,

2945
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,680
without even me pressing at all,

2946
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,560
with my hands off the wheel approach,

2947
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,240
you've now committed to finishing

2948
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:11,720
The Haunted Mansion next year.

2949
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,560
That's wild.

2950
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,400
The episode-

2951
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:15,200
Jason Sheridan has not said anything in protest,

2952
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,600
therefore he signs off, and as soon as I say,

2953
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,960
you survived haunt cast the Fright,

2954
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,160
that closes the door, at which point

2955
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,000
there would have been,

2956
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,760
we would have been able to get protest from Jason.

2957
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,320
What I would like to say is,

2958
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,280
that episode could be five hours long.

2959
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:32,560
So, well, Change Me usually likes to get these done

2960
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:33,400
in a tiny amount of time.

2961
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,240
That could be a double episode of time.

2962
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:36,680
But Change Me has nothing but time.

2963
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:37,520
Nothing but time.

2964
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,400
I don't have anything else going on.

2965
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,440
Time enough at last, you know.

2966
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,280
Is that Shakespeare?

2967
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:44,600
That's Twilight Zone.

2968
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,480
A lot of Shakespeare stuff.

2969
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,560
All right, well, I guess, for now,

2970
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:55,040
you survived haunt cast the Fright,

2971
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:58,360
and when we push, I guess, confusingly,

2972
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:01,560
some of the graveyard, not even sure what's left.

2973
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,400
We'll find out next year.

2974
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,680
Into next year, yeah, but wow.

2975
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,160
This is the first single room

2976
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:12,160
that will have taken three calendar years to get out of.

2977
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:17,120
And you know what, the more we extend it, why not?

2978
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,080
Because I don't, you know,

2979
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,840
now it's become such a tradition that I really love,

2980
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,600
is that, you know, getting to post these,

2981
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,880
wondering what the world in America

2982
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,840
will be like a year from now.

2983
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,560
I hope we do so many more Haunted Mansion episodes

2984
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:35,280
that happen to come, you know, within 10 days

2985
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,560
of Donald Trump potentially being the president again.

2986
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:39,680
Because this guy is, you know,

2987
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,720
he's gonna live till he's 110,

2988
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,760
and they're gonna run him until he's 110,

2989
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,120
no matter what happens.

2990
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,640
So you think we have, like, our Haunted Mansion

2991
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,320
and Trump election season gonna meet

2992
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,440
at least three more times?

2993
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,200
It depends on us and it depends on him.

2994
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,480
It could be three, it could be seven.

2995
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,160
That's true, we don't know.

2996
02:00:58,160 --> 02:00:59,680
So it's all ahead of us.

2997
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:00,840
Everything's ahead of us.

2998
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:03,880
Dr. Doom is ahead of us in more trouble.

2999
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:05,200
Well, it's what I see now,

3000
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:08,640
and it's why I've taken this relaxed attitude.

3001
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,760
I'm so happy, I look forward to the future

3002
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:13,460
and to just chilling out and hanging out with you guys.

3003
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:15,400

3007

3008
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:31,000
in a relaxing, non-concerning,

3009
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,800
Old Scott returning, Old Scott returning.

3010
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,640
Oh no!

3011
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:36,800
The Ghost House Warrior returns to remind us

3012
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,040
of Hitchhiker Ghost, who we soon meet,

3013
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,800
Ezra Bean for Mr. Phineas Bluff,

3014
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,040
and gods, I'm finishing it!

3015
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:41,880
What funny names!

3016
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,720
All right, all right.

3017
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,560
In a series of various,

3018
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,380
I don't know, all of us,

3019
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:45,220
we have our two muggies,

3020
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,160
and we see a smuggler like Brian,

3021
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,320
who tells us to hurry back.

3022
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,200
It's finished, it's done, now you're mine.

3023
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,880
Okay, okay.

3024
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,160
Jim Lee drew X-Men.

3025
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:57,440
You're bleeding, I don't put up with names anymore.

3026
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,240
Frank Quietly, new X-Men.

3027
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,160
Time to bleed, fellows.

3028
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,000
Forever.

3029
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,520
