00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
a place for rock

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a place for roll hardly

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
a place where oakland raiders

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
merch is sold well not anymore

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a sublime hot topic

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and billabong

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
some of that maybe

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a smattering of that

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a place where you can purchase a candy thong

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
well thank god thank god for now

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
for now but who knows

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what can we trust

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what can we grip onto

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
what can we move into the future knowing

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
i guess nothing at all

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
there's the grim tone

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
in which we enter this episode of podcast

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the ride hello i'm scott garner joined by

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
mike carlson and jason sheridan

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
uncertainty abound

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the markets stock market

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and city walk both

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
everything is unstable the stock market

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the sock market all is unstable

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
very good point

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
oh no not

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the sock market well not yet but

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we don't know

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
major pieces

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
in the city walk hollywood line up

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
have been shattered

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
have been tossed aside as if it was

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
nothing

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
stuff happens all of a sudden too

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
there's no warning

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
this is what really is upsetting

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to us is the store can close without

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
warning half the stores can close

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
while we record

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
you'd get heads up

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
possibly

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
presumably if there was an earthquake

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you might get an alert

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
there's a little bit of a lead

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
new fires have been spotted

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but instead

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
like the biggest disasters

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in the city

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the closure of all of these stores

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in which we've never purchased anything

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the oakland raiders

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the oakland raiders store was just closed one day

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
people hundreds

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
thousands of people drove up to city walk

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to get their raiders merch

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
on a thursday afternoon

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
as they always do

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
thousands of people

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
well after the super bowl

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that they were not in

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
well well after the raiders

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
have played in los angeles

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
they were met with a closed door

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a closed helmet

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a shut helmet

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
sealed up forever

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't want to say

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
did we cause this

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I said we caused this

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've proclaimed that already

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the butterfly effect

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
like the ripples in a pond

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
when you drop a pebble

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you may not

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
see them for a while

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you record a podcast

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and then suddenly

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the raider image is gone

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
suddenly years later

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
years later the ripples take a while to get to the edge

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I would like to think though

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that we were more directly responsible

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
not just the butterfly effect is like

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
oh I take a drink of water now

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and then in ten years there's like

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
bulgaria goes to war or something

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that to me was with the butterfly effect

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to be directly responsible for something

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I want it to be like three steps removed

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we did a podcast about city walk

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
it should have been pretty one to one

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but what's the theory

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
of us causing it

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
what's your more like closely

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
tied together theory about us causing all

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of the city walk stuff

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I feel like we directly put it into the air

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the chapter of city walk

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that we all know is closed

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we literally closed the book on city walk

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that's what I think

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
so you think they looked around

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
people are responsible for city walk

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think it's a feeling

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think we put something in that you can't even describe necessarily with words

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
where they just like felt kind of a

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
gust and they went

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's done isn't it

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if you listen to all of our city walk

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
multiverse of madness saga

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we closed the book on that version

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
of city walk and now we are entering an unprecedented

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
new version of city walk

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I believe we are directly responsible

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
even though I just

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
asked for it to be a little more direct

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I was like no it was a gust

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you still say direct

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you're very particular

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
but Jason's was not direct enough mine is a little too

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
direct

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you're dialing the knobs of direct

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
as precisely as you can

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because I think what we did with the city walk saga

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
what happened there

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what we did

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and we did a lot

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it's going to take decades to parse

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
everything that we did

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
artistically

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
that we can discuss at length

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but in this case

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I just think it felt obsolete

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the current version of city walk felt obsolete

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
at that point

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and never until

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the year 2024

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
did any part of city walk feel remotely

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
obsolete

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
vibrant, current, now

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
very now

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
everywhere you look every sign that you see

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
every music track that you hear

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
could not scream more 2024

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's shocking development

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
putting in businesses

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and restaurants that people

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
actually enjoy and would like

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to patronize

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it's quite disturbing isn't it

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
hello kitty

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
cookies

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you say that and I'm like hasn't everything

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that's called the NBA thing

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
like been an instant failure

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it's pretty much a more

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
narrow lits though

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
if you want jerseys people want hats

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
lids is

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a big success I feel like but I think NBA

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in general seems like every time they open

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and locker room by lids

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think it was strange that Jason as proof of why people want to go to the NBA store

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
pointed at his Philly sweater

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
at my baseball sweater

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
people wear baseball stuff

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
people buy stuff

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with the NBA store I think it's really

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
generally with like the Disney Springs

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
thing it's tied to a bigger

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
idea that doesn't seem to work

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
probably just Jersey store

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
would work okay I mean I just hope

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that's what it is because if it's

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
anything other than that it's over thought

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
because what's it called is it called the

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
NBA store maybe

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
it better just be a store

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as soon as they add any sort of like experience

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to customize

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
your NBA fantasy that's where

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
everyone checks

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
out then there's

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it will failure

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
failure will come to it immediately

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
well there's a lot to

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to parse here and it's been a

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
tough time for sure

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you know all of us dealing with a

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
a crucial place

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
having been torn asunder

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and who knows what else will happen to it

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and it's in tough times like this that

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
all we can do is try to

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
do is to you know take solace in the

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
little things the little things like

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
directing Conan O'Brien's sketches for

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the Oscars I'm just

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
trying to see this as kind of

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a consolation prize

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in my life in a life that has not

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
gone the way that I have imagined

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that it would yeah you would

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
trade this experience though if

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you could just get Sparky's back

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
of course yeah of course are you

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
kidding it was just like

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
a job fine I

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
need to stay distracted I as much

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you know sure you can just you know

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you can mourn or you can try to be

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
busy and you could try to try to

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
move past it right now that's

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
over all I have is free time to

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to think about Sparky's yeah

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
yeah and to you know and and

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you know to worry about

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
luck and stone

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
or whatever the hell that is

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
something and luck

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think so I went in there the other day too

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
virtue and luck

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't think that's right

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
either I think I pulled that out of my ass

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
can I ask what you are talking

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
about there's a store at

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
City Walk now called like

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
virtue and luck but I don't I guess

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it's a store what does it have in it what do you think it is

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
it's like stones karma and luck

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
there you go you bought virtue

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and luck no problem I did and I was

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
right I was there literally a week ago it's a

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
store for stones I think they got like

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
not sector stones like crystals

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and like worry stones

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
lucky stones that's my guess again

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will never go in I

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
they have like big the candles

264
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
too and then they have

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
like things like ceramics

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that you can hang on the wall and I think everything costs

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
$200 I think everything is

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
very expensive these aren't

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
why are they there I don't know and it's still

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so many of these places don't seem like they're

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
designed to actually be

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to conduct business yeah

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
there's like jewelry I guess

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that's still there for right now

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so you can buy

276
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
onyx you

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can buy jade these are the different

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
gemstones you can purchase at the

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
karma and luck that's great pretty reliable

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the city for onyx precious

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't find anything stones and gems yeah

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
not enough onyx talk on our various sagas

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
but maybe

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that's I don't know

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I guess a problem

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
well you know

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the whole thing was about stones so when we

288
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
like whatever tortured expansion we

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
do with all of this stuff we'll have to we'll devote

290
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
a whole episode to every stone right

291
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
maybe you get your birthstones

292
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
up there I don't think so

293
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
like your own ring or brace no I don't think so

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
it sounds too much like something people might need

295
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
yeah it does seem like a thing

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you might buy as like a fun

297
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
souvenir on a vacation that's like a wisconsin dells

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
thing that's not a karma and luck thing

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
okay I can't tell

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the only vibe I get from karma and luck

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is that it is of use

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to no one I could

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
be wrong I guess I guess we'll have to poke our heads

304
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in there and see

305
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but no of course like

306
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
like you know here I am standing next to

307
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
actual oscar statuettes

308
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and all I can do is worry

309
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that something's going to happen to one of the stores

310
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that sells fake oscar

311
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
statuettes that say best aunt

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
every little thing reminded

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
me my heart was always being pulled

314
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
elsewhere you know it's what

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
made this a tough situation

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but a situation worth

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
talking about for a minute if

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
y'all don't mind

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what's that yes yes

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
of course yeah

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
no it's a little bit of old news

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
as you're hearing this and we'll touch

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
on this for a minute before we get to the real shit

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
but we

325
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
yeah you know

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
y'all went scott free

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
for a couple of episodes and I thank

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you for doing that because things

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
got really crazy for me because I

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
got this gig of a lifetime

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
which was directing Conan's sketches

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
for the 97th academy

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
awards this was

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so bonkers to get to do

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
just the thrill of a lifetime

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you all would see

337
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because of all this this has been going

338
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
on also on top of me I'm like I've been

339
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
finishing the movie yeah the movie

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that I've been working on since September

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
this also landed perfectly as we're like

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
wrapping picture on it and these things

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that I've committed to on the movie like all

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of course all of this at the same time

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
so the podcast we've basically

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
been just doing like one a

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
week like on a weekend

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I come in just with a flurry of like

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know I might be doing the Oscars I'm not sure

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we'll see I don't know

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and I feel like I

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
don't know I like would always dump a lot

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
of crazy stuff at you every

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
time I saw you guys I was

355
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
like sometimes you're like it's on it's maybe not on

356
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it's different it's on but it's not the same

357
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
it's different it was radically different

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
reports yeah every time

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and so I'm thrilled at this juncture

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to be able to say it came

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
together it worked out beautifully

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
just a little bit of like

363
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
backstory here and how

364
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
this came to be and thanks listeners by the way

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
for saying nice things via

366
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
via social media

367
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but basically

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
so I used to work at the

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
at the TBS Conan show

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and my main bread

371
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and butter there was directing

372
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
videos and you know

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
all the way from like little sketchier things

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
which is how you and I met Mike

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
as you're jumping onto a bed a

376
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
futon made of ramen

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and all the way up to big

378
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
crazy things like like you know

379
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
big stylized cold opens

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that were kind of

381
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
cinematic when he would have like entire

382
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
casts of a show

383
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
on the show like I got to do these cool

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
things that were putting Conan into the

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
world of Breaking Bad and Walking Dead

386
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and then I left the show

387
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and they would still bring me back

388
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to do these things like it was this market

389
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that I sort of cornered

390
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and was so honored to get to do

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you know like I Conan was

392
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
driving around in the real Batmobile

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
from Batman versus Superman

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and we put him in Sons of

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Anarchy and he was on a motorcycle

396
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and it was just this

397
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
awesome stretch of stuff

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that I got to do.

399
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If I can pay you a compliment you directed

400
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the Wes Anderson

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Star Wars? Oh yes yeah

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that always made me laugh so much

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
because he's such a distinctive

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
director with such like clear

405
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
tics in visual

406
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
styles and I always thought you really nailed

407
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that. Oh man oh thank you you know

408
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that also that was one of the first things I

409
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
got to do with the show I was

410
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
pretty new I didn't write it but I

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
was thrown in with I think that was a Dan Cronin

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and Todd Levin two great

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
guys who wrote for the show

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and yeah I

415
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that felt like a oh geez

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if I'm coming in with the hype of like this guy

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
directs I got to really nail that one

418
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and I love Wes Anderson and I got to make

419
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that look right feel right I also

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
got to act in that

421
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was very excited in that piece to get to do

422
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was like I'm going to try to do not

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
an Owen Wilson which everybody does

424
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but a Luke Wilson can I

425
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
pull off a Han Solo via Luke

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wilson and I don't I've never

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
seen that impression anywhere else I feel

428
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
like I did a decently subtle

429
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the

430
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
more thin slice of impression

431
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to get to do and then there was a there was

432
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
a part of that scenario because I got to be

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in it I was on a

434
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
a motorcycle side

435
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
car like an old timey motorcycle side car

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and the the driver

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
of the motorcycle proper

438
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
was Chewbacca and

439
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
when we're riding along the LA River

440
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and that's a moment I think about a lot

441
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in any like situation seems a little stressful

442
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or scary or outside the comfort zone I'm

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
like when I was there I was like if

444
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
you don't sit back relax and

445
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
enjoy that Chewbacca is taking you

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
for a motorcycle ride right now

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
then then you have no perspective

448
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you have to

449
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
enjoy this moment and I tried to

450
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
get there when this

451
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
came up this is like a wonderful return

452
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to Conan world so basically

453
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
like you know that's something that I got to do

454
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
for a while but then the TBS show

455
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
ended and I was doing other things

456
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and Conan has become this

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you know is leading this wonderful podcast

458
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
empire and you

459
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
know it all felt a little bit in the rear view for

460
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
me and

461
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because like a podcast empire does not necessarily

462
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
need big

463
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
stylized cinematic cold opens

464
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but then he gets announced as the

465
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
host of the Oscars and I thought wait a

466
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
minute I know something they might need

467
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
big stylized cinematic cold

468
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
opens so

469
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I figured let me let me send an email

470
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
what's the worst that can happen the worst that could happen is that

471
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
they ignore me the best that could happen is

472
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I direct the open of the Oscars

473
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and hey that proved to me

474
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
take your shot you know if you're

475
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
feeling like putting yourself out there it's

476
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
worth doing because they

477
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I sent an email they reciprocated right away

478
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
they said we were Scott we were already

479
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
thinking of you and that meant

480
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
a great deal to me and then it was

481
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
just kind of a holding pattern for a little bit I

482
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
was just kind of like hanging tight and waiting to

483
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
see what what they would come up

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
with or if they would come up with something and just

485
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
like weeks proceeding normally

486
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and then all of a sudden oh shit go go

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
go they're calling you the Academy

488
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
his colleague it was so why

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
like once it took off

490
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
it was a launch to put things in

491
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
in our terms and

492
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and then I was just like you know

493
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
thrown a bunch of possibilities of what could be

494
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the sketches and there were things that didn't end up getting

495
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
made and things that got scaled back a little

496
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
bit but eventually we landed

497
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
on like what what the things were

498
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and if you were watching the broadcast

499
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and you sort of clock some of

500
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
these things it ended up

501
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
being three little bits one was this little

502
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
thing in the monologue where Jeff Bezos

503
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
was delivered to the

504
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
red carpet via an Amazon

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
box

506
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
delivery guy like throwing it

507
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
kind of brusquely onto the red carpet

508
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and that was cool because I got to go to the red carpet

509
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like shooting on the red carpet was

510
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
super neat one was called

511
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Cinema Streams which is

512
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a thing we shot in a movie theater that was basically

513
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
like imagine a building

514
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
where you can stream movies

515
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
just like it was like about you know

516
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
tricking young people into thinking a movie theater

517
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
is a streaming service

518
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that was cool because we got to shoot at the Grove

519
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
closed down a theater at the Grove

520
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
yes yeah yeah no good like high

521
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
end theater to get to do something

522
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
in the site of Erin and I's first

523
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
date in fact she picked

524
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
up tour guide me

525
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
at the little city walk

526
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
cul-de-sac turnaround

527
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
she picked me up and we

528
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
went to go see Little Miss Sunshine

529
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
if that dates it and I think it does

530
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and that was the first date and then

531
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that is a great date

532
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
like that is a perfect

533
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
first date movie I went on

534
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
a first date once to see

535
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
into the wild

536
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
remember the

537
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
what is into the wild again that's the guy

538
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Sean Penn

539
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
did he direct

540
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that it's the guy

541
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
who goes off the grid and tries

542
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to like he's sick of the

543
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
modern world Kirsten's yeah

544
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
yeah

545
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
he like dies

546
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in the woods it was a

547
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
best-selling book but it was like an

548
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
intense movie the main thing

549
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I remember from it is the Eddie Vedder

550
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
theme song oh so I'm seeing

551
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
yes guaranteed

552
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Golden Globe winning song guaranteed

553
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
a depressing film though

554
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
ultimately an awkward thing for first date

555
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
pretty depressing yeah

556
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
didn't get everybody horned up

557
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
no

558
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
if you and me ended up in a bus going

559
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
across the country then we were

560
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
kept the temperature more comfortable

561
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
yeah you got to be careful

562
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
with those things yeah Little Miss Sunshine

563
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
a pleasant one I would say

564
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so anyway that was super

565
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
fun to get to do but

566
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the kind of the big one

567
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
ended up being this

568
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
sketch that put Conan into the substance

569
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
where

570
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
he basically ended up entering

571
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
the show

572
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
by rising up out of

573
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Demi Moore's back and

574
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
this was basically like

575
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
like bigger backstory

576
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to this there was another piece being talked about that was

577
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
more of a like Billy Crystal

578
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
style opening where

579
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
he you know where Conan was in a bunch

580
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
of movies albeit

581
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
with more of a kind of like clever

582
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
meta Conan twist

583
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and it

584
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
ended up being like it

585
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
didn't make sense for them to do because the opening

586
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
ended up being Cynthia

587
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Rivo and Ariana Grande singing songs from

588
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wicked so they didn't want to do like big

589
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
musical number and then you sit through a big video

590
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but as

591
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
part of doing that I was

592
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
watching all of the movies and

593
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
like getting excited about like figuring

594
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
out strategy for putting

595
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Conan into the movies and by the way

596
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
you guys know me we did

597
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
a whole episode about this stuff like

598
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I love the Billy Crystal Oscars

599
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think we're all fond of the Billy Crystal Oscars

600
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
so as this is coming together

601
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and I'm like holy shit this is one of these

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
things where the host is popping up in

603
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
the movies and he's like magically

604
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in a tuxedo, Hollywood

605
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
this felt just like so

606
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
like clean and classic of

607
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
a thing to get to do

608
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and I also

609
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and it gave me license to alright

610
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
for work what I need to do

611
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is research and study

612
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the Billy Crystal openings

613
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
which is like

614
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
these things had such a tremendous

615
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
influence on me when I was a middle

616
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
schooler whenever the hell he started doing

617
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
them and

618
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
it got me thinking about how you know

619
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you think of those and you maybe think about like oh yeah

620
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it's where he would get green screened into the movies

621
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and I think they did that somewhat

622
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but when I started watching them I was like

623
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the really good

624
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
shit is where they just they're doing

625
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
stuff practically where they've just recreated

626
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the world of it and he's actually interacting

627
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
you know he's running from the

628
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
English patient plane that Letterman is

629
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
piloting and stuff like the most

630
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
effective always are the ones where they just

631
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
kind of matched it and did it for real

632
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
so the substance was part

633
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
of the first one that was being talked about

634
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and that's the one I was salivating

635
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
over because like we can

636
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
do it for real this bathroom

637
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
set have you guys seen the movie by the way

638
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I haven't seen it yet

639
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I really enjoyed this ended up being

640
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
my favorite movie of the like

641
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
of the season

642
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
it's on Mubi

643
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
right now I was going to sign up for Mubi

644
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
an official Mubi film this is a Mubi

645
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't know I paid for it but I like

646
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think it's represented at least

647
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
as a Mubi film I want to try Mubi

648
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
for a little bit because they also have

649
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
on there the People's Joker

650
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
oh really that's where that ended up

651
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
a documentary I like

652
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I only learned about recently called Grand

653
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Theft Hamlet which is

654
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
a production of Hamlet

655
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
done in Grand Theft Auto

656
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
whoa really

657
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
because I think Grand

658
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Theft Auto

659
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is called RP or Grand

660
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Theft Auto Online I think there's

661
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
a lot more flexibility so you can

662
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
kind of do are they with like

663
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
custom dialogue

664
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
yeah like people are

665
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
into a gaming mic characters

666
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and car and so they are

667
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
trying to line up all the events of the game

668
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
to perfectly mirror no

669
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
no I think maybe this was

670
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a pandemic thing where someone's

671
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
like I think we can do like

672
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
people were collaborating

673
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
so all these movies I'm like

674
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
oh I kind of want to watch all of these

675
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I feel like every once

676
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
every four weeks or so you do

677
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
just a voluntary ad for a streaming

678
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
service this keeps happening

679
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you get so excited about like

680
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and their library is immense

681
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
well this one is like independent

682
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and international film

683
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I feel like Mubi is a little

684
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
more

685
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
it seems cool like

686
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
you like streaming services he gets

687
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
excited doesn't he especially if it's one that isn't

688
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like one of the primaries he likes good ones he likes

689
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
bad ones he likes to talk about

690
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Quibi he likes to talk about Mubi

691
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I just got an email today and Tubi has

your movie I haven't opened to any of these

710
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Tubi well it sounds like you're not as

711
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
committed to the Tubi relationship

712
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
as Jason is I'm not yeah you're

713
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000

back that's what love is yeah the love you

715
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
make is equal to the love you take

716
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you need to dedicate more

717
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
time to just endlessly streaming

718
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and then giving up and turning on the Bar Rescue

719
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Pluto channel sure

720
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm excited about

721
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Beetleby I don't know if you've heard about it but Beetleby

722
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
it's the new streaming service where you can get all the

723
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Beatles albums they pulled it from all the other

724
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
services oh wow so you know for

725
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the low low price of $14.99

726
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
a month you get all of the Beatles music

727
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know that's so far fetched from what will be

728
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
happening in 10 years yeah I think I just announced the

729
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
plan I think that's what it is going to be

730
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and it will somehow present this like

731
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
it's a major bargain

732
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
better actually those are pretty hard to

733
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
track down right yeah yeah no

734
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
extremely rare you don't really hear yeah

735
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
imagine the convenience of all of the Beatles in one

736
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
place you only have to pay every

737
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
month for the rest of your life my mother and

738
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I weren't going through her garage at

739
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the old house once and just found

740
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
half of all Beatles albums on vinyl

741
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
like all the later

742
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Beatles albums well that's vinyl

743
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but you know can you get it sounding

744
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
shitty on your phone yeah that's a whole other

745
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
thing pay for it

746
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
pay up it's just not that same if

747
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the vinyl's not mildewed for me

748
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
yes yeah it needs to have accrued years of gunk

749
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that the gunk makes it sound good

750
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but anyways

751
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I like basically this ended

752
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
up being so exciting because I

753
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
like as opposed to something

754
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that is entirely reliant on post effects

755
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
where you maybe

756
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you're like okay well we'll see if we can color

757
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
correct it right and insert it right and if his size

758
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
isn't weird and you know maybe we can make it look like

759
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
as opposed to that it was like oh something

760
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
like this we can like we'll leave set

761
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
knowing that it was fucking great

762
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
we're like physical toys to play

763
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
with so when I realized it was

764
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
things were lining up for it to become just the

765
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
substance like yes I am

766
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so ready for this loved

767
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the movie started analyzing

768
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
like pulling all the shots I cut together

769
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
a demo of clips

770
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
from the real movie and then just like badly

771
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
inserting just a still of Conan

772
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
rising up out of the body

773
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which you know like was quick

774
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and janky and I just cut it on my computer

775
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
but I sent it to everybody and that

776
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
gave everyone enough confidence that like oh

777
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
this could be really funny this might be the opener

778
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
so things start lining up that way

779
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
like oh this could be the entrance to

780
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the show so we really got to nail this thing

781
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I felt motivated in the best way

782
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we had to figure out how to do it

783
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and thanks to the fine people at Mubi

784
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
who on their YouTube channel

785
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
posted an excellent making of

786
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the substance we were able to just go right

787
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
to the source and go how did they do it

788
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and we ended up building two

789
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
little sets one was just regular and on

790
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the ground for Conan to stand in and do his stuff to

791
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the mirror the other one we built

792
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
up like just a two wall set

793
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
up on a platform

794
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
four feet off the ground because that's how they

795
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
did it in the real movie where like

796
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
in the actual transformation

797
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
sequence where

798
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it ends up being like an elbow comes out

799
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
it's a lot more disturbing in the real

800
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
film a lot gooey or a lot grosser

801
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we did like the PG-13 version of it

802
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but

803
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
they just had a bunch of people down there

804
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
like pumping their fists and do

805
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
like making weird things

806
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
puff up under this

807
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
this complicated back

808
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
prosthetic basically it was like a muppet

809
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
set that's when I got really excited I was like oh

810
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
this is how they do it they got to build all

811
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
of these high up sets

812
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so puppeteers can be relatively

813
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
comfortable underneath so now

814
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm like oh my god it's toys we get to build

815
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
a set we got to cut a hole in the

816
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
ground and then place a

817
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
demi prosthetic which was done

818
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
you know at some little shop in Burbank

819
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that does prosthetics

820
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
for Star Trek and all these great

821
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
things like you know so suddenly

822
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
there's a woman of demi's

823
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
proportions getting into a

824
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
plaster cast and I went to go visit

825
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and like oh god this looks incredible

826
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
this is going to be so fun

827
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
great production designer Dylan Hutchins

828
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
figured out how all this would work he really knocked it

829
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
out of the park so anyway a lot

830
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
of confidence going into the day

831
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
because we got like you know it's

832
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
going to look so great out of the gate

833
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
like very achievable and not a ton

834
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to shoot so we can just like take our time

835
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and play but then here's what happens

836
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
what we show

837
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
up to set with here was the here

838
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
was the plan Conan will be

839
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
birthed out of demi he will climb

840
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
up out of her then he will have left

841
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
something in demi's body he

842
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
will have you know is maybe

843
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
going to be a soda or a flask

844
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
or a watch or something nobody

845
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
could really land on the right item

846
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so it's like well we'll just have a bunch of things

847
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and we'll film a bunch of things and that's how

848
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
it'll go then Conan

849
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
shows up on set I

850
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
show him around I show him here's everything that we have

851
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
to work with and we're thinking it'll be

852
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
like this and then we'll pop over there and should be fun

853
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and I see his gears start

854
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
to turn he's like he gets a little

855
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
serious and he starts thinking and then

856
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
he goes away and then I'm summoned up

857
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to his dressing room five minutes later

858
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
where he has come up with entire

859
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
new plan new plan is

860
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I left my shoe in there

861
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I have to go all the way back into demi

862
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
to get my lost shoe

863
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and I'm like okay oh that's great so then you're

864
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
reaching way down it's like you know it's like a magical

865
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
thing how far you're able to get and he's like

866
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
yeah yeah but like I mean

867
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm going all the way in

868
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I want to dive head first

869
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and for my entire body

870
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
to disappear into demi

871
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
more and

872
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think for a second

873
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
my initial thought to that is not it's not

874
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
no it's like of course we're going to figure that out

875
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but I just get a little look of concern on my

876
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
face mainly because I know that we

877
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
built the whole setup for maybe

878
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
his shoulders to get through

879
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
like possibly you know we literally

880
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
just cut a hole

881
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
with really precise measurements

882
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and if we didn't do it exactly right like the whole thing

883
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
might cave in so I just kind of

884
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
furrow my brow and Conan takes

885
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that as me saying no or something and he's

886
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
like Gardner relax you got

887
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to cool down I'll be fine I'm a

888
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
rubber band man you'll see it's going

889
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
to be great like

890
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and I go no no no I am not saying no

891
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I just have to go talk to three people to make

892
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
sure and like come on cool and he's like

893
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
slapping me on the arm I'm like I can't let

894
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the boss down I gotta

895
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it was also very nice

896
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
after all this time I haven't I have not like

897
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
worked with Conan since

898
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I did the calculation it was 2017

899
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
the week that we first

900
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
recorded podcast the run

901
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
when we went down to comic con

902
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and did those bits

903
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
so it's been the entire

904
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
length of the show since I actually

905
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
got to collaborate with this man

906
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and it was like no time had passed

907
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
he's slapping me on the arm

908
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
he's calling me Gardner the desert rat

909
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
which is a world war two reference that I

910
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you know still have not taken the time to understand

911
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but that's what he called I'm the desert rat over there

912
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
so anyways

913
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we get this cooking

914
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we get to that moment

915
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
alright here we go I'm going to do the dive

916
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
we're only doing one take and he

917
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
starts and I'm like I don't know where this is

918
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
going to go I don't know if he's going to get

919
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
stuck he's got like stage

920
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
hands helping him down there I don't

921
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
like we did not build it wide enough

922
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
for this gag and I'm like

923
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
as long as we get some piece it should be good

924
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
instead we watch and we watch

925
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and he goes all the way

926
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
down he slides all the way

927
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
perfectly into that thing

928
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
this is a slender man this is a guy

929
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in very good shape

930
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
61 he's like I should never

931
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
have doubted it he was he just like

932
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
perfectly burrowed in there

933
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it was astounding to watch

934
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and you know

935
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
A is a physical feat I feel

936
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
like I watched a little like Olympic act

937
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
come into the room

941
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
see through the matrix like something

942
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that nobody else saw that is actually

943
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the funny thing about

944
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000

945
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000

questions and like

949
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
the spirit of it watching the genius

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
at work it was so inspiring

951
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000

952
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
he's been my hero since high school he's even more

953
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000

954
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000

963
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
yeah it was just I'm so blown away

964
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
one of the best things about

965
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Conan is man of a million ideas

966
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and if the funniest idea

967
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
involves him putting his body

968
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
on the line you will do it

969
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
yes absolutely well and it also

970
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I went like oh and this

971
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
is the guy who's been like he stayed

972
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
in prime shape with this travel

973
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
show with Conan O'Brien must go

974
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
like you know where he's performing

975
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
physical feats every episode he

976
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
has yeah he does like it is comedy

977
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
first safety second for sure

978
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I also got to watch him act out like

979
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what would happen if he

980
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
got down there slipped weird

981
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
broke his neck and then I watched him act out

982
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
an entire here's what the Oscars would

983
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
be like if I had to do it with a broken neck

984
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
which is just perfectly

985
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
spun out of his brain with no

986
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
effort whatsoever

987
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
he's insane it was wonderful

988
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it was just you know great great to get

989
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
to be part of it a surreal memory

990
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
came to me as we're talking about all this is

991
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I remember being out

992
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
here for college going to universal

993
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hollywood for the very

994
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
first time where we are minutes

995
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
away from for the first time

996
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and then coming

997
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
leaving and then

998
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
immediately getting back to

999
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
our apartment and turning on

1000
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
the Conan O'Brien hosted

1001
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Emmys oh really

1002
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
those were like killer

1003
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
yes yeah 2006

1004
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
oh another great I mean I watched that piece

1005
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
too that had a fantastic cold open where

1006
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
again it's like host in tux and

1007
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
he's stuck in lost and he's stuck in the

1008
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
office yeah also all done

1009
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
practically like he just went and did

1010
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
it came to he like smashed down from

1011
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the ceiling onto

1012
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Dwight's desk or whatever it was

1013
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
yeah yeah of course I mean like the pedigree

1014
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
has always been so high for

1015
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
all of these things and I just I just wanted to

1016
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
to follow in the footsteps and make it make

1017
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it cool and it was it was really fun to get

1018
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
to do

1019
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the other crazy thing about it

1020
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you guys know

1021
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
listeners may know if anybody

1022
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
has ever clocked that I am a

1023
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
huge unabashed fan of the Billy

1024
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Crystal Oscars you might know this

1025
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
from an episode that we did a few years ago

1026
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that was like collecting all of this

1027
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
kitschy Oscar nonsense

1028
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and talking about all

1029
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this insanity the Rob Lowe Snow White thing

1030
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and that was that was

1031
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
an episode with guest Ryan

1032
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Perez our good friend

1033
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
a guy who we're all very

1034
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
fond of and when

1035
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you know so the substance part

1036
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
was that was like a pre tape that was done with like a week

1037
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
to go before the show a few days

1038
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
before the show there was one little piece that we

1039
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
had to add to it which is just like it was

1040
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
supposed to feel like it was on the live broadcast

1041
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
with the stage manager

1042
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
going back and knocking on the door and saying Conan

1043
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
we're ready for you when I realized

1044
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
okay wait this is a thing

1045
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
we have to film it at the Oscars

1046
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it's got to be a guy

1047
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
who seems like a plausible

1048
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
real guy who's not going to be like

1049
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you know doing some goofy side

1050
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
bit we need like a great character

1051
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
actor who sells this

1052
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
part I was like

1053
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
there's only one man for this job

1054
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
must be Ryan Perez and you know

1055
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
if you heard that episode I mean like

1056
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we've watched the Oscars together forever

1057
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you know like the epitome

1058
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of a cinephile to me. Yeah Mr. Movies

1059
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes. Yes. And this

1060
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
year the Oscars were kicked off

1061
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
by Mr. Movies. I know. Him so

1062
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and as I was feeling this all come together

1063
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and it did successfully land as

1064
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
the opening of the show I was like oh my god

1065
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
are the Oscars going to go

1066
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
from Ariana Grande and Cynthia

1067
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Areva is it going to go from the wicked

1068
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
note from the

1069
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
defiant gravity note to

1070
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
our friend Ryan Perez and indeed

1071
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that is how it played out I am so

1072
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
proud I've never been prouder of anything in my

1073
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
life it was like

1074
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
amazing to get to put together

1075
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and to be like running around the Dolby

1076
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
with him with like our holding

1077
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
room to wait for that bit was

1078
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the theater they were like here you guys wait

1079
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
here open door we're both

1080
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
in the Dolby theater for the first time

1081
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ever like we've been watching this show

1082
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
our whole lives and now we're in the room

1083
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
we're watching a fake Emma Stone

1084
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
hand a fake award to

1085
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
what's her name from Amelia Perez

1086
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
like a rehearsal only

1087
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
award. That's another cool thing about

1088
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
being around there is that you get to see this like

1089
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
it almost feels like a weird like fake wrong

1090
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
AI Oscars

1091
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
where like all the details

1092
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
are like okay all the right

1093
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
things are happening but it's all the wrong people

1094
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
like their faces aren't right

1095
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and it feels like they all have seven fingers

1096
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
just watching the demo

1097
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oscars was cool as hell

1098
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
there was a musical

1099
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
number on it that was kind of

1100
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
derided a little bit there was like a James Bond

1101
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
song

1102
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
medley and I caught in reviews

1103
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
later and you know just people analyzing

1104
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
it like why was there that that was kind of

1105
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
a weird you got Doja Cat doing

1106
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
diamonds or forever what is that that's

1107
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
what all the reviewers thought I got to watch that being

1108
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
rehearsed and I'm watching it from the fifth

1109
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
row in the theater and I'm almost

1110
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
in tears I'm like the majesty

1111
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the magic of

1112
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
oh my god skyfall

1113
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
somebody came down from the ceiling and then somebody

1114
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
else went back up like I was like

1115
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
this is I almost wanted to tell people there's this James

1116
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Bond thing you are not going to believe so

1117
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I guess I was like I thought that was cool

1118
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
oh great well

1119
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
so did I

1120
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you would have lost your mind in person

1121
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
sometimes it is just I've heard people say this

1122
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
about musicals that you just get wrapped up

1123
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
at like the power of people singing

1124
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
no matter what it is

1125
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and that's kind of how I felt

1126
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
so like yeah

1127
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I did want to ask because one

1128
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
of the big viral

1129
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
things of Domine's this year

1130
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of like oh my god

1131
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
look at this goofy French bullshit

1132
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
was that clip from Amelia Perez

1133
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
where they're singing from penis

1134
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
to vagina

1135
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
did anyone pitch from

1136
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
nominee to winner

1137
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
oh geez

1138
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that would have been a good way to do it

1139
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
there was definitely

1140
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
discussion of like

1141
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
can you do an Amelia Perez beat

1142
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
of a thing like this

1143
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you don't want the most annoying people

1144
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
to like latch on

1145
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Conan's Amelia Perez joke

1146
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
was killer

1147
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
about to like

1148
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
a few less f-words than

1149
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
uh

1150
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Casone's PR

1151
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
about the publicist

1152
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
yes yeah yeah no no agreed

1153
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
all the jokes were killer

1154
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
it was cool to see the videos

1155
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
have like joke run off

1156
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and knowing like oh my god Demi Moore watched

1157
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
this she was in the front row

1158
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and she watched this occur

1159
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I think she lost best actress

1160
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
sorry Demi

1161
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I loved it I have a big fan

1162
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I loved substance and I also

1163
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
very cool that I cut this little video

1164
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
from cutting the little video on my phone

1165
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to less than a month later

1166
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
director of the substance

1167
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Cora Lee Farja

1168
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
is posting about I had a little back and forth

1169
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
with her on Instagram

1170
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
she really liked it and was posting about it

1171
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
cool as hell

1172
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this is I just I'm coming to you

1173
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
with Hollywood Magic

1174
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Hollywood Magic is real

1175
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm feeling it it's coursing through my veins

1176
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
here I'll sing

1177
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll sing the Defying Gravity now

1178
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that wasn't bad

1179
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that actually wasn't bad see

1180
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Hollywood Magic is real yeah

1181
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
well congrats on doing it

1182
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean Conan we all love

1183
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Conan and I love the podcast and stuff

1184
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
but it was good Conan should be on TV

1185
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
doing stuff and I'm glad you were

1186
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
part of that too

1187
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
there was a lot of comfort in it

1188
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I feel like if it had been like

1189
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
you were doing stuff for the Oscars but it's all people

1190
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you've never met before there would have been a little

1191
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
scariness to that

1192
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but being like it almost

1193
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
what over rode

1194
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
that was oh my god

1195
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the Conan TBS show is back and in this

1196
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
bigger better way because that show it ended

1197
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
really quietly in this weird pandemic way

1198
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and everybody felt that way even the people who were on

1199
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
staff back then were like it

1200
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
felt like it never had like a

1201
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
big finale and then they

1202
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
all got to do the Oscars together and I

1203
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
got invited to the party too it's a

1204
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
really special group of people all those

1205
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
writers are fantastic and everybody

1206
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
wrote that Jesse Gaskell

1207
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and Laurie Kilmartin and Mike Sweeney

1208
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
the greatest the greatest ever

1209
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
the head writer who brought me on years ago

1210
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
it was

1211
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
yeah yeah I know and that

1212
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
was and with the substance thing just like

1213
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you know less than it being like

1214
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
it's about this year's movies

1215
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
or that less than trying to do something

1216
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
edgy or whatever it was like oh

1217
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it's like big physical silliness

1218
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
for Conan O'Brien to start the show with

1219
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I just I felt like

1220
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I felt the

1221
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
baton getting passed to me of an important

1222
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
thing and something that matters to me

1223
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
just setting up a cool stage for

1224
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Conan O'Brien to be goofy on

1225
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
yeah doesn't it feel good

1226
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
it just feels good as a fan

1227
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
or whatever it is

1228
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I mean TV isn't real anymore I guess

1229
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
in general so I really shouldn't like say oh he used to be on TV

1230
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because what does TV mean really

1231
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
for his YouTube but

1232
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
him in front of a bunch of people

1233
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
being goofy is really what I'm talking about I think

1234
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
yes I mean a big musical number

1235
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and like yeah yeah yeah

1236
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the sand worm

1237
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the Scott Kronick

1238
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
the Scott Kronick his incredible

1239
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
wardrobe person one of the best one of the

1240
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
coolest bits I ever got to do that show there was

1241
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
a thing they used to do called NCAA

1242
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
mascots who shouldn't dunk

1243
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
oh yeah they would build these really complicated

1244
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
horrendous costumes

1245
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that would be like an Olive Garden never ending

1246
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
pasta bowl or something send people

1247
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
up to dunk they said the costumes

1248
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
go flying spectacularly make

1249
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
a huge mess so seeing the

1250
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
dune sand worm clearly made

1251
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
by those same skilled hands

1252
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
who were also who's also the same guy

1253
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
making Conan look sharp

1254
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
like picking great tuxes for him

1255
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
yeah yeah yeah

1256
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
it's all ends with that job

1257
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
just a great

1258
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
really good detailed sand worm costume

1259
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
and then he's just doing this stupid stuff

1260
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
imaginable on stage

1261
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
yeah yeah yeah oh it's I mean

1262
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that's what you want out of him

1263
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the guy who had a guy who had to

1264
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I didn't realize at the time how much I was

1265
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
torturing doing things

1266
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
like please make a Princess Jasmine

1267
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
costume for Nick Mundy to wear

1268
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I threw incredible

1269
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
curve balls that guy's way

1270
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and I don't know boy

1271
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I missed I missed this crew just incredible

1272
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to get to do something with them again

1273
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
so thanks for letting me nerd out about all that

1274
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I also I'm very happy with how it all

1275
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
turned out I'm feeling great

1276
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
about everything and all the support I've gotten

1277
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
about it it does scare me a little bit though

1278
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
because there

1279
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
was another guy who achieved his

1280
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Oscar dreams and

1281
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
shortly thereafter

1282
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
some stuff went down and the equalizer

1283
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
himself Denzel Washington

1284
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
was telling him at your highest moment be careful

1285
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
because that's when the devil comes for you

1286
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that's when the devil comes for you

1287
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you know what I didn't even need to finish the sentence

1288
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and we isn't that fun

1289
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
you and Mike

1290
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and me and Brian Perez and others

1291
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
watched that moment live

1292
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
oh yes all together

1293
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
in my backyard

1294
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and

1295
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and I was it just

1296
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
2024 we did the Billy

1297
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Crystal segments

1298
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that was 2023

1299
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
that episode yeah I think it was 2023

1300
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
okay yeah so then from

1301
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
2023 to 2025 then

1302
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000

Perez opening the Oscars

1304
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
oh jeez yeah I mean isn't that crazy

1305
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
yeah yeah I say as part of a little

1306
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
backyard Oscar gay who who would

1307
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
have known from the Burbank backyard

1308
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Oscar gang to the real deal

1309
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and now I'm just nervous about

1310
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
what does that mean for me what I

1311
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
do I now I am worried the devil is going to come

1312
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
for me well I well it's just

1313
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
this closures at CityWalk is that kind of part

1314
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of it well yes I'm worried

1315
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that it could be that I'm also I

1316
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm worried that you know also

1317
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
in the near future that the devil coming for me

1318
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
is that episode that we got to do about

1319
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
puppets oh yeah well

1320
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the club three at patreon.com

1321
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that might be it yeah I'm

1322
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
worried that the devil is goes by

1323
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
a different name which is knucklehead Smith

1324
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
no he's a silly guy

1325
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
can I trust him am I worried

1326
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
no you can trust him he's fine

1327
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
you can trust him just don't count on it

1328
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
well that's a good piece of advice

1329
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
well there's a lot to learn there

1330
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
but yes indeed from Hollywood's

1331
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
biggest night to

1332
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hollywood's biggest plight

1333
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
which is of course the ongoing

1334
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
destruction of the place that we

1335
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
hold so dear

1336
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
so I think you know

1337
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
we kind of talked at the

1338
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
beginning with some

1339
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
assumption that people know what's going on

1340
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
but in case you don't

1341
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
there have been

1342
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
sorry it just made me laugh

1343
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
like all of that build up and then really what I'm

1344
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
about to say is some stores closed at a

1345
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
mall a mall

1346
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
which has been a long running subject

1347
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
on the show and the kind

1348
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
of cruddiness of it has been a long

1349
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
running subject on the show okay wait but

1350
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
like kayfabe right kayfabe

1351
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
we are beloved

1352
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
lands have been slaughtered and

1353
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
taken for their natural resources

1354
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
it draws us there

1355
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
yes I never craved

1356
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
sparky's donuts before but now that I

1357
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
cannot have them

1358
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
yes you craved a myriad of better

1359
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
donuts but now that you know that it's not

1360
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
an option now I need to go to the second

1361
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
donut location it's anyone

1362
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
which

1363
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't know if you want to do that look

1364
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
voodoo's a tough one voodoo we have never spoken

1365
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
too highly of voodoo

1366
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
yeah look if you've

1367
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
been with the show forever or if

1368
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
you haven't you've gone backwards

1369
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and caught up on on the city walk

1370
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
saga we have placed

1371
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
an odd amount of emphasis on these weird

1372
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
stores these weird names

1373
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
with on popcornopolis

1374
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
on the crepe cafe

1375
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
on sparky's and

1376
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
due to us doing this and kind of

1377
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
putting a spotlight on these places and

1378
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
underlining them I have

1379
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
a kind of unreasonable amount of

1380
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you know just

1381
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
just affection yeah for

1382
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
these places and

1383
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
over the course of I would

1384
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
let's keep it a really rough time period I would

1385
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
say like the last nine months

1386
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
there have been a ton of

1387
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
sudden closures of a lot of these places

1388
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
yeah sometimes for them to be replaced

1389
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
by a newer and better

1390
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
sounding retail

1391
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
location sometimes

1392
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
just for nothing and in

1393
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
fact if you go up to

1394
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
city walk right now as you're listening

1395
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
to this you will find a lot

1396
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
of dead space I would say that right now

1397
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
for maybe the first time

1398
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
ever we've had our complaints about

1399
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
city walk there's things that we've laughed at

1400
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
city walk for but one thing

1401
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
it has never felt like is a dead

1402
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
mall right now there are finally

1403
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
stretches of it I went

1404
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and walked it the other day there really are

1405
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
places that feel fully

1406
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
dead yeah it's a bit disturbing

1407
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and this is the episode to

1408
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
parse that yeah there's a lot

1409
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
going on there's a lot of feelings

1410
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you know there when you talk about

1411
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
dead space at city walk

1412
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
previously the only dead space

1413
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
you would say was

1414
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
vertical perhaps when we talk

1415
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
about where wizards was the

1416
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
three story wizard themed

1417
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
restaurant and bar well the

1418
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
entire that yes there was the

1419
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the multi-room magic

1420
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
oriented

1421
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
bar and restaurant and then I think

1422
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
some of that space became various

1423
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
other weird bars

1424
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
John Lovitz comedy club and

1425
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
BB King and weird other nightclubs

1426
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that all has been nothing

1427
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
either somewhere between nothing

1428
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and sheriff substation

1429
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
for many years so that

1430
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
all has been the idea of like

1431
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and then up in the loft you can dance the night away

1432
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that's been gone for a long time

1433
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
it's also

1434
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I guess it's not new that it's

1435
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
kind of dead in an area that you can just

1436
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
walk anyone up there can walk

1437
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
which is the

1438
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
unused top level of both

1439
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
margaritaville and

1440
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
buka D

1441
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Jason

1442
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Peppo

1443
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
is that

1444
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
for real are you giving the fans what they want

1445
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm not I'm not I fucking

1446
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
broke on it I got confused

1447
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I started doing the same

1448
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
battle you know what I you know

1449
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Conan I would be

1450
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
upset if you didn't say Peppo

1451
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
as good as he ever have decades later

1452
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
as good as he ever has decades later

1453
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
some things never change

1454
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and that's how I feel about this I hope you never

1455
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I hope you never get it

1456
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I won't and

1457
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
once they sat down

1458
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and ordered the full

1459
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
like appetizer salad

1460
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
entree dessert I'm like well

1461
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
now I'm really not committing this

1462
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
cause this sucks

1463
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
like this food

1464
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
oh wait so you're saying when you finally ate it

1465
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
so he's saying that because the food was bad he doesn't feel

1466
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
he owes it to you learning the name

1467
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
he's gonna stick it to buka da beppo

1468
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
by saying peppo I had eaten a lunch special

1469
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
in the bar before but

1470
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
doing the full yeah

1471
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
it was fine wait a second Jason

1472
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Jason not to reopen this whole thing

1473
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
but your defense for a long time

1474
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
has been I've never been

1475
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
in there that's why I don't know the name

1476
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
now you're telling us about this lunch special

1477
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
yeah when did this come out

1478
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
hold on I'm talking 2018

1479
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
city walk one

1480
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I went up there

1481
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I ate in the bar

1482
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I ate in the bar

1483
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I did I had just it was a sandwich

1484
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and fries and an iced tea

1485
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the polar opposite of like

1486
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
the family style

1487
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
buka experience

1488
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
has always been that you've never

1489
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
you haven't done it right am I crazy

1490
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
or

1491
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm trying to remember

1492
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I'm trying to remember cause Abercrombie

1493
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Fitch I believe you said

1494
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
you called it Finch cause you've never been in there

1495
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
but was there a buka da beppo

1496
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
also that you said you hadn't been

1497
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
yeah the defense for a long time

1498
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
has been I never go over there

1499
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
now I'm hearing about this 2018

1500
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
meal and is your defense that because

1501
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
you only had a small reasonable lunch

1502
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
which sounds like all the components of a lunch

1503
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that because of that

1504
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
that you it makes sense that you wouldn't know

1505
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
the name well now I'm

1506
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
saying that lunch was okay I

1507
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
was just a bumbling fool and then after

1508
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I had the full like experience

1509
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
which was recently

1510
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
which yeah

1511
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
2024

1512
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
which of course

1513
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
involves sitting in a booth with a couple

1514
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
people and ordering different menu items

1515
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
while a

1516
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
pretty sizable

1517
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
prayer group is celebrating

1518
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the self publishing

1519
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
of some Christian book next

1520
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to you and they are praying

1521
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
a lot

1522
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
were they in the room were they in the pope room

1523
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
yeah they were in the tiny room I don't think we were in the

1524
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
pope room well you would have known if they

1525
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
were in the pope room if you're a religious group

1526
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
going to celebrate a religious book at

1527
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
city walk buka da beppo why don't

1528
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
you go to the you wouldn't ask for the pope room

1529
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
maybe they didn't know

1530
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
or they got confused

1531
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
about B's and P's and they called it the boap room

1532
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
depends

1533
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
plenty of flavors

1534
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
of evangelicals are like

1535
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Catholics aren't questioned

1536
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that's not real

1537
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
necessarily could have been people that didn't want to believe in the pope

1538
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
so they would have been

1539
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
that would have been a disgrace

1540
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
do you think anybody just speaking of Oscar movies

1541
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
did any groups go to see conclave

1542
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
at the city walk KMC

1543
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and then follow it up

1544
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
like at the pope table

1545
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
perhaps yeah I think that's a very strong

1546
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
possibility imagined all of the different popes

1547
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
that it could have been hey no spoilers

1548
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
but you know like

1549
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
you know your Lithgows

1550
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that'd be a fun exercise I think to go to the

1551
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
pope table and imagine John Lithgow's head in there

1552
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
oh they should change that that's what Disney

1553
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
would do if it was on property at Disney

1554
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
because they want everything to be like IP

1555
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
yeah they're arguing over where they were going to eat

1556
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
afterwards mirrored the tense

1557
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
cardinals retreats

1558
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
no I want to go to two some chocolate

1559
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
bread no I want to go to the pope room

1560
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we will take another

1561
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
vote alright send out the

1562
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
smoke signal we have

1563
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
we have landed on just going to the food

1564
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
courts and going to different places

1565
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
some of these places would have been improved

1566
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
by vaping cardinal

1567
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
the smell would have been improved by the

1568
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
presence of vaping

1569
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
cardinal well we're going to have

1570
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
to look into this I this meal is

1571
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
surprising to hear that you had a meal

1572
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
before this but I don't know maybe I'm

1573
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
misremembering I just feel like the argument

1574
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
has always been I've never really

1575
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
been there and I

1576
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I've never really been there doing the

1577
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
family style last year I did the

1578
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
family style but the family style is

1579
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
what's crucial to you knowing whether it's Beppo

1580
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
or Peppo well I just never thought

1581
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
about it I like though I like

1582
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the argument though that you've never

1583
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
really been there been

1584
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
the way you've ordered a big enough meal

1585
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that's

1586
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
even though you've eaten in the restaurant

1587
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I always thought well I

1588
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
hadn't done the song and dance and

1589
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I don't really think about this place

1590
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that much maybe

1591
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
then when I did the full book experience

1592
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I was like this is not deserving

1593
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the respect of me remembering

1594
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
this

1595
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
well some listener is going to go through

1596
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
it feels like there might be a bit

1597
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
of retconning happening but if a listener

1598
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
tells me again it's I'm remembering

1599
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Abercrombie and Fitch situation was

1600
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that you said you'd never been to the store so

1601
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
maybe that's what I'm thinking of I could be wrong

1602
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
the smells make my eyes water

1603
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
make me feel nauseous

1604
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
from the shirtless hunk that

1605
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
would stand in the doorway sure

1606
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
gets flashed by that

1607
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
universal city

1608
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
wind blowing the dancing

1609
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
fountains that's something you and I agree on is

1610
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that wind up there so hang on wait a minute

1611
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
the wind is not at the fountains

1612
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the wind is not at the fountains

1613
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
it's more at city food there's no

1614
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
way for it to get but it did it now did

1615
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I go up to that top level the other

1616
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
day and like try

1617
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
to put myself in your shoes and imagine

1618
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
this brisk this hurricane

1619
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
that occurs only on the city food

1620
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
level did you try getting lately

1621
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
thing oh I've been up there a couple

1622
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
times lately everyone's timelines are all

1623
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
not matched when we were doing city

1624
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
walk saga last year it was windy

1625
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
up there it was very windy up there

1626
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
look I go I go often now

1627
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
when when my wife says

1628
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
you want to take our daughter

1629
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to the park I say can I take her to city walk

1630
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
instead park stresses me out too

1631
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
much park stresses you

1632
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
out park is great

1633
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
city of bourbon I love park there's so many

1634
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
parks there's so many parks

1635
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
in bourbon I love the idea of park

1636
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
but every time I go to a park a

1637
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
bossy seven year old takes

1638
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
over parenting

1639
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
from me just body

1640
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
slams you yeah it's often

1641
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
rude to me takes my

1642
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
toddler and just

1643
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
tries to get her to do everything a seven

1644
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
year old should do but not a two and a half

1645
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
year old this this has happened

1646
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
to us for sure you're not describing an unfamiliar

1647
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and I always want to like

1648
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
just cut and run when a bossy kid

1649
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
shows up almost every time

1650
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to me uh-huh it's so like

1651
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
when we get there and there's no one on the park I go

1652
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
oh thank god we

1653
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
we do that too my son would certainly prefer

1654
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
no one at the park but you just move to a different

1655
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
area of the park maybe you gotta stand

1656
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
your ground you can't only

1657
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I don't know like

1658
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
your daughter deserves a chance she

1659
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
you have to take her places that aren't city walk or

1660
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
she's gonna end up like I hate to say it

1661
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
well look like us like

1662
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
all of us let's make it us

1663
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
there's so much fun to be had though

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
a novelty SNL character

1676
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
cereal box that she can pick up and then

1677
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
quickly put down yeah she likes to

1678
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
learn who Gilly is she likes

1679
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000

the dinosaur the Jurassic Park dinosaur

1681
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
on the wall

1682
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
she likes seeing the dragon

1683
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
she likes seeing there's a lot of fun stuff

1684
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
look I take my son up there too I'm

1685
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
just saying this is not a replacement for park

1686
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
well the second replacement for park

1687
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
is there's some play areas

1688
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
in the Burbank mall that

1689
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
are not always so populated if you go at the right time

1690
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
there's that little section of like

1691
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
hill kind of like this weird like

1692
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
it almost looks like an art installation

1693
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
it's weird little plastic

1694
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
rainbow hills

1695
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
at the entrance near the

1696
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
cost plus right and she loves that

1697
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
yes we've spent a good hour there

1698
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that's fun and there's not a ton of kids there

1699
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and there's more and more arcades

1700
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
every six months

1701
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
round one is

1702
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
expanding there's a weird

1703
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
AI advertised

1704
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
candy land

1705
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
yes and I don't think that's the only location of this

1706
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
candy land new kid play

1707
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
area

1708
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
soon I mean soon we should do an episode on the

1709
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Chuck E Cheese style like Billy

1710
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
B's that's around here

1711
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
there's various chains with various

1712
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
B characters that we could discuss

1713
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
yes yeah B family characters

1714
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
well unless look is that a harbor hoedown thing

1715
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
oh perhaps it is

1716
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
perhaps Billy B's

1717
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
people are willing to wait for Billy B's

1718
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
perhaps it is harbor hoedown also an interesting

1719
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
thing to say in this in this state

1720
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
because I look this

1721
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
is a weird if you if you put on this

1722
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
episode with a title presumably related

1723
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
to city walk

1724
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
you might be wondering well does that

1725
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
mean we're gonna get an appearance from

1726
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
an old pal yeah but

1727
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
we said goodbye to our old pal

1728
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
no yes I mean there's no way

1729
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
even how would we contact

1730
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
our old pal we don't our old pal

1731
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and by which we mean the sector keeper

1732
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and you know just like I

1733
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
don't want to spoil the end of conclave

1734
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I also don't want to spoil the end of the city walk

1735
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Orlando saga

1736
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
but let's just say it's you know it's

1737
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
not as easy to contact our old friend

1738
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and that leaves us also as here

1739
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
as his land decays

1740
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
as the land that forged our

1741
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
friendship decays we also

1742
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
you know we're we're without

1743
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
a guide we don't know the

1744
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
sectors are all falling apart

1745
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and we don't have a keeper to

1746
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
help us get through the sectors

1747
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I mean this is just

1748
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I feel

1749
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
a mess right I don't even feel

1750
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
are we even capable of putting on a show

1751
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
or any of the words I'm saying making any sense

1752
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
by saving the keeper we

1753
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
may have destroyed

1754
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
unpleasant city walk

1755
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
well that's kind of I guess that's what

1756
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
that's a bad version of what you're saying

1757
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm saying more like

1758
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
a positive spin but I guess it could be that

1759
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
as well we don't know that's some of what we're here to

1760
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
figure out right what what are

1761
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
these changes why are they happening are

1762
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
they happening for the better are they happening

1763
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
to slowly start piecing

1764
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
off city walk to no longer

1765
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
exist what is it this is so

1766
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
okay let's let's start with

1767
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
just rumors

1768
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and kind of what we know because there's

1769
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
stuff we know permits have been filed

1770
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
well can I also have

1771
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I don't want to you know

1772
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
if you've got an order in your head but

1773
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
it also feels like we should maybe say

1774
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
some of what has happened yeah sure like

1775
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
where where we stand today because

1776
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I have

1777
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I went and looked I found

1778
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the list that we made of what's

1779
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
going to be right you know what's

1780
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in each sector and I did a

1781
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
count of what all of

1782
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
the I just left it at like

1783
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
you know because we talked about things that are a little more

1784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
abstract like the

1785
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
King Kong or Walters

1786
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Gate the entrance to theme park

1787
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
employees I didn't count things like that what I

1788
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
counted were restaurants

1789
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and stores places that you could

1790
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
walk into and have an experience

1791
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I and I of that

1792
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I counted 57

1793
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I didn't

1794
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
count things that we talked about that were already gone

1795
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I didn't count wizards I didn't count the hotels

1796
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I didn't count parking garages 57

1797
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
retail locations are what

1798
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
we covered in the original 19 part

1799
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
series since we

1800
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
did the original series

1801
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
in what year 2018 yeah

1802
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
27 of

1803
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
those places have closed

1804
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and within that 9 of

1805
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
them have closed in the last 9

1806
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
months that

1807
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I expanded it to the 9 months because

1808
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I think that's when we lost oh which

1809
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
one I mean

1810
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
they really started flying I mean it's

1811
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
been a ton you know kind of

1812
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
since November or so

1813
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
is it worth

1814
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
saying what we've lost

1815
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
meditating a little on what we've lost

1816
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
yes I think it's worth it

1817
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
the saddest one to me

1818
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
is sector one sector one almost

1819
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
doesn't exist and I don't think anything

1820
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
in the original list is still

1821
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
oh wait actually I missed one whatever

1822
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
angle or

1823
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
angl that's gone

1824
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I didn't count that so it's 28

1825
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
angel yeah is it angel

1826
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
or angle I think it was angel

1827
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
there was a few other locations

1828
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
of that story I think in Malta

1829
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I was still going to be angel okay okay

1830
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I guess that's more appealing than angle

1831
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
like startup app

1832
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you just remove the vowels

1833
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
most of the vowels

1834
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
or put bi on it

1835
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
and that's how you get your app

1836
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
sector one this is the craziest one sector

1837
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
one here I'll just you know what

1838
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
just for old time's sake sector one

1839
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
billabong popcorn

1840
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
opolis fossil

1841
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
zenzone angel

1842
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
good luck boys

1843
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
was that offensive that I did that

1844
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
or was it kind of nice

1845
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I tried to make it

1846
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I tried to make it like you know

1847
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Jamie Foxx doing Rey but

1848
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
you know I can't stack up to the original

1849
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
fossil zenzone angel

1850
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
long gone billabong popcorn

1851
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
opolis gone recently

1852
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
so sector one as we knew it

1853
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
doesn't exist

1854
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
yes it's and this is

1855
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
okay let me say this

1856
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
we'll save this for the end

1857
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I do want to say and tease right now

1858
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in case you weren't going to listen to the end of this episode

1859
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I was there the final day of billabong

1860
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
oh oh Mike

1861
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Mike I went

1862
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
up to city walk on the final day

1863
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
of operation now I was very thankful

1864
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
that they announced

1865
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
when they were closing because we don't get that

1866
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
kind of heads up with other stores

1867
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and other restaurants here because Mike you

1868
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
go through surf wax like no one

1869
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
is I'm a big surfer

1870
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
we know that

1871
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I love the beach but I

1872
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
will tease that

1873
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I will tease something I got

1874
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
something happened whoa

1875
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
at billabong the final

1876
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
night of billabong

1877
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
and we'll end with that

1878
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
something happened tears were shed

1879
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
scars were forms

1880
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
that will last forever and it's interesting

1881
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
it was funny I'll say this it was funny because

1882
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
for a couple weeks I think you know

1883
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
how you see a store going out of business they have

1884
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
those big yellow signs and they have some

1885
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
company that comes in there and like figures out a way

1886
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
to trick people into thinking they're getting a deal on the

1887
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
clothes or whatever and

1888
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
this is what was happening at city walk

1889
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
for like a couple weeks you'd have big yellow signs

1890
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
going out of business sale at city

1891
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
walk which just didn't feel quite right

1892
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't know why I thought it was

1893
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
funny just like just like some

1894
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
common stores some dirt place

1895
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
yeah this is this is the finest

1896
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
shopping institution on earth just shouldn't

1897
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
be the case it just feels too low rent

1898
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
how did it ever come to this but

1899
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
yes this whole chunk is gone

1900
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
it's all gone and empty

1901
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and now we were talking about this

1902
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
they're building a hotel

1903
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
right here in this area

1904
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and this is a key piece that people may not know

1905
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
this has been rumored for a long

1906
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
time and I think this is pretty official

1907
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
that they are building a pretty

1908
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
big hotel that's going to wrap around I don't

1909
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
think we know the exact lay of the land

1910
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
but it certainly it is

1911
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
more akin to Grand

1912
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Californian being right there

1913
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
mixed in with the retail

1914
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
bordering the park

1915
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and I think it's going to wrap all

1916
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
the way around to another

1917
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Fallen Brother

1918
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Saddle Ranch

1919
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and it'll take over a lot of parking

1920
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
lot that's that's sort of the

1921
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
a lot of stuff that is like non garage

1922
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
just one level

1923
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
parking is going to become a hotel

1924
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and the current security

1925
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
corridor oh yes right

1926
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
will be knocked down

1927
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and it seems like we'll get replaced

1928
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
by some sort of more permanent facility

1929
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
where like Disneyland

1930
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the security happens before you're even

1931
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
in the mall so the way you have to go

1932
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
through security to be in downtown Disney

1933
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
seems like it's going to be the same

1934
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
for CityWalk

1935
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
get them up to CityWalk

1936
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that's going to get them up there

1937
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
doing a quick metal detector

1938
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
pad down it's going to bring

1939
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
the people in

1940
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
it's about time because

1941
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
if I see some some godforsaken teen

1942
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
with a switchblade

1943
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
starting to you know climbing up and starting to

1944
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
carve up with a cow that's upside down

1945
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
on top of the Ben and Jerry's

1946
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
protect CityWalk yeah I will

1947
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
kick that switchblade

1948
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
out of their hand put it in my

1949
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
hand and slice them up a little bit

1950
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
turn their face into a slice

1951
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
house if CityWalk was its own

1952
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
country and we could enlist in

1953
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
its army we would

1954
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
it's the only one

1955
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
yeah yeah no if there was a

1956
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
CityWalk flag CityWalk was its own

1957
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
country we would always stand

1958
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
and salute it we would I would I will

1959
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
draft a bill

1960
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
to let CityWalk secede from the

1961
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
union so we

1962
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
can have it to be its own country

1963
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
does sound like a good deal hey the three

1964
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
of us and the listeners

1965
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
let's go find some places to you

1966
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
know right I guess whole

1967
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
you know well all right here's the plan you can't really

1968
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
live there yet so we'll just

1969
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
go sleep in the bathroom every night

1970
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
hide on top of the toilets until

1971
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
the security guards stop checking legs

1972
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
yeah and then we get to live at CityWalk

1973
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
as a sovereign nation forever beautiful

1974
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
yeah and you know like in the way

1975
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
that medieval castles and

1976
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
stuff are fortified with moats

1977
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
soon CityWalk will have a whole

1978
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
building full of rooms that are difficult

1979
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
to escape from oh well that's

1980
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
we haven't even gotten over there that's the other side of the

1981
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
place the whole other side of CityWalk let's

1982
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
keep progressing via sectors

1983
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
in sector two we have lost the crepe cafe

1984
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
this is I knew it was serious

1985
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
when we lost crepe cafe

1986
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
because crepe cafe has sustained

1987
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
for many many years in

1988
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
which I imagine you know

1989
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
a total of six people bought a

1990
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
crepe per day so

1991
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you know if they're able to

1992
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
live to survive in those

1993
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
conditions yeah and then suddenly

1994
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
you're gone I knew this was

1995
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
a transformation yeah this was

1996
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
nothing we could turn back from right and

1997
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and you know I should say

1998
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and I don't know if it's completely true we've said

1999
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I've said this at least a hundred times on the show

2000
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
at this point it feels like

2001
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
universal we've heard universal

2002
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
is going to replace everything with universal owned businesses

2003
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
yeah well this is something that's said

2004
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
a lot about what the plan is or why this is happening

2005
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
seems like that's not the case

2006
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
as far as things we've heard now or

2007
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
at least it's not so the folk at least

2008
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
in the moment right now it's not the case

2009
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
yeah it is still all these outside things

2010
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
hot topic and Ben and Jerry's

2011
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
still standing well yes they are still there

2012
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but yeah it's not everything not by

2013
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
any means you're right you're right by the way

2014
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
if I say any of these and you know what

2015
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
the replacement is feel free to shout it out

2016
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't think I do in all these cases I'm trying

2017
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
to remember now I look I've been

2018
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I hope he doesn't mind I've been

2019
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
communicating with universal high

2020
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
the Twitter account or

2021
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Peck's account a little bit okay one of these

2022
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
accounts that's been tracking all okay I was

2023
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I was correct now apparently

2024
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
there was a permit filed

2025
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
for halal guys to

2026
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
replace crepe cafe

2027
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
which he

2028
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
says is now it's been pulled

2029
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
the permit doesn't exist anymore oh my

2030
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
god what happened so what

2031
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
happened would immediately

2032
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
be the best food at City Wall

2033
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
like number one

2034
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
anything that goes in goes straight to number one

2035
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
number one with a bullet

2036
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
like I love halal guys

2037
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I haven't had in a little while some people said the Glendale

2038
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
location has gone

2039
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
downhill a little bit but I always liked it when I had it

2040
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and that's a chain

2041
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and yes that would be very exciting I didn't

2042
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
know anything about this until today

2043
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
but apparently it's not happening or it doesn't seem like

2044
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
it's happening so we

2045
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
don't know what's going in the crepe cafe

2046
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
we certainly don't know what's happening with billabong

2047
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and all that stuff no idea no idea

2048
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
mini monster

2049
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
has recently departed yes

2050
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
now mini monster is that one

2051
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
that's being replaced by this new dessert

2052
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
location insomnia cookies

2053
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
insomnia cookies

2054
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Jason in a previous episode

2055
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
you before time

2056
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
pulled whatever story you have about

2057
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
insomnia cookies now is the time

2058
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
what do you know about insomnia cookies

2059
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
okay well we're flashing back to 2005

2060
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
or 2006

2061
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and at that time in

2062
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Ithaca there was warring late night

2063
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
cookie delivery services

2064
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
the late night wars the late night

2065
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
wars yeah and

2066
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
one time

2067
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
one of my older roommates and I

2068
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
he had his own dorm room that year

2069
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and we were just hanging out late on

2070
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
a Saturday watching

2071
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
mystery science theater 3000

2072
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
on DVD sets

2073
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
as you would it wasn't

2074
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
a thing that you could before the streamers

2075
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
this is before a Tubi this is before

2076
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
a Pluto before you could just

2077
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
pull it up on any

2078
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
streaming free channel

2079
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and

2080
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
we were like hey

2081
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
you want to get

2082
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
you want to get cookies

2083
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
do you want

2084
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
because there was one

2085
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
the one I liked would sell cookie

2086
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
like slight slices of cookie cake

2087
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
or they'd bring you a Ben

2088
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and Jerry's pint for five

2089
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
dollars and the economics of this

2090
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
was all insane at the time too because

2091
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
it's like why did the place

2092
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
like that sold five

2093
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
dollar calzones deliver one

2094
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
five dollar calzones how did

2095
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
that make sense

2096
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
these are the mysteries that Jason has been grappling

2097
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
with for 20 years I've been still thinking

2098
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
about it so anyway insomnia

2099
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
cookies had just opened

2100
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
so at about one or two in the morning

2101
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
we ordered a set of

2102
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
cookies and brownies now when you say

2103
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
set yeah what

2104
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
does that mean like a

2105
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
a box okay

2106
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
meant to be shared

2107
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
twelve

2108
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
twelve cookies

2109
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
it was probably like six cookies four

2110
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
brownies okay

2111
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and I you know was

2112
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
going nuts on those

2113
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I was eating a lot

2114
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and by

2115
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
the time I left his door

2116
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
of course when I left it was like 2am

2117
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
3am in the middle of the winter

2118
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
in Ithaca it's freezing out

2119
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and my stomach hurts

2120
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
not made any better

2121
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
by the cold and I

2122
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
woke up with the worst stomach

2123
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
pains the next I just like

2124
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000

2125
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
so for years I like side eye

2126
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and insomnia cookies

2127
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
anytime I see it now

2128
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
was it the cookies or was it my own

2129
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
foolish actions who's to say

2130
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000

2131
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000

Pepto-Bismol this doesn't even sound that bad honestly

2141
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
it was really pain it was really unpleasant

2142
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
this is don't start teaching

2143
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
this behavior this is not good this is how

2144
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
it spreads about bad behavior how nobody

2145
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
ever learns you're saying that a big stomach

2146
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
ache is like that's not so bad you can get through

2147
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that you should keep doing that keep having those

2148
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000

2149
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
of insomnia I had insomnia

2150
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000

2151
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000

2152
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
chance since they're reviving

2153
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
at all it's been 20

2154
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
years it has been 20

2155
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
years what we need to do though is you need to eat

2156
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
the exact same amount

2157
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
at two in the morning

2158
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
at two in the morning for a science it's for work

2159
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
it's for science experiments six cookies

2160
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and four brownies and you have to go fucking

2161
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
wild on them just getting a room

2162
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
at the universal Hilton

2163
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
yes like depriving myself

2164
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
of sleep to eat you have to recreate

2165
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
the situation properly

2166
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
you could be sloppy telly

2167
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
right have you

2168
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
just you and me babies

2169
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
by which I mean cookies and brownies

2170
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
had you had then did you ever

2171
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
order from them again no college

2172
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I haven't had them in 20 years

2173
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
did you ever order from a different cookie

2174
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
oh yeah I order from the other cookie place

2175
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
all the time and did you order the same amount

2176
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
no because it was

2177
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
different it was different form factor it was

2178
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
like slices would you eat a similar amount of

2179
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
treats no

2180
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
no because I would usually

2181
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
get one or two

2182
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
cookies and then split a pint of ice cream

2183
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
with my girlfriend at the top

2184
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
okay so you never recreated

2185
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
you didn't have a

2186
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
control or you guess you did

2187
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
have a control but you never tested the experiment

2188
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
well if I just throw

2189
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
in Mano's hands of fate I don't

2190
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
know if I'd be I wonder if it would just my

2191
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
body would just react it could have

2192
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
been that that might have thrown you too

2193
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
it says is a nauseating film to watch yeah

2194
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
this is going to be a big episode for us

2195
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
back to insomnia is you returning

2196
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to insomnia cookies after 20 years yeah

2197
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
to see if you can handle it

2198
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
it is like

2199
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
a place usually that

2200
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
when it first caught on I think sprung

2201
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
up around the college campuses

2202
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
for like yeah stoners and

2203
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
drunks these dumbasses will eat anything

2204
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that is

2205
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
a lot of the food services

2206
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
around the college campus

2207
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
just use a bunch of newspaper cook

2208
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
a bunch of newspaper and feed it to these losers

2209
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
these hogs aren't going

2210
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
to poke down tick tock long enough to know

2211
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
what they're eating oink oink you pigs

2212
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
eat up pay up

2213
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
and eat up you know a lot of people

2214
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
people experiment in college people like

2215
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
you know try on different personalities

2216
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
interests predilections

2217
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and to me this is like

2218
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
this is a more experimental kind of

2219
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Jason a Jason who would get

2220
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
stomach pains and then not immediately

2221
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
go back to the place that gave him the stomach pain

2222
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I don't even know this Jason

2223
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
you didn't really test them out

2224
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
like you should have that's

2225
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
it comes with maturity I'm saying

2226
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
you and I go to city walk and if something kind of tastes

2227
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
weird or bad or something we'll try it out a couple more times

2228
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
alright you're on blast for six

2229
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
days right Scott

2230
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
did you test the wind did you get like

2231
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
a three bite tuna sandwich and test

2232
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
the wind factor no I didn't

2233
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I did no wind experiments

2234
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000

2235
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000

oh yeah your pickle blew away

2239
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
no in fact because we recorded

2240
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
after I went up there

2241
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
just to like just to kind of walk around

2242
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000

01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000

2244
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I told you I made a point

2245
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
of getting food not there

2246
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I left early

2247
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
so that I could eat lunch somewhere that was

2248
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000

down at the bottom of the hill

2251
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
on Lankersham if you're going to Universal Studios

2252
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000

2257
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
as good a time as ever

2258
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I'll tell a second part of I'll tell

2259
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
what happened after the billabong

2260
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
story right now because I was trying

2261
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
to figure out where to eat at city walk I had gone up there with

2262
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
my friend Tim and I was like

2263
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
trying to figure out I really was having a difficult time

2264
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
what time are we this is a dinner late

2265
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
it's late eight or nine

2266
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
oh that's for city walk hours

2267
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
yes that's basically the two in the

2268
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
morning yeah so I said ah

2269
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I got a free I got a free

2270
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
menu item on the Taco Bell app

2271
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and I was extra excited

2272
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
about this because

2273
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Taco Bell prices at city walk are

2274
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
three times more expensive than in a

2275
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
regular Taco Bell so I wondered

2276
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
is it going to still is the conversion rate can be

2277
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
the same here when it comes to the free item

2278
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
because you get a free item it's you get one

2279
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
cheesy goatee to crunch one chalupa

2280
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
whatever and those are four bucks

2281
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
at city walk they're eight or nine dollars

2282
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
it's wild it's very expensive

2283
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
but I realized yes I could get

2284
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
the extra expensive cheesy

2285
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
goatee to crunch for it's

2286
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
$8.99

2287
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
for a cheesy goatee to crunch at city walk

2288
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
which is insane

2289
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
that's for a full meal this is generally how much you

2290
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
would spend so I could get that for free and I said okay

2291
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I need one other thing to eat

2292
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and I love Taco Bell generally

2293
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
speaking I never have a

2294
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
bad Taco Bell meal very rarely

2295
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
so I go oh there's this like

2296
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
there's a quesadilla for $10

2297
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
okay I'm getting a free item so the whole

2298
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
meal will be $10 that's pretty good

2299
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
the caliente cantina chicken

2300
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
quesadilla uh oh and

2301
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
it's a new menu

2302
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
item and I we're scared

2303
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
just at the name I eat

2304
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and I eat the

2305
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
cheesy goatee to crunch it's delicious it's as good

2306
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
as a cheesy goatee to crunch ever is

2307
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I open the caliente

2308
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
cantina and it's

2309
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
covered in neon yellow

2310
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
sauce just

2311
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
even like crazy

2312
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000

01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
sauce like lemon like lemon

2316
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
someone uh open a glow

2317
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
stick that's what it looked like on top

2318
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
of it accidentally and I this

2319
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
this goes so south I forget to even take

2320
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
a picture before it's thrown away

2321
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
okay I I

2322
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
take a bite of this it is like

2323
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
tasting like

2324
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
rancid lemon

2325
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
candy that's

2326
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
soaked in a chicken quesadilla

2327
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and it's it is so

2328
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
it is like a pool of it

2329
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
my quesadilla is sitting in a pool

2330
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
of like neon yellow

2331
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
candy it's leaking

2332
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
out and again I've seen

2333
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
all sorts of Taco Bell shit in my day

2334
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I'm a veteran of this place

2335
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I've never seen anything like this it's like

2336
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
wet it's like been soaking

2337
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
in piss basically

2338
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
what do you think it is in their world

2339
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
a cantina

2340
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
first of all the only thing trustworthy on that menu

2341
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
is the crispy cantina

2342
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
chicken taco

2343
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
is pretty good there's some great new cantina

2344
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
items too this is a thing in the last couple of months

2345
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
the burritos and quesadillas are too

2346
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
gross they brought the

2347
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
shredded chicken back which is what I was I've been

2348
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
that I like yes it's much

2349
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
better than their shitty chunk chicken

2350
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
the shredded chicken is a better quality I don't know why

2351
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
but it is this

2352
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
imagine the candy piss from

2353
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
its sugar and they just

2354
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
dribble it all over your chicken

2355
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
quesadilla and I made it through

2356
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
maybe that's what it is it might be

2357
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
it could be surplus piss candy

2358
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
it could be surplus piss candy

2359
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you gotta get rid of this piss

2360
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
is that caliente sauce spicy

2361
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
it was maybe supposed to be but it just tasted

2362
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
like this weird artificial lemon

2363
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
sauce that was a really

2364
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
it was like it felt like it was giving me a headache

2365
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
and I just I couldn't take it

2366
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
it's actually it was

2367
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
it's radioactive was it

2368
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
barbicide it felt like

2369
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
in some ways it was worse than

2370
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
it was barbasol

2371
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
it was yellow barbasol it was it felt

2372
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
in a way like worse than the

2373
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
flounder almondine

2374
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I would have rather had the flounder

2375
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
from city walk Orlando

2376
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Toothsome than this chicken

2377
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
quesadilla from Taco Bell

2378
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
you just had your worst city walk food now?

2379
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
just had it never had a worse city walk meal

2380
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
than this oh my god and from Taco

2381
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
my beloved Taco Bell of all places I don't know if

2382
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
they I suspect that since it was a new

2383
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
menu item they put like

2384
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
fifty times the amount

2385
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
on the quesadilla that they should like they didn't

2386
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
know what they were doing they had not been trained

2387
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
so there was a new right somebody

2388
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
didn't come like the regional manager didn't come

2389
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
around and explain the proportions

2390
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
they're making what no

2391
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
they're not ready

2392
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
at least at johnny rock you get

2393
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
a flat top grilled dog you know

2394
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I should have gone to johnny rock I thought about

2395
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
it and then I was like I don't know why didn't

2396
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
you go to a Taco Bell

2397
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
down the street I

2398
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
made a mistake I got excited at the

2399
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
prospect of getting the nine

2400
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
dollar cheesy gordita crunch for free

2401
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
but then you still paid for this

2402
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
other thing that was bad

2403
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
yes so because the quesadilla

2404
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
was still the prospect of the free

2405
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
but then he just gives him ten dollars

2406
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
of the worst thing he's ever eaten in his life

2407
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
because it's still a case I'm sure that quesadilla was

2408
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
four dollars more than it should have been

2409
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
retail regular retail

2410
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
but it still felt closer to

2411
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
how much it should cost than the nine dollar

2412
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
cheesy gordita crunch which is absurd

2413
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
he only spent ten dollars

2414
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
on the worst food

2415
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
item that's ever been in front of him

2416
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Scott you know what else set the foot of

2417
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000

01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
about spitz there's never yellow

2439
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
battery acid all over the

2440
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
food it is reliable

2441
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000

2442
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000

2443
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
something dependable

2447
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I'll go back to taco bell I mean especially

2448
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
if I have a free item you get a free cheese

2449
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
goodie crunch and it does make me feel

2450
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
good that I get that nine dollar for free

2451
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
that nine dollar item you paid them ten dollars

2452
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
you got screwed in this

2453
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
scenario you're right in this scenario I got screwed

2454
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
but I'm saying in the future I'm screwing them

2455
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
in the future I'm taking it to them

2456
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm trying to just figure out how

2457
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
much taco bell you eat cause the only

2458
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
free items I get are like value

2459
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
men you like rice and beans like

2460
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
a basic taco and he's getting

2461
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
like the giant free base

2462
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
he's racking up points

2463
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I don't really know I don't have a log of Mike's

2464
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
day to day but it does feel like there is

2465
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
a lot of taco bell

2466
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
we order pretty regularly my

2467
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
James vegetarian very reliable

2468
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
you can get a bowl too I get a power

2469
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
bowl often as well

2470
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
you know we get beans you get a little chicken

2471
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in there you get

2472
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
cause he's a health nut this health nut over here with his

2473
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
power bowls I don't know man

2474
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
350 calories to get one of these bowls

2475
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
if you make it right you put taco bell

2476
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
pieces in a bowl or

2477
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Subway ingredients in a bowl

2478
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm like I shouldn't be saying this I shouldn't

2479
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
be seeing this like this Subway bowl is the most

2480
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
foul thought I've ever

2481
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I got one of my orders Wednesday

2482
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Wednesday 2-12-25 Cantina

2483
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
chicken bowl modified reduced

2484
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
fat sour cream easy on it

2485
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
guacamole easy on it

2486
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
health nut added a little Mexican

2487
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
pizza sauce though

2488
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
but I removed the avocado ranch

2489
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
sauce and I removed all the rice

2490
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so it only ended up

2491
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
being like 350 calories you're playing

2492
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
with fire with this many modifications

2493
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think no I'm not

2494
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I know exactly what I'm doing I'm just saying

2495
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000

01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
goo that's on it

2501
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
oh you never modify the goo at taco bell

2502
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000

2503
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000

2507
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
of as little meat as possible

2508
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
if it's just potatoes or

2509
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
beans or stuff like that I

2510
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000

01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
the taco bell but you'll get sick

2512
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
if you do the meat I'm saying that

2513
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
beef is questionable

2514
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000

that someone who isn't me is

2518
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
at chain restaurants what's happening

2520
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Jason and I are aligned

of plenty coming back

2540
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I was just we were texting about the

2541
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Liv Moss presentation

2542
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
event where they talk about the new

2543
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Taco Bell stuff coming

2544
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
there's a Taco Bell keynote

2545
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
that you both follow

2546
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Liv Moss yeah

2547
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that's how we live

2548
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Jason and I all the snacking counts

2549
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I follow on Instagram we're all over

2550
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
so you text about Taco Bell enough to

2551
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
cover the Liv Moss keynote but you

2552
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
haven't run into this specific issue of

2553
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
that you don't eat the meat and Mike's mad

2554
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
that you don't eat the meat it just seems silly

2555
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
to me unless you were a vegetarian

2556
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
or a vegan to not ever have meat

2557
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I've always I've for the last few years

2558
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
been trying to eat less meat

2559
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
but unsuccessfully

2560
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
no I'm doing a good job

2561
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
of it what are you talking about

2562
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and you're also saying to never eat meat he's not

2563
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
saying he'll never eat meat he's saying he doesn't want to eat the

2564
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
shitty meat at Taco Bell makes sense

2565
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
to me I'm not a perv I mean

2566
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
look I like a little shitty meat so I'll have

2567
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Big Mac sometimes but I'd rather

2568
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
have like it's either

2569
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'd rather have Big Mac or I'd have a decent

2570
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
steak and otherwise

2571
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
that prefer not that prefer

2572
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
chicken or fish Mike goes to a steakhouse

2573
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
he's like how many modifications

2574
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
do you have an app do you have an app for this

2575
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
alright nevermind I'll go somewhere else

2576
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
oh I mobile ordered

2577
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
for the first time at

2578
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
crypto.com arena yesterday

2579
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
the modern world

2580
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
we live in my god we are in the future

2581
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
now our friend at knees was telling

2582
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
us how dog shit the food is at

2583
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
crypto.com arena how do you respond

2584
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
you don't say he's right

2585
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
yeah it was awful

2586
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
but that's besides the point

2587
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Mike has a lot of skin slices

2588
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
in his food discussion this is all about

2589
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
skipping the line which was very exciting

2590
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
you got to get you got to in a

2591
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
faster way get dog shit food

2592
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I ate a shitty hot dog faster than the

2593
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
line I ordered from the

2594
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
chair I walked up it was ready to

2595
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
go then you were to the

2596
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
toilet before they were even done ordering

2597
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
that's right that's right I threw it up

2598
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
let me ask cause you were at AEW

2599
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Revolution were you eating a hot

2600
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
dog during any of the very

2601
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
bloody matches

2602
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
no I ate the hot dog pretty

2603
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
early yeah

2604
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
no there was no blood cause I

2605
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
was eating a salad as one match

2606
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
was ending and then the next match was

2607
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
in a steel cage so I

2608
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
really finished that salad quickly

2609
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
cause I was starting to get grossed out when you see

2610
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
a human being bleeding it makes your appetite

2611
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
less

2612
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I know I might be going out on them here

2613
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
but yes Michael

2614
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
to me the craziest

2615
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
bloodiest match of all time was Mike Carlson

2616
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
versus Flounder Almondine

2617
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
yeah I bladed

2618
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I bit my mouth yeah

2619
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I bled as a bucket of blood for

2620
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
that Flounder during City Walk 2

2621
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I'm gonna keep going through the list here

2622
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Sparky's we

2623
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
have just lost Sparky's I think in

2624
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
all that time I never actually walked into

2625
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Sparky's I don't think I ever bought anything from

2626
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Sparky's Sparky's very confusing

2627
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
it seems to be it was a store that sold 100

2628
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
things it had a cat that looked like Lady Gaga

2629
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
well it doesn't have that

2630
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
anymore yeah

2631
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Sparky's is being replaced by

2632
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Slice House

2633
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
by Tony

2634
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Gamignani

2635
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Gamignani

2636
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Tony Gamignani you guys

2637
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000

01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Mike spoke highly of it

2641
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
it is it has a Burbank location

2642
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
where it replaced the

2643
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Doughboy's perennial steak

2644
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and shake by Big Laurie

2645
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
which if you follow Steak and Shake on Twitter

2646
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
has turned into an

2647
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Elon Trump simp account

2648
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000

our fries and beef tallow

2652
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
yes they're frying their fries and beef tallow

2653
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
make America healthy again

2654
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
there's like AI art

2655
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
of Steak and Shake being also like half

2656
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Steak and Shake half Tesla dealership

2657
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
or Tesla restaurant oh my god

2658
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
they're like going hard like they have a red hat

2659
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
they're just kissing the brand down the drain

2660
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
it's really interesting what's happened to Steak and Shake

2661
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
wow wow I was not aware of the

2662
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Big Laurie turn Big Laurie is

2663
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
like kissing Trump in everyone's ass yeah

2664
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
this is very interesting oh my god

2665
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
well anyway this is I mean this is a

2666
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
this is a legit chain that's been going for a long

2667
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
time just showed up in Burbank

2668
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I

2669
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
as a theme park journalist was

2670
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
got a little bit interested

2671
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
in trying it seeing

2672
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
if the hype lined up with reality

2673
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
it was I'm gonna be honest

2674
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
nerve wracking to do so

2675
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
like going to a

2676
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
going to a food establishment

2677
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
where the only recommendation had been

2678
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Mike made me very

2679
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
nervous and knowing that City Walk

2680
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
has said yes you can set up shop

2681
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
here I was wondering am I about to give

2682
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
my entire family food poisoning

2683
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
some bonus feed is I believe he's won

2684
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
some pizza making awards

2685
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
yes and he's called like I forget

2686
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that his Wikipedia says he's like

2687
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I don't know he's the

2688
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Elvis Presley of

2689
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
pizza throwing

2690
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I don't know who the company I don't know

2691
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Michael Jordan I guess Elvis makes no sense

2692
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
he's the saviour

2693
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Glover of he's

2694
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
he's the river dance of

2695
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
pizza throwing would you direct the cold open for

2696
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
the pizza awards

2697
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I'd love to

2698
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
that's really just what I've been

2699
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
yeah me and Murr from the impractical joggers

2700
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
are having a ball well that's what

2701
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
for Oscars it's Ryan Perez for pizza

2702
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
awards Jason Sheridan is my man

2703
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
try to make people's dreams come true

2704
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
anyway he's also

2705
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
bone of feed is wise

2706
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
he was a bar rescue pizza

2707
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
expert I don't think

2708
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
recurring I think maybe just one

2709
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
or a few but he was the guy who

2710
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
showed a place how to make better pizzas

2711
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
that they probably did not implement

2712
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
as a four days later and that

2713
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
one stretch of shopping and dining

2714
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
in the movie theater in Burbank

2715
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
often used as b-roll

2716
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
in early bar rescue

2717
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
how is it oh to show like

2718
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
some of their southern California

2719
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
is a formulation

2720
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
lots of college students

2721
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
so the Burbank one makes sense because it's

2722
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
literally at the foot of a 16 screen

2723
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
movie theater yes yeah yeah

2724
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
oh a quick slice that's kind of decayed

2725
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
they've lost a lot of places why there's been a

2726
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Hooters that is set empty

2727
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
for many years when will

2728
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
this Hooters ever become something else

2729
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
who wouldn't want to open a

2730
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
restaurant in a parking garage

2731
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
yes it is literally interesting

2732
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
but that said there is a

2733
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
very solid Indian

2734
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
restaurant in the ground floor

2735
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
of a different Burbank parking garage

2736
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
yes that place is great we at this point

2737
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
are going to have to like distribute a map of all

2738
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
of the Burbank malls to the listeners so that they

2739
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
understand what we talk about every

2740
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
single episode it's almost impenetrable

2741
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
alright please consult

2742
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
A6 on your map that is to what

2743
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
we are referring now Mike and I were

2744
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
also messaging about some souped

2745
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
up trading card vending machines

2746
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
that are on the ground floor of the Burbank

2747
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
alright where's that in the mess C2

2748
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
consult your map that's in C2

2749
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
anyway

2750
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
with some trepidation

2751
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
got slice house for the whole

2752
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
family to try brought it

2753
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
back big hit

2754
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
this was a hit this was great

2755
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
correctly hyped Mike

2756
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I believe you brought up the grandma

2757
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
pie what is grandma pie

2758
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
what is that defined as it's square

2759
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
in this case Sicilian I don't know if

2760
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
they're always Sicilian which is more

2761
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
grandma pie is

2762
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
a popular east coast preparation

2763
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
of pizza involving

2764
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
sauce and parmesan cheese

2765
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
it's heavy like sauce

2766
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
kind of like more like Chicago it's closer

2767
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Chicago style which I like

2768
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
like kind of square slices

2769
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
it wasn't so heavy with the sauce

2770
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
it was

2771
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
actually more of a light dusting it was

2772
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
sweet Gino with sweet

2773
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
tomato sauce and

2774
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
mozzarella and basil and sea salt

2775
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I thought this was excellent I mean I liked

2776
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
everything but that was the one like the one

2777
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
that's a little more you know I didn't have

2778
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
any just regular New York

2779
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
but that's what's great you can mix New York

2780
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
and Detroit and Sicilian

2781
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
get kind of a grand bag of all of them instead of just

2782
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
one pizza although I think next time I probably

2783
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
put my eggs into the sweet Gino

2784
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
basket I thought this

2785
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
is great my son liked it Aaron

2786
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
liked it I like this we

2787
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
we were pretty knocked out

2788
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
we're happy to have a pizza location we

2789
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
like in the area and there's already a few

2790
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
we got we got salad pizza in Burbank but we got

2791
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
that now too and you get to you know

2792
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
doff of the cap to Batman

2793
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
to the Batman statue as you get it

2794
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
so good so

2795
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
this is eerily

2796
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
good news for CityWalk I would say

2797
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
replacing a store that was utterly confusing

2798
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
with a pizza place that is

2799
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
actually solid I don't want to get ahead of myself but there's

2800
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
news that broke today

2801
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
about another place that's coming to

2802
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
CityWalk which is farther down the line that also

2803
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
is shockingly good news wow

2804
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
and it is scary because it's like what are they going to

2805
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
do to these places

2806
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
should I get to it in the list or do you jump to it

2807
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
because we're not so far

2808
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
we've gotten through a lot of the recent ones we've never addressed

2809
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
by the way that nectar bath treats is now

2810
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
nectar life that fixes

2811
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
everything

2812
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Abercrombie and Fitch

2813
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
is becoming

2814
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
the NBA store which we

2815
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
discussed a little bit I still

2816
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I feel like NBA might be a weird cursed

2817
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
brand but

2818
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
see what it's like yeah if they try to like

2819
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
put you in VR goggles

2820
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and make you become a player

2821
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
no it's over yes yeah

2822
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
who was the commissioner who there

2823
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
was a statue or a wax

2824
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Adam Silver

2825
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
if it's your opportunity to meet Wax

2826
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Adam Silver then I don't know if it's going to work

2827
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
out Dong Po Kitchen

2828
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
the site of the worst meal

2829
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
experience of my life oh well

2830
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
right well what's coming to Dong Po Kitchen

2831
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Jason I'll let you do the honors sir

2832
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
the rumor is

2833
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Raising Cane's

2834
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Raising Cane's Chicken

2835
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that's everywhere I love

2836
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
it took a while

2837
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
but it's grown on me quite a bit I like

2838
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Raising Cane's it's not like it's so special but I

2839
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
think I do think Raising Cane's is pretty consistently

2840
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
good and I have grown to really like

2841
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
it what did Dave's Hot Chicken excite me

2842
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
a little more even though Dave's has fallen off

2843
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
because it's franchised so fast yeah the hot chicken

2844
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
sure some of those hot chicken places are

2845
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
falling apart for sure um but

2846
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
yes I was but still Raising Cane's is

2847
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
a solid if it was to maintain

2848
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
the quality of the Burbank location

2849
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
it would still be like oh I can at least have

2850
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
a reliable chicken sandwich

2851
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
up here you know I still have never

2852
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
been because when they open

2853
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and the one close to us open and it had like the huge

2854
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
line thing for a while and it's not the

2855
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
kind of thing I eat all the time anyway

2856
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
compare contrast

2857
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Chick-fil-A and Raising Cane's

2858
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
God I haven't had Chick-fil-A in a long time

2859
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
um does that imply Raising Cane's is better

2860
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
because Cane's like only

2861
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
has a certain number

2862
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
of things on the menu similar to

2863
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
In-N-Out Burger okay everything is

2864
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
the chicken is cooked

2865
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
really fresh in fact that's my worry

2866
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
about the City Walk one because I find the

2867
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
best way to eat Raising Cane's

2868
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
is take out or try through

2869
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
because then it goes from scalding

2870
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
hot to reasonably hot by

2871
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
the time you get home I promise you

2872
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
the City Walk location and City Walk tradition

2873
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
will find a way to be lukewarm

2874
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
whenever it gets to you I would prefer that

2875
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
because I ate at Cane's once and I

2876
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
bit into it and like scalded

2877
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
my mouth

2878
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
it's well yeah it does feel I'm a car eater

2879
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I love to eat fast food alone

2880
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
in my car yeah that is one of my

2881
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
favorite things to do in life

2882
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and it is hot there was a moment

2883
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
that went like the prepping of

2884
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
the movie that I've been doing was exceedingly

2885
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
stressful yeah and the

2886
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
shoot way more fun and the post has been

2887
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a blast we locked picture we had picture

2888
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
locked baby but

2889
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
the prep was really insane and that I

2890
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
like actually had five minutes to myself

2891
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
before I had to go to some other

2892
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
meeting and I sat and ate jersey

2893
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
mics in the car

2894
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
in five minutes

2895
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
glorious this was yes

2896
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
this was this was like having a like a

2897
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
full weekend day off all

2898
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
of a sudden in the middle of the schedule

2899
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
it was really I will really cherish

2900
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that jersey mics in the car tossing some Miss Vickie's

2901
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
chips you may as well be getting a massage

2902
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
sure as hell did jalapeno my friend

2903
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
oh the best they're really good that's a solid

2904
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
chip barbecue one's really good too

2905
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
yeah yes those are my two wow

2906
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
alright hey

2907
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Vickie brothers

2908
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
the placement

2909
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
we're getting matching tattoos

2910
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
we're all getting Miss Vickie's

2911
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
the placement of

2912
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
here's what's interesting city food

2913
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
which is the upper level where the

2914
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Taco Bell is and where pink the awful

2915
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
pinks hot dogs is and where you cannot

2916
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
stand where you can where any

2917
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
pickle is to the wind and where last year

2918
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
was very windy this year less

2919
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
windy so far but last year was very

2920
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
windy the placement of

2921
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
of an establishment at city food does

2922
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
indicate that it's going to be worse

2923
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
than the restaurants with more

2924
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
space more room true

2925
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
so that's what gives me

2926
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
city food feels cursed yes

2927
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
that's what I mean so if the rumors

2928
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
are true and Raising Cane's is going to be

2929
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
in the Dong Po spot

2930
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I have a little more hope for it

2931
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
than I do and same with Slice House I have a little

2932
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
more hope for those places than I do for

2933
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
something moving up to city food city

2934
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
food just seems like it's going to be

2935
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
worse it has to be there's just some rot

2936
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and even when they change out locations

2937
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
maybe they keep the they keep they keep all

2938
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
the appliances like it's the

2939
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
same crud that was accruing at the walk

2940
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
in Dodger dog location

2941
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
that is making the pinks taste

2942
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
nightmarish today

2943
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
yes so

2944
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
yeah both of those things are

2945
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
like oh man if those are if that's

2946
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
open like at 9 p.m.

2947
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and you need to eat something you're coming out of the park

2948
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
like that seems like that would be a

2949
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
godsend honestly

2950
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
sure if they're 75 percent

2951
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
of other consistent quality

2952
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
yeah but they got to change some

2953
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
of these policies this everything

2954
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
closes at nine and that's the

2955
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
hotel so the rumor is two

2956
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
hotels I think we know they're moving

2957
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
faster on the first hotel that's outside

2958
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
and we're going to get to where the other hotel is

2959
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
potentially yeah because you might have some info that

2960
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
we don't know well I don't know that much

2961
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
more the second hotel I don't think has been

2962
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I don't know that I would bet a million

2963
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I think I would bet a million dollars that they're building the hotel

2964
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
outside the entrance I'm less

2965
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
certain for sure that they're

2966
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
building a hotel over where iFly is

2967
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
but that's still a rumor

2968
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and we've seen kind of weird plans

2969
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
that indicate they're doing that

2970
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
but we don't know because

2971
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
will all guys permit yes no we don't

2972
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
know yeah yeah if you want

2973
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
to jump around from I was going to go to

2974
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
sector 11 but I'll go to sector

2975
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
13 instead because there's no keeper

2976
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
to tell us not to do that such a crazy

2977
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
jump crazy jumps

2978
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
also what you could do in

2979
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
IFly which is no longer

2980
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
you can no longer indoor skydive

2981
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
at Universal Studios

2982
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
they have knocked that out to be replaced with

2983
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
open air

2984
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I think that zone will be an

2985
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
entrance to something that is what we

2986
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
seem pretty confident of

2987
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
did that also take out the outdoor

2988
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
some of the outdoor seating at

2989
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Margaritaville I don't know

2990
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
that's alright don't worry really

2991
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I thought the construction was and don't worry

2992
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
no one is ever out there well you know what

2993
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't know if it's closed because they're working

2994
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
perhaps perhaps you can't go

2995
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
on the patio right now but it's not it

2996
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
hasn't as far as I can tell from

2997
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
looking it hasn't encroached on

2998
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
it but maybe you're right oh okay because

2999
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I took a peek in there and maybe those

3000
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
doors were closed because they wouldn't want you

3001
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
near the construction not the fire

3002
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
pit but they were like

3003
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
fiddling with equipment once yeah

3004
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
so maybe they had trouble

3005
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
bad trouble night

3006
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
bad troubles

3007
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
so this is

3008
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
interesting because this area yeah there's

3009
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
an idea at least I

3010
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
think they had to put a hotel here

3011
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
which is a small piece of

3012
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
land if you're just going by the

3013
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
iFly but there's room behind it

3014
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I think it's more I consider that the iFly

3015
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
is gone to be an exit

3016
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
that takes you over to maybe and then

3017
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
years ago I read a rumor that they would do a

3018
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
second gate and there would be an entrance over

3019
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
here in this zone wow

3020
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
and I don't think

3021
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
that's happening but all of this

3022
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
and we should as I guess said this even earlier

3023
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
all of this I think is happening right

3024
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
now because as soon as epic

3025
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
universe wraps up the word I've heard

3026
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
from many people is we are go go

3027
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
go in Hollywood for

3028
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
what all every we're

3029
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
going we're doing like

3030
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
team shifts over really

3031
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
yes so we get all the universal

3032
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
stars that is the oh

3033
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
that is a vibe I really feel very strongly

3034
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
from a lot of different people

3035
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
the construction too

3036
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
when you're going up the hill by the existing

3037
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
hotels yes is for a building

3038
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
that people are calling a creative campus

3039
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
oh wait

3040
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
sorry where where do I point me in

3041
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
the sort of by the

3042
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Sheraton and the Hilton okay

3043
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
there is when you're going

3044
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
up that hill to the left

3045
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
really there is a large building going

3046
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
up and they're like oh that's for universal

3047
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Frankenstein parking where the

3048
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
unused Chinese restaurant

3049
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
used to be well that

3050
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
there was a rumored hotel

3051
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
there I feel like for a long

3052
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
time there's been a couple feel like

3053
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
and there's also I

3054
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I don't know Scott you might have gotten

3055
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
these mailings we both used to live a lot

3056
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
closer to universal they're

3057
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
always sending surveys

3058
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and sketches

3059
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
and stuff of like

3060
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
we're going to open

3061
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
combined shopping and living

3062
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
spaces on the back of the

3063
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
back lot and that

3064
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
tanked I haven't heard that

3065
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
maybe nobody's living over there

3066
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
so you think

3067
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
not there's I sent

3068
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I sent a Google map

3069
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
a couple days ago or last week

3070
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
of like behind that

3071
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I fly zone okay yeah and I think

3072
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't remember I probably stole it from somebody

3073
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and I can't remember who it was

3074
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
but there's a bunch of land back there

3075
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
there's a bunch of space that people

3076
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
are speculating that's expansion

3077
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I think which is current which is

3078
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
where to again talk about early dating

3079
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Erin the place where I brought her back

3080
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
to see the decaying

3081
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
it was like

3082
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
not a parking lot but just kind of like

3083
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
storage I think it's where they yeah

3084
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
that's what it's always seemed like over there

3085
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
it's just like I don't know big like

3086
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
just a vacant lot to put shit

3087
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and that perhaps they will put

3088
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
some permanent shit they're going to yes

3089
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I think they're going to put permanent shit there like if

3090
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
we have to identify now I hate to get actually

3091
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
into the theme park of it all but

3092
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
no I please don't we may

3093
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
as well a little bit because it's

3094
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
we could say right now

3095
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
we could say right now

3096
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
like things we want speculation

3097
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
like there's rumors of Transformers

3098
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
and mummy going away

3099
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
more Nintendo down in that zone and mummy

3100
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
yeah I mean mummy's been rumored

3101
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
to go away for years never seems

3102
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
to happen they're moving the tram entrance

3103
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
today is the last day to see

3104
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
fast and furious supercharge

3105
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
oh and you know what

3106
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
okay and that always felt like because also

3107
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
if you're not up on what's going on at Universal

3108
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Hollywood they're getting real close on this fast and

3109
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
furious coaster

3110
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
maybe not that close

3111
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
next year they said maybe it's going to

3112
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
open with the new movie oh maybe

3113
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
that's why they're holding it but jeez does it seem

3114
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
like they're going fast I know and the track

3115
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
is oh you got a track that is

3116
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
looping above the starway nuts

3117
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
it looks so crazy especially

3118
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
if those pictures are right and

3119
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
you're in little cars that rotate

3120
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
spin around that was going to

3121
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
roll so hard yes

3122
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
it's like Velocicoaster level but also flips

3123
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
you in little tiny cars Velocicoaster

3124
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
level built into a giant

3125
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
hill like a tiny mountain

3126
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
and goes over the starway

3127
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
holy shit is that exciting

3128
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
it impacts like the skyline of the

3129
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
city right and you'll see that from everywhere

3130
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
from all around it's huge

3131
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
so it seems

3132
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
like the fast and furious

3133
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
finale to the tour is going

3134
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
away for that reason

3135
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I hadn't even clocked it like okay

3136
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
so they're getting rid of that because there's going to be a better fast and furious

3137
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
thing but

3138
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
that land is pretty close to

3139
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
that's tour exit so that

3140
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
is land they could turn into something else

3141
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
if you know the lay

3142
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
of the tour land at all then it

3143
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
seems like I feel like I've heard that

3144
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
fast and furious stage is up for grabs

3145
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
that falls lake

3146
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
is up for grabs the big like lake

3147
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
with the backdrop where they filmed the

3148
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
TLC waterfalls video my favorite

3149
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
thing to say oh right I'll go

3150
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
a step further

3151
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
the residential neighborhood that overlooks

3152
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
were the world

3153
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I saw an account speculating that at

3154
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
this point a lot of those houses

3155
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I had heard it

3156
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
over the years oh universal owns

3157
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
some of those houses for directors

3158
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
or actors or producers

3159
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
they're putting up there I've heard they

3160
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
own a lot of it now I think they own a lot

3161
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
yes I believe that's true I don't think

3162
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
they're going to do anything with

3163
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
that for theme park development

3164
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
in the near term it's just a buffer

3165
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
to where there aren't neighbors who can

3166
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
complain about loud rides

3167
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
right in their backyard right but

3168
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
but overall I think right now

3169
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
if you want to have fun speculating

3170
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
speculate on what

3171
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
will happen to transformers mummy

3172
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
what will happen to Simpsons

3173
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
and then the area downward tram

3174
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
loading is now which will be moved

3175
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
they're doing work right now on

3176
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
the hill they're doing

3177
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
something to it they're clearing things

3178
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
they're moving it like I don't know if an

3179
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
e-ticket that could go next to Harry

3180
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Potter that replaces Simpson

3181
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
could kind of hang off the hill in a way

3182
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
like there's not enough room

3183
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
there's not enough room to put anything

3184
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
other than a simulator ride right now where

3185
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Simpsons is yeah but I don't know

3186
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
if there's something they could figure out

3187
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
to build sort of on the side of it I don't

3188
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
know interesting I don't like

3189
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
because there's back like there's

3190
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I think and I've this is

3191
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
was my guess but then I've seen a bunch of other

3192
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
people say it wicked will be the

3193
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
finale of the of the tram

3194
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
tour oh that's my guess

3195
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
that there'll be some sort of wicked thing and they want

3196
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
to do it fast because why close fast and

3197
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
furious now unless you've got

3198
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
something that will be the finale

3199
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
soon and the guy from the one

3200
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
universal guys was talking about how

3201
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
wicked is going to make a great theme park

3202
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
yeah yeah yeah

3203
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
no that's been overdue not overdue

3204
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
because the movie was only out recently but like

3205
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
that's a pretty big thing they're sitting on

3206
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
even Ariana Grande was like

3207
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I got some ideas for wicked rides

3208
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
yes I know she's a

3209
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Parks fan she's a big and there was

3210
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
a recent video from universal

3211
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
creative where they were teasing

3212
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
epic universe stuff and they're also like

3213
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
just so you know this isn't the end

3214
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
this is the beginning we have

3215
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
plans for every park

3216
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
yes they're the they're putting

3217
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
the pedal to the metal and they're like

3218
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
really now a lot of people

3219
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
have modern Disney brain and they're like yes

3220
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
put wicked a Marvel superhero

3221
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
island and I said

3222
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
10 years ago said 10 years ago

3223
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
but I'm like they're not going to retrofit

3224
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
uh 25

3225
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
year old rides oh

3226
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
for this brand new movie

3227
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I don't know when they have

3228
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
uh when they have all this space

3229
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
and stuff it just feels like

3230
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I don't

3231
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I don't think they're going to do it because I think it's still valuable

3232
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
enough to keep Disney from having it

3233
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I think so yeah I think that's probably right

3234
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
but I don't know Toon Lagoon

3235
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't know sorry

3236
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I'm worried about

3237
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
breaking hearts over here I'm worried about Toon Lagoon

3238
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I'll compromise and give them lost continent

3239
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
because that's all vibes

3240
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
that's no compromise

3241
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
that's no compromise

3242
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
but I think we're getting

3243
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
just because it's fun to talk about I think

3244
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Nintendo's going to sweep out Transformers

3245
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and Mummy I think we'll get

3246
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
probably Donkey Kong and then whatever the next land

3247
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
they build or we could put Pokemon

3248
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
down there does all of lower lot

3249
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
just what does is there some world

3250
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
is the holdout yes but

3251
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
what if otherwise well

3252
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
yeah that's weird

3253
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Mummy is awkward I don't know what you do with Mummy

3254
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
yeah I just I just think that whole

3255
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
chunk then will become Nintendo

3256
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
yeah just because it makes

3257
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
the most sense if you want to have like a portal

3258
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
if they want to keep this thing where the portals take you

3259
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
that's what's weird I don't know what happens

3260
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
because they don't have to do it but it still makes sense

3261
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
or Mummy becomes that you enter

3262
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
not there but like you go

3263
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
through a portal and then enter the other way

3264
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
they flip it around like Toy Story Mania

3265
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
in Florida different entrance yeah

3266
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
oh boy that'd be great to skip

3267
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
early at Epicure

3268
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
to speak great at forgetting

3269
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Donkey Kong out here

3270
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
that's a whole portal to just

3271
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
skip

3272
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
there's no way I'm not going to Donkey Kong

3273
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
see the big Donkey Kong guy

3274
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
that's fun it wasn't as big for me as you

3275
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
you know that's true I like it

3276
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I want to see the big guys

3277
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
yeah you just got a Nintendo like a year ago

3278
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
huh

3279
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I just started playing Mario Kart like a year ago

3280
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
yeah you're not as you're not as fond of

3281
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Donkey Kong as I am no okay

3282
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
well that's fair I like it don't get me wrong

3283
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
but that ride the video friend Japan

3284
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
it's like 82nd 90s

3285
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I'm worried about the ride

3286
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I'm excited to go on the ride

3287
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I have a feeling the ride is going to be fun but it's not the e-ticket

3288
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
we want the blow away Nintendo e-ticket

3289
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
we want and deserve that's that's the

3290
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
reality I'm worried I have to meet

3291
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Vincent Various in his various shops

3292
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
and establishments

3293
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I would play guys

3294
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
we do have to explain what Vincent

3295
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Various is

3296
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
it's shorthand for us but what is Vincent

3297
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
they put out a casting notice

3298
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
in Orlando for a character named

3299
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Vincent Various for the new epic

3300
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
universe and apparently I've heard

3301
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
on the inside some rumors and not rumors

3302
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
that there are deep lore

3303
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
about new characters at

3304
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Celestial Park

3305
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I'm so excited for Celestial Park cause two things

3306
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
14 hours of original

3307
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
music I saw that too

3308
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that's really fun a lot of

3309
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
people who worked on

3310
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
port of entry working on

3311
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Celestial Park

3312
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
yes I saw that as well

3313
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
no that's going to be awesome Vincent Various

3314
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
is very exciting I don't know anything about him

3315
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
but I love him

3316
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
he's an astronomer a scientist who converted

3317
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
a lot of his workshop spaces to

3318
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
restaurants and shops

3319
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
is that what Celestial Park is

3320
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
it was some magical gathering place

3321
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
for great minds

3322
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
yes the greatest philosopher I think

3323
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
that's the vibe of it

3324
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
so I think that's you got Nintendo

3325
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I do think we'll get a version of

3326
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Monsters somewhere I think there'll be a version

3327
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
of their Monsters somewhere out here

3328
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I'd like that and then I do

3329
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
think Wicked is number one I think Wicked

3330
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
goes in Orlando we're out here

3331
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
faster than we expect

3332
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
does it knock out fast and furious

3333
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
in Universal Studios Florida

3334
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
potentially

3335
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I could see it being a bigger

3336
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
they wanted to have a bigger footprint for it cause

3337
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
that's pretty small so you think it's built fast

3338
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
but it's also huge

3339
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
yeah I think it's I think like Wicked replaces

3340
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Toon Lagoon I don't know that as a rumor

3341
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
but I think it's that size of a project

3342
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
don't you dare tell me that Wicked replaces

3343
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Race Through New York starring Jimmy Fallon

3344
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I think it's too small

3345
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I think there's a new coaster

3346
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
that will replace Rip Ride Rocket

3347
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
possibly the Fast and Furious coaster

3348
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
a different version of it

3349
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
but I think

3350
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
that I think that a lot of this

3351
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
city walk stuff and hotels is in

3352
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
preparation for what

3353
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
our park looks like in five years

3354
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
that's the vibe I'm getting

3355
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that's what people have said

3356
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
so just to recap

3357
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
parking lot behind

3358
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
current city walk becomes a

3359
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
hotel this we know we think a hotel

3360
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
over by

3361
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
over the area that they've cleared

3362
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
out where iFly used to be

3363
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
do you still believe any more

3364
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
park over there or is that kind of an

3365
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
impossible by iFly

3366
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
yes I believe that I think there's lands

3367
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I think there'll be enough to can you can they

3368
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
somehow turn it into a second gate

3369
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
or is that insane I think you

3370
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I think they could do it I just don't think

3371
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
they will do it I

3372
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
think if they're opening one

3373
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
hotel they're going to need a bunch

3374
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
new attractions let alone two

3375
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
hotels yes that's for sure

3376
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I just think I just think the second

3377
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
gate I don't think they want

3378
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I don't think I don't

3379
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
think they want to build it all at once

3380
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
now I hope I'm wrong because that would be really

3381
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
cool if they did because then you could

3382
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
you could fix the problems of

3383
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
universal Hollywood with a second

3384
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
gate in a sense that like

3385
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
universal Hollywood still is like I

3386
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
don't know if it's completely fixable to

3387
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
put in the magic

3388
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
that it needs to make it on par

3389
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
with Disney just because it's

3390
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
still very piecemeal the

3391
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
flow of it is a little awkward yes

3392
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
there's plenty of magic yeah it was built in this

3393
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
weird janky way unlike universal Florida

3394
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
which at least did start as a new theme park

3395
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
designed from the ground up it's always been

3396
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
around weird this movie theater

3397
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
staying and these bungalows are staying

3398
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
but I think they've done a tremendous

3399
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
job oh absolutely but it does still have

3400
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
to remain a working studio

3401
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
and offices need to not move it's

3402
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
weird it's some of the same awkwardness

3403
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
as Disneyland expanding as opposed to

3404
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Disney World yeah and that's the

3405
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I like it I've heard people be negative

3406
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
about it that's the charm of like

3407
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
you see Fast and the Furious from Hogs

3408
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
or Hogwarts or something like you see

3409
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I love it all just slapped together

3410
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I love that yeah new coaster

3411
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
will be whipping by big minion

3412
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
it's like the it's like you know

3413
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
hey it's magic of the movies

3414
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
it is kind of true in spirit

3415
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
not chosen of universal

3416
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Hollywood but the original

3417
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
universal Florida where it was like

3418
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
a movie studio there's

3419
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
lots of stuff going on I'm a big

3420
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
defender of it but I do think

3421
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
it would be really cool to have

3422
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
like an Islands of Adventure

3423
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Port of Entry second gate

3424
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
where you did get Jason's

3425
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
noise

3426
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
like if we could get like a

3427
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Toon Lagoon out here

3428
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
new Toon Lagoon

3429
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
guess what everybody new for

3430
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
2028 Dudley Do-Right

3431
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
well I would pick that over a lot

3432
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
of things I'd pick that over Wicked

3433
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Wicked's fine I like

3434
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Wicked but

3435
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I was saying this you could

3436
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
do like a themed hotel that looked into

3437
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
a land you could do Wicked

3438
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Hotel right there and it looks into a wicked

3439
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
land these all do feel like more of

3440
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
like Disneyland Paris style

3441
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
or what they've done recently

3442
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
in Tokyo like hotel that's like

3443
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
backdrop to theme park

3444
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
or entrance to theme park right

3445
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
because the one that's in front of the

3446
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
entrance you'd still see in from

3447
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
it's a fairly tall

3448
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
hotel from the paperwork

3449
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
so like you're looking into the park

3450
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but if they do build a hotel right where

3451
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
iFly was and they put

3452
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
stuff behind it there's no

3453
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
way you're not looking right into the park

3454
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
like that has to be an element of it

3455
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
so I don't know if that hotel has to be it doesn't

3456
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
necessarily have to be themed like the land

3457
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
whatever they decide to put there but it could

3458
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
be it could be a monsters

3459
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
area with a monsters hotel

3460
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
this is a complete speculation

3461
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
on my part the movies and stage

3462
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
plays and going back to the original

3463
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Frank Baum books

3464
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Wizard of Oz

3465
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
has entertained people for generations

3466
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
so hey listen

3467
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I don't believe you

3468
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I don't think he's right on that

3469
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Hold on

3470
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
fucking Emerald City hotel

3471
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
is like that's like a home run

3472
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
well we already had it it was called the MGM

3473
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
grant well but that was unlucky

3474
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
you don't want to enter through for a half second

3475
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I thought you said Emerald City the chef

3476
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I mean sure yeah

3477
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
start your day with a bam

3478
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
so I think all of that's

3479
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
on the table I do think

3480
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
maybe there'll be another Harry Potter I think

3481
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Monsters and Wicked and then more Nintendo

3482
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
is probably in our near future

3483
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
now I'm just like how can

3484
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I get that Wicked simulator

3485
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
experience to transition

3486
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
straight into something with Ryan Perez

3487
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm on a streak now I don't know

3488
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
how I'm getting greedy

3489
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I could see the Wicked I could also see the Wicked

3490
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
finale

3491
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
just being there for three years until the land is

3492
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
built or something it's a little stop

3493
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I could see it be just like we need to get into the park now

3494
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
that's why we got to get rid of Fast

3495
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
because they're going to like I don't

3496
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I also think it's Wicked

3497
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
because why close

3498
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
it now if you're not going to

3499
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
put something new in there

3500
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
that might be Fast because that second

3501
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
movie comes out in the fall

3502
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
of 2025 right it could be Fast but you know what I'm saying

3503
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
like what's the why wouldn't you just keep

3504
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
it open as the finale

3505
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
sure because if it was a new finale

3506
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
because we still don't get Fast and Furious for another

3507
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
year right right there's got to be something

3508
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
they want in Fast to be the finale

3509
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I assume yeah

3510
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
so it was very abrupt too

3511
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
that they announced that closure

3512
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
no one was sad

3513
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
no one gives a shit

3514
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
my prediction for Wicked part two

3515
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
is that it's kind of like an awards season

3516
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
sweep in the way that

3517
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Lord of the Rings Return of the

3518
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
King of like alright

3519
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
there's been thrill let's get the last one

3520
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
the awards yeah yeah

3521
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I don't know about that

3522
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
well part two

3523
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
is I think act two of Wicked

3524
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
is the more supposedly the more

3525
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
upsetting

3526
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
part of Wicked

3527
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
the dramatic south

3528
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
that's another thing when I watched this weird demo

3529
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Oscars I got to watch

3530
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
a rehearsal of the opening performance

3531
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
with two people who were not Cynthia

3532
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and Ariana and they didn't sing

3533
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
either but they did mouth

3534
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
the words so I basically

3535
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
sat there let's go down clips

3536
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
play we love Los Angeles and then two

3537
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
people come out and just like

3538
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
silently pantomime the song

3539
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
that's weird I didn't know they did

3540
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
stuff like that but even that

3541
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
was very stirring because it was

3542
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
still the orchestra playing still

3543
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
all the chorus like popped in from the

3544
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
from all the balconies like that

3545
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
made me emotional and it

3546
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
wasn't even the real

3547
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
that really is the magic

3548
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
of the movies just people going

3549
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
through the like a rehearsal

3550
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
live rehearsal yeah we'll put

3551
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
it in later or we'll tape we'll

3552
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
do a take later it really got to me

3553
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
and then and also the woman who

3554
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
did the big final note who was

3555
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
the stand in Cynthia Revo like

3556
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
dung and then there's just the space

3557
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
left and she just mouthed it she just

3558
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
went and she got a

3559
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
huge applause I think everybody really

3560
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
enjoyed applauding somebody who

3561
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
was on mute doing the final

3562
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
note that's great

3563
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
that of course that musical number at the Oscars

3564
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
yes

3565
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
started with Ariana Grande

3566
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
singing somewhere with a rainbow

3567
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
oh yes they kind of made it yeah they got

3568
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
they went all in and then the whiz

3569
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
later in the show

3570
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
they got to all of them

3571
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
but anyways

3572
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
now so you know

3573
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
what started we started all

3574
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
grim because our beloved land

3575
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
is being picked apart

3576
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
but now what we're finding is that maybe it's

3577
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
for very good reasons and exciting reasons

3578
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
but where does that leave us with are we

3579
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
worried about like

3580
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
what if big chunks do

3581
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
disappear what if we lose entire sectors

3582
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
this is my theory that you guys seem to disagree

3583
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
with what I said about sector one

3584
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
that they're all gone like currently there's almost

3585
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
nothing there I think it's possible

3586
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
and Bill Bong's out I think it's possible they

3587
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
yank that entire structure that's

3588
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
what I was trying to figure out because that one's

3589
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
kind of an island I think any

3590
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
any sector right

3591
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
any like CityWalk technically is broken up into

3592
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
like seven different buildings you see

3593
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and I think that if any that are

3594
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
attached to a parking garage are safe

3595
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
they're not rebuilding any parking garages

3596
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
that'd be a waste of money I think

3597
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
cause you're gonna need people

3598
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I think are there multiple

3599
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
security stations

3600
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
there's gonna be cause if you park in the

3601
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
ET one you'll go through one set

3602
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
they're gonna have to fix this

3603
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
problem of that there's eight ways to get into

3604
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
CityWalk and you don't know where any of them

3605
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
take you or where they take you out

3606
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I think any flat parking is

3607
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
gonna go away

3608
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
a lot of it absolutely yeah

3609
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
but any parking garage is staying

3610
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
then I was analyzing other buildings and I was like

3611
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
okay some of these do have offices

3612
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
up top where people work

3613
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
sector one with Bill of Bong and the

3614
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
wave pool they don't use anymore there's nothing

3615
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
going on there I could see that becoming

3616
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
like a little bit of extra

3617
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
hotel maybe not maybe they don't have to

3618
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
but something's moving in one of the stores

3619
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
isn't it yes there's some like

3620
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
cutesy character store but I still think

3621
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I still think you could evict

3622
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
that 10 months later I it's

3623
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
possible to do that I just don't know why

3624
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
they wouldn't immediately move it

3625
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
to some other empty store which they

3626
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
have plenty seemingly plenty of

3627
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
so that's the only reason I'm skeptical

3628
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
of that and because one of the pictures of

3629
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
of a permit or a plan

3630
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
didn't show that

3631
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
area gone you could retrofit

3632
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
that building in to incorporate

3633
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
it into a larger building

3634
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
and knock down some walls and stuff

3635
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
and I think the

3636
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
what is your daughter like

3637
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
the line friends yeah I think

3638
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
if those were temporary

3639
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I think they'd try to

3640
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
full court press like

3641
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
marketing pop up

3642
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
like only here for a little

3643
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
while you know sure I mean it's

3644
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
possible I if

3645
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
if something moves into Bill of Bong we'll know

3646
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I think if they move

3647
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
something into the billable if you find out

3648
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
it's happening you tell us you don't keep that secret

3649
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
from us right don't these accounts

3650
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
out there you come to us right

3651
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
this matters to us we got

3652
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
skin in the game yes it's very important

3653
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
but I feel like things actually

3654
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
are pointing to a perhaps a changed

3655
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
city walk but a thriving

3656
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
city walk because it might be the

3657
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
you know the conduit to even more

3658
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
traffic than it's than it's ever been before

3659
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
city walk might be more important

3660
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
than it's ever been and I even say

3661
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I would dare say if these two hotels are

3662
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
built maybe you can

3663
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
find something to do after nine p.m.

3664
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
maybe things will have to stay open

3665
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
a little later and I'm

3666
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
not always wanting to party late at

3667
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
night at city walk anymore but it would be nice

3668
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
to have the option so if there's a bunch of

3669
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
other people that are going to be walking around

3670
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
maybe later at night

3671
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
you're going to have to have a little more fun available

3672
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I don't know that Howl at the Moon

3673
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
will reopen there's no talk of that but I just hope

3674
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
there'll be some saying that if you

3675
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
bring hundreds if not

3676
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
thousands of people plant

3677
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
them directly in city

3678
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
walk yes they're likely going to

3679
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
want to enjoy food beverages

3680
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
and various amenities I am making

3681
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
this point yeah I never considered yeah

3682
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
how about it think about it

3683
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
when you go home tonight I will but are they

3684
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
going to keep me up at night are they willing

3685
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
to make a city walk that has things

3686
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
for people to do that they like

3687
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
to do I don't know that's

3688
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
probably the big push and pull right now universal

3689
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
is do we want to make this okay now

3690
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
this isn't us don't you see

3691
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
well they are putting in a

3692
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
weird third party escape room

3693
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
company oh right we missed that

3694
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Samba Brazilian Steakhouse

3695
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
is now an escape room and that's okay

3696
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
so this is why I okay real quick before

3697
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
we do the big finale oh real

3698
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
quick

3699
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I do think that at one

3700
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
point they were thinking they would put mostly

3701
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
universal owned businesses places

3702
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
because they have an escape

3703
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
room in Orlando with their

3704
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
IP with their classic

3705
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
things and for some reason they're

3706
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
not just cloning it and moving

3707
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
it over here it's probably

3708
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
because it's bad and I have

3709
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
to assume that

3710
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
because this is like a company that

3711
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
has a place in Woodland Hills I think at the mall

3712
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
escapology this is they have

3713
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
other locations and they have like there's

3714
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
going to be a Batman escape room

3715
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
at City Walk which is funny

3716
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
which probably won't be good

3717
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
but it's funny that like Batman's showing up

3718
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Scooby Doo but to me

3719
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
that's the waving the white flag already

3720
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
of like we just don't have the resources to

3721
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
own every business at City

3722
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Walk yeah okay but

3723
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I'm sure at some point the thought

3724
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
was like yeah we're going to do these escape rooms and then we're moving

3725
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
them over why not

3726
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
we did all the work anyway

3727
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
why wouldn't they have done why wouldn't they just

3728
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
put them over they got too much to do I guess

3729
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
that's what I that's my theory is that

3730
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
maybe at a certain point they were like trying

3731
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
like our ultimate goal is to own

3732
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
everything because why not but then at a certain

3733
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
point they went we can't do this and there

3734
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
is we can barely open up toothsome

3735
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
and keep it edible

3736
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
there there's something in the

3737
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
because downtown Disney in Orlando

3738
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
in the former Disney Quest space

3739
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
that was the NBA experience

3740
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
mostly the NBA experience

3741
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
is getting what is

3742
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
essentially an off-brand Disney

3743
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Quest like it's another like

3744
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
laser tag escape like

3745
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
no name yeah it is

3746
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
really interesting yeah

3747
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
so it's gone full circle

3748
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
right but can we just decide that

3749
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
we like these things we need things to

3750
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
do for god's sake we can't

3751
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
just wear helmets at home

3752
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I got kids I got to take them somewhere

3753
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
can we keep these places around

3754
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
well I if you're going

3755
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
to outsource it just outsource it to

3756
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Dave and Buster's or round one

3757
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I

3758
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
listen to the the recent Dough Boys

3759
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
episode with Griffin Newman where they

3760
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
went to Chuck E. Cheese

3761
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and had a horrifying experience

3762
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
and it is a very

3763
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
funny podcast episode

3764
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I went I went to a kid's birthday party

3765
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
there this very weekend

3766
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
and like oh my god that is an

3767
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
unpleasant Chuck E. Cheese and I'm a fan of

3768
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
the brand and I'm still yeah and I got to

3769
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
watch my son be confused like

3770
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
he was trying to say hi to

3771
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Chuck who is of course a robot who

3772
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
doesn't respond or move

3773
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and I had to explain to him

3774
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
dad why isn't Chuck

3775
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
saying hi to me and

3776
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
why does he look different than the other Chuck

3777
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
and I said son this is the

3778
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
there's a lot about parenting

3779
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I don't understand but this is the moment I've been

3780
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
waiting for my whole life

3781
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
this I can do can you just

3782
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
clarify when you go to Chuck E.

3783
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Cheese now with kids you have to buy

3784
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
socks there and kids have to

3785
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
put them on yes yeah you buy

3786
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
like I don't know anything

3787
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
about this this is not insane it's not just

3788
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
for there no I know I know I get

3789
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it but I'm like that is

3790
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
no wonder they were saying

3791
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
it stinks in there if every

3792
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
child is changing socks

3793
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
that's so nasty

3794
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
that is gross

3795
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I have stood up

3796
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
everyone's looking at me yeah what's happening

3797
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
so now I'll do the rest of the show standing

3798
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
whoa this is weird it is

3799
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
weird so I went to Billabong

3800
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
unless you have something else I want to

3801
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
close out the I have nowhere

3802
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
to go now that you've stood I'm so

3803
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I was like I had been keeping

3804
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
my eye on the prices at Billabong

3805
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I had been and they were bad I went in

3806
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
there was a big dirty like plastic

3807
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
tub they were selling for ten dollars

3808
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
that they kept in the stock room to

3809
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
like store t-shirts or something and I was

3810
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
like what ten dollars for a dirty tub

3811
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
like what do they want

3812
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
two dollars maybe if you need a

3813
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
tub you can buy a new one for

3814
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
this price so I went in there last day

3815
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
well maybe there will be like some deals or whatever

3816
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
maybe it would be something funny

3817
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
now I saw universal high posted that

3818
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
day this is of course parallel thinking

3819
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
that they went in and bought

3820
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
some hangers some coat

3821
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
hangers from Billabong and

3822
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
plants and like

3823
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
and I was thinking the same thing

3824
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I go are they selling like parts

3825
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
of the of the like retail

3826
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
space or stuff on the wall or whatever

3827
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
and I go wouldn't it be fun to go in there

3828
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and do this so I went in

3829
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and I immediately there were hats

3830
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
that were pretty reasonably

3831
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000

02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
wave Santa would have been put into

4015
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
a wood chipper

4016
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
what Santa would be dead if not for you

4017
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
he saved a life

4018
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I'm really disclosing a lot

4019
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
of my correspondence but I sent this to universal high

4020
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
and they were like what the fuck where was that

4021
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
so I think wave

4022
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Santa was hanging out in the back

4023
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
for a while and all of a sudden just popped

4024
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
up and I just

4025
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
it was it was fate that I

4026
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
would get wave Santa oh my

4027
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
god wow

4028
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
this is really you know

4029
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
in an episode where I tried to share

4030
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
some of my my Hollywood magic

4031
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I got to experience and then where I

4032
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
when I thought it would get Hollywood tragic

4033
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
instead you have

4034
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
brought a wonderful new

4035
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
character into our lives

4036
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
your pictures are great and I don't

4037
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
want to create work for you sure but

4038
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
it does occur to me that putting

4039
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
them all into a video would be

4040
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
a moving experience if there's a

4041
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
way to all right all right if you have

4042
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
a minute no pressure maybe

4043
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
with that fast and furious when

4044
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I see you again

4045
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I was probably gonna do the city walk theme but maybe

4046
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I'll do that oh yeah you can do that too

4047
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
or despacito maybe oh despacito

4048
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
is also good fast furious

4049
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
was just in my mind cause we talked about it so much

4050
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
yeah yeah I mean

4051
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
just I don't know this guy making it

4052
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
him like propelling himself out of the

4053
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
ocean into our world

4054
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
yeah not being held down

4055
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
despite being an unusual color

4056
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
all I can think of is this

4057
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
guy is wave santa singing defying

4058
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
gravity oh yeah

4059
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I'm defying

4060
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
gravity

4061
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I'm surfing

4062
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
high defying

4063
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
gravity

4064
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
ho ho ho

4065
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
ho ho ho

4066
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
ho ho ho

4067
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
anytime I try to do that

4068
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I just end up doing the Tarzan

4069
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
yell cause I

4070
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
kept seeing that Brian Blessed

4071
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
talking about doing the Tarzan yell

4072
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
and getting two contracts

4073
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
for Tarzan the movie

4074
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
close enough I'm realizing now

4075
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
is wave santa like is it

4076
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
is this an original character to the

4077
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
store or is this something in other billabongs

4078
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
well listeners

4079
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
if you have billabongs near you and

4080
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
if you've done Christmas shopping at billabong

4081
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
then you're gonna have

4082
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
to let us know that yeah cause if

4083
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
not I think we just I just bought the

4084
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
IP wow you've bought an

4085
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
entire IP for five bucks

4086
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
wave santa yeah

4087
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
but you didn't sign any contracts

4088
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
that like give you the exclusive

4089
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
rights as far as you can tell I don't think so

4090
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
but I think it's best to assume yeah

4091
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I love him it definitely

4092
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000

shipped from Corpip but it also

4098
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000

at a Staples copy and print center

4100
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
