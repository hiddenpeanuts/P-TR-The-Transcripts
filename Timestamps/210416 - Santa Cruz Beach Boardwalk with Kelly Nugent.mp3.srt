1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,280
Whoa, warning, man.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,560
The following podcast features fun, sun,

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,540
and surfing cave bed.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,160
Grab your lotion or oil or your tanning butter

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,840
as we breathe along the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,400
with guest Kelly Dugent.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,640
Hey, cowabunga, man.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
This podcast the ride.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,360
that today we'll try to focus on actual rides

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,000
and not a store called the Octopus's Garden Gift Shop.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,480
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,120
under the sea, Jason Sheridan.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,760
Yeah, I mean, between the Octopus's Garden

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,160
and like all of the long gone closed stuff

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,520
and just the past, the past looms large

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,820
at this destination.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,080
We're gonna try.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay, Scott, you're gonna hear as well?

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,720
I know, it's a good thing there's some very good rides

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,280
because it'd be easy to get lost in the woods.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
I wanna know about this gift shop though.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,460
I didn't previously, so we're gonna have to carve out

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,300
some time.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,440
Anytime, the podcast dangerously veers into Ringo's

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,160
star obsession territory with me a lot.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,160
And again, I'm trying, if you hear like me going,

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,240
it's like I wanna talk about Ringo and this gift shop,

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,000
which I assume he knows a lot about

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,320
and definitely gave his blessing to.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
Personally approved.

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah, a lot of Ringo lately, a lot of Leno.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,320
Obviously Buffett Beach Boys always around the corner,

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
we know the topic, we will stay

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,480
and there's such good rides here,

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
so we promise we'll be good today.

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
There's very good rides.

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,300
Of course, I did discover that the nearby Sun and Sand Inn

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,920
offers cookies every day from three to five.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
But we'll get to the lodging if it comes to it.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
There's only a couple.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
Let's bring in our guest to prevent me from talking about

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
Ringo Starr's solo music career and all the songs

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,840
that I like that I feel like people don't appreciate enough.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
So I will not do that.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
I do myself.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,520
Yes, that's your friend and I don't.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Bring the guest in,

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
this will make me not have to talk about this.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
You know her from the podcasts Exile and Teen Creeps.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Kelly Nugent.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
Hey guys, thank you so much for having me.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
Hey, thanks for coming.

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Thanks for doing the show.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
Thanks for talking about a place

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,400
that we all wish we could visit.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,840
Ah, wish I was there, wish I was there.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,000
I do feel bad because I know you were like begging

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,800
for anyone to give you a reason to not talk about Ringo,

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,200
but I did have a question upon hearing what you said.

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,960
I was like, is that an actual gift shop?

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,360
I looked at the website and it said,

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,480
that's what the name of the gift shop is called.

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,640
And I got very excited because it's a Beatles reference.

67
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
So yes, that is real.

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
I did not make that up.

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,640
I would, sounds like some place I would make up,

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
but I did not.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
Okay, I don't mean to derail straight off,

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
but like, do we know what kind of product they sell?

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Like, is it specific to Ringo?

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,120
No, it's not specific to Ringo.

75
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,600
I wish it was all Ringo star hats and shirts.

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
That would be incredible.

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,760
It says Santa Cruz inspired clothing, hats, stickers,

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,080
and gifts, as well as a wide selection

79
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,520
of sunglasses and sundries.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, all of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk stores

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,160
seem to sell similar surf inspired items.

82
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,480
But if it was like surf Ringo and he was like peace and love

83
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,240
while he was on a surfboard in the water,

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,200
I mean, that would, the sales would triple, quadruple.

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,760
So we're throwing that idea out for these places for free

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
if they want them.

87
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,480
They got a Darth Vader and it says,

88
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,320
may the surf be with you.

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
So that's cool.

90
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,280
I don't think that's, why Darth for that though?

91
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
I guess it's not force.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,000
So he, I guess he might say, may the surf be with you.

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
It's a little muddy, but whatever.

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Hey, it looks cool.

95
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,640
Nobody's thinking about it that hard.

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,760
I shouldn't either.

97
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,320
Yeah, so yeah, not Ringo specific.

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
As far as we know, maybe there is a Ringo section in there,

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,480
but I don't know.

100
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm hoping I haven't been-

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
I mean, missed opportunity, missed opportunity

102
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,720
if they don't have it.

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Yeah, for sure.

104
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,760
At least obviously they would have cute octopus stuff

105
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,760
and it would be, you know, lines from the song maybe.

106
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Yeah.

107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
That's kids, kids, that kid could wear that

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
and not be beaten up at school.

109
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,560
Like a child, a young child would go with a Ringo Starship

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
and be like, this is the coolest.

111
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Like if I had a son, he'd be like,

112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
daddy says this is the coolest celebrity on the planet.

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
A 90 year old Ringo star.

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,240
And then the kid's just right in his stomach,

115
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
punch right in his stomach.

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,840
Well, I also just, I feel like it's such a,

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,040
because you know how you see all those like tweets

118
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,400
that are like, what if you old kids

119
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
don't even know who blah, blah, blah is?

120
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,400
Like, I feel like there would be such little context

121
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,160
that maybe this hypothetical son could fly under the radar

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
and people would just be like,

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
okay, man, I mean, whatever.

124
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,800
I think that's cool.

125
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
Yeah.

126
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Who is that?

127
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,320
You're saying I'm, my references will be so out of it.

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes.

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,440
By that point that the kids won't even know

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,000
to make fun of this hypothetical son of mine.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
So yeah, he may be fine.

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,600
He may be, oh, okay, he's got that older man on his shirt.

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,800
That must be a cool guy I've never heard of.

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
Yeah.

135
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,880
So yeah, that's a dream I can hold on to at least.

136
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,320
But we're talking Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk today.

137
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,520
Yes.

138
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,360
A place that none of the hosts have been.

139
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
I've been.

140
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,020
You've never been there?

141
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,280
I've been at the beach part,

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
but I did not have time to go to the amusement park part.

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,840
I know that it was beautiful and chill,

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,720
but I didn't know how wonderful some of these rides were

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
and a lot of the mythology and everything.

146
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,040
So I really wish I'd gotten to go,

147
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,520
but Kelly, you've been clearly.

148
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Yes.

149
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
What's your story with this place?

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay, I do feel tricky being the person

151
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
that wants to talk about this,

152
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,960
because I didn't grow up in Santa Cruz.

153
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,400
I don't have these childhood memories of like,

154
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,660
oh my God, me and my friends used to go to the boardwalk.

155
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,400
First of all, I was not allowed to do anything

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
when I was a kid.

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,080
So I wasn't, even if I lived near it,

158
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,200
I would not have been at the boardwalk.

159
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,920
You weren't allowed to have stories growing up?

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
Yeah, no.

161
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,160
No, I mean, my stories were like,

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
I sat at a dining room table

163
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
and like stared at a math book and was sad.

164
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
So.

165
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
What a story.

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,600
I was like alone.

167
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,560
Yeah, it was great.

168
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,960
I went there for the first time probably in college

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,800
because a friend of mine's family lived out there.

170
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
So we went there to visit it.

171
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,700
And that visit, I think I did the whole gamut of rides.

172
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,200
I did like all the different rides,

173
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,200
the big old roller coaster, classic giant dipper.

174
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,220
It's like wooden roller coaster,

175
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,040
shared lap bar with the person that you're sitting next to.

176
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,520
So if you are someone who's smaller like me

177
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,920
and I was sitting next to someone

178
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,120
who was like six, four or something,

179
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,880
I did fear for my life, like going down the drop

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,720
because it was safe for him,

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
but it was not safe for me.

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
But also it's the boardwalk, so who cares?

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
Right.

184
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,040
But it's so safe.

185
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,120
I hate to say this though, this is an attraction.

186
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
It's been around for a long time,

187
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,240
so it's had a lot of opportunities to kill people

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,280
and it has killed three people.

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
So.

190
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,440
I hate to tell you that now, but you're off,

191
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,520
you're not on it now, so everything's okay.

192
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,600
But again, there's Disney rides that haven't killed anybody

193
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
but they haven't been around as long.

194
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,400
There's a century of opportunity for death.

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,520
So, and most of them were a long time ago

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,400
before there were better safety standards.

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
So I'm sure nothing to worry about now.

198
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
No bars maybe.

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,120
Simultaneously, a historical landmark

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,040
along with the carousel, the giant dipper,

201
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
a historical landmark.

202
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,360
In fact, the picture, I wonder if I can ever find it,

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,040
because they snap a picture of you as you go down.

204
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,520
I swear my jaw is like unhinged

205
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,200
because I was truly shrieking for my life

206
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
because I was suspended in air

207
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,040
and was just gripping with my hands on the lap bar

208
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,680
because I was like, oh, I will just fly out

209
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,520
of the top of this car.

210
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,800
Yeah, yes.

211
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
That would be interesting.

212
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
I mean, you should find that

213
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,880
because I would, there's like a newer Six Flags coaster

214
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,160
that like has like really strong restraints

215
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,400
and it still felt like I was flying out of it.

216
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
It was the Twisted Colossus.

217
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,320
And I would like to see what older technology

218
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
to restrain someone in looks like.

219
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
It's just a lap bar.

220
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
Yeah, it's just a metal.

221
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,720
It's just the shared,

222
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,920
it's like one, so you just pull it down

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,920
to whomever has taller legs and then hope for the best.

224
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Yeah.

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,280
And by the time you realize it,

226
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,200
there's like a teenager that's like, okay, go,

227
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,680
and then it's just going and you're like,

228
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
oh, but I'm not, it's fine.

229
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,600
Yeah, the Santa Cruz teens who work there

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,320
are not so diligent maybe as far as safety.

231
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
No.

232
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
I assume also- At least they weren't

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,120
when I was in college.

234
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah, I bet they haven't changed.

235
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Well, they do go out of their way on the website

236
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,320
to say they have four engineers every day

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,000
like checking on this thing every few hours.

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah. What?

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,640
Like on call, they have full-time like mechanics and stuff.

240
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
There's also a full medical staff on call

241
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,840
all the time for this ride.

242
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
He's listing all the things they have,

243
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,000
a defibrillator in case your heart stops.

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
The medical staff does,

245
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
they transport on the Skyglider though,

246
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,280
so it will take a significant amount of time.

247
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
They have to wait in line too.

248
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,000
They've got to wait in line and if it stops,

249
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
it could be upwards of 10 minutes.

250
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah.

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,400
Kelly, when you went on this,

252
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,320
is this one of those things where you were terrified

253
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,920
and you were like, I'm not going on that again,

254
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,120
or it was like right back in line?

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh, I was never gonna go on that ride ever again in my life.

256
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Got it.

257
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,240
Okay, so it was that kind of thing.

258
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,160
It was scary.

259
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I truly was, it was one of those things where,

260
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
so I was in college at the time,

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,080
so I was like, oh, this is fun and scary,

262
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
and then we didn't go on that ride again,

263
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,400
and then for my Bachelorette trip,

264
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
basically my three best friends arranged

265
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,920
a spooky tour of the California coast,

266
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,640
and so we went to go see all these haunted places

267
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,200
and also went to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk,

268
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
and as an adult, I saw that ride and I was like,

269
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,160
I will not be riding that ride again.

270
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Now that I'm in my 30s,

271
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,080
I don't need to do anything to anyone going to perish.

272
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Interesting, so yeah, you were not looking to conquer it.

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,320
That was, you were done with it.

274
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,160
I was done.

275
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,120
Yeah.

276
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,360
But then we went on rides that I had overlooked

277
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,120
as possibly being babyish or boring

278
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,880
on the second trip that I went there,

279
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,160
and those rides, I mean, 10 out of 10,

280
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,680
Cave Train is amazing, amazing.

281
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, my friends, Tyler and Kia,

282
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
who've spent a lot of time up there,

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
I asked them, what's the big stuff to hit,

284
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,760
and they said, just mainly Cave Train.

285
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,880
Anything else you get to, whatever.

286
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
Cave Train is the shit.

287
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
Make sure you get a lot of Cave Train in there.

288
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,040
I couldn't believe this ride.

289
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,000
This looks like a, I cannot wait to go on this thing,

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,240
and it's, I mean, it's not just Cave Train,

291
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,080
but some of these other dark rides that they have are long.

292
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,600
These are massive rides with so many animatronics,

293
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,240
fairly limited animatronics,

294
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,040
but you feel the heart and spirit in the making of them.

295
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,520
Yes. Yes.

296
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Really good, yeah.

297
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,080
Haunted Castle goes under the Boardwalk,

298
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,960
which was very popular for a certain while

299
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,240
on the Jersey Shore towns, in the amusement parks there.

300
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Now, on the East Coast, that's a real dicey proposition,

301
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,400
because while that is very fun,

302
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,240
you are subject to hurricane storm surges,

303
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,880
and every now and then, once in a generation,

304
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,240
Superstorm that does this to theme parks,

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,600
because this is in Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

306
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,640
So Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is built,

307
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,560
like the amusement park is built parallel to the Boardwalk.

308
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600
On the East Coast, beach down parks are built

309
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
similar to Santa Cruz Boardwalk,

310
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
but just kind of in a patch of land,

311
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,120
or they're built on the piers,

312
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,880
which again, subject to storm surges,

313
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,040
sometimes hurricanes take those parks away.

314
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,080
Wait, explain that photo, Jason.

315
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,640
It's like there's a roller coaster

316
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,840
that's just not on the pier anymore.

317
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
It's in the Osh.

318
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,880
Yes.

319
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,160
So Sandy hit the Jersey Shore pretty hard,

320
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,280
and Wildwood and Seaside Heights,

321
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,040
two towns on different parts of Jersey,

322
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,880
they built their parks on piers going out into the water,

323
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,680
and the Seaside Heights park,

324
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,400
just the pier part of it collapsed,

325
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,680
and the whole roller coaster just plopped down

326
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
into the water.

327
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,840
Are you trying to put Santa Cruz on notice?

328
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,640
This could happen to you.

329
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,240
Well, I did find historical photos

330
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,960
where there are one pier that used to have

331
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,680
a water intake pipe on it that would fill the indoor pool

332
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
was partially destroyed by a storm,

333
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,920
but when you build the park further back

334
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,280
behind the Boardwalk, less chance of damage.

335
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,960
So you're saying Santa Cruz is better prepared for a storm.

336
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,400
You just want us to know about the storm

337
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
possibility. Yeah.

338
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
The storm possibilities before we start talking

339
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
about these fun rides.

340
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Well, compare and contrast.

341
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,640
They were in the middle of talking about a fun ride,

342
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
and then like, but hang on, storm possibilities.

343
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah, no.

344
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,680
Also in the listed things they have,

345
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,200
like doctors on staff, they also have you on staff being like,

346
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,120
guys, this could go away at any time.

347
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,640
You're like a Doc Brown style, like, it's coming, it's coming.

348
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Look at this photo from the other coast.

349
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Get off the ride, kids.

350
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
For the sake of listeners.

351
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
You've got some interesting literature

352
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
underneath your seat.

353
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
And it's the picture.

354
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,520
For the sake of listeners, because my impression

355
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,040
of seaside Boardwalk is a little different than this one.

356
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
I mean, they were more popular on the East Coast

357
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
than on the West Coast.

358
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,720
Santa Cruz Boardwalk is one of the bigger ones

359
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,120
and one of the few still around on the West Coast.

360
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Yeah, that's a miracle.

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Oldest surviving one.

362
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
So let's hope, let's hope that Santa Cruz

363
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,440
so let's hope, let's hope the storm never comes

364
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,120
for these cute little rides that I like from the video.

365
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,440
This is also. Not a huge storm either.

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
No storms, not a capital storm.

367
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
I don't want any storms in this place.

368
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,800
No one's can, no one should storm the Boardwalk.

369
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,480
Oh, yeah.

370
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,440
No, let the cave people be.

371
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
Political.

372
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,360
That's right.

373
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,920
This is one of the older places we've talked.

374
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,440
I think Kennywood might be a little older than this,

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,320
but this park goes back to 1907.

376
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
Well, if the cave train is to be believed,

377
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,040
this park goes back to prehistoric times.

378
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,760
Yes. That's right.

379
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,640
You go to a world that has stayed intact

380
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,160
since prehistoric times that happened to exist.

381
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,120
It's a world that exists only under the Boardwalk.

382
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,320
It's a microcosm, entire other universe.

383
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,560
Which I. Perfectly preserved.

384
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
When you watch the video with the thing,

385
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I really like the like casual narration.

386
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,040
You're looking at the phrase cave train.

387
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Like, what does that even mean?

388
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,760
Like, is that a frequent thing that trains go into caves?

389
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,280
You have no real indication of what the premise

390
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,160
of the ride is going to be.

391
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,120
And then there's this folksy narration.

392
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,880
It's like, it's the funniest thing.

393
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,920
People were looking under the Boardwalk one time

394
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,640
and there was a whole race of cave people anyway.

395
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,720
So we thought that was neat.

396
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
Like, give you a chance to go see it.

397
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,080
It's just like tossed off in the amount of time

398
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
it takes to go through this hallway.

399
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,200
And then you do love that the name is kind of a misdirect.

400
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,160
Like, you don't know what if you because if you go on the ride

401
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,680
as I did, not knowing what was going to happen to me.

402
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,120
When you come upon the like scores of cave families and also

403
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,840
cave dinosaur families, because dinosaurs are also there.

404
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Coexisting, they're all friends, coexisting, all friends.

405
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,800
Sometimes they're fun little enemies for enemies.

406
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Sure, sure.

407
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Rivals.

408
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,720
You're it's deeply voyeuristic in a way that's like different

409
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,240
from other rides that have like families of animatronics

410
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,040
like doing things because like.

411
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,480
They're. It feels very uniquely, and I don't know,

412
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,840
maybe this I was just experiencing something myself

413
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,640
when I was going to this ride, but like I feel like a lot of other

414
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,840
animatronic rides, it's like this is a show that you're going to see.

415
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,160
Right. But like there's so little effort put into like.

416
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
A show for the person going through, it's just kind of like these

417
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,920
animatronics exist here and you get to go through it

418
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,280
and you see what is happening and that's kind of it.

419
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,480
They aren't in other words, they aren't like, hey, you're here.

420
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Welcome. They don't acknowledge you.

421
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,960
You're just watching them go about their day to day.

422
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,080
No, no, no, it is.

423
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,800
It is. They're not trying too hard.

424
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,680
You know, they're kind of just like, like, oh, we're playing cave volleyball.

425
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
Oh, did you know we have our own boardwalk?

426
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,720
Like it's gone back all the way since here.

427
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,560
We have a square dancing.

428
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,640
It's like there's a whole thing.

429
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,920
There's a drive in like it's amazing. Amazing.

430
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,680
It's like it's a very it's a crazy premise that. All right.

431
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,200
So you're going to go see underground cave world. Great.

432
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
What's what is that?

433
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm going to see a lot of like bats or what is this going to be?

434
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,640
No, it's a bunch of cave people all with a really united,

435
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,360
specific style of drawing that are or not drawn, but design.

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,840
Wallace and Gromody, very totally.

437
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
Nation looking. Absolutely. Yeah.

438
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
I thought Rugrats a little bit, too.

439
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,960
Yeah, a little.

440
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,320
There's some Garfield, too, though.

441
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

442
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,160
But there's definitely some Tommy Pickles faces like throughout the ride

443
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
in the in the dance hall scene.

444
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,880
That's like a step up from the Billy Joel piano man song.

445
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Like it kind of looks like the cave man version of that bar. Yes.

446
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,600
And I feel like there's also a lot of like no stakes,

447
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,920
like, oh, this thing's about to happen.

448
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,840
Stuff going on like.

449
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,440
Like there's like one where I'm trying to recall,

450
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,160
I think it's like a dinosaur is like hoisting up something

451
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
that's going to drop on like a cave person.

452
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,600
And yet I don't know how to put my finger on it,

453
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,400
but it lacks any of the urgency of like any other of setups of those kinds

454
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,120
that you see in like another

455
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,880
ride, you know, where you're like, oh, God, the dynamite's going to fall.

456
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,680
Or like, for example, in Pirates of the Caribbean, right?

457
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,800
When they're all like shooting at each other and there's like explosives

458
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,160
everywhere and there's that thing hanging above you.

459
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,360
I guess it's because nothing's ever hanging above you.

460
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,480
It's like to the side.

461
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,600
And it all looks like very obviously like paper mache.

462
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,800
And so you're just like, and if it falls on him, so what?

463
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,280
You know, danger is more casual in this time. Yes. Yes.

464
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,200
Yeah, it's a more brutal era.

465
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,160
Yes. It's going to happen.

466
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,800
It was brutal, brutal. Yeah.

467
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,520
They are similar to that.

468
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,160
There's a I think my favorite aspect of it.

469
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,360
Yeah. So it is like it's cave people who are also like beach dwellers.

470
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,880
They're doing the same thing that you're doing up on top of the boardwalk,

471
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,800
but they're doing it underground.

472
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,000
They're having like they're they're having fun burgers,

473
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,800
McBoulder burgers and dino dogs, and they're watching bands play and stuff.

474
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,440
They're having a fun seaside day just like you.

475
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,520
But there is a big sign that says sharkasaurus warning today.

476
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,680
So that feels like stakes a little bit.

477
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, it was going to be we're going to see a sharkasaurus

478
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
maybe at the end of the ride.

479
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,280
And then it's like 15 seconds later, there just is the sharkasaurus.

480
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,240
It's very big, but it's grinning.

481
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,280
It seems to be lunging at somebody, but you don't find out what happened.

482
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
And they're they're probably fine. I'm not worried about it.

483
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,640
No, exactly. No one's in peril.

484
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,880
Like you're just like, oh, I guess they're together.

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,560
There's also like interpersonal stuff happening between the animatronics.

486
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,720
Like you get to see kind of fun, like, oh, he's looking at her,

487
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,840
but he's with her. You know what I mean?

488
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,080
Like that kind of because they're all like swinging singles, like they're all

489
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,160
the vibrant, like Polly scene in the cave.

490
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,600
That's the brother.

491
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
They're Polly cave people. Yes.

492
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
And the big band era never ended, seemingly.

493
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,120
The big band era that once the big bands have played

494
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,400
the old coconut grove at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

495
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,040
There's still cave people,

496
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,600
big bands in the ride, the clam tones.

497
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,160
You got the clam tones playing.

498
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,880
That seems like a good show.

499
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,920
There's a lot of good that might be on the like our fake final four

500
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,280
is like full animatronic bands.

501
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,800
That's a that's a fun and electronic band area.

502
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,000
And that not says that really good one in the log ride.

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,360
And yeah, shout out to the clam tones. Good job.

504
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
And with the clam tones, I do want to say here,

505
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,560
I think this kind of falls in the same.

506
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,880
Mm, joie de vivre of the name, where it's like the clam tones,

507
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,960
like of the name of the ride, the clam tones.

508
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,200
There's no danger that the clam tones are playing the music that you hear.

509
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,240
Like they are supposed to be, but we all know, like their movements,

510
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,280
like there's not any way that the music that they are creating

511
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,800
is the music that we're hearing.

512
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,080
Do you know what I'm saying?

513
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,960
They don't suddenly that is not a speaker that you pass by

514
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,440
that's playing music similar to the instruments you see them playing.

515
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
It's entirely unrelated.

516
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,240
It like I feel like the ride is trying to tell us like,

517
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
you believe that they're playing this music, right?

518
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,040
But like, you know, like, there's no way it would be.

519
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,840
They're playing a different genre or something you're feeling.

520
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
Yeah. And just like the way that they're moving,

521
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,760
there's no possible way that like their range of motion

522
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,040
would be able to even at all play that kind of music.

523
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,960
It's very nice. I like it.

524
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,120
A lot of suspension of disbelief. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

525
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,640
Should we describe a little bit just looks wise?

526
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,240
We're talking about this this cave ride like it's very like

527
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,440
I wanted to say kind of it's it's a better version of the Kiss Mini Golf

528
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,240
in Vegas color wise.

529
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,000
There's like kind of totally low neon blacklight.

530
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Great blacklight. Right.

531
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,640
Like stuff going on.

532
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,360
But oh, it's low, low rent ish, I think, in a good way,

533
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,400
in a way that I actually feel like it gives it a vibe.

534
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
Oh, it's so super charming.

535
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,160
And the story that I looked up about it is that

536
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,840
they thought that this thing was kind of this was open in 1961.

537
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,640
In the late 90s, they thought this is decaying.

538
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,480
This is all right.

539
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,520
This was put in in Flintstones era.

540
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,680
Do people care about the Flintstones anymore?

541
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,240
Let's do something different here.

542
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,400
They were going to put a whole other dark ride in.

543
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,200
And then people started saying, but I love the cave people.

544
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,160
And I think the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk folks were like, they you do.

545
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,200
Like, I don't think they realize the cult.

546
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
And then they they talked about it and said, well, is there just a way

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,680
to like inject new energy in a new storyline?

548
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,280
And they got this dark ride company, R&R, to come in and revamp it

549
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,240
and make the effects better.

550
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,120
But it's all still the original figures.

551
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,840
So it's this like great it's 60s bones and kooky sub Flintstones characters

552
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,640
mixed with, you know, a 90s refresh.

553
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,480
And I think all of that, that it's a beach,

554
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,720
you know, that they're hanging out on the pier and

555
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,440
eating Brano burgers and all that.

556
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
I think that's all new in the 90s.

557
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,640
So I don't know.

558
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
It's so nice that this was like

559
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,880
it's 60s charm being saved.

560
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,760
Yeah. Due to a public outcry.

561
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,760
And crosses over with a different ride in this park

562
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,440
because there is a caveman on one of the ride vehicles on the Skyglider,

563
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,280
the shareless type.

564
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Yes.

565
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,880
Ride that you can ride up and down the boardwalk.

566
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,480
Again, another thing that I was so excited to see one of these

567
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,080
because I feel like a lot of beach towns used to have these on their boardwalk

568
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,880
and then remove them partially probably because the upkeep is expensive

569
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,680
and the liability.

570
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,080
It really feels like you'd fall out of one of these things.

571
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
You definitely would. Yeah.

572
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,320
And it's always fun seeing that cave guy because there's, you know, a story there.

573
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,640
Right. Like, did he get out?

574
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
Is he stuck?

575
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,960
Is he coming back?

576
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,080
I like the idea of like this larger mythos surrounding these cave people.

577
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,880
Is he an Encino man?

578
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,320
Oh, Link. Yeah.

579
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
Right. Right. Yes.

580
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
Did he leave?

581
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,960
Did he somehow escape the time vortex that you go into at the beginning of cave train?

582
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,360
I also wanted to bring up like what's because I was just thinking about this.

583
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
And I don't know if this is real or anything.

584
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
This is just me postulating. But.

585
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,960
OK, so I was thinking about why a train, right?

586
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,520
Like, why are you in a train in the train, cave train, right?

587
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,680
Because and the train looks.

588
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,440
It doesn't look cave ish, it looks like a train,

589
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,160
but the boardwalk is right off of a set of train tracks.

590
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,360
So maybe that's like.

591
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,920
Like a like a world within a world, you know what I'm saying?

592
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,640
Like, so so you're saying like it's like in the narrative

593
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,680
of the boardwalk, you're using the same train that might have been on those tracks

594
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,960
in the real world that's transporting you to this magical cave land.

595
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,120
Yeah. And that's what people on that train, the real train,

596
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,680
are experiencing kind of like when they go by the boardwalk.

597
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,120
Sure. Yes. So like, look at this world of boardwalk people.

598
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,080
Oh, but then we're not talking to the people on the train. Right.

599
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,040
Then waving to them, maybe a little bit, you acknowledge them,

600
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,600
but not we're just going about our day.

601
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,240
And in the same way, the cave people are just living in their cave world.

602
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
They're not concerned about us on the train.

603
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,600
Yeah. Yeah. They're just like us.

604
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,040
Levels is really what it is. Yeah.

605
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
Yeah. No, I think that's I think that's right.

606
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,080
This thing is so cool.

607
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
I love that it's the whole time if you're up on the boardwalk,

608
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,920
you're doing anything on the boardwalk that you're above this long, long dark ride.

609
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,520
This entire time, it's such like clever use of the double decker space.

610
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,480
This thing is great. Everybody watch a video of cave train. It's great.

611
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,760
There's also OK, there's this other ride and I'm I cannot recall

612
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,040
the name of it right now, but it's right across the way from the cave train.

613
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,280
And it's like something like waves or something.

614
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,760
Anyway, you go in, it's under the boardwalk, but it's like a concrete space.

615
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,480
OK. And it's just.

616
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,560
A nothing room like this, the walls are like they look like temporary,

617
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,760
like rigging. It doesn't even it's like no effort put in. Right.

618
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,160
But it's just a bunch of like, I want to say, like wave runners.

619
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,080
Like you just sit and it's like a bunch of them on like a series of little

620
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,720
carousels that all each spin and they all all together all spin.

621
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
But they turn out all the lights and each of the wave

622
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
runners that you're sitting in has headlights and you're just spinning

623
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,240
like crazy in the dark with these lights that are just like.

624
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,840
And it is the most transformative experience, like once those lights go off

625
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,720
and they have like, you know, neon like lasers and like music.

626
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,080
It's like, and you're spinning in the dark.

627
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,680
The difference from before the ride starts

628
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,840
and while the ride is occurring is phenomenal.

629
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,840
Well, really, nothing happens except for lights.

630
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,400
Mm hmm. Can't find what this is called.

631
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,160
It's it's not wave writer because I looked it up and that's a slide.

632
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
There's no dark light.

633
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,400
I think it's called Wipe Out.

634
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Wipe out. Yes. Wipe out.

635
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
That ride is so fun.

636
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,640
It really whips you around.

637
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,920
And it's a transformative experience of some kind is what you're saying.

638
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah. When you walk in, you're like, what is this?

639
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
But it only costs, you know, X amount of tickets.

640
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
So I guess I'll do it.

641
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,720
And then you do. And it's very fun. It's.

642
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,080
Yeah, it just like really takes advantage of that,

643
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,800
like centripetal force kind of thing.

644
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,760
There's a whole like like tilt.

645
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,640
Like I think some people I'm a guy who likes to be spun around

646
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,400
fast in a circle.

647
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
I like it. And you love that tilto world that they have.

648
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,080
I like a tilto world. I like a gravitron.

649
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,960
I don't think it's a sensation everyone likes, but it's I'm a lights guy

650
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,840
and I'm spinning around in a circle, guys.

651
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,400
So I'm looking at this now and I do.

652
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,280
I see exactly what you're saying.

653
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,760
It seems like it seems like you're doing like cosmic bowling

654
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
or you're playing laser tag. Yeah.

655
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,040
But you're being spun around like twice, essentially at the same time.

656
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,800
Double spins and it looks like it looks like darkness.

657
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,880
I was going to say it would blow my mind as a kid, but let's be honest,

658
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,200
it would blow my mind now.

659
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,360
It blew my mind now.

660
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,400
I went on that ride for the first time two years ago and I was changed.

661
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,440
I truly was like this ride, like because I was like, this seems so low rent

662
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,040
and so nothing, especially when you go in, you know, the in between

663
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,480
everybody get off and everybody get on all the lights are on

664
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,680
because they bring on all the lights. I swear it's like

665
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,600
fluorescent bulbs, like like so no magic.

666
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,160
Nothing. Terrible lighting.

667
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,480
It looks it looks odd and it looks like let me hear.

668
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,240
I'll bring up a share a screen real quick just to show everybody

669
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
how odd it looks with the lights on.

670
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,080
Here it is. Yeah.

671
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,240
Very industrial. This like I see what you're saying.

672
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,400
Like you walk into this.

673
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,640
You just see the machinery and the wires.

674
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,800
You don't think you're going to have a great time on this. Yeah.

675
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,080
Oh, also. OK, so you see how that the blue shirt child is tilting.

676
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
So you can control your.

677
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,040
Oh, wow. You really want to.

678
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,480
Yeah, if you really want to whip around, you just have to put your shoulders

679
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,840
into it and you'll really get whipping.

680
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,880
Wow. It does.

681
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,480
It looks like if you walk in a Broadway theater,

682
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
when it's just rehearsals and they have fluorescence on

683
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,080
and then you turn on all the show lights and turn off the audience lights

684
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
and you're like, oh, my gosh. Yes. Yes.

685
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
How it's so fun.

686
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,360
How is this not everywhere?

687
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,080
It's it's so, so, so fun.

688
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,480
I was cackling the entire time on this ride.

689
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,280
Yeah, because because there's so much going on and the lights

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,680
and then the controlling controllability of it.

691
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,360
It's very like Miami Vice.

692
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
Like the vibe is very.

693
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
Yeah. I guess you're on little speed boats.

694
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,920
Yeah, I guess.

695
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,040
Or I think they're like hover. Are they hovercrafts?

696
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,720
They look like they're hovering.

697
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,920
Well, so what you don't see is that the decor not in here is very like ocean theme.

698
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,480
Right. So that's my only.

699
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,200
So you're on like futuristic boat.

700
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah. See how the lights are turning on.

701
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
It's so cool.

702
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,000
Or you're on the boat from Thunder in Paradise or something like a futuristic boat.

703
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
Mini version, the children of Thunder in Paradise. Right.

704
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,160
Mini. Yeah. What's the name of the boat?

705
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,640
Thunder. It's the thunder, right?

706
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
And Thunder in Paradise.

707
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
Maybe some mini thunder.

708
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,600
Yeah. Thunder Juniors.

709
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
You're on a Thunder Junior.

710
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,560
A bunch of Thunder Juniors. Yeah.

711
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,080
This is delightful. I know what you mean.

712
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,800
Like, why is this not a standard type of dark ride?

713
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,560
So fun. Yeah.

714
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,080
Because you've got tilting and turning, which I really enjoy the combination of tilting and turning.

715
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,520
Yeah, boy, that's something.

716
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,080
I missed that one entirely.

717
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,240
Like we're so focused on on dark rides and original IPs.

718
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,680
You miss the simple thrills of Wipeout.

719
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,760
Yeah. And I only went on it because I had like a weird amount of tickets left

720
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,400
because how you do it there and I guess a lot of boardwalks these days is you like

721
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,280
you can get a wristband and then you add, you know, tickets or points or whatever.

722
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,960
And so like I had an odd number left and I was like, well, I could fit in a ride on this weird ride.

723
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Also, no imagery about what this ride is going to be like, because there's just like a door,

724
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,200
like an open garage, basically.

725
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,880
And it's dark. And it just says.

726
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,200
What's the name of it? Wipeout. Wipeout.

727
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,440
It just says Wipeout. And you're like, what is that?

728
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,920
And you go in and if you go in while it's not going, you're like,

729
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,560
OK, maybe is this storage?

730
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Is this a shed? Yeah, exactly.

731
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,120
Because it looks so industrial.

732
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,560
It looks like not for the public. Yeah.

733
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,440
But there are people going on it.

734
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,400
So I was like, fine, I'll go. And and and it was very fun.

735
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,880
I mean, there's a lot of that, like a lot of I like the mystery of this whole place in general,

736
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,000
which I don't know if it's all purposeful.

737
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
This sounds like they were just like, oh, we don't want to put up a sign on the shed.

738
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,000
But yeah, but the cause of that or what happens because of that is you have like

739
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,680
a very surprising experience because you don't get to see things.

740
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,360
And it's the same with cave or what?

741
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,720
Like you don't know the characters are in that ride.

742
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,480
You don't know. There's a lot of mystery to be had at the boardwalk, is what I'm saying.

743
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah. Maybe that's my thing with this place that I was near it essentially

744
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,840
and was like, I know what that is. That's like Santa Monica Pier.

745
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
I don't need to do that.

746
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,040
And I was wrong. I was completely right.

747
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,320
Like there's so I maybe I don't know.

748
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm maybe not the biggest fan of the Santa Monica Pier.

749
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
It's a little like all off the shelf there.

750
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,040
I feel like. Yeah, I don't like the Santa Monica Pier.

751
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,040
It's not great. You know what it is.

753
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Yeah. You look at it. You know what you get.

754
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,760
Whereas this thing, like you wouldn't expect like

755
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,520
like rides with mythology and rides with surprises.

756
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,840
And you see the, you know, the wooden roller coaster like, oh, OK.

757
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah, I wouldn't roll by a beach. I know what that's like.

758
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,040
You wouldn't expect that it, you know, almost threw you out of it entirely.

759
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,440
Kelly, like there's yeah.

760
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,200
And that it's a historical landmark.

761
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,840
Like there's there's stories and surprises with everything here.

762
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,200
I feel. Yeah.

763
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,680
Also with the boardwalk,

764
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,880
there's like a discovery aspect to everything because they're not

765
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,880
like super streamlined and you know where everything is.

766
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,120
I mean, unless you go there all the time. But like there's like.

767
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,720
Because they kind of like don't bother to make everything super slick,

768
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,400
you're kind of just like finding yourself on certain rides.

769
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,720
And then you're like, oh, I guess I'll go on this ride.

770
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,840
And then it turns out like it's this huge dark ride

771
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,480
that's underneath the entire boardwalk, you know, and and and.

772
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,040
Yeah, there's kind of like this feeling that you discovered it.

773
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,960
Right. You know, yeah, that is that is the best kind of feeling at one of these places

774
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,400
is feeling like you've done something, you've uncovered something,

775
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,360
because it does happen even like if you're like, you know,

776
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,960
we were told to go with this ride Sinbad's voyage in Tokyo, Disney,

777
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,360
and we got on it and we were like, we had no idea what it was.

778
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,560
We loved it. It's one of our favorite rides.

779
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,080
But it felt like, you know what?

780
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,320
We kind of discovered that. Yeah, we didn't even.

781
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,400
It's really just your brain playing a trick on you because you didn't know anything about it.

782
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
But it is a feeling of like I did something here.

783
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,080
If there's nobody telling you this is an incredible classic.

784
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,560
So get ready and love this.

785
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,480
Like if you don't have any of that buildup and just get to experience it.

786
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Following like a group of middle schoolers and you're like,

787
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,320
I guess I'll just go where they're going. Right.

788
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,040
And then afterwards, you're like, I have

789
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,400
something everyone could come around, gather around.

790
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,520
And then you're DMing podcast, the ride, and you're like, guys,

791
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,400
I have a really not well known ride I'd like to talk to you about.

792
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
Yes. Yeah, for sure.

793
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,440
That happens all the time.

794
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,720
I've looked up Wipeout real quick on just on YouTube to see if there's another one.

795
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,560
Wipeout apparently is in the very common name among a wide variety of rides.

796
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

797
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Like you just look at you on YouTube and it's like one of it's just one of those

798
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,520
circle things that spins around one of its one of.

799
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,760
Yeah, which is not as fun.

800
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,040
One of them is like a weird arm with like some Kuka arm

801
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
chair kind of Harry Potter things.

802
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
I think it just spins.

803
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,200
So I guess Wipeout at this point, you can't.

804
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,400
Oh, yeah. Wipeout.

805
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,160
There's one where it's like a long chair of people in an arm.

806
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,440
It's like Wipeout is used for many things, but I cannot see another one

807
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,080
that looks exactly like that one.

808
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,040
So maybe that is truly unique.

809
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,800
Well, I've been to a million carnivals or fairs or stuff

810
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,120
that have like the bobsleds or the Himalayans.

811
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,720
Or and it's it's yeah, it's always one of two things.

812
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,680
But like, yeah, stuff that's generic that they can call

813
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,760
any rides, you know, the log ride, the log ride.

814
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,600
Yeah, it's not like an original character, say, like

815
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,320
my friend, my boardwalk card.

816
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
There he is.

817
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,120
I came across him, my boardwalk rechargeable card.

818
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,960
He's got a great attitude.

819
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,720
He's in the safety video for the giant tipper.

820
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,120
He so the I think I guess you pay for things at this park

821
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,680
by putting money on a card.

822
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,640
And they have in the in the recent past made their mascot

823
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,520
one of these cards with legs, with very scrawny little ant legs

824
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,320
and 3D eyeballs.

825
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,920
He's he's very strange.

826
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,920
The voice is strange. Yeah, yeah.

827
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,040
I was creeped out by the video I watched where he explains

828
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,240
how he works, which has a lot of odd double speak and like,

829
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,320
so just make sure you swipe me and don't lose me

830
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,720
because other people are going to want me and then they'll have me

831
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,640
and they'll have the money on me and not you.

832
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,960
It gets very confusing, this guy talking about you,

833
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,280
talking to you about himself.

834
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,640
But then it really did you see this one, Jason, where then he

835
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,760
suddenly it cuts in.

836
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,360
There's four of him. He multiplied.

837
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680
No, I haven't seen that.

838
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,640
You was right.

839
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,680
I did. I did have the reaction of like, this guy's got a good attitude.

840
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,600
But what is he trying to hide?

841
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,880
And it appears multiple man powers is what he's trying to hide.

842
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,080
That reminds me of I was

843
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,320
there's this commercial that's been happening a lot lately,

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,840
which is like the Kologard commercial,

845
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,560
which they've also decided to anthropomorphize a like colorectal test.

846
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,040
And the like little box comes up to this guy on the beach.

847
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,360
And and he's like, I'm Kologard.

848
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,920
And the guy is like with I assume his wife and ignoring his wife

849
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,840
to have a full on conversation with like the box.

850
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,560
And he's like, I can tell you if you have like this and that and whatever.

851
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
And it just is a similar thing where you're like,

852
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,680
why did you make this a character?

853
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,000
Like you couldn't you.

854
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
You don't need to have it be a character.

855
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
Hey, buddy, don't look at her. Look at me.

856
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,600
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.

857
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,120
Eyes on me. Now put me up your asshole if you want to know if you're sick.

858
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,040
There is Kologard.

859
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,680
Kologard, I've never seen Kologard.

860
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Here he is with a hat and a whistle like a referee.

861
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,320
He's blowing and he has little he has cheeks.

862
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,840
He has cheek puffs.

863
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,120
Wow. This is great IP.

864
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,320
Kologard has cheeks.

865
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,920
Oh, don't think just because he's a he's a box of of colorectal tests

866
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,560
doesn't mean he does. He can't have cheeks.

867
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Wow. Well, we have to subject him to the podcast, the right test real quick.

868
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,000
Is Kologard cute?

869
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,720
No, Kologard is a criminal.

870
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,040
Hmm. How so? Why is he a criminal?

871
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,240
Yeah, he's trying to help.

872
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,840
I don't. That's OK.

873
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
The best villains think they're trying to help.

874
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Mike, I don't do trust him.

875
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,960
First of all, why is he everywhere?

876
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,680
Why is he there? He's everywhere.

877
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,560
Why did he follow you to the beach?

878
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm not bathroom.

879
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,800
I don't look. I don't know his motivations.

880
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
I don't know what's in his heart.

881
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,000
But if I'm judging him purely aesthetically, I think he's cute.

882
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,720
His face is a colon, by the way.

883
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,880
That's true.

884
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
But it's like it's blue.

885
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,720
It's shades of blue.

886
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,240
And it's a kind of you could just mistake it for maybe some sort of symbol.

887
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,880
Wait, is it is the weight?

888
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,200
The shape on his face is a is a colon.

889
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,600
Like, well, yeah, I guess down knows the anus.

890
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,760
Yeah. Anus. Yeah, I guess.

891
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,560
Yeah, I cute, though, I think, because it's not like

892
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,080
it's not cute because you know his nose is the anus.

893
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,360
I think he's cute despite the fact that his nose is the anus. OK.

894
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,120
Well, I mean, look, I'm not telling you you have to say he's cute.

895
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,040
I'm just judging my personal opinion.

896
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,640
I do think Colo Guard is cute.

897
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:09,840
I don't know.

898
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,680
Colo Guard, Colo Guard versus my boardwalk card.

899
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,960
One will fall like Godzilla versus Kong. Yeah.

900
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,960
I like Colo Guard more than my boardwalk card.

901
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,640
Cute. I'm not sure is the right word.

902
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,960
I think he's likable, but he's not like a child.

903
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,480
So I think it's weird to call him.

904
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Yeah. Yeah.

905
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,200
A little a little too much like Clippy.

906
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,520
I don't think Clippy is cute.

907
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,160
I don't mind Clippy.

908
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't know if I call him cute. What do you think?

909
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,760
I do think he's cute. Thank you.

910
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Yeah. All right.

911
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,160
Yeah, I think he's cute.

912
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,960
And I love a practical.

913
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,880
I love I'm a practical guy.

914
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
You know, I this kit makes sense to me.

915
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
You know, the kit makes sense.

916
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,520
I just don't get why he needs to like follow you everywhere.

917
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,040
He seems to be a guy.

918
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,080
He seems needy.

919
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,800
He it's odd that he's alive.

920
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
It's like did a wizard and chant up Colo Guard box.

921
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,160
And you know, I came to life one night.

922
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,800
You're right. When you say he seems needy, he seems like the kind of guy

923
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,440
where like if you're upset about something, he's like,

924
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,400
but I need you to tell me that I'm doing a good job making you feel better.

925
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,520
Comforting. Yes. Yes. Right. Right. Right.

926
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,560
He's that he does something wrong and then it's like you.

927
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,080
But it's actually on you. Yeah. Me out.

928
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,160
Yes, I agree.

929
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,000
I mean, the Pillsbury Doe Boy, I think is cute,

930
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,680
but he's also one of the neediest character. Yes.

931
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,160
And so I think it's a similar vibe with him.

932
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,120
He obviously makes cookies and doesn't ask people to shit in a box for a side

933
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,160
for him and him. He says it's in him.

934
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,560
He's shooting in him. Yeah.

935
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,040
I mean, you're shooting in Colo Guard.

936
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,520
Wait, that's what the test is. You should in the cold.

937
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,840
You you you like drop off your stool sample and then they do a test.

938
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,280
Clearly, this is a test that I haven't done.

939
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,440
And maybe I need to maybe I need to get too dumb.

940
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,880
We're going too dumb. You're like, wait, this is what you do.

941
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,160
What I truly did.

942
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,200
I did not know until this time what a colorectal test involved.

943
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,440
I didn't know that you shit in a little box.

944
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,880
Well, you you don't go in the box.

945
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,280
You go in like, oh, you in the box.

946
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,280
You go in this little in this little plastic trash can that comes in the box.

947
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Yeah. And you put that in the box.

948
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,320
OK, so you could you would take this little plastic thing out of Kola.

949
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,920
You don't have to open the lid of this box with a face

950
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,120
that we've all been looking at and poop into him.

951
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,920
No, no, no. He's like.

952
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,080
Um, he's like the outside of a porta potty.

953
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,920
You know what I'm saying?

954
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,840
He's like not the part that's holding the poo.

955
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,000
He's like holding the thing that's holding the poo.

956
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,400
Oh, right, right.

957
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,480
OK, I mean, it would be fun.

958
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,760
I mean, it would be fun if you were to put it in there.

959
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,720
And he goes, thank you.

960
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,000
Like in the box, we talk a little bit because if you take too long, he goes, I'm hungry.

961
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,520
Yes, I would be.

962
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,920
Ironically, yeah, that's just flavor.

963
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,600
Some of the food offerings at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk

964
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,320
might be helpful to you if you need to use the look art in moving things along.

965
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,240
It's all like deep fried Twinkies and, you know,

966
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,320
corn dogs and yeah, nachos and that sort of thing.

967
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,000
And the you know, if you take a step back in time,

968
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,080
this struck me as potentially something, despite it being from 1933,

969
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,600
something that Jason might dig today, which is Winnie's turnover pies.

970
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,200
Yes. And where you can get hot chicken pie for 15 cents.

971
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,240
There is a substantial historical blog on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk website.

972
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,520
And I read a long post about the ownership history of Winnie's turnover pie.

973
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,840
There's been a lot of turnover at Winnie's turnover, a lot of turnover and changing tastes.

974
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,760
I mean, a lot this park, you know, Seaside Park is always subject to changing tastes.

975
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,640
You know, there used to be the plunge, a massive indoor chlorinated saltwater pool,

976
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,120
which is now. Wow.

977
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,280
What is it called?

978
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,440
Neptune's Kingdom, I think it's called now.

979
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,320
And it's miniature golf and arcade.

980
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,120
Yes, that miniature golf is like blacklight.

981
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,640
Very good. Very fun.

982
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:33,400
Yeah, this whole place grew out of the of the bath, the big bath facility.

983
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,440
And the thing that I copy pasted right under that photo of turnover pies

984
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,560
is the phrase visitors could swim in the heated plunges and eat fancy turtle

985
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,600
soup at the casino grill.

986
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,440
Oh, man. Mass baths and turtle soup.

987
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,320
You know, that's what you do in 1895.

988
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,280
You are what you eat.

989
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,600
I feel like if you're sitting in a hot bath, you're like basically turtle soup.

990
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,480
And then you're eating turtle soup. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,920
Any time. I mean, the shredder, the shredder would have loved it.

992
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,960
It would have been so all into it.

993
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,840
Sure. He said that a lot, right.

994
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,440
And he's going to turn him into turtle soup.

995
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,000
He said tonight. Well, it's I think the first Nintendo game is he says tonight.

996
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,960
I'll die tonight.

997
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,320
I dine on turtle soup, I believe is the quote from the shredder.

998
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,680
What if he did it?

999
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,840
What if shredder killed him and then ate them soup?

1000
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,680
And that was the end of the Ninja Turtle.

1001
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,760
And then it was like the end to do to do to do really fast credits. Yeah.

1002
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,080
There's a very dark series happening right now,

1003
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,040
and I have not read the second issue, but the only one it's the future.

1004
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,280
And only one turtle is alive.

1005
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,760
I've heard about this. I read it.

1006
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,880
Yeah. You read it.

1007
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,480
I've read the first issue so far.

1008
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,320
I read both. Lots of fun reveals.

1009
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
Yeah, really. So maybe that that happens.

1010
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,240
Maybe there's a maybe shredder is got a bowl of something.

1011
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,280
Oh, page splash of just him eating the bowl of turtle soup.

1012
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,320
It's just lots of panels of the full pay.

1013
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,240
Everything is a full page flash of shredder to tasting soups

1014
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,320
with the comment like a mouth chompin

1015
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,120
or wiping his mouth,

1016
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,240
picking, picking a little flick, like a little bit of orange bandana

1017
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,280
out of his teeth.

1018
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,800
And, you know, that's Michelangelo in the second issue.

1019
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,040
Spoiler alert. They do eat eggs.

1020
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,920
So they might be building to a larger, more ornate legs.

1021
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,840
Turtle. No, not turtle.

1022
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,760
No, just like regular eggs, but they're hard to find in this.

1023
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,640
They, you know, who do the turtles eat eggs in the series or to shredder?

1024
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,240
Do turtles eat? I don't want to spoil anything.

1025
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,800
These issues are hard to track down.

1026
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,280
I asked at my comic shop if if they had issue two for Mike

1027
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,120
and they kind of chuckled like, no, no.

1028
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,520
Like it came out two weeks ago and they're like, well wiped out.

1029
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,800
So yeah, it's almost comic book man thing.

1030
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
Turtle eat eggs in real life, by the way.

1031
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,720
Just looked it up.

1032
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,720
Hmm. Yeah, like little Grogu. Yeah.

1033
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,320
Hey, I got another

1034
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,200
animal who eats unorthodox things right here.

1035
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,160
Look at Leo, the paper eater.

1036
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,560
This is a good idea. Wow.

1037
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,440
This is a way this was a way to get people to clean up trash.

1038
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,920
Is this thing made a sound like called people over and then made chomping sounds.

1039
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,920
So it encourages kids to put paper in them.

1040
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
It called people over like it.

1041
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,680
OK, question. Was it like?

1042
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,160
And you may not know this is my band fair.

1043
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,440
Was it like pre recorded sounds just every once in a while?

1044
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,720
Or was there a person like hiding with a microphone

1045
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,160
that would like see people and call out to them or?

1046
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,080
My guess is pre recorded.

1047
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,400
I think maybe and then maybe when you put something in, it triggers.

1048
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,880
Right. Chomping sounds.

1049
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,720
Num num nums or something.

1050
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,520
I don't like how round his mouth is.

1051
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,280
I wish it were just that teeth.

1052
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,920
More realistic.

1053
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,720
It was like more mouth shape.

1054
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,520
Like I just don't like.

1055
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,960
I don't like how far I'd probably have to put my hand in to drop.

1056
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,120
What are you know what I'm saying?

1057
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,240
Keep going. Yeah.

1058
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,200
Keep going deeper, deeper.

1059
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,640
Touch my uvula.

1060
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,240
Get your elbow in.

1061
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,440
Get your elbow in there.

1062
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,720
Uh, yeah, it is a little odd.

1063
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,040
Yeah, it was just a trash can, though, at the base of its.

1064
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,680
I mean, it obviously it's a disembodied head.

1065
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,600
I assume it wasn't like a shredder.

1066
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,360
There was on a paper.

1067
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,480
Now I'm not talking about the shredder.

1068
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,160
I'm talking about a paper.

1069
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Shredder. A paper shredder in there.

1070
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,560
Jesus, I don't think so.

1071
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,120
I don't think there's like a garbage disposal in this lion's been this cute

1072
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,240
lion's mouth. Seems dangerous.

1073
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,280
Do we think that lion is cute?

1074
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1075
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,840
We're all in agreement.

1076
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,040
Unfortunately, he's cute.

1077
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,520
Leo, the paper eater is cute, cuter than the color rectal box.

1078
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,400
What have we what have we not talked about?

1079
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,280
Well, in terms of these cool rides, you want to hit haunted castle.

1080
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,920
Oh, it's kind of it's it's not quite the cave train, but it's pretty good.

1081
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,000
Very good. Yeah.

1082
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,520
I actually went on that before I went on the cave train.

1083
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,680
And I had, you know, like zero expectations because,

1084
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,160
you know, a lot of the outdoor rides just seem very carnivally.

1085
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,400
Like the Tilted World that they have is the is the kind that they're

1086
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,960
it's literally just like grating and you just lean against it.

1087
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,680
And they just put a little chain thing in front of you.

1088
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,640
And then when it goes up, you just hope you don't fall out.

1089
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,080
So everything seems very like lo fi, very.

1090
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,280
Like basic, I don't know.

1091
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,240
So when I saw you see the sign and it just says like.

1092
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,360
On a castle and there's like, you know,

1093
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,800
sounds and you're kind of like, OK, this is just going to be what?

1094
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,440
Like some cardboard cutouts or something and like not.

1095
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,360
But it is a very long and be.

1096
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,600
If you don't know that most of it takes place underneath

1097
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,800
where you start out, it's quite delightful being like,

1098
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,240
how far down are we going to go?

1099
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,880
You know, oh, does it descend?

1100
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,400
I don't think I could tell that from.

1101
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,560
I think it does descend. Wow. Wow. Yeah.

1102
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,560
There's a lot of, you know, again.

1103
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,080
Weirdly, like a lot of like singular animatronics

1104
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,080
that either like pop out at you or like are down a hallway

1105
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,480
and you're like, oh, what's that?

1106
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,880
But they also have like fun wigs and T-shirts on some of the animatronics,

1107
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,680
like some of the skeletons are wearing like Santa Cruz boardwalk T-shirts.

1108
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,360
So it's like, oh, someone from the boardwalk got stuck in the haunted castle.

1109
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,280
Yeah, there's a lot of like creatures and skeletons and stuff.

1110
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,280
But then at some point, there's a bunch of skeletons

1111
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,000
who are all burying a Santa Cruz surfer dude alive.

1112
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,640
It's really creepy.

1113
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,880
And he says like, oh, no, man, I don't know what it is.

1114
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,640
But like, you can sense his character big time.

1115
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,560
The voice acting is superb in this one. Really good.

1116
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,840
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of like notable characters.

1117
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,480
You talk to you like the there's a there's a skeleton

1118
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,880
who's holding his own skull separately from his body.

1119
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,560
I remember that being a fun performance.

1120
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,880
And then there's like a creepy British guillotine guy.

1121
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,840
Yeah, because that's the end of your trip through the haunted castle

1122
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,760
as you get guillotined and then it goes.

1123
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,200
Then it's the bright light of your back outside.

1124
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,160
And that's it. I think this this ride ends with your death. Yeah.

1125
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,760
There's a you are dead.

1126
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,840
A great effect where there's like an alligator or a crocodile in the distance.

1127
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,520
And it comes towards you under a dock and every board on the dock like.

1128
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,880
Yeah, that's really cool.

1129
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,600
Splits down the middle.

1130
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,640
That is so cinematic. It's really cool.

1131
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,080
I was really. Yeah, that was awesome.

1132
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,480
Yeah, there's a scary rabbit that's being cooked by a skeleton.

1133
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,080
You got projections on bus, a la haunted mansion. Yeah.

1134
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,280
This is this is great.

1135
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,200
And I love like the genre of ride, like like the one that I'm

1136
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,560
very nostalgic for growing up, the scary dark ride in Balboa Island,

1137
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,160
in Orange County, that where you're if you're combining

1138
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,760
different mythologies of scary stuff, if it's like

1139
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,760
full knight's armor moving at you and then like a rat coming out,

1140
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,080
but then also dinosaurs.

1141
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,440
Or big scary snakes or like and ghosts and pirates.

1142
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,960
Like how much just all the scary things all in one place.

1143
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,800
That is fantastic.

1144
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,840
Like mix them all up, you know, very confusingly.

1145
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:47,120
I like I like a ride that feels very like cokey in its creation, right?

1146
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,320
Because they're like, well, like what's scary?

1147
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,960
Like skeletons, right?

1148
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,280
But then also an alligator. OK.

1149
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
And it's like very like genre mixing, because like

1150
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,800
if I were thinking haunted castle,

1151
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
first of all, I would think ghosts.

1152
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,400
But there's like a billion skeletons.

1153
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,640
And then there's also an alligator like that.

1154
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,640
Aspect like there's like a whole swamp section that you go through, which is like.

1155
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,880
You just wouldn't think, oh, haunted castle,

1156
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,400
which I love that about that, like I love that they were just kind of like,

1157
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,040
I don't know, let's throw a bunch of shit in there and like hope it's scary.

1158
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,680
Like they got bored with the castle premise and are like, all right,

1159
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,880
we need something else. It's a long.

1160
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,120
It is a five minute ride.

1161
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,440
We already made the sign.

1162
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,240
We can't change it.

1163
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,400
So yeah, but the haunted castle's backyard, it's Marsh backyard.

1164
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,320
They got to go to whatever swan.

1165
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,520
Yeah, they wouldn't have a feel bit of a swamp.

1166
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,240
If you were watching like a movie version of it with this idea,

1167
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,240
sometimes I feel like I'm watching a movie where I go, I feel like 45 minutes

1168
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,160
and they ran out of the premise and they were like, well, what are we going to do now?

1169
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,480
And then they like throw something wild at it,

1170
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,480
which can go bad or less bad sometimes.

1171
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,760
But like for this, for a ride situation, fantastic.

1172
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,480
Bring it on. Bring it on.

1173
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,720
They also simultaneously, they have a ghost blasters.

1174
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,000
Did you see this?

1175
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,440
I go on. I did not do ghost blasters.

1176
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,000
Just because a listener tweeted out us about ghost blasters recently,

1177
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,600
asking why the Nickelodeon Park at the Mall of America,

1178
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,720
why do they have a ghost blasters?

1179
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,320
And it's not like Danny Phantom or something to clarify,

1180
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,960
to answer your question.

1181
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
Ghost blasters is a pre like a prefab ride.

1182
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,880
It's a design dark ride by the Sally Corporation

1183
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,640
that parks can license and install and it's good to go.

1184
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,000
And it saves money and time by installing.

1185
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,280
It's like a bunch of unrelated parks kind of across the country.

1186
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,560
Yes, a bunch of parks have ghost blasters.

1187
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,800
And you can go to the Sally Dark Rides website and like look at the like,

1188
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,840
you know, brochure like the digital.

1189
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,080
Oh, we could buy that or Scott could get it and put it in the backyard right now.

1190
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah. So are you allowed to add your own zest to it?

1191
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,480
Or is it like is are there like licensing restrictions?

1192
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,160
I think depending on your budget, you are able to customize to different levels.

1193
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,480
I'm sure that you customize yourself, though, is what I'm asking.

1194
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,520
Like, could you be like, oh, I want to make this not necessarily existing IP,

1195
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,280
but like maybe I want to make this luau themed like, could I do that?

1196
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,560
Or are they like, you're not allowed to represent our product?

1197
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,560
That's a great question.

1198
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,760
I bet they never check in on it again.

1199
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,160
I bet like it's out.

1200
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,000
Technically, if you ask the question, they'd say no.

1201
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,880
But if you just did it, nobody would ever find out. Right.

1202
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,800
Like if like, yeah, if we bought one of these rides, put it in Scott's backyard.

1203
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,160
Could we change all the characters into like

1204
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,720
like characters we talk about a podcast ride like Ringo Starr

1205
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,880
or I Love Lucy guest star Frank Nelson?

1206
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,000
Could we put those characters on this ride?

1207
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,880
Colo Guard, one of my favorite characters in

1208
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,920
could a ghost poop into Cola Guards top?

1209
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,120
Yes. And would Sally Ride Corporation be upset

1210
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,480
if one of their guests pooped in Cola Guard?

1211
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,720
I don't know.

1212
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,200
Cola Guard company might be assuming that you got the correct licensing for

1213
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,320
for the IP that you're using for Cola Guard.

1214
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,840
Yes. But we may have to do an analogous Cola Guard,

1215
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,360
like call them like poop box or Mr. Poop Box or something. Right.

1216
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,280
And then everyone would be like, but I know what you mean.

1217
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,080
You mean classic Cola Guard. Right.

1218
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,600
And then we just if we get sued, we say, well, this is parody law.

1219
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,520
Yeah. This is a classic parody. Sorry. Yeah. Fair use.

1220
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,840
I bet I bet there's leeway.

1221
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,880
I bet there's leeway with it.

1222
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,880
It feels like if there is licensing, it feels like I don't know

1223
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,920
if Sally Ride's corporation is trying to make a Ghost Blasters TV show.

1224
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,880
I'm not sure how precious with their IP they are.

1225
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,240
I think they should at this point, because everything else

1226
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,960
that's ever been in a thing is becoming a show. But that's true.

1227
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,760
I bet if you talk to them, they're like, I do whatever you want.

1228
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,040
I don't care.

1229
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,400
I'm guessing, but maybe not.

1230
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,840
So let's just gather the probably seven million dollars

1231
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,000
it takes to buy all the parts of Ghost Blasters.

1232
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,320
And then we can and then we can do whatever we want.

1233
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,640
Yeah. You know, better to ask forgiveness than.

1234
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,400
Absolutely. Permission. Yeah.

1235
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,120
And that applies to Sally Ride's corporation.

1236
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,720
In the coal guard, right? You're going to make.

1237
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,120
Yeah, it's mostly it's by the way, it's mostly going to be the coal guard.

1238
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1239
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,520
With a little bit of the Knights and White Satin stuff

1240
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,320
that we're able to get from their their other innovations.

1241
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,640
Is this called the rectal blasters?

1242
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,600
The only like the only laser game

1243
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:49,960
with a score where you're also curing rectal cancer along the way. Nice.

1244
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,640
Wow. Yeah, that's yes.

1245
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,480
That's the that's the that's the ride. Yeah. Pretty cool.

1246
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,840
If only were that simple in the real world, you just take a laser gun

1247
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,520
and blast away the rectal cancer.

1248
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,160
But it imagines a better world where that is what's possible someday.

1249
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,240
Yeah. Yeah. And at the end, a generic animatronic

1250
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,720
called like Rock and Roll Older Man says like, great job.

1251
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,520
Peace and kindness, peace and kindness.

1252
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,760
That's our generic rink that rock and roll older man.

1253
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah. And then you get a child's t-shirt with his face on it at the end.

1254
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,440
For your child. Generic rock and roll man.

1255
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,120
There's been a weird history of IP at this place.

1256
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,120
Do you know they had they were just using Popeye for a while.

1257
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,600
Popeye olive oil late 80s, early 90s.

1258
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,800
I was watching an old commercial and then Popeye and olive oil ran by.

1259
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,760
Like, what are you talking about?

1260
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,280
So just for like, I don't know, like a decade, they had Popeye

1261
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,520
and now they don't.

1262
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,360
Was he present at the park?

1263
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah. You can take a picture of Popeye at the boardwalk.

1264
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,400
I love that. Mm hmm.

1265
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,760
Oh, that's stunning.

1266
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,760
Popeye is weird. Popeye.

1267
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,160
I mean, it's universal now.

1268
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,400
And then there's the creepy island off the coast of Italy,

1269
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,440
where you can hang out with the Popeye characters.

1270
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,920
And at one point, they were also in Santa Cruz, California.

1271
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,720
That's so funny. Weird travels.

1272
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,920
There's also did you guys come across

1273
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,320
what was in the haunted castle space long, long ago in the 30s?

1274
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,640
A ride called Dante's Inferno.

1275
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,920
Oh, I miss this.

1276
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,280
I saw a headline about it, but then I didn't click it.

1277
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,680
So they've always had this space for a scary ride.

1278
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,680
And I think there was some iteration of a haunted.

1279
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,640
It's mostly been haunted castle for a while.

1280
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,560
I think the current version came in in 2010.

1281
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,280
But when this space opened in the 30s,

1282
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,240
it was a ride called Dante's Inferno sub headline, A Trip to Hades.

1283
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,880
So this long before Mr.

1284
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,840
Toads was an attraction, there was a trip through hell.

1285
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,640
Wow. Yeah, yeah.

1286
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,000
Pretty pretty. I'm assuming you probably die at some point

1287
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,720
and then you're there.

1288
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,040
Or maybe they're just like, welcome to hell.

1289
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,480
Or maybe it's like cave train where you're just like, you're a tourist.

1290
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,440
You're visiting hell to then maybe to scope it out,

1291
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,680
see if you want to live there someday.

1292
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,200
But I don't know any premise beyond that.

1293
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,600
It's very weird and creepy, like seeing like 1930s

1294
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,760
plaster representing the stalagmites and stalactites

1295
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,880
that you would find in hell.

1296
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,480
Like the facade is really fantastic.

1297
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,160
But I don't know what happened once you were in there.

1298
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,720
I don't know if it was either really tame or like unbelievably

1299
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,160
morality tale terrifying.

1300
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,680
It could go either way.

1301
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,360
It could really go either way.

1302
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,760
Yeah, bad. Yeah, it's too bad.

1303
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,560
There's not like an old newsreel.

1304
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,000
To talk definitions of hell were very different.

1305
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,720
It could be like one room is just a bachelor in a studio apartment

1306
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,040
and the next is an unmarried woman,

1307
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,200
a 30 year old unmarried woman, a bathing suit in multiple pieces.

1308
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,000
Couple in the same bed on TV.

1309
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,200
Oh, yeah.

1310
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,560
Yeah, it's just like two beds, like being pushed together over and over again.

1311
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,920
No, no, don't do it.

1312
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,320
And then they and then it splits down the middle and they tumble into hell.

1313
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,720
Oh, that's great.

1314
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,560
That's a cool effect.

1315
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,280
Beautiful, beautiful hospitalized regularly going on this ride.

1316
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,400
They were so aghast that that band's not big at all.

1317
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,080
It's a small band. No.

1318
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,080
Get them on the cave train stat.

1319
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,280
Curious.

1320
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,040
Yeah, I've also got another thing in the realm of like

1321
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,240
scary stuff and horrors that occurred.

1322
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,800
So lots and lots of movies been filmed at St.

1323
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,360
Chris Beach Boardwalk.

1324
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,080
Lost Boys. Yes.

1325
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,000
Us recently, Killer Clowns from Outer Space.

1326
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,800
So lots of lots of varying degrees of creepy movies.

1327
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,160
But I didn't know.

1328
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,800
I have never seen the film Sudden Impact.

1329
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,440
Which is a dirty, hairy movie.

1330
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,160
So Clint Eastwood like starred and directed

1331
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,040
this scene of that.

1332
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,320
So the movie climax is at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

1333
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,480
And, Jay, this is also this is one of the you know,

1334
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,920
we were just seeing a lot of theme park uses of theme park

1335
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,920
or movies of theme parks for our fake theme park Final Four.

1336
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,880
This isn't a fake theme park.

1337
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,080
Boy, this is a great theme park scene.

1338
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,320
You'll see. And he kicks it off with the the iconic line itself.

1339
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,960
So buckle up for this.

1340
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,000
Come on.

1341
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,440
Make my day.

1342
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,120
Scary guy holding a woman hostage on top of the giant dipper.

1343
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,320
She punches her way out.

1344
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,440
Dirty Harry shoots him.

1345
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,520
Many times.

1346
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,160
He falls off the coaster over and over again.

1347
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,880
Yes. Electrified into the water.

1348
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,640
Oh, look at that.

1349
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,960
He falls off the giant dipper

1350
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,120
through the glass of the carousel, lands on a carousel horse.

1351
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,480
But it's not a horse.

1352
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,440
It's he's very unlucky because it's a unicorn.

1353
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,600
And the horn punctures him quite bloodily right through the chest.

1354
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,000
Stunning. Cool, huh?

1355
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,960
Stunning. Wow.

1356
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,920
Yeah. What a little theme park action sequence.

1357
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,600
I'm so jealous of it.

1358
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,720
Really great.

1359
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,240
And I love the Santa Cruz boardwalks.

1360
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,520
Just. Devil may care attitude about being portrayed in this way

1361
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,840
of like being a place where a person could fall and be impaled on their carousel.

1362
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,440
I love that.

1363
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,400
We don't give a shit.

1364
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,760
Just give us the money and whatever you want to do, whatever you want to manipulate.

1365
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,160
Go for it. I love it.

1366
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,200
Yeah, geez.

1367
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,600
You know, there was a movie in the 60s.

1368
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,560
I might be getting this wrong.

1369
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,680
40 Pounds of Trouble that was filmed in Disneyland.

1370
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,400
I think Tony Curtis is in it.

1371
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,680
And in that movie, it's just like a guy runs around.

1372
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,080
He's chased by another guy and then everyone runs, but then they emerge safely.

1373
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:08,960
And that's it.

1374
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,600
It is the tamest action you've ever seen.

1375
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,760
And that's what Disneyland would allow.

1376
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,880
Cut to Santa Cruz Beach.

1377
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,800
All of these horror films and crazy shit.

1378
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,000
And then there's impaling.

1379
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,720
And yeah, boy, it's devil may care.

1380
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,600
They're taking risks.

1381
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,760
In Lost Boys, the bridge that they're supposed to be on by the boardwalk.

1382
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,920
So you can walk across that to get to the boardwalk.

1383
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,360
You're supposed to walk on the side of it.

1384
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,680
So basically, there's a railway, right?

1385
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,080
And it's on this bridge with planks.

1386
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:48,560
And each of the planks is about, I don't know, five or six inches apart, pretty wide.

1387
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,760
And then to the side, there's like this safe part for the pedestrians to walk.

1388
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:01,440
But of course, if you are a rebellious teen or when I was in college,

1389
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,360
you can walk along where the railway is.

1390
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:10,960
And it's pretty scary because once you're so far,

1391
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,960
you can't really jump over easily to where the pedestrians are supposed to be.

1392
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,320
So you're kind of like tempting fate by being where a train could hit you.

1393
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,000
And you're very high above the water.

1394
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,920
So if you're scared of heights, that's a river at that point.

1395
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,640
It goes over a river that feeds into the Monterey Bay.

1396
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:34,720
Yeah.

1397
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,920
And would you believe I don't have any close by,

1398
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,880
but very popular for engagement photos and influencer bullshit.

1399
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,080
I'm sure.

1400
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,720
I'm sure.

1401
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,000
If someone tried to propose to me on that, I would push them into the ocean or the river.

1402
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,280
And they would fall or push them onto the carousel.

1403
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,760
Oh my gosh.

1404
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,800
Come this way.

1405
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,760
Perfectly impaled.

1406
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,960
What if we not talked about, Kelly, was there anything new,

1407
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,080
any other odd memories of this place or things you ran into while you were there?

1408
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,480
No, I guess I just want to OK, this is like I have to do this because I grew up in the South Bay,

1409
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,840
which is Torrance, like not the NorCal South Bay.

1410
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,280
And I have to give a shout out to the boardwalk I grew up with,

1411
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,120
which is the Redondo Beach boardwalk.

1412
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,720
They had this like really creepy like boardwalk area that had basically just like a little

1413
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,760
tilt to whirl and which was clown themed.

1414
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,640
And they had this machine that I will like never forget,

1415
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,200
which is like you put in and that machine has been there since it opened.

1416
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,520
You put in a quarter and then like marionettes dance for you.

1417
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,120
And it's like a little scene of like some kind of drama, I guess,

1418
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,800
between the marionettes.

1419
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,680
And so they dance for you.

1420
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,880
So I do have to, you know, it's now being closed and they're putting in condos there,

1421
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,920
which is very, very sad.

1422
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:03,840
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1423
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,560
That's a bummer.

1424
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,680
Yeah, I've been there.

1425
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,720
That's really cool.

1426
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,360
I love it.

1427
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,480
Yeah, I love it.

1428
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,040
So that I do have to say that was my first boardwalk love,

1429
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,440
but the Santa Cruz boardwalk is so iconic.

1430
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,920
Do you do recall when am I being insulting to this place that you love from my trips down there?

1431
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,840
I recall it like stinking around there.

1432
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,800
Yeah, it smells like shit.

1433
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,960
It smells like fish because it's right next to this open air fish market.

1435
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,080
And the way that it is set up is like it's not really that open air because like

1436
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,600
it's like a like a C shape.

1437
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:44,080
And so like at the curve or I guess a U at the bottom curve of the U is the fish market.

1438
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,200
And then just right to the right is like this boardwalk thing with like

1439
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,680
games and rides and stuff.

1440
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,200
But it's all enclosed.

1441
01:08:53,200 --> 01:09:00,320
So like all the air just like goes into it just funnels straight into.

1442
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:05,280
And there's a really like like no air escaping parking garage right there.

1443
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,680
Yes.

1444
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,520
I've written my bike through carbon monoxide parking lot.

1445
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,680
Yeah, yeah, it's like really tight.

1446
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,960
So yeah, carbon monoxide and fish all merge in this little blowing into like a Tilted Whirl.

1447
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,000
That's heaven to me.

1448
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,960
I mean, that sounds great.

1449
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,960
I loved it.

1450
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,800
I loved it, but it is going away.

1451
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,080
So I'm very sad, but there's still the Santa Cruz boardwalk.

1452
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,580
Yeah.

1453
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,000
Can I mention the coconut grove?

1454
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,600
We haven't mentioned that spelled an anachronistic spelling.

1455
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,520
Of coconut with an A in the middle.

1456
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,120
This is now used for like weddings and conferences and that sort of thing back.

1457
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,880
We were talking about changing taste, but in the 30s and 40s, it would host big bands like

1458
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,560
fronted by Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw and another reoccurring podcast,

1459
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,720
the ride character, Xavier Kugin mentioned on the websites.

1460
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,400
Well, of course, great.

1461
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:00,960
That's great.

1462
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,000
There's also a you're welcome listeners.

1463
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,240
Xavier Kugin is back.

1464
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,640
It's 2021 more save.

1465
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,440
There's a portion of one of the buildings called the Boardwalk Historium

1466
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,920
and where you can learn more about this place.

1467
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,360
And I will push anyone out of the way.

1468
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,360
If you tell me, would you like to learn about the history of this seaside town?

1469
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,360
Yes, I absolutely would.

1470
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,200
Hey, and one more little thing about the history.

1471
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,280
This place, they had a ride about a ride called Autorama.

1472
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,520
Autorama, I'm not sure, but it was a ride a lot like the Autopia

1473
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,160
opened in 1961 and unlike the Autopia, it had a guard rail.

1474
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:50,560
So Walt Disney heard about this place and heard that it wasn't constantly maiming children

1475
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,080
like the Autopia was at the time, which was just Roman free, no guide rail.

1476
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,640
So the company Aero built the thing and they built a lot of the early Disney rights.

1477
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,080
They said, why don't you come check it out?

1478
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,760
So Walt Disney in 1963 went up to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, checked it out,

1479
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,560
looked around and was like, all right, we should probably do a guard rail.

1480
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,440
I think we better do it.

1481
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,920
So that's why there's a guard rail on the Autopia.

1482
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,360
But his trip to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk led to this photo of a bunch of people.

1483
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,000
And in the center is Walt Disney smoking a cigarette.

1484
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,300
Wow.

1485
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,400
Right under the giant dipper.

1486
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:26,900
Yeah.

1487
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,200
Himself having a nice puff.

1488
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,040
Nice crease in those pants.

1489
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,960
You can tell he was sitting for a while.

1490
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,520
Oh, yeah.

1491
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,320
Yeah, that's true.

1492
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,400
Very wrinkly pants.

1493
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,520
Very wrinkled pants.

1494
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,200
He looks tired.

1495
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,240
Tired.

1496
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:40,480
Yeah.

1497
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,600
Worn down.

1498
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,880
Soon to die.

1499
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,680
Dead in three years of this photo of smoking.

1500
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,960
Well, yeah, the dang Lost Boys are creeping around.

1501
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,880
They crave this delicious blood.

1502
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,600
I cannot believe that the Santa Cruz Boardwalk influenced someone to make,

1503
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,000
like through good example, to make their ride safer.

1504
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,400
Because the Santa Cruz Boardwalk is very, you know.

1505
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:06,880
Wow.

1506
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,920
This very ride that he's under, you said, does not feel safe to you to this day.

1507
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,000
And yet it inspired safety.

1508
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,320
Yeah.

1509
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:20,480
I mean, I feel like it's safe if you sit next to somebody that's similar in height to you.

1510
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,200
Right.

1511
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:31,360
So your plus it up would be maybe try to even out the size of people going on the giant dipper,

1512
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,880
try to get those leg heights and widths in line.

1513
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,520
But other than that.

1514
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,240
I mean, here's the thing.

1515
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,080
To this day, they might have changed their lap bars to, you know how some places now

1516
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,240
do an individual, like they just slice them down the middle.

1517
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,720
So it goes to, you know what I mean?

1518
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,120
Oh, yeah.

1519
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,240
So maybe they've done that.

1520
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:53,360
But at the time when I rode in, you know, 2007 or whatever, it was one.

1521
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,240
And I sat next to someone who was a good foot taller than me.

1522
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,440
So I had a lot of space to fly away.

1523
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,680
I need to find someone six three, possibly.

1524
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,960
Hey, you could ride next to the guy that rode next to me.

1525
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,360
OK.

1526
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,200
Well, if you know, I'll hook you guys up.

1527
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,520
Yeah.

1528
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,320
Let me know.

01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,400

01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:14,960

Wow.

1535
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,120

Well, you know, I don't know where to do it, guys.

1566
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,280
But what I'd like to propose that we all try to go find some some hot chicken pies.

1567
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,320
Might be more than 15 cents, but if we find a place, let's all meet.

1568
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,040
I think Jason knows where the hot chicken pies are.

1569
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,040
So if he if Jason could take a second out of from warning every boardwalk that their time is imminent.

1570
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,320
He's so busy, though.

1571
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:03,680
You know, climate change is very chaotic and, you know, just be careful.

1572
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,480
I'm sure they're designing, you know, with with that in mind.

1573
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,360
There is a pier.

1574
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,560
There is a pier.

1575
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,040
There's not a ton on it anymore.

1576
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,600
But, you know, be careful out there.
