1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Warning, the following podcast contains less scrutinized muppets, begrudging fake meat preparation,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,080
and discussion of two very important streets, Sesame and Gilman Street, the place where Green

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,420
Day started out.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,800
All this plus turmoil erupts as one of the hosts gets a new backpack.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,800
It's Sesame Place with Evan Susser on today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,680
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast where four grown men talking about

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840
Sesame Street is somehow less strange than their normal topics of conversation.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,880
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,960
Jason Yeah, I mean, we've got two parents here.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Mike Right, it's normal.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,680
What we're going to be saying today, the topics are normal today.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,920
Jason It is normal.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm feeling very normal.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,680
Like, Sesame Street is one of the pieces of media that I have no qualms with.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,360
It's untouchable kind of.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Mike It's perfect.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
And you still called it Streep.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Jason I know, Sesame Street.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
Besides that, you feel perfectly normal.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,240
Mike Well, look, I'm a little out of sorts, you know, I had to run home, I forgot the

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,560
microphone, I got a new backpack, I had not transferred the new backpack.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,440
Jason Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, what all that explains it.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
New backpack.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Jason I hadn't transferred.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Mike I mean, we shouldn't have even asked you to record.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,080
Jason I hadn't transferred the bag, the podcast bag, into the new backpack yet.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,480
Mike Voices of Scott Gardner giving Jason grief already before the introduction.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,920
Jason Not, no, what do you mean?

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,840
Once you explain it was a new backpack, it changed everything.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Jason Good vibes of Sesame Street.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
Jason I am excited about the new backpack.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I'd like to send our guest home and address the backpack for the rest of the episode,

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
but that would be extra rude.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,440
So I wouldn't, I won't do that.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,720
Jason It's up to, we'll bring him in on the backpack conversation.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Jason Is, but Sesame Streep is interesting.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,280
Is it a Meryl Streep, like, based Sesame Street?

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Jason The Precede?

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Jason It's not a Streep on the brain.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,360
Jason Is it, does Topsy show up on Sesame Street?

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Is that what it is?

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Jason Well, you know.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,280
Jason Topsy from Mary Poppins Returns, one of our favorite characters in fiction?

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't know.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's bring our guest in.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,840
He might know a little bit more about what we're talking about.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
You know him from Doughboys.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
He's the commissioner.

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
He's a podcast rascal, I would say.

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Evan Susser is here, ladies and gentlemen.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Returning to the podcast.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Evan Happy to be here.

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Did you not introduce Scott?

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Jason Yeah, he was got it.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
I was sort of mumbling when I was like, I started talking.

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
Jason I said giving Jason grief, Scott Geardon.

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
Evan It's great to be here.

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
Mike, I've seen you.

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Jason and Scott, I haven't seen you in about a year and a half.

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Scott So long.

63
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
Not since Mike's party.

64
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
The last party.

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
The last party.

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,200
Mike But Jason, I haven't seen you in a year and a half.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
I get up to do this podcast.

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,680
You walk up to me very frazzled and ask, do you have a heart out?

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
Evan That was what I was told.

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,840
I was told to go out and ask if he has a heart out.

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Well, I also directed you to the correct house.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Scott Oh yes, I was also trespassing in somebody else's house.

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
Evan Because you were going in the back door, the back gate of the wrong home.

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,840
Jason I know this is a lot of podcast.

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,200
This is the you know, we're explaining what we're doing, but we're back outside.

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,640
We're outside again because of the new fucking thing.

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,320
So we're being careful just in case.

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,000
So that just as Mike also, as you were saying, like it's oddly more normal that

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,480
we're talking about Sesame Street.

80
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,440
Let's add to it that we're doing it in the evening and that we will slowly be going

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,800
from day to night.

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, that's as we this will be an episode where it shifts and then it becomes a little

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Sesame Street after dark.

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Yeah.

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,360
You know, if you're scared of the dark, one, I know a great place where they could

86
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,960
teach you how not to be scared of the dark.

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,200
And I know I could tell you how to get there, too.

88
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Scott That's a place that teaches you that premise that it teaches you to be not

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
afraid of the dark.

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Evan Sesame Street teaches lots of lessons.

91
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Sure.

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,320
I would assume in many decades.

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,440
Scott I'm sure they've covered it.

94
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
It's just not like an iconic one.

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
And then how to get there.

96
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Surely.

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,440
How to get there is addressed in every episode.

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Well, no, they're asking how to get there.

99
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
That's not actually addressed how to get there, is it?

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Because you don't really know.

101
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Other than like at the theme park.

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Can you tell me?

103
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,440
That's a question that's always unanswered as far as Sesame Street is concerned.

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
So that is, yeah.

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm very happy to be here.

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,440
I've enjoyed the podcast over the pandemic, even though we weren't together.

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,440
It was a way for me to feel like I was together with you guys.

108
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I was telling you guys Lamar's episode I just listened to was so funny.

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
All those stories.

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,440
And I will say, as is my want, I pretty unapologetically campaigned to do this

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,440
episode and was insistent and pushy about doing the episode.

112
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
And I'm glad that you guys finally gave in.

113
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,440
And not enough, apparently, because I think I think it was I don't know.

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I want to say it was in my brain somewhere, but because you had texted almost like a

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,440
little coy like, oh, yeah, I was just asking because I'm going to Sesame Place.

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm going to go to Sesame Place.

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,440
And you know, it's because I went to Sesame Place and then it eventually took you

118
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
saying, so you're going to have me on for Sesame.

119
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah, I think I mentioned it while so I was we should probably get into I was

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
living on the East Coast for a year during the pandemic.

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
And while I was there and things were kind of starting to look better with COVID,

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,440
it was kind of feeling like, oh, that would be a fun thing to do at some point to go

123
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
to Sesame Place.

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
And I think I texted you guys and said, have you ever done it?

125
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Like, I might do it.

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm close.

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I've got an opportunity and, you know, kind of hinting there.

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Maybe if you guys had told me, we'll do an episode with you if you do it.

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Maybe that would have been the push.

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
But then you didn't say that.

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Then I went to Sesame Place.

132
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I sent some pictures, got tepid.

133
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Nice reaction.

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
But not not.

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, make sure to do some research.

136
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
And then I finally just had to get back and be like, OK, when are we doing this?

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Yeah.

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Well, we apologize for that.

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
You know, we should have picked up on the hints.

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I think signal reading.

141
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
It's, you know, like, I don't know.

142
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
None of us have had to like date new in a little while.

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Maybe we're not good at picking up.

144
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,440
And like, you know, I feel like even when I was dating, I needed just like clear, like,

145
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
like, no, no, no, I like you.

146
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Let's do it.

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
We don't have to go back.

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,440
So I kind of appreciated the just forward nature of it.

149
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
I mean, I think it's safe to assume we're three men who really appreciated if a woman

151
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
made the first move.

152
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh, absolutely.

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
That's my entire dating career.

154
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
I wouldn't even think to.

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
That's right.

156
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Yes.

157
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes.

158
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I think usually would like go like somebody being like, well, what is this?

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Are we going to kiss or something?

160
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Like it would be an angry female.

161
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
It's like, do you like me or what?

162
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
What is it?

163
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:13,440
So I think I think the words can I I think permission was asked for kisses of the parents.

164
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Handwritten letters.

165
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Yeah.

166
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
A lot of reasons why I think this might be a positive momentum for everyone.

167
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Yeah.

168
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
For sure.

169
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I think our generation, I feel like was told, like, don't ever ask permission for that.

170
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Like in high school and college, like Tony, I just can't.

171
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,440
And now I think more people are like, don't ask.

172
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Don't do that.

173
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
And I was like, I don't know.

174
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
And now I feel so much better.

175
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Just fucking agro morons.

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I grew up with like this was like a thing.

177
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Well, I mean, it is it is crazy how quickly culture moves.

178
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I mean, I was just thinking about, you know, that book, the game that like, you know, with like, yeah, yeah.

179
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah.

180
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
That was like a bestseller like 10 years ago.

181
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Right.

182
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Like not even that long ago in our lifetime, which was a lot of that like really, really gross.

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Like kind of what was like be mean, be mean.

184
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
And also like, you know, just like make a move and see what happens.

185
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,440
And yeah, so Jason was talking about mystery when he was saying a guy who told him it was mystery.

186
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I was mystery.

187
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Old friend.

188
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Neil Strauss, the great ghostwriter of our time.

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Yeah.

190
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
You're hanging out at the Saddle Ranch every weekend.

191
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Oh, well, I would go back and well, I go back and forth.

192
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Universal City during the week.

193
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
West Hollywood on the weekends.

194
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,440
You and Toby, David Blaine, Leonardo DiCaprio.

195
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
All the greats, all the greats.

196
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
You know the name of the group.

197
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Well, yeah, you're the one that said maybe we should rename it.

198
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
So you've kind of been a progressive.

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
The progress posse.

200
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah.

201
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,440
The nice, the nice guys, the nice fellas.

202
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
The alliteration was good, though.

203
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Something else about like culture changing and everything.

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I think about Sesame Street and Sesame Street's been more of a presence in my life because now I have a kid and he watches it.

205
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,440
And I it's it's taken me back to like, oh, it's it's still good.

206
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
It's great. Like I do not mind watching it ever.

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
And I feel like, you know, in the interim, watched it as kids now watching it with a kid.

208
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,440
And in the interim, there was just decades of godawful comedy that was all about like, hey, what if Ernie and Bert were gay?

209
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
They're gay. And that's the thing about them is that they are gay.

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
That's the joke.

211
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
And that's what Sesame Street doesn't want you to know.

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Like how much garbage did we have to sit through as if like that is a problem.

213
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Being just like it was just one of those like extremely obvious beat into the ground.

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Yeah. To know the end.

215
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
There's no further point to that.

216
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
It's just the worst.

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:54,440
There's another type of joke that annoys me with the basic premise of like, what if the thing you liked that was for kids is dark and fucked up?

218
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
And it's like, it's still that genre is still around.

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I've seen it.

220
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:06,440
It's also evolved into like, what if that thing you liked as kids came back and it's worse?

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
That's a different issue.

222
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
I'm specifically about like, yeah, trying to like distort it.

223
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Yeah. Like the version that I always, which I don't even know what this is.

224
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,440
If this is a show or like a screenplay that didn't get made, it's just like the peanuts all grown up.

225
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Well, I know exactly what you're talking about.

226
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
And that's exactly what was in my head.

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I can think of like three different versions of that.

228
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes. It's like, and then Linus tried to kill himself and you're like, all right.

229
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Like, what are we doing here?

230
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
What is this? What is the point of this?

231
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
But I agree with the very, I guess, basic take that Sesame Street. Good.

232
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
It was good when we were kids. It's good now.

233
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,440
And it doesn't have the, what's interesting is they're all Muppets.

234
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Sesame Street are Muppets, but they don't have the scrutiny of the Muppets.

235
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Everyone and people go crazy about the Muppets and this and that.

236
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
And what's the like, what's right for the Muppet?

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
And then they're going to come back. What is it going to be?

238
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
And so there's never more pressure on every move of the Muppets.

239
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
But Sesame Street just going and we don't even know what they've been doing.

240
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,440
The key is that it's been, it doesn't get rebooted.

241
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,440
It just has existed and evolved and changed over time and had to.

242
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I mean, one of now, Scott, maybe you know this.

243
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I don't know if you guys know this about why Snuffleupagus is not on Sesame Street.

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Oh, right. That's darkness creeping into the world.

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
This is a little bit of darkness.

246
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,440
So if you guys remember, which I did not remember this,

247
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
the whole thing with Snuffleupagus was only kids saw him.

248
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,440
And the joke was, or the game or whatever is, he would always be gone when the adults came back.

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,440
And kids would be like, no, Snuffleupagus was here.

250
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,440
And the adults would be like, no, there's no Snuffleupagus.

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
We don't believe you.

252
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
We don't believe you. Can you guess where this is going?

253
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Yeah, I'm a little concerned.

254
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,440
And then child psychologists approached Sesame Street and said,

255
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,440
this is not a good lesson to be teaching children that if something crazy is happening

256
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,440
and they go to an adult and adults won't believe them.

257
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,440
So they had to get rid. So there was a big thing on Sesame Street where all the adults finally saw Snuffleupagus.

258
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
But then when they did that, I was kind of like, well, what do we do now with this giant?

259
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
That was the whole thing.

260
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Well, but there is a I think he's still kind of around because there's a photo op at Sesame.

261
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Yes, he's still kind of around, but he's much, much like if you're watching, Scott, I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't seen.

262
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
No, I don't.

263
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
He's not like a regular part of the show because they kind of they diminished his role.

264
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Yeah, because that was his whole thing and newer characters that they're and also newer characters that they incorporate.

265
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I remember Abbie Kadabby's.

266
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Yeah, I had forgotten.

267
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I remember when Abbie Kadabby kind of remember when that character was introduced.

268
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,440
But like that was well after our time.

269
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I thought Elmo was more recent, but Elmo was in 1980.

270
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It just Elmo had that giant burst in popularity with the tickle me Elmo when we were like just past the Sesame Street.

271
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
He took a while to find his voice.

272
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Yes, that's sure.

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
But he was around.

274
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Yeah, the design of the character.

275
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I discovered a little of this on the second gate because I went to another separate Sesame Street place.

276
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,440
But we were also like if you've been watching it a lot, I got to ask this again.

277
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Elmo's world.

278
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I like Elmo's world.

279
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I love the song.

280
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I love both songs.

281
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
My son's obsessed with the beginning song and the end song.

282
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I Mr. Noodle drives me up the wall.

283
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
I like just snip it out.

284
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Why is why does this happen?

285
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Why does a rouge faced mime man or multiple of them?

286
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
It's a noodle extended family.

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Yeah, I'm so relieved when it's the dog.

288
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Yeah, when it's schmoodle because there's less.

289
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,440
There's less like a broad insane faces that a dog can make.

290
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,440
And yeah, and I'll say my daughter doesn't seem to really care for Mr. Noodle.

291
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
No, I don't think.

292
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah, but they're committed to it.

293
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Yeah, it's a misfire.

294
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I don't know exactly what they're going for.

295
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Maybe nonverbal communication or something like that.

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Physical comedy, I guess.

297
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
And that works without a lot of explanation.

298
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I don't know.

299
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
But he scares me.

300
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,440
If he scares me, maybe he would scare a child.

301
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Although I'm scared by a lot of things that a child is not.

302
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
I am happy.

303
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I had heard rumors because me and Scott have this thing of watching Sesame Street again after not watching it.

304
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
I had heard that Cookie Monster didn't like cookies anymore.

305
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
I heard that rumor too.

306
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,440
PC talk show monologue point.

307
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
A happy report.

308
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
He likes them just fine.

309
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Yeah.

310
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I haven't verbalized this.

311
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I felt the same way.

312
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I know what's up with Sesame Street.

313
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
They're not doing the cookies anymore.

314
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Not true.

315
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
It's not true at all.

316
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
He loves them.

317
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
He eats way too many of them.

318
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
It's great.

319
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,440
He just occasionally would tell children, try eating something else sometimes.

320
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Yes.

321
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I haven't learned that last time.

322
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
So Cookie Monster is still like.

323
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,440
And also too, I think he's also, he's become a bit of a foodie too.

324
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Which is also.

325
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
He's got the truck.

326
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
He has the food truck.

327
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Who's the helper?

328
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Gonger.

329
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Gonger is the name of the helper.

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Oh, I like that.

331
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Who's a great character.

332
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I don't know Gonger.

333
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
They do recipes for good sounding food with fresh ingredients.

334
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,440
You're watching good meals get cooked and they go talk to the guy who's sourcing the ingredients.

335
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm enthusiastic about all of this.

336
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Oh wow, yeah.

337
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Gonger looks awesome.

338
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Gonger's cool.

339
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Gonger's in the park.

340
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Gonger's in Sesame Place.

341
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Wow.

342
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Yeah, I've seen him.

343
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Yeah, should we get into talking about Sesame Place?

344
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Let's get into the place.

345
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Yeah.

346
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Yeah.

347
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Open 1980 I believe.

348
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
And now we, did you, I forget, you grew up.

349
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Well where?

350
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
In that general region.

351
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I grew up in Maryland.

352
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
So pretty close to Sesame, like very close to Sesame.

353
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Like two and a half hours.

354
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,440
We went a bunch of times when I was a kid.

355
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,440
The first time we went with my younger brother who was like two and a half when we went for the first time.

356
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:17,440
And after the day my parents always remember this, he said, this was the best day of my life.

357
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
And yeah we loved it.

358
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I mean it's, they have a lot of, like they have the characters.

359
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,440
It's like, it's not like Disneyland or Universal.

360
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,440
But it's a little bit more than just a completely janky amusement park.

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Yeah.

362
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,440
It's somewhere kind of in between and they have a big water park section which is like that you can enjoy even as you get older.

363
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Sure.

364
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
But the characters are all there.

365
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
They have rides.

366
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
They have like kind of games.

367
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Right.

368
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
And it's fun.

369
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
And the street.

370
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
And the street.

371
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
That's the street.

372
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
That's the thing.

373
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Yeah.

374
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
That's the place.

375
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I'm sorry about that.

376
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
It does have the street, Siri.

377
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
I assure you.

378
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes.

379
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,440
I grew up like 40 minutes from Sesame Place.

380
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Oh, okay.

381
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
And I remember going a couple of times as a kid.

382
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
It's Sesame Place in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

383
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I grew up in Delaware County and it's just kind of on the other, just a little north of where I grew up.

384
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
And I only had very faint memories of it.

385
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I think we went like once when me and my brother were both very little.

386
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
And then we went again when I would have been like nine or 10.

387
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,440
And it's one of the few theme park experiences I remember ever having.

388
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,440
I still had a great time, but it's one of the few times I remember going like, I might be a little too old for that.

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Because like at nine or 10, you're towering over like a lot of the other.

390
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Even a short Jason was towering over a lot of kids.

391
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,440
And at the time Sesame Place was only like three or four acres.

392
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,440
And now it's kind of quadrupled in size where it was like back then it was mostly water park.

393
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,440
And my dad reminded me there was a big like huge jungle gym netting kind of climbing area.

394
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,440
And now it's like kind of split between water park and then like there's two roller coasters.

395
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,440
There's a bunch of flat rides, you know, kiddie rides.

396
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,440
And it's really kind of grown quite a bit.

397
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Yeah. On that point of like feeling too old for it, it does.

399
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,440
I think I saw the tagline go before you grow.

400
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Go before they grow.

401
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
They grow.

402
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
And I almost started bawling.

403
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Like I almost was like, oh, God.

404
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Yeah, really tugging on the heartstrings.

405
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Tugging on the heartstrings.

406
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
There's other stuff in this where I in this park where I'm like, that's so nice.

407
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
That's so kind.

408
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
But I guess they are like they're not.

409
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
The other theme parks are more like, OK, we have to advance them to the next thing.

410
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
And what do you like when you're a teen?

411
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
And what do you like when you're an adult?

412
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,440
And I guess Sesame Place just counts on, well, maybe you loop back around.

413
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,440
That's when we get you again is when you're taking kids.

414
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah, truly. And I mean, you know, take them before they grow or whatever.

415
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I'll say that, you know, my wife and I, who both grew up going to Sesame Place, you know,

416
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,440
it was something that we talked about like, oh, that'll be fun to go with our daughter.

417
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Then this freaking pandemic happened.

418
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
And we're also I don't know if you guys know Kenny Stevenson.

419
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
He you know, he's got kids too.

420
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,440
And he told me we talked about Sesame Street and he was like, yeah, kids love Sesame Street.

421
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,440
And then like right about when they're three and a half, they're kind of like done with it.

422
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
And I was like, oh, no.

423
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You know, the pandemic's going on and we're like, we're going to we're going to run right here on the East Coast.

424
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
We got to get to this place.

425
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,440
So we're going to we're going to, you know, running out of time, the biggest loss of the pandemic,

426
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
because we might not get to go to Sesame Place.

427
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Well, if you can hold out till 2022, Sesame Place San Diego is coming.

428
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Yes. Well, we knew that was happening. Yeah.

429
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
So we were looking we were looking forward to that.

430
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,440
But then we decided to when we were, you know, Jamie and I got fully vaccinated.

431
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Cases were relatively low.

432
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
And we were like, you know what, a lot of it's outside.

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,440
So we went we went with our daughter to Sesame Place.

434
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,440
So we got that experience in which is great.

435
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
That's great. Yeah.

436
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I actually made the clock tick.

437
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:24,440
And when I did this, so the Sesame Street stuff in SeaWorld and I and I sort of like, yeah, we set a date to do it partially because well, things seem kind of the pandemic was for the moment.

438
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,440
And then and also like, what if he doesn't like Elmo next month?

439
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Yeah, these things are pretty and already it's less.

440
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
It's definitely less even than then.

441
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Yeah, I'm glad we just is crazy with a kid.

442
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,440
When like they start watching Sesame Street and you're like, how would you like to like go to real Sesame Street?

443
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
What do you think? It's like a mind blowing concept for a kid.

444
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Well, you got to have that because I was speaking it.

445
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
So you you got to communicate.

446
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Yeah, we got to talk like and like, how would you like to like meet Elmo?

447
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Like, would you like to meet Elmo?

448
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Is that something that you'd be impressed with your dad if he arranged that?

449
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Like, well, you know, like maybe it might be the kind of thing I'm able to arrange.

450
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Give the guild a little ring.

451
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
See what you can get done.

452
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
So how to play out.

453
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,440
So well, it played out well.

454
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,440
So we got there and right away, the funny thing about Sesame Street plays is you can do like everything there.

455
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,440
It's like the park was open to like 10 to five and we were like, oh, is that going to be like enough time?

456
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,440
And like, yeah, we have nothing to do.

457
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,440
So we get there and right away we're like, oh, like there's a parade at 1030.

458
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
That's like a good thing to do.

459
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,440
We'll see everybody. And we're like we like are running in because we drove in from, you know, D.C.

460
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,440
like that morning to like Philadelphia. It's like a two and a half hour drive.

461
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
And we're like parking and like we've got to get good spot for the parade.

462
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,440
And then we get there like, where is the parade happening?

463
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Like no one. It's like the smallest.

464
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Like there was no it was not very crowded.

465
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
So we just get a good spot.

466
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
And it's they call it a mini parade.

467
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,440
And I don't know a big theme of the whole trip was is this because of covid or is this just always how it is?

468
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
So it was a small parade with which some of this is good because it's kind of overwhelming.

469
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,440
But it's like Bert and Ernie, Elmo, cook Oscar and Cookie Monster.

470
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
And that was it for the parade.

471
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Oh, and like three floats.

472
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,440
And that's what it was, which, you know, is like exciting.

473
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,440
But even like Abby, who's like one of her favorite, I was like, it's not Abby.

474
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
There's not Big Bird.

475
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Oh, in fact, spoiler, no Big Bird the entire.

476
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
What do you mean?

477
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Like represented with like, you know, pictures and stuff.

478
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Yeah.

479
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,440
But so they'd like the tall person calling sick.

480
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I guess that could be.

481
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Or, you know, we went on a weekday or because of covid.

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Maybe it's like like the Big Bird costumes, more of an ordeal.

483
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
We don't do that.

484
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
You know, did you ask, by the way?

485
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
What did you ask?

486
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
We should have asked about Big Bird, but we did not.

487
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,440
And then we did a meet and greet with Elmo, which unfortunately, because of covid, they don't actually get to touch and interact.

488
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
So you kind of extend.

489
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,440
But then it was nice because when we went to the meet and greet, it was Elmo and Abby was there.

490
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,440
And then my daughter was very sweet, like, you weren't at the parade like we were looking for you.

491
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,440
And then Julia, who's a newer character.

492
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Julia.

493
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,440
She's she's an autistic character, the first autistic Muppet.

494
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
So that's a nice thing that they have.

495
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:51,440
And then the big thing, which was they had Cookie Monster's foodie truck at Sesame Place, which we were building up.

496
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
It seemed really exciting.

497
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,440
It also was like, oh, this is like, you know, being worried about indoor outdoor dining.

498
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Oh, that's outdoor. It's a food truck.

499
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
That'll be great.

500
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,440
But then on the drive up, our daughter was like, oh, great.

501
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,440
And then like Cookie Monster, like, will serve me the food.

502
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
And I know that can't be how it works.

503
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
You know, it's just going to be a guy.

504
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah.

505
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,440
And then unfortunately, the food truck was closed the whole time we were there.

506
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,440
So there was a lot of that kind of stuff of like building up and expectations.

507
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
But still good.

508
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,440
And a lot of we tried doing the rides because they have a lot of rides there.

509
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,440
But very off the shelf, but like nicely decorated with Sesame Street stuff.

510
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Yeah.

511
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,440
But the rides, all of them, my daughter was just like, this is not my favorite.

512
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,440
So I mean, she like me, you know, my wife is much more she's like, oh, maybe she'll like they've roller coasters.

513
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Maybe she'll want to do the roller coaster.

514
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm like, are you insane? She's two and a half.

515
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,440
You're getting like because I like you guys, I'm scared of rides.

516
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,440
And even like we did like their version of like the teacups, which our daughter hated and I hate it.

517
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I don't like really disco Grover teacups or the actually the.

518
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Hold on.

519
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,440
That's OK. Is the answer mix up the monster?

520
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,440
And it's but it's the same situation where you can turn it in the car.

521
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,440
But did you just not turn it? Yeah.

522
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Jamie, my wife was trying to turn and I like push her hand.

523
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I mean, we don't like it. We don't like that.

524
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,440
So, yeah, so there's like a lack of like I think the most expensive Sesame Street ride is in Japan, right?

525
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Or a port. Yeah.

526
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
What have you in Spain? I think this is a dark ride.

527
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm talking about spaghetti. Oh, you're talking about spaghetti.

528
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Is that universal? Is that in Singapore?

529
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
It might be Singapore. Yeah.

530
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,440
I think it's a dark ride where Grover like goes into space and sees monsters and like you're like kind of it's like E.T.

531
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Adventure a little bit.

532
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Space chase. Yeah.

533
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,440
They don't Singapore. I would love them to have some like good like dark rides, but they don't.

534
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
There is a dark. There's a dark ride in Spain, I believe.

535
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,440
OK. So, yeah, it is interesting that like the thing I think you're talking about, you want something like that.

536
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Yes. That's like not thrill based, but there's a lot of stuff and robots and right.

537
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Because they kind of have like state fair kind of rides with like Sesame Street branding.

538
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Right. Exactly. Sure.

539
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Which some of that stuff, you know, I said I can't say a bad word about Sesame Street the show.

540
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Sesame Place. There are some criticisms.

541
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh, yeah. Sure.

542
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Oh, please. Because it's not a given.

543
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Like, you know, like I understand that like, well, this will be enough for a kid.

544
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,440
The kid will like it. But maybe you're testing that like maybe your daughter like it's I don't know.

545
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
They take more too. Yes.

546
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
They would happily accept more.

547
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Well, one huge thing, my big complaint is the gift shop, which, you know, I would love to have gone nuts in this gift shop.

548
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Yeah. But they don't they only they like just sell stuff that you could like buy online.

549
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Yeah. Just like normal Sesame Street stuff.

550
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
So that's a that's a small thing. But I said, come on.

551
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Like it was I finally found like a shirt that said Sesame Place itself.

552
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Whereas it's just so that was general. That was one.

553
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I have a piece of merch. If we're talking about merch, this was again in the SeaWorld San Diego thing that I saw.

554
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,440
And maybe you ran in this too. This might be at multiple locations.

555
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Sesame Place, by the way, owned by it's in the SeaWorld umbrella.

556
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:36,440
There is some crossover and some of the same stuff, which maybe could include this shirt, which has the count on it and the shirt.

557
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,440
He's doing a very particular move and the shirt says Count Dabula.

558
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Yeah. Yeah. There are some attempts.

559
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
That's good. Yeah.

560
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,440
But he's not he's not Dracula, though.

561
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,440
I know.

562
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Dabula.

563
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Count Dabula is good. If you saw Count Dabula, would you have gotten it?

564
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Yeah.

565
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Wow. They were not the first outlet to think of Count Dabula t-shirts.

566
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm finding out very quickly.

567
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Is it the counter is actually Dracula?

568
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Jason. What's that?

569
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Is it the count specifically or is it actually?

570
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Oh, no, it's a lot of generic looking Dracula's.

571
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
OK, got it.

572
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,440
But nobody's made the move to make Count Dabula into a feature film, which is what I think should be the ultimate.

573
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,440
As soon as this is now in the universe. Yeah.

574
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Now it's going to happen. Yeah, for sure.

575
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,440
One of the most popular shirts is now a major motion picture and a streaming series.

576
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,440
The viral shirt is now a hit movie.

577
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Yeah, that's a good idea.

578
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,440
No foul that away. Yeah, you're the screenwriter.

579
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,440
I could see the light bulb going off. It was nice to see the creation process.

580
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Martin Carcesi criticizes the viral shirt.

581
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,440
And the street itself is great. It feels like, you know, like you were saying, Scott,

582
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
as good as it is, you could imagine that being even better.

583
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Like you could have more fun with actual Sesame Street.

584
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,440
You could have like characters kind of like honestly, would they do a universal with like the Italian American?

585
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,440
But if you had that was like Sesame Street characters, that would be you want them to like roast you as you're walking down Sesame Street.

587
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Oscar popped up and said mean things.

588
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Oh, that'd be great. Dumb shoes.

589
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,440
There is a trash can that you can like touch a button.

590
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
It's like, hey, leave me alone. That's kind of fun.

591
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,440
But he doesn't pop out. He doesn't pop out.

592
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Well, Oscar has a roller coaster. Yes.

593
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
He does. Oscar also has a garage.

594
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,440
There's like a facade that says Oscar's Oscar has a lot of business vendors going in this part.

595
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Very all over the place.

596
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Yeah. Living in a trash can. Yeah. He gets a lot done.

597
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Yeah. They don't even have like a donkey like a donkey universal like waffle cart with Oscar.

598
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
They don't have that.

599
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Well, here's something I know from a little looking into retro Sesame places that they did have this at a certain point.

600
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
OK. Yeah.

601
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:20,440
And not only that, but it was I think somewhere in an early contract, it was stipulated that you could not have representations of the characters without the real voices.

602
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,440
They wanted this to be consistent.

603
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,440
So there was an Oscar and a what was the other one? A Cookie Monster.

604
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:38,440
And they were animatronics. They were simple animatronics with the real voices.

605
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,440
So and they like you look at photos, they're like cool and early 80s and analog.

606
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,440
I don't know why like why you would have that and then stop doing it.

607
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
That seems confusing.

608
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,440
I just want to see the as with any of the Muppet attractions, seeing like, well, this is how they look on TV.

609
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,440
They don't even have to change mediums. That just is Cookie Monster there.

610
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
That'd be really cool.

611
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,440
It feels like you could like make more money getting rid of all the rides and just making the street amazing.

612
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
I agree with that.

613
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,440
And you know, in the things like the shows, some of them like the meet and greet, they're just waving.

614
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Obviously, they're not talking.

615
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,440
But then some of the shows, they do have, you know, they're like lip syncing to like record it.

616
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,440
And that like blew my daughter's mind being like, whoa, they're like here.

617
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Like they're talking. And this is this is great.

618
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Well, now what were those? Because we got to and I said a lot of us in the second game,

619
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,440
but I went to something called the furry friends dance party, which I believe is there too.

620
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
We also did. Yeah. All right.

621
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Right. Well, my daughter, I think I sent Mike a video of it.

622
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,440
I mean, she just was so excited to be there.

623
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,440
It was like, you know, entering Studio 54 for her.

624
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Slightly less cocaine, but just for the parents.

625
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Yeah, but she she loved that. So that was really good.

626
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,440
There was the the magic of art, which was a little bit of like a story kind of show that had like some humans

627
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,440
and like learning the lessons and like my daughter like will sing the song from that show like even now,

628
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,440
which is like she really made an impression. Oh, that's cool.

629
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Is there a an Elmo the musical?

630
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,440
There's not an Elmo the musical. Is that in SeaWorld?

631
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,440
No, there wasn't. I think there maybe there was or has been.

632
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Yeah, because that's like also recurring Elmo thing that it's he makes it musicals and there is a like a curtain

633
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,440
flap that speaks, I think.

634
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Oh, that would have been a hang. I don't know.

635
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
I think they may have done that. I was trying to find evidence of moves like Bert.

636
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
The parody. Do you have it? I got you covered.

637
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,440
All right. Thank you. Did you did you catch the song moves like Bert?

638
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,440
We did not get moves like Bert. We got the Elmo slide.

639
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,440
I really like the Elmo slide. Yeah, it's like an earworm for sure.

640
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Yeah, that's one of those it's been kicking around and then like out of nowhere.

641
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,440
You're just like doing the dishes and then and when you're at a place, we probably have the Elmo slide 30 times.

642
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,440
That was in the show. We just like turn to each other one day out of nowhere.

643
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,440
I think I like the Elmo slide. Yeah, no, I think that's not I think I'm not laughing at it.

644
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,440
I just like it. Let me let me do a little hit of because this was a song that I got in my free friends dance party

645
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,440
referenced on the second gate, but I think it merits a clip if this is too quiet.

646
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Drop in some later.

647
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,440
That's fantastic. I'm very disappointed that that was not a part of.

648
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Yes. Is that the video from Sesame Street Live?

649
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,440
I think it was. Yeah, that version is I think this is from a live tour that went around.

650
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:06,440
By the way, after this goes a couple other characters get rounds, including I think a very like overlooked character at this point.

651
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Telly monster. Yeah, one of my childhood favorites.

652
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I think Telly is being phased out as well. Telly is something wrong with Telly's relationship?

653
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
No, I think just not connecting. Oh, man.

654
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:30,440
You know what I like that song and then the shop Trader Burt's this park really showing Bert letting his hair down a little relaxing a bit.

655
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Lindsay really brought I sent Lindsay moves like Bert and she said, Why isn't it moves like Ernie?

656
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
There's two syllables. Doesn't he have enough?

657
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,440
I disagree with that concept. Ernie never could have enough.

658
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,440
But Ernie two syllables like Jagger.

659
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,440
And also if who would you think has the moves? Right.

660
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,440
It's funny. It's a comedic. It's a funny, comedic set up with Bird.

661
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I guess that's why it's happening. But it doesn't maybe Bert and Jagger have that in common.

662
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Is that is that bird like Jagger? Yeah, maybe.

663
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
So moves like Telly is fun, too.

664
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I'm glad Telly had some some representation there.

665
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I just like to have. I don't know. Maybe it's the kid situation brings this out of me.

666
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I think I've been hard on Jack FM type music.

667
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
What would the Med Tea Party Fiasco?

668
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:33,440
And I just want to say that in terms of like theme park entertainment from songs within the last 20 years from vaguely contemporary songs, moves like Bert melted my icy heart.

669
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Wow.

670
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Yeah, I mean, it's hard. It's hard to imagine a parody sung by Bert that you wouldn't like.

671
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah. You know, he's got a funny singing voice.

672
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,440
He's a lovable character. Yeah.

673
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Let me ask real quick. Everybody, Bert or Ernie, as far as their favorite as a child.

674
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Ernie. After all that, it's Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. Jason.

675
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,440
It was probably Ernie. I think I had stuffed animals of both.

676
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Now, I think. Well, we know now.

677
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:16,440
We're talking about this. I'm concerned that like as a child, I just absorbed all this through osmosis of my personality is just a combination of Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch and parts of Bert and Ernie.

678
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,440
A little bit of Ernie in there, but a lot of Bert.

679
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Yeah, maybe Ernie like 10 years ago when I as far as I know you.

680
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Ernie's gone, I think. Do any of you have in his 20s?

681
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,440
20s. I remember Ernie inside.

682
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,440
But now I think it's just Bert. Oh, man.

683
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
What's the most hurt Jason's ever been on the show?

684
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Working together this long has led to that.

685
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Yeah, I did it. I beat it out of me. I beat the Ernie out of you all these years.

686
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,440
My Ernie antics have beat the Ernie out of me. Only Bert remains.

687
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,440
So yeah, Ernie. Ernie's I just I always get bummed that Ernie's not more popular these days.

688
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Yeah. Yeah. I don't. Why do you think that is?

689
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't know. I mean, his zany antics fit better in the couple decades where he was at the top.

690
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
I don't know. Almost not as zany. I don't think.

691
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Yeah. He's not as much of an anarchist as Ernie was.

692
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,440
That's like Ernie, I think, is also like a holdover from your Bugs Bunny.

693
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Like he comes in the situation and tears shit up.

694
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
The cat in the hat is the same way.

695
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Yeah. Young kids these days, they don't like that as much.

696
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
They don't. Right. That's not as fun.

697
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,440
And I think Elmo kind of elbowed in a little bit, too.

698
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. With like, you know, as far as being a wild.

699
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,440
What's interesting about Elmo is he's wild, but you kind of get the sense he doesn't know better.

700
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,440
The funny and maybe bad thing about Ernie is he knows better.

701
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
He knows. He knows.

702
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
He knows. The thing where he gets the sheep to carry Bert's bed out of.

703
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
We've all seen the segment, right?

704
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,440
There's one where Ernie's I'm trying to think it's Shuffle Off to Buffalo or something.

705
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
He's doing like a song and he keeps way.

706
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
I mean, he keeps like messing with Bert.

707
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,440
He's like playing a saxophone and then he has like sheep come in and they carry Bert's bed outside.

708
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:19,440
And the thing ends, the little segment ends Bert outside at night and he can't get in and he's trying to go like Ernie has kept him outside of their bedroom at night.

709
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,440
And like, that's it. It's over. And you even as a kid, you're like, Bert has to sleep outside.

710
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,440
That is kind of mean. Like, oh, OK. Right.

711
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I did find even though Ernie was my favorite, like I liked him more than maybe my favorite period and definitely liked him more than Bert.

712
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,440
He would sometimes do things like Bugs Bunny that would make me uncomfortable.

713
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Sure. So, you know, I think that I can understand.

714
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,440
He would tell you just to go for the kiss and don't ask.

715
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,440
He was often giving you that advice.

716
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Yeah, no, I agree with that. And but I yeah, I liked Ernie.

717
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,440
He was so much fun. I liked both Ernie and Bert.

718
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I had both Ernie and Bert dolls and I was pretty obsessed with them for a couple of years.

719
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:15,440
I still, by the way, real quick, sorry. I have this Ernie doll in in my bedroom now and it is terrifying.

720
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,440
It's from when I was little, like one. And I have it in his pajamas. His crotch is ripped open.

721
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,440
I think I've talked about this before. His stuffing is coming out. His hair is falling out.

722
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,440
I think we don't need to explore that too much more.

723
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,440
There's nothing dirty there. It's just because the thing wasn't made very well. His hair is falling out.

724
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,440
It's a connective point. Yes, his mouth is like gone.

725
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,440
That like little like piece of felt that was his mouth is gone.

726
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,440
So you have like a portrait of Dory and Greg kind of Ernie doll that just falls apart and you stay youthful.

727
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Like Robert the doll, the evil doll. I have the Ernie version of like the living doll that was Chuckie was based on.

728
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Yes, I have it still in the apartment. So I'll post a photo of Ernie. Anyway, sorry. You were saying, Scott.

729
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:04,440
What was I saying? I think that does some of, is there a little bit of a slide with Bert and Ernie because you no longer have the originals doing it.

730
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
100%. Yes, 100%.

731
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Because that's like an ultimate, an ensign Oz. Right.

732
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Like unfortunately, and I think a lot of the characters have maintained and bounced back and changed hands successfully.

733
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:22,440
But that one, I mean those are just such like classic sketches and they just had such a rhythm as they did with Hermit and Piggy.

734
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,440
And I mean, that's an unfortunate fallout of that kind of situation.

735
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,440
And I ask is that kind of the same with Grover? Is the same person? I don't know. I can't account for it.

736
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,440
I feel like Grover has faded back to his era. Grover is pretty minimized. He is.

737
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
But he's around more than I thought. This was a thing I was bemoaning.

738
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Not like some of these other ones. Maybe even more than, honestly maybe even more than Bert and Ernie.

739
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,440
But really the show is Elmo and Abby are like the stars. Yeah.

740
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Cookie Monster, I would say third lead. Wow, really? Pretty good.

741
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,440
And then, yeah, yeah, which is nice. I'm glad he's so represented.

742
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,440
And then just like celebrities from shows that film in New York. Yes.

743
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,440
It's a lot of, you know, Chenoweth and Ellie Kemper and Michael Che.

744
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,440
And then it kind of rotates in. It's like, oh, this one you'll have Bert and Ernie. This one you'll have Gonger.

745
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,440
And then also, yeah, like Zoe, Rosita, like newer characters. Yeah.

746
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Yeah. I did think reading about the roller coasters because the Super Grover coaster is like a metal steel coaster.

747
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,440
And I was like, is that for the millennial parents? Is that for the older folks?

748
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,440
Oh, so Grover almost reads as a retro reference in a way.

749
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Well, I mean, yeah, I get he's still around and stuff.

750
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,440
But I just remember being a big Grover kid in like the 80s, late 80s. Yeah. Yeah.

751
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Monster at the end of this book. Yeah, I will.

752
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,440
I have a special bond with Grover because I had a lot of action figures as a kid and I love playing with them.

753
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,440
And really the only time I ever remember being punished by my parents, I broke a cabinet by hanging on it repeatedly after they told me not to.

754
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,440
And they took away all of my action figures for I think it was a year.

755
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,440
It was probably three days, but it felt like a year.

756
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:28,440
And I think after 12 hours of seeing me in like agony, my dad gave me a Super Grover, like snuck me a Super Grover and like Homer with the pizza.

757
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Right. Exactly. And it and it was like a lifeline to have the Super Grover.

758
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Wow. Interesting. So that's why you're bonded to him. Yeah, because he's also Jewish.

759
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,440
He is. Oh, wow. Yeah. Canonically, that's true.

760
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,440
I think I realized that. And he's a Jewish superhero as well. Yes.

761
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Yeah. As is the Count, which I have some weird feelings about. Oh, yeah, sure.

762
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,440
The Count is canonically Jewish. He is canonically Jewish.

763
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Wow. Where is all this established? I knew Grover, but I know the Count.

764
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,440
It's I don't know. It's in the Sesame Street.

765
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,440
There are Jewish books where it specifies that they're Jewish.

766
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
And it's like, I think, kind of consistent.

767
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I think that in the show when they would have like a Hanukkah episode, they're Jewish.

768
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
When you cut to a Hanukkah party, that's who's there.

769
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
That's who's there. Two of them.

770
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,440
Count is there. Counting is money. That's the issue. Yes.

771
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Having a perfect handle on everything you got.

772
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,440
But yeah, those are the Jewish. Those are the Jewish Sesame Street.

773
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
And of course, Bert and Ernie. Bert is Episcopalian and Ernie is Methodist.

774
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,440
And that's where a lot of the friction comes from. Small differences, you know.

775
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Yeah. That was the underlying thing in all the old sketches.

776
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,440
That's right. Protestant strife.

777
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Yeah. So I have not obviously watched. There's a lot of childish things in my life.

778
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I have not watched a full Sesame Street in 30 years.

779
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah, I'll say it would be insane to do that. Yeah, right.

780
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to say you should do it.

781
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,440
It's just a thing. You don't like. It's a pick your poison with the kids entertainment.

782
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,440
And like, well, it's a good poison.

783
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,440
You always have the option, of course, of the Elmo not too late talk show on HBO Max.

784
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Where Elmo hangs out with Lil Nas X. OK, sure.

785
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,440
And John Mulaney and you know, you could. I could watch that. Yeah.

786
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Elmo's friend Lil Nas X. I mean, that's pretty. That's great to see.

787
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,440
They have a lot of fun together. So give that a go.

788
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,440
And you know what? They get like, is his sidekick Ernie or is Ernie like, does Ernie work there?

789
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Like they fit everybody in. There's sort of a Larry Sanders component.

790
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,440
You see people in the booth. Is Ernie like. Stage managers.

791
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Burt would be like a good arty. Like a Larry Sanders. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
Fred deCourteve. Yeah, yeah.

793
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Or I was going to say like Gelman. I have to really quickly correct something.

794
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,440
I don't know that I've ever gotten so many corrections for an error I made on the podcast, The Ride.

795
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,440
But on Patreon and I apologize, it's only on Patreon.

796
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,440
I incorrectly said that the Green Day's venue and street that they played in was Gelman Street.

797
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Every book I think plus 1010 per people told me it is not Gelman Street is Gilman Street.

798
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
You idiot.

799
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Gelman is the producer on Regis and Kathie Lee or whatever it's called now.

800
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,440
That's a bad mistake.

801
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:33,440
And so I'd like to apologize formally for getting the name of the venue slash street, which I think I may be getting that wrong too.

802
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:41,440
And I'd like to apologize for any of this ever coming up, for any Green Day content being in this theme park podcast.

803
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Green Day blew the doors wide open with everyone.

804
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,440
And they're like Scott doesn't like American Idiots.

805
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
That was a whole big thing.

806
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Yeah, no, we.

807
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,440
I've been following.

808
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,440
Oh, OK. So you know all the controversy.

809
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
I see. OK.

810
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
But you didn't text about you weren't like worried about us.

811
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Yeah.

812
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,440
We aren't getting along anymore because I think I texted Carlson privately and said that you're crazy.

813
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
The Green Day is great.

814
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
OK. Yeah. You're pro-Green Day.

815
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
No, I'm getting out of number.

816
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
All right.

817
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Why did I agree to have you on?

818
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
I knew that.

819
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,440
I kept it to myself.

820
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,440
The Susser band stated a few other things I wanted to touch on in the park.

821
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
If that's of course.

822
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, go ahead.

823
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
So the food options.

824
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
Fun thing. We got soft pretzel, Elmo soft pretzel.

825
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
It looks like Elmo.

826
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Great. Yeah.

827
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Very good.

828
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
I wish there were more stuff like that, but happy to see that.

829
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:42,440
Right. Then the food is like pretty like I mentioned that the foodie truck was closed and then like the dining options pretty like sparse like hamburger.

830
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,440
You know, chicken fingers, mac and cheese.

831
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Yeah.

832
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Like that's kind of what you get.

833
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,440
But my wife's a vegetarian and she said, well, look at this.

834
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
They have impossible meat.

835
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,440
They have an impossible burger and an impossible meatball sub.

836
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
So that's good.

837
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,440
You know, that's like not have to worry about that.

838
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
She can eat.

839
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
She can eat.

840
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,440
And so I went in to order the food and I was like, I have a hand.

841
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,440
They didn't see it on the menu, but I was like, um, I'll have a hamburger.

842
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
And do you have an impossible burger?

843
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:24,440
And this was the reaction from the person.

844
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Let me check.

845
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
They leave.

846
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,440
They come back and like, yeah, we have them, but it'll take like 10 minutes.

847
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
And I said, that's okay.

848
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,440
That's fine.

849
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Okay.

850
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
I'll call you when it's ready.

851
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Yeah, no problem.

852
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Okay.

853
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Wait, it's way more than 10 minutes.

854
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Fine.

855
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I'm just like, you're punished.

856
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
Yes.

857
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,440
I finally like 15 minutes.

858
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,440
I just want to make sure like the impossible burger.

859
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Like, yeah, we're, we're working on it.

860
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,440
And then somebody walks by, this was like the county part.

861
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Oh, like another, like, you know, looked like visiting a Sesame place from Brooklyn,

862
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
hipstery kind of dad hears it.

863
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,440
He's like, Oh, you guys have impossible burgers?

864
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,440
Yeah, yeah, we do.

865
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
They take, they take 10 minutes.

866
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,440
I looked at a lot of the menus and a lot of the places have, are advertising impossible burgers.

867
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440
They're not being ordered.

868
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Like Buffalo cauliflower.

869
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
These things are not being ordered.

870
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
I guess.

871
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
Yeah.

872
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
Don't put them on.

873
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
If you're good.

874
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah.

875
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
So make a big face.

876
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Are they probably, they're probably like frozen because they're not in rotation a lot.

877
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Right.

878
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
So it's a huge to do.

879
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,440
Yeah.

880
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
I mean, it didn't seem like I'd pick up what to do.

881
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
I mean, I had the whole thing.

882
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm like, yeah, I know they're frozen.

883
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
It'll just take a little bit longer.

884
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Unless it's further than that.

885
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,440
And forgive me if I've said this on the show, but at that Knott's chicken dinner restaurant,

886
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:58,440
there was some occasion where my wife ordered something pretty heavily vegetarian and the person froze.

887
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,440
The waitress, like they had never encountered this before at the chicken restaurant.

888
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,440
So like, absolutely that will be fine.

889
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,440
And then it took so long to come.

890
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:15,440
And we are very sure that somebody had to make a trip to the store for ingredients for this.

891
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Or maybe.

892
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
That's what happened.

893
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
You know, that's the other funny thing about Sesame Place.

894
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:27,440
It just is like it's on one side and then like across the street is just like a mini mall, like a Best Buy and like a sports authority and maybe a grocery store.

895
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
So maybe it was just like, we got to get there.

896
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Do they have the Impossible Burgers here?

897
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,440
It's time for an intern to shine.

898
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Other gripes to bring up.

899
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
Jason, I think you'll be right here with me.

900
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
So there's a big water park.

901
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
Yeah.

902
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,440
OK.

903
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,440
And they have like lockers and stuff so you can put your stuff.

904
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,440
How much do you think a locker at Sesame Place?

905
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,440
I saw this.

906
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,440
I did see this.

907
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,440
Go ahead.

908
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
Yeah, I saw it.

909
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,440
So we weren't going to do a lot of the water stuff, but we were going to do the Lazy River.

910
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
And we were just kind of unsure.

911
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,440
We were like, oh, like I did it once with my daughter and the janitor said, oh, let's all do it.

912
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Can you go put the stuff in the locker and we'll go around twice for like 10 minutes.

913
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
And I said, you know, we can probably just leave.

914
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Like people aren't going to.

915
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Like there are a million strollers out.

916
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Right.

917
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,440
Are people really going to run by?

918
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,440
I was like, fine, I'll do it.

919
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,440
I get to the lockers.

920
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Thirty five dollars for a locker.

921
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
Wow.

922
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,440
For no amount of like you can't do it for a period of time.

923
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
It's just like that's the whole.

924
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Yeah.

925
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
And it's also not a huge locker.

926
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,440
So it's like really only for like a backpack.

927
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
No, the bigger lockers are more.

928
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
And also like summer.

929
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Forty five dollars.

930
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
And then it even goes up from there.

931
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Yeah.

932
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
And I was looking at ticket prices.

933
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,440
I remember it's like, oh, one thing I remember at Sesame Places, it was always pretty affordable.

934
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,440
And there's a lot of hotels that do discounts in the area.

935
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
There's a lot of deals in the area.

936
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
So you can usually find discount tickets.

937
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,440
But like summer tickets seem to be on average like 40 bucks.

938
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Yeah.

939
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,440
That locker is just under ticket price.

940
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,440
The price of Sesame Place is 90 dollars, but it's like always on.

941
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
It's never 90 dollars.

942
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
Yeah.

943
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,440
It's always like you can always get a discounted ticket for like half price.

944
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,440
So Sesame Place is like 40, 45 dollars.

945
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
Right.

946
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
But then the locker is the same price is going.

947
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
It's insane.

948
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
Yeah.

949
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:29,440
Prices seem to go up for the Halloween and Christmas stuff because the park operations is like it's open all summer.

950
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Rides and waterpark.

951
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,440
And then it continues on the weekends of September and it continues in Halloween time.

952
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,440
So there's some weekdays and weekends for like the counts Halloween event.

953
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
And then there is a furry Christmas.

954
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,440
I think they call it very furry Christmas is the name.

955
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,440
A lot of people show up to and are kind of confused.

956
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
This isn't what they said.

957
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
And so I'm free here.

958
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,440
Yeah.

959
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:04,440
But I don't I don't remember if they did that when I was a kid or not because they didn't have like many rides of anything to open at Christmas and Halloween.

960
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Right.

961
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,440
Yeah.

962
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,440
They also too which I remember from being a kid have like a whole like carnival rides kind of section.

963
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Oh yeah.

964
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Games where you win a prize.

965
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
Yeah.

966
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
Did you did you play.

967
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,440
Yeah I did.

968
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Which was also my daughter's first time ever seeing something like that.

969
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,440
And just the idea of like you do it and you get something was like.

970
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Yeah.

971
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
That's great.

972
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
That's did she did she play at all.

973
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Did she play.

974
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Yeah.

975
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
Kind of.

976
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
I mean with me assisting.

977
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
I see.

978
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Was it like the water squirting thing or.

979
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
Yeah.

980
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
That's it.

981
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Did I ever.

982
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,440
I told the story in the podcast where I accidentally beat a bunch of kids on the pier Santa Monica Pier and one of Homer Simpson doll.

983
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
That's great.

984
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
At what age.

985
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,440
Twenty nine.

986
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:55,440
Like I was like oh game I want to go sit down and play and I played and then I looked I looked to my right after I won and I was like I think I just beat a bunch of kids.

987
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,440
All right.

988
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
I didn't realize it was a competition.

989
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
Yes.

990
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,440
I think that's a new rule with that where I have to be sitting first at a game and then if the parents see there's an older kid that it's on them then it's on them.

991
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Maybe their kids are sharp.

992
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,440
That's how I think of myself.

993
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,440
Maybe their kids are you know.

994
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,440
That's right.

995
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,440
They're setting their kids into the fire if they see me playing but I'm not going to go there.

996
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,440
You're starting up against.

997
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,440
There's a bunch of kids.

998
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,440
I'm not going to do that.

999
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,440
I like to scope those things out and if there's really it's really empty like can I be a player of one.

1000
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
Can I guarantee myself.

1001
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Well but then you get a smaller prize.

1002
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Yeah exactly.

1003
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,440
I mean the right way to scope is like see like a bunch of kids.

1004
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
Yeah.

1005
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,440
The littlest kids possible playing and then you got one seat left and you sneak right in and you beat all of them.

1006
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
That's the way to do it.

1007
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
You got to get ruthless Jason.

1008
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,440
You're going to get like a little like decoder ring or a little one of those really cheap prizes.

1009
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,440
It's usually like not the IP also is when it's you know what I'm saying like a small you'll see like oh it's a bunch of Simpsons things.

1010
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,440
Right.

1011
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,440
And then like the thing you get if it's only one player or two players it's like oh it's like a generic bird or something.

1012
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,440
Plus bird.

1013
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
I mean I and sensor.

1014
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
Right.

1015
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,440
It's not the same way maybe universal but like on the pier they always put the attractive IP prizes and they're giant.

1016
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,440
And yeah you have to have a full like a packed house playing to get those prizes.

1017
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:20,440
I played a game at nots back at the Christmas food festival with a pick like the duck game and like pick up a duck.

1018
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
Pick up a duck.

1019
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,440
And I really it's similarly to what I said I did with it.

1020
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,440
I appreciated this setup.

1021
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,440
They're like OK you're guaranteed to win a prize.

1022
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,440
Five dollars you can pick one of these ten dollars you can pick one of these.

1023
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,440
I was like so I'm just buying a stuff that they're like yeah but you have to play the game.

1024
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,440
All right fair enough.

1025
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,440
But it sounds like that's what you want to do anyway.

1026
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,440
Kind of.

1027
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
Yeah.

1028
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,440
Because you don't want to play you don't want to be playing it so you was a little disappointed when I walked in a gift shop and I was like oh well there's that little Snoopy.

1029
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,440
I just I didn't realize I thought they were maybe a little more exclusive to the prize.

1030
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:00,440
But you should go inside a dollar store and have a little bucket of water with a duck and pick the duck up and then buy yourself something nice.

1031
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,440
You know that is that's a good idea.

1032
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Yeah some limited run cereal that they're just trying to clear stock.

1033
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Yeah.

1034
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
Old vitamins.

1035
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,440
I play carnival games at home and give myself a little prize.

1036
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Nothing wrong with it.

1037
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,440
Fresh treats bakery treats is the prize.

1038
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,440
Yeah.

1039
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
We were going to say something.

1040
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
Yes.

1041
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Mike before we did this I asked you to remind me about something.

1042
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
Oh yeah I haven't reminded you haven't reminded me.

1043
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
What's the time.

1044
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
Yeah go for it.

1045
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
I reminded myself.

1046
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Okay well I'm going to set this up though the way you did it you said remind me on the podcast and I said what.

1047
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,440
And you said I'll know.

1048
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,440
And not to backtrack too much but also you specifically texted about me not liking Green Day.

1049
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,440
In reality.

1050
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,440
This is an exchange like I better go out of my way to talk about Scott and Green Day.

1051
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Well I mean surely you know the early albums you could appreciate.

1052
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Appreciate.

1053
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
Yes.

1054
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,440
We'll sit down and we'll listen to the whole catalog together.

1055
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
Yeah well we're going to record it.

1056
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,440
He's going to have to listen to American Idiot.

1057
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
Okay.

1058
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Watch the Broadway show.

1059
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:11,440
So there is this thing that also happened while I was at Sesame Place that I don't think is representative of Sesame Place.

1060
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Okay.

1061
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,440
And in fact I would like to not keep track of what all their employees were doing on January 6th.

1062
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Okay.

1063
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Well I would like for this not to be in the podcast.

1064
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:32,440
So I would like to tell you this story and then maybe you could play moves like Bert and then you'll pick up just on your reaction to the story.

1065
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Hang on.

1066
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,440
Wait a minute.

1067
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,440
How close can you get us to this is just all this is entirely.

1068
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
I love you calling this shot.

1069
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,440
I love this.

1070
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,440
This is an interesting move.

1071
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,440
You can hear the story and if you guys think that it should be included I maybe leave it to you to do it.

1072
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
Okay.

1073
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,440
But I think when I tell you the story you might all decide that I've made the right decision.

1074
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,440
Okay.

1075
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Wow.

1076
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
Interesting.

1077
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
So if so the listener is really teetering on something.

1078
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,440
You might hear an interesting story or you might just hear a full block of moves like Bert.

1079
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
Yes.

1080
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Wow.

1081
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
What's around the bend.

1082
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Wow I don't know.

1083
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Let's see.

1084
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Today it's Sesame Place.

1085
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
Okay.

1086
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
It's really nice.

1087
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Only good feelings about it.

1088
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,440
We were about to leave and I decided to go to the bathroom.

1089
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
Okay.

1090
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Walk into the bathroom and I see that there's kind of a bathroom attendant person who seems to be.

1091
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,440
Has a.

1092
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
All right.

1093
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Okay.

1094
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,440
Okay.

1095
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:49,440
Go in the bathroom and the conversation with the appears to be getting.

1096
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,440
And I it's only me in the bathroom and this man.

1097
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Okay.

1098
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
And he.

1099
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Okay.

1100
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,440
And then I'm just going to the bathroom.

1101
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,440
This is happening.

1102
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,440
And then there appears to be.

1103
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
And then I leave.

1104
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,440
And that's the end of the story.

1105
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
Okay.

1106
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,440
Can you edit the master recording like just just edit.

1107
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
You want me to edit this.

1108
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,440
Just edit everything.

1109
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Yeah.

1110
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
You want me to edit that live out.

1111
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,440
You want to you want this to be scrubbed from your brain.

1112
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,440
Yes.

1113
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
I think.

1114
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,440
Yeah.

1115
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,440
I want the eternal.

1116
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
Yeah.

1117
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,440
Now you've heard the story.

1118
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,440
I don't think it's representative of Sesame Place.

1119
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,440
I also imagine I'm not there every day.

1120
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,440
I'm very sympathetic actually.

1121
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,440
Sure.

1122
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,440
Yeah.

1123
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Situation and I haven't really told many people it understandably I think.

1124
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,440
But I felt like I had to tell the three of you.

1125
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Right.

1126
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Thank you for telling us that.

1127
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Do you feel scandalized.

1128
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
How are you feeling.

1129
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,440
How do I feel.

1130
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
I feel fine.

1131
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,440
It's an inch.

1132
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
It's an odd story.

1133
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
It's an awkward situation.

1134
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,440
Do you feel like my proposed idea is a good way of handling it.

1135
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,440
I feel like now I'm in show energy and I need to come down from that and then I have to assess.

1136
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Make that determination.

1137
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Is over.

1138
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Yeah.

1139
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,440
I'm a different guy.

1140
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Review the tapes.

1141
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,440
We have to review the tapes.

1142
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,440
The brain trust will meet.

1143
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:35,440
It feels pretty clear to me that the preference from the three of you would have been not tell the story and include it not tell a story and just play over it.

1144
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
Do you would have preferred if I just never told you the story.

1145
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,440
Oh that's a good question.

1146
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,440
I enjoyed the story.

1147
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,440
OK.

1148
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
I like tearing it.

1149
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,440
I almost wish that there was you had more.

1150
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,440
Are you sure that this is not.

1151
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,440
I don't know how to ask this way for editing part of it.

1152
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,440
But is this a situation where.

1153
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
All right.

1154
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,440
This is a story that happened in the bathroom and you thought you understood what was happening in a different stall.

1155
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,440
But remember this also happened to a guy.

1156
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:15,440
Wait no it was it was to Tom Arnold a gambler in a casino in the film Austin Powers International Man of Mystery where he what he thought he was hearing in the other stall is not what was happening at all.

1157
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,440
So maybe I can say that's not the case.

1158
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,440
Some involved with double entendres and misleads.

1159
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,440
I guess you know I'm saying I'm confident but I guess I could be wrong.

1160
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,440
It could have been like some sort of immersive performance.

1161
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Yeah.

1162
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,440
OK.

1163
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,440
OK.

1164
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,440
I mean it says to me.

1165
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,440
Yeah.

1166
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,440
OK.

1167
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,440
Is there a version of this where there's fits and starts of what we play.

1168
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:48,440
And just then it's like a radio dial is changing and if you hear a little zoom like bird.

1169
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Or maybe you know a page on episode is just that disturbing.

1170
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,440
Well that'll be that'll launch our extra tier.

1171
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,440
That's more.

1172
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,440
Which is kind of about like you know shame and horror.

1173
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
That's right.

1174
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,440
Here for me having to listen to Green Day.

1175
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,440
It's where all of the worst shit goes.

1176
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,440
So the gumbo tier.

1177
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
Yeah.

1178
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,440
Come on here.

1179
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
Yeah maybe.

1180
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,440
I don't know.

1181
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,440
Well again this show I'm in show mode right now and I'm going to have to be in like editor mode later.

1182
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,440
So we're going to have to assess there.

1183
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,440
I'm not going to be able to to truly.

1184
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,440
Green Day story.

1185
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,440
Oh great.

1186
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,440
Yeah.

1187
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,440
Go ahead.

1188
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,440
So now this one I'm going to wish I hadn't heard this.

1189
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,440
I want the eternal sunshine.

1190
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
I'm going to cut it.

1191
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,440
I've even heard it.

1192
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Now I'm going to now I'm like completely blanking as I bring it up.

1193
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,440
But anyway when it was my bar mitzvah.

1194
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,440
I we were looking at a band to play at my bar mitzvah.

1195
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,440
And there was a band that was like the cool band to play.

1196
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,440
And they played a Green Day song in like their like video.

1197
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Oh yeah.

1198
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
So higher like the higher right.

1199
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,440
Right.

1200
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,440
And now this is where I was like mad myself because it's like their most iconic early song.

1201
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,440
Baskin Baskin.

1202
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,440
Do you have the time to listen to me.

1203
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,440
Yeah.

1204
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:13,440
And I saw that and we were moving forward and this is like very much I thought you guys would appreciate it as good boys because.

1205
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
Because I'm 13 years old.

1206
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
This is so embarrassing.

1207
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:28,440
But I was thinking it was my bar mitzvah and I was so worried because there's a line in that song that's like I went to a whore who said my life's a bore.

1208
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
Right.

1209
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,440
And I was just imagining they're going to play this at my bar mitzvah in front of my grandparents.

1210
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,440
And also I have been saying I'm like my parents like they don't know what Green Day is.

1211
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,440
They don't know about Basket Case.

1212
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
I am I'm like signing off on this band.

1213
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,440
The police are coming to Steven with this being dredged up today.

1214
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:57,440
I'm signing off on this band and it's going to scandalize my bar mitzvah.

1215
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,440
I was like losing sleep over this.

1216
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,440
So I knocked on my parents bedroom door at which in my memory at 2 a.m.

1217
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,440
Probably like 11 p.m.

1218
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:15,440
And I just said I know I know that you that you're maybe moving forward with this band but like we have an issue.

1219
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
And I lay the whole thing out.

1220
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:26,440
So I don't know if we can get a different band at this point or maybe just a DJ or maybe and they're just like oh you don't want them to play the song.

1221
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,440
OK we'll just tell them not to play the song.

1222
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,440
OK thank you.

1223
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,440
That was not on the table for you that there was an option to just not play that particular song.

1224
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
I don't know why I didn't.

1225
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,440
Yes well because honestly I mean it was the same this bar.

1226
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:52,440
I didn't I'll say maybe I was a stupid kid in the same way that you couldn't go to the real Green Day and say hey you're not playing Basket Case tonight.

1227
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,440
Right.

1228
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,440
I thought that this bar mitzvah man.

1229
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,440
Like they had a rider.

1230
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Would be equally offended and choose to walk and was equally.

1231
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
You would be like.

1232
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,440
The song that got us here.

1233
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Yeah.

1234
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,440
You're like Ed Sullivan telling the Rolling Stones to change the lyrics.

1235
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Right exactly.

1236
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,440
I thought that they would walk.

1237
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,440
I thought that Fancy Pants would say.

1238
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,440
Listen here Susser you became a man today.

1239
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,440
That means we can kick your ass for talking to us like this.

1240
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,440
That's so great.

1241
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:32,440
So you thought that that line is that it's sort of like a movie where then everything like there's like a sudden distortion and everything goes.

1242
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,440
Why it never once stares at the band and then everyone stares at you.

1243
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,440
And then everyone either files out or starts hurling insults or like relatives cry.

1244
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
How could you do this to us.

1245
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,440
Yeah I think truly that is what I thought would happen.

1246
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Like your grandparents are like hanging on every word of the song which is like fast and like if they're singing it like Billy Joe it's like a faux British accent that you can barely understand.

1247
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,440
They're loving it up till that point.

1248
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
Your grandparents love it so much.

1249
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Right and I think I also too was like taking a lot like of course like I had no say really vote on like what the bar mitzvah band was.

1250
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,440
But I felt like the pressure that like my parents have included me in this decision.

1251
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,440
And I'm sitting there like signing off on this.

1252
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:23,440
And I have this information and yeah I had the shame that it would bring to my family and to me.

1253
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,440
It truly was very excommunicated from the religion.

1254
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,440
Yes.

1255
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,440
The only way it could have been better is if you went and consulted with a rabbi.

1256
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
Right.

1257
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,440
I mean that would have been good.

1258
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,440
There is a heavy toll on me.

1259
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,440
Lyrics printed out.

1260
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
Dukie CD.

1261
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,440
Excuse me Rabbi.

1262
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:50,440
I truly yeah I mean this is like Scott I mean like your you know crazy version of it is pretty close to what I imagine.

1263
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:56,440
I truly like would go was like going through the guest list and imagining each one of them.

1264
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,440
Each person's reaction to this scandalized lyric.

1265
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,440
She would be okay with it.

1266
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,440
Right.

1267
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,440
She would hate it.

1268
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,440
He'll be mad at me.

1269
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,440
Right.

1270
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:14,440
And me thinking that Green Day was this super cool underground thing that only me as a 13 year old.

1271
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,440
You know Montgomery County Maryland was the only one who was like hip to.

1272
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,440
What is this song you found.

1273
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Like the number one song on the billboard.

1274
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,440
It's on the radio uncensored I'd imagine.

1275
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
Yeah.

1276
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,440
Maybe it depends on where you were but.

1277
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Like your parents were about to hire Gigi Allen.

1278
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,440
I'm just going to take a shit on stage.

1279
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,440
The departments.

1280
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,440
We have a big problem here.

1281
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,440
I don't know what this man does and I didn't tell you.

1282
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,440
And now the bar mitzvah boys favorite group.

1283
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,440
He endorses every word in this song.

1284
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,440
If we had just watched Sesame Street for just a couple more years.

1285
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,440
Would it have dealt with any sort of developed neuroses like that.

1286
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,440
We just got a few more years of polite nice entertainment.

1287
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,440
Maybe.

1288
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,440
Yeah.

1289
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,440
The many issues of when you're booking a bar mitzvah band.

1290
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,440
Hey it's OK.

1291
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
It's probably not a problem.

1292
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,440
Set lists can change.

1293
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,440
I'm trying to find out if Green Day's been on Sesame Street.

1294
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,440
That's why I'm looking.

1295
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,440
That seems very possible.

1296
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
Sort of a rite of passage.

1297
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,440
I don't think they have.

1298
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,440
They're on the they were on the Simpsons on the grandest stage of all.

1299
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,440
The movie.

1300
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,440
Well that's true.

1301
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,440
Yes.

1302
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,440
The high point of the Simpsons.

1303
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,440
We know the movie.

1304
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,440
Got it.

1305
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
Yes.

1306
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,440
Yeah.

1307
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Let me say a here's a little like let me go back into like founding of this place because I remember I'm like you know I didn't grow up because I'm on the other side of the country and I remember it being even it was clear to me like all right.

1308
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,440
Maybe in my life if I'm lucky I could go to Disney World.

1309
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Right.

1310
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,440
But maybe.

1311
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,440
But I don't think that a trip to Pennsylvania specifically for this is on the table.

1312
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:18,440
I think my parents did kind of say like well that's maybe I don't know see as much as I would have liked like knowing there was a tangible Sesame Street place.

1313
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,440
So I just it was always it always just kind of lived in my imagination.

1314
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:29,440
I sort of I don't know if they ever talked about it on the show or showed a picture of it or what my how I was even aware of it.

1315
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:36,440
But my the vibe that I always got in those early days now it's pretty aligned with like bright happy current Sesame Street.

1316
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:44,440
But like I just remember being very like it's that early 80s brown the dull kind of muted vibe that I'm sort of obsessed with now.

1317
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:58,440
But if you watch any old video of it I don't know if anybody did but like it seemed just like the most kind of gentle still place and that didn't was not even ride centric Jason what you're saying about how it's like the acreage expanded.

1318
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,440
It was like pretty small and modest.

1319
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Yeah.

1320
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:15,440
And like the characters represented there were these animatronics I guess but mainly it seems like you took a like a an escalator into Big Bird's mouth and he's still represented kind of abstractly and it feels very early 80s.

1321
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,440
It's not on brand.

1322
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:22,440
It's like a sort of odd minimalist Big Bird.

1323
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:36,440
I guess I'm just I'm saying all this to say like the vibe that I get of original Sesame Place is like it's not about rides and characters as much as these like like you climb up a vinyl pyramid.

1324
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,440
You know what I mean.

1325
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Do you remember this your memory in your.

1326
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:49,440
Yeah I mean there is some one of the things that I remembered I think I texted Jason it like these like tree sculptures of the characters.

1327
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,440
Oh it's obi area.

1328
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,440
Yeah yeah yeah right.

1329
01:09:51,440 --> 01:10:08,440
It's a big bird which is like cool but also yeah I think that kind of like what you want is it's a street and the characters are all around and all of that kind of stuff and like a dark ride that like feels like you're like going into bird and Ernie's like apartment or something like that.

1330
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,440
It's a madcap chase.

1331
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,440
Yeah.

1332
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
It doesn't really deliver.

1333
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,440
No.

1334
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:31,440
In all of that kind of way but it's still it's kind of nice because you know I don't know if you guys have had if you had similar experiences like when I went to Disney World as a first time I like didn't sleep for two days straight because I was just so like over simulate.

1335
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
Yeah yeah.

1336
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,440
Sesame Place is good because it's just not too much going on.

1337
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:53,440
And it's ever built it up over I ever said my parents notably as I was saying all that did not say there's the greatest place in the world and it is in Langhorn Pennsylvania and you would not just boy someday so it's never been built out you didn't build it up too much.

1338
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
Right.

1339
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:01,440
Yeah I mean I think that it would seem crazy to me to fly from like California to go to Sesame Place.

1340
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:09,440
It's like a good like regional theme park that like yeah you know if you're on the East Coast even like the Midwest.

1341
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:19,440
I could imagine if you're like oh well go to Philadelphia and also like make a day of going to Sesame like that doesn't seem crazy but to get on a plane to go to Sesame Place.

1342
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,440
That seems a little right.

1343
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Right.

1344
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:38,440
It reminds me of when we had Mookie on and we're talking about the New Hampshire theme parks the park story land one of the executives or one of the people who run it describe the park in in the way that the park.

1345
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,440
How many hours to allow for the park.

1346
01:11:41,440 --> 01:12:07,440
Well the park usually outlasts the kids meeting like the kids are going to tap out before you run out of rides and that definitely seems like the vibe of Sesame Place where like yeah you can get to maybe four hours max if you're taking real little little kids who are going to you know run towards the characters as soon as they see them you know and burn out a lot then and then if anything has a line or anything has a way you're going to lose them big time.

1347
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:28,440
Yeah I saw one tip about this park a YouTuber who did like you know 20 tips for Sesame Place said do the don't do the water rides first do the regular rides first do the water rides in the afternoon or later afternoon because everyone else usually does it the other way they go to the water rides when it's bright and sunny in the morning.

1348
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Usually that sometimes the crowd shifts it seems like you did not do water rides.

1349
01:12:33,440 --> 01:13:01,440
We only did well you know we maybe we watched the same video we took that advice but then it was like cold in the afternoon and then we're like well and the lines were never that bad so we did the lazy river and then a lot of the other unfortunately like I think either because of either because of covid and they don't want to like risk of it but I think more likely just being understaffed and under serviced like there's like a fun sprinkler area that they just didn't have open.

1350
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,440
Yeah right.

1351
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:09,440
Which would have been fun and then they had like you know water slides with like you know tubes and stuff which like our daughter is not going to go on that.

1352
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,440
Oh sure.

1353
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,440
So we didn't we just didn't do a ton of the water stuff but the lazy river was fun.

1354
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Sure.

1355
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:30,440
I was starting to say I'll have to say like so just like the vibe that I always got from the place this early it always felt like sort of like like yeah like gentle and about like foam and like you're going through like you know like those those punching bags that you run through or like ropes

1356
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:46,440
courses or those sort of nets that you climb and everything and ball pits and stuff and it always felt very for some reason it felt really Canadian to me like all the footage of it felt like so like sleepy and brown and just nice and you can tell this is not a hyperactive place.

1357
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,440
It's just kind of like and it's just it looks pleasant muted color forest greens and browns.

1358
01:13:51,440 --> 01:14:14,440
So then I was looking up the guy who founded it not founded it but the guy who designed the park initially Eric McMillan is the name and it turns out this guy was a British guy sort of a fastidious John Cleese type apparently who moved to Canada and did installations for cancel culture.

1359
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Don't look at the tweets.

1360
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,440
I don't know why he's doing it.

1361
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:29,440
No like this guy did installations for like Canadian World's Fairs and Expos and the kinds of things that I like that I get such a pleasant like you could smell from those.

1362
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
Yeah.

1363
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
I just always had the vibe right.

1364
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,440
There's a thing up in Toronto called Ontario Place.

1365
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:42,440
There was like a big kids area and it has like a very epicotti dome where they showed IMAX stuff and he designed that and that was such a hit.

1366
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:48,440
I guess this guy is credited with kind of reinventing what kids play areas were.

1367
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,440
He's called the sort of creepy phrase father of soft play.

1368
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,440
He's considered very very creepy.

1369
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,440
If you want to redact that one too we could take out father of soft play.

1370
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:13,440
But anyway just the crazy thing is he likes this like kind of abstract design like and you know just places that are visually stimulating and that seemed like the point of it more is like here's little challenges for kids and weird environments for them to be in.

1371
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:23,440
Among which apparently in the 70s when this guy's building different places he he I what I'm getting at is I think this guy invented the ball pit.

1372
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,440
What?

1373
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,440
The guy who designed the initial plans of Sesame Place initially called a ball crawl.

1374
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
Wow.

1375
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:48,440
But this like did not exist like the guy he was looking at like he said like a like a jar of pickles or something it was tightly packed and he said like what if a kid could dive through something like this and it's not just like it's not being in a pool it's solids but you're in a pool of solids basically.

1376
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,440
But it's definitely pickles.

1377
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,440
Yeah and then they tried to fill up a big thing with pickles and they gave it again.

1378
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
They couldn't replenish.

1379
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,440
I know the pickle thing is right.

1380
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Jason is furiously scribbling down notes now.

1381
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
Pickle pool.

1382
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
How can I make this happen.

1383
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:09,440
My memory of it from as a kid is I don't know if this was here in Disneyland or if it was in Florida.

1384
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,440
You know the honey I shrunk the kids land.

1385
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,440
The play land.

1386
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:19,440
Yeah that was kind of the closest Disney thing the vibe of Sesame Place.

1387
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Those smells all the soft padding everywhere.

1388
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Like interesting things to look at and to crawl around and to play.

1389
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Yeah.

1390
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:42,440
With this ball pit thing then what I realized because I saw a sign that said something like this when I was down in the Sesame Street area in San Diego and it turns out what now is called the Sesame Street Bay of Play was this thing this guy designed called Capri.

1391
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:49,440
Kids much like the oft referenced weird buffet that is closed on Harbor Boulevard.

1392
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:58,440
But that that place where I was this was now Sesame Street place was the site of the first ball pit ever in the world.

1393
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,440
Wow.

1394
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Yeah.

1395
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:08,440
And I was there and I even noted I said in the episode there is a thing that seemed like all it was is like five pieces of foam that some mean brothers were playing with.

1396
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,440
I think what that was at one point in time was the first ball pit ever.

1397
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
So that's all kind of a mind blow to me.

1398
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:19,440
But also that ball pits didn't exist until the 70s.

1399
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,440
And then I guess if you think about it is kind of a psychedelic right thing in a way.

1400
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,440
It's sort of a heady trippy thing to do.

1401
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,440
But like I would never have guessed that ball pits are that recent of an invention.

1402
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:37,440
It makes sense now you're saying but I never even thought about it because like I don't think there's I've seen some 60s footage of it.

1403
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,440
60s footage of kids playing in a bunch of plastic balls.

1404
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,440
No.

1405
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,440
Yeah.

1406
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,440
It just kind of became ubiquitous so fast.

1407
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,440
And the rise of Chuck E Cheese and all.

1408
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,440
And grew and grew.

1409
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:59,440
And something else in this park I noticed that that's come up when we've done smaller parks or regional parks before.

1410
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:08,440
It seems like Dippin Dots has cornered the market like every midsize or smaller or Nate like kind of smaller theme park.

1411
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,440
Non Disney Universal.

1412
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Non Disney Universal.

1413
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:17,440
Autumn and not that universal I think sometimes has Dippin Dots but the smaller parks there's always a Dippin Dots stand.

1414
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:27,440
They they and I remember like at the Jersey Shore like them giving out samples of that when I was a kid and they're like pitching they're explaining it.

1415
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,440
This is hard.

1416
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
These are little ice cream dots.

1417
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,440
It's frozen colder than ice cream.

1418
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,440
It's the ice cream of the future.

1419
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Like you know and that and then and then it was everywhere very quickly.

1420
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,440
Yeah.

1421
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:50,440
Do you think like you know like a serious radio or a serious XM or whatever like they basically the only reason they're around is because they meet deals with like car makers and they like force you to like listen to it.

1422
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,440
Like that's how they've been able to survive.

1423
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,440
You think it's a similar situation where nobody really likes Dippin Dots.

1424
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:05,440
It's just convenience of like the satellite radio is in your car with a bunch of companies and then that's really where they like they're surviving off that just like that money that they're getting every year.

1425
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,440
Probably.

1426
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,440
It's possible.

1427
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,440
Your contract.

1428
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,440
I think they definitely make money on people forgetting they have the service.

1429
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,440
A lot of these build every month services are.

1430
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,440
Can I ask a sincere question?

1431
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:22,440
Were you when we're talking about the balls were you thinking of this is a good connection because these are littler colorful balls?

1432
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,440
No I wish.

1433
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,440
I wish I went I mean maybe subconsciously I was.

1434
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:30,440
Because honestly it was like I was like where does this transition oh they're like littler balls.

1435
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:37,440
I just remember as a kid going to amusement parks and theme parks and the ball pits just getting bigger and bigger and more elaborate and more like.

1436
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,440
It's kind of gone the other way now I have like a personal little ball pit for my daughter.

1437
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:47,440
Which is like which when I was a kid I was like people didn't I don't think people really had that.

1438
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,440
No.

1439
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:55,440
Now it's like an easy thing that like most people I know it's not like a huge thing it's just like it folds out and you throw them balls and it's like.

1440
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,440
But how often do you see a big sprawling ball pit.

1441
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,440
Those are kind of out of fashion Disneyland completely stopped doing them.

1442
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Due to poops.

1443
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:10,440
Pooping and dinneries and fights and I mean does anybody not like a ball pit from their childhood.

1444
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,440
I was obsessed with it.

1445
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,440
There was this place this kind of maybe it's kind of like Discovery Zone did you guys have that.

1446
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,440
Oh sure yeah.

1447
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,440
We in high school.

1448
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,440
This is nuts that this was allowed.

1449
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,440
They would allow I guess at night you could just rent it out.

1450
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
Yes.

1451
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,440
As like older kids.

1452
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,440
Yes.

1453
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,440
And my this is dorky.

1454
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,440
But my male Jewish youth group.

1455
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:53,440
Rented it out and this is and my it had been I guess what we would do in the Discovery Zone was just have like fake wrestling matches.

1456
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,440
Of course yeah.

1457
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
Because it's like foam and bubbles.

1458
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,440
Yeah.

1459
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:06,440
And two of my this is one of the best things I ever witnessed in high school was two of my friends like they had been building up that they were going to wrestle each other.

1460
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,440
And like they're going to have this big thing like the Discovery Zone like event.

1461
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:24,440
It was my friend Jonah and my friend Ben and Jonah shows up first and he's like he has like he bought like a novelty belt that he was like the champion.

1462
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:31,440
And then and he was like all like it's on like music or something.

1463
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,440
He's really ready.

1464
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:37,440
Ben shows up and he has crutches and he's like I'm sorry.

1465
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,440
I like twisted my ankle.

1466
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,440
I can't do it.

1467
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,440
Like I'm just here to hang.

1468
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:44,440
And everyone's kind of bummed but I was like oh it happens.

1469
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,440
The whole night goes by and we have fun.

1470
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,440
We like goof around whatever.

1471
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,440
Everybody's leaving.

1472
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:58,440
And he takes the crutches and knocks Jonah into the ball pit and just jumps on him.

1473
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:07,440
It was the best thing I think I had ever witnessed.

1474
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,440
I was delighted by it.

1475
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,440
Yeah it's great.

1476
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,440
There's no yeah no that's incredible.

1477
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,440
The whole night of playing apart.

1478
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:19,440
Yes it's insane that they just were like yeah like this is like a kid's play zone in the morning.

1479
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:27,440
But yeah if you like you know this group of like 17 year old Jewish boys want to beat each other up for sure.

1480
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,440
Go nuts.

1481
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,440
Just wail on you in front of a big stick.

1482
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,440
Do an angle.

1483
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,440
They want to do an angle later.

1484
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,440
A trick.

1485
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,440
Oh god that's great.

1486
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,440
Backing up to Dippin Dots.

1487
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:47,440
I tweeted about this so maybe you get some but I not at Sesame Place at the zoo there was a Dippin Dots stand where I got Dippin Dots for my daughter because it was just like oh this is something fun I guess.

1488
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,440
I don't know.

1489
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,440
She didn't seem to care for it too much.

1490
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,440
But then the woman in front of me in line.

1491
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,440
The funniest special request I've ever heard in my life was do you have any of the ice cream without the dots?

1492
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:10,440
Completely perplexing to the to the people there.

1493
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,440
This is the whole thing.

1494
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:18,440
Well Ma'am if you leave them in the sun for like 20 seconds you're going to have regular ice cream.

1495
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,440
She just thought there were dots on regular ice cream I assume.

1496
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,440
Yes I think that's what she thought.

1497
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,440
She thought that it was like the topping.

1498
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,440
Right the dots were the topping.

1499
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:32,440
I guess Dippin Dots without dots you could call impossible dots.

1500
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:38,440
Oh you guys got impossible dots?

1501
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
Let's start winding it down here I suppose.

1502
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,440
Do we miss anything from your childhoods?

1503
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,440
Any odd factoids?

1504
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,440
Any ways to make this place better or are there plus ups?

1505
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:53,440
Clearly Dark Rides and stuff would be great.

1506
01:23:53,440 --> 01:24:02,440
It really deserves a fully like thought out and I don't mean it in a scary dark twisted way but a Horror Nights style maze.

1507
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:09,440
That's really what it like a fully immersive you start out on the street and then you go in and there's rooms with the characters.

1508
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
You have interactions with all of them.

1509
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,440
There are things you've seen on the show.

1510
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,440
I don't know what like locations they have on the show anymore because I would say oh it's like with Grover and the waiter and stuff.

1511
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,440
But that's obviously kids that they don't maybe one for the parents at the end like that.

1512
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,440
But like you go through and there'd be different experiences like that.

1513
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,440
The thing would be like 45 minutes.

1514
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:38,440
I feel like you could double the amount of money you charge maybe and like that probably the kid would come away and saying like was your brother that once said this is the greatest day of my life?

1515
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,440
Yeah.

1516
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,440
Something interesting that I forgot to mention no televisions in the park.

1517
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,440
There's no actual Sesame Street.

1518
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Interesting.

1519
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:53,440
And there's not they're just like lazily showing episodes or movies somewhere.

1520
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,440
That's kind of nice.

1521
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:02,440
The one big thing we didn't mention the Sesame Place the first theme park in the world designated as a certified autism center.

1522
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
Yeah.

1523
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:10,440
So all the employees receive training on sensory awareness and social skills.

1524
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,440
They're quiet rooms.

1525
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:22,440
There's sensory guides that guests can get noise canceling headphones for auditory auditory sensitivity.

1526
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,440
And I just think that's nice.

1527
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,440
I just think that's a great thing that they went out of the way and did.

1528
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:28,440
Yeah.

1529
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,440
That's really cool.

1530
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,440
That's a cool move to make and to realize that you could do.

1531
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,440
And that's going to be true of the other one I believe.

1532
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,440
Yeah I think so.

1533
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,440
Funny thing about the other one.

1534
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,440
So Sesame Place is opening in San Diego.

1535
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,440
It's taking over the Aquatica water park.

1536
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,440
Yeah.

1537
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,440
Which itself took over a not soaked city.

1538
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:55,440
So this is multiple generations of water parks.

1539
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:04,440
We I think Jane brought it up but I looked it up and she said oh is Aquatica next to SeaWorld and I was like oh no it's about 23 miles away.

1540
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,440
Because they just took over an existing theme park.

1541
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,440
It's very it's much it's like way more south like much closer to the Mexico border.

1542
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,440
Yeah.

1543
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:19,440
So but one of the posts I saw about it so it was supposed to open 2021.

1544
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Obviously construction delays kind of happened everywhere.

1545
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:33,440
Because in the contract it said this park will open in 2021 because it has not on paper.

1546
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:40,440
SeaWorld may technically oh Sesame Workshop something like two thousand dollars a day.

1547
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,440
Until it opens.

1548
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Until it opens.

1549
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:51,440
The person commenting on this from SeaWorld was like we're hoping to work something out because two thousand dollars times 365.

1550
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,440
Yeah that starts to really add up.

1551
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,440
Wow.

1552
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,440
Two thousand.

1553
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,440
Four thousand.

1554
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,440
Wow.

1555
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:11,440
Well that's what happens when the other side has Grover and Count doing the contract.

1556
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,440
They picked the right people.

1557
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,440
They picked the right muppets.

1558
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,440
I don't know what I mean.

1559
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,440
Where do you go over there?

1560
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,440
You know what I think Evan says you survived podcast.

1561
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Thanks so much.

1562
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,440
That was a plus.

1563
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,440
Thanks for having me.

1564
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,440
I'm going to the gift shop.

1565
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,440
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1566
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,440
No.

1567
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,440
Add Evan Susser on Twitter I guess.

1568
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,440
It was recently hacked but I got my Twitter account back.

1569
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,440
Oh yeah you were hacked.

1570
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,440
That was weird.

1571
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,440
You're on Doughboys.

1572
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,440
Yeah I'm on Doughboys.

1573
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,440
You'll be around for something.

1574
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:52,440
If you like this you'll find more stuff from me.

1575
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,440
You'll do it Google.

1576
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,440
Yeah do it Google.

1577
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:00,440
I'm doing some of this game stuff where I'm making them come to me.

1578
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,440
That's good.

1579
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,440
Make them work for it.

1580
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:09,440
Bernada you came directly to us which I appreciate.

1581
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:15,440
I love the podcast and I wanted to be back on and talk about Sesame.

1582
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,440
Play with you and see you guys again.

1583
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:21,440
We did it and we did the full day to night.

1584
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,440
Now it's a nice summer evening.

1585
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,440
I hope nobody's getting too bit.

1586
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,440
Once I put the spray on my legs I'm doing all right.

1587
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,440
Evan Susser and I actually just ate at the Jurassic Cafe not long ago.

1588
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
So maybe we can come back and talk about that.

1589
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,440
We did eat at the Jurassic Cafe.

1590
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,440
Wait you just came from?

1591
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,440
Not today.

1592
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,440
I was going to meet him up at City Walk and I go you know because we both have passes.

1593
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,440
We could go down and eat in the park.

1594
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,440
So we did.

1595
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,440
We went on no rides.

1596
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,440
You only went to the direct to and is that the name of the main restaurant down there?

1597
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,440
Is it?

1598
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,440
Am I wrong?

1599
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,440
Yeah no that's correct.

1600
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,440
That's right yeah.

1601
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,440
Okay.

1602
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,440
That's it.

1603
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,440
That function is just a dinner.

1604
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,440
I fell sick afterwards.

1605
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,440
You fell sick afterwards.

1606
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,440
I felt like oh this could go wrong but then it settled itself.

1607
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,440
It was fine.

1608
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,440
We ate on the top of the Jurassic Cafe.

1609
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,440
Nice spot obviously.

1610
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,440
I mean that I love.

1611
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,440
Great view.

1612
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
And then yeah then we left.

1613
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,440
Okay.

1614
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,440
Well it seems like we did the episode.

1615
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,440
Did we?

1616
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,440
I say yes.

1617
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:25,440

1621
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,440
I'll post I'll try to post this as a video but there's I think just as a little play

1622
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:48,440
out there's a weird video on YouTube called One Day at Sesame Place that just kind of

1623
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,440
takes you around like all the facades the employees and the kids and what it's like

1624
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,440
when it closes and and they show you a little bit of a show and this is just a really strange

1625
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:03,440
moment where the thing that's happening in the show seems to be that Big Bird is trying

1626
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:10,440
to say the names of everybody who's in attendance and that's a tall order for a tall bird.

1627
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,440
You can't figure out how to do it.

1628
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:19,440
So he but I still don't understand how it jumps to this point where a song starts playing

1629
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:27,440
and just imagine Big Bird pop locking is what's happening here and then he picks up his pursuit.

1630
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,440
I don't this one's hard to explain.

1631
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,440
Just I'll play it for you guys.

1632
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,440
It's a musical way out.

1633
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,440
This is this is really odd.

1634
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,440
So thanks for listening.

1635
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,440
Bye bye.

1636
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:49,440
Audience delighted with pop locking Beverly Hills cop Big Bird.

1637
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,440
I mean I'm delighted.

1638
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,440
I'm wearing pants.

1639
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,440
This is like some piece of abstract video art.

1640
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,440
Axel B.

1641
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,440
Sounds slowed down.

1642
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,440
Yeah.

1643
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,440
It's like a vapor wave.

1644
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,440
Like ET.

1645
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,440
It's ET at the end of the word.

1646
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,440
I stole it from this.

1647
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,440
I love that.
