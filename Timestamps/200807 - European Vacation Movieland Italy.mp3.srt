1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Benvenuto to Podcast the Rides European Vacation hosted by three guys who are

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
excited even to take a fake trip. I'm Scott Gardner. Mike Carlson's here as well.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am here. I'm ready to virtually travel.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Which is the best we can do.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Get a breath of digital fresh air. Jason Sheridan, you excited?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano. That's what I say, at least for today's episode.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I guess I'll have to figure out some other country specific thing as we go along.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, that's what I figured. We'll all learn some fun greetings. We'll let you know where we're going right at the top of all of them.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because, gang, we're spending the whole month of August in virtual Europe. This is going to be great.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're getting out of here. As we've said, we've been cooped up. The three of us have been cooped up.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You listening at home have been cooped up. And there's lots of things that are off the table for us to do, including going to Europe.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Americans can't really do that. Rightfully so. It's the most correct, I think, painting there could ever be.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
As we're really fucking this thing up. But you know what? They can't put regulations on. It's our imagination.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we're going to take a vacation in our imagination, all of us together. And I couldn't be more excited to do it.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think that you should, yeah, maybe if you're a listener and you're at home, maybe get a cocktail.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe listen to this outside, wear a tank top. You know, all the things you do during the summer months during a vacation.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, I really want everyone to feel this with us. I want it to be a sensory experience.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a virtual reality trip you're taking.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And if today's episode is any indication, start off right off the bat by ignoring any copyright trademark.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just throw any knowledge you have that out the window.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, we're also taking a vacation from copyright laws with today's topic.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Potentially safety regulations, too.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It sure looks like it. It sure looks like it. Videos and photos.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We'll get into where we're going today and where we're kicking it off.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I want to say a couple things just right off the top about what this month is going to consist of.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And you know, because another thing we're taking a little vacation from is our usual areas on the show.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I'll tell you this in this month of August, no Disney, no Universal, no Six Flags.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We're not doing any of the usual shit.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And we I think we couldn't be starting more off brandy than than where we're starting today.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, I mean, I look it's a it's a fake Universal Studios.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll just say it. That's what we're doing today.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But we're so we're going to get a little of the flavor, but the flavor is off.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's slightly it tastes weird, but it's not bad.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It just tastes a little weird. It's exactly like a type of food that doesn't really translate in another plate.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Like if you guys have had the experience of having Mexican food in a place that is where Mexican food is not native, that's how this that's how this perk feels.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It feels like they technically followed the recipe of Universal Studios, but just I don't know.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not in their DNA. They just it wasn't in them to get it right.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It feels like somebody went maybe to Universal like five, ten years ago and they're like, we need you to design a park.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And they're like, yeah, I think I remember there's dinosaurs.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's like that arch thing. OK, yeah, yeah.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let me sketch something out here for you and I'll have it to you tomorrow.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Which is weird. Weird is I think that's what I want out of this series.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And we're certainly getting it today. I'm a little I'm a little worried.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sure it'll all work out. I'm a little worried that this is episode is kind of like if you introduce the concept of Chekhov's gun and you're like, hey, check off.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Check out Chekhov's gun. Bang, bang, bang, bang.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like you just are immediately show the gun and just immediately start firing it in the air.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is so weird.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You might be right, but I also would say, you know, this whole series that we're doing this month, the things we're talking about later,

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it's going to get weirder. I think it's going to be weirder.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's other things coming out that some you might be familiar with.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You might not be that are super weird.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Every one of them that we that we've talked about, because we kind of know our itinerary, some of them charmingly.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So it's I don't know, but I think that's this has always been my assumption about European theme parks is that they are weird.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't like and you none of them are that famous in a way like like we're pretty big theme park heads.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We haven't found ourselves really ever talking about European parks to much of an extent before.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if this is maybe just our American bias or the fact that there's such prominent American parks that they've set the standard.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And now we look at these and we go, it's so weird.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And it's just because we're used to something.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I would be interested to hear from people who live in Europe.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you think these parks are weird as as we do?

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Or do you think our parks are weird?

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Maybe you think we're about to talk about today is perfectly normal.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And you've been to Universal Florida and you go, well, this isn't anything like the place we're about to talk about.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, which I am hiding. I don't know why I'm hiding.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, I know. Yeah, we could say I think maybe I'm just wanting to talk through anything else about the theme parks.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Anything else about the Europe thing in general, which one thing that we might want to say at the top is that after some discussion and some some reflection and looking inward, we have decided we're not going to do Efteling.

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Might be good to get that out of the way.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Right. Because unlike let's just say I think every place that we're talking about this month, none of us have personally been to.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're breaking Doug Jones rule that watching videos isn't the same as going there.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I know that. But hey, look, we're not getting to Europe anytime soon.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So we're doing we can't.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I mean, I've scoured a lot of websites.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But anyway, Efteling felt like somebody's got to go.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
One of the three of us has to go for us to do it justice.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, that's yes. That's such a big heavy hitter.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And probably it definitely has a lot of substance, but maybe not enough madness that I think we're all right in the.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like I had so much fun reading about this park.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have to say that I think if it had a little more substance, I would have less fun.

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll go out and say we're not doing to like to Voli Gardens either.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The one that Walt Disney like walked in and inspired him.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have we made him. Scott, to your credit.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I mean, we talked about a bunch, but Scott, you made a massive list.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So, yeah, yeah. Well, with with some listener help because we threw it out there.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If we were going to go to Europe, where would you want us to go?

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A lot of you said Efteling and we're ignoring you. I'm sorry.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But again, you can see also there was so many specifically campaigning and saying you should not go to Efteling.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because you need to experience it for yourself.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And we bought that argument and we were kind of feeling that anyway.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But yeah, we considered a lot.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I actually think what you'll find there, I think there's some parks that seem like fine and good and solid.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But, you know, if you listen to this podcast for a while, you know, maybe that's not the best meat on the boat.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We need the most shitty, bizarre, miscolored meat to be on a bone that's falling apart.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's what we want to eat.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, I guess I agree. Jason, sorry.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's a good turn of phrase because there is some shitty, discolored meat coming later in this episode.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Dear God, the food.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, you want to just let's just throw it out.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's let's start talking about it.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But although you know, another what's tough about saying where we're going today is like, what is it called?

103
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Really? There's like four names.

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, there's a lot of names.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you think it's called?

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right. We're all going to say it at the same time what we think it is and see if we're all on the same page.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
OK. OK. One, two, three.

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Movieland. Hollywood par.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Movieland.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Kanavel world.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Kanavel world.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OK. OK. Kanaver.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think Kanavel world is the whole property, right?

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes. Right.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And we are all the only thing on it.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They put Italy in the name.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I kind of say that on the website I'm looking at.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OK. I've seen it elsewhere with Italy is in the specific spot.

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And they have a water park.

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And the movieland, the Hollywood park is what what we're focusing on.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And what you do now, what you just called it.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But what I decided to say out loud was movieland studios.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes, I've seen movieland studios somewhere, too.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I've also seen movieland park.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then I saw a video where there is a stormtrooper.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
People are taking footage with a stormtrooper.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And on his stormtrooper uniform, it says movie studios in the same font that we've come to know from this park.

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So that's the most off.

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And in general, you know, not to blow our load on this yet, but a stormtrooper character, there is no way they have permission to use.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Absolutely not.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They can't.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There is so left and right.

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There's unlicensed music, I'm pretty sure.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like on rides, there's full rides that are very much based on properties.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's no way they have because the properties are owned by the biggest entities that we're ignoring for this month.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That is universal.

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, I just to give an example of what we're talking about, there is a ride here that is like sort of like a big humvee sort of like Jeep ride.

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you imagine the vehicles used on the Kilimanjaro safaris in Animal Kingdom, and I watched some vloggers who toured this park.

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And when they were on that ride, that ride was clearly playing the song The Call to Adventure, which is the entry music for islands of adventure.

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, well, not even taking music from movies, but from theme parks from theme parks.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Right.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, yeah, just to give you an idea, if you're not looking at the Internet, the park looks like it has a very familiar like arch, I guess you'd call it, that looks exactly like the entrance to Universal Studios.

143
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And yet more plastery and like the shape is weird.

144
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's like the difference between, you know, they go into it in the Imagineering documentary, how like that Golden Gate Bridge in California Adventure was just not it was just two plastic fake Lego.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And there just wasn't the mat like that's that's how kind of everything in this place.

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, yeah, this is like this is it truly like feels like you're having one of those like dreams slash nightmares of like you're in universal, but it's not right.

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It doesn't feel correct.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Something's wrong and everything feels like fake and you're not really there.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's like, yeah, it's it's strange.

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right on. Yeah.

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This if I could recommend a video, I mean, you know, I think Mike, as you're saying, if you go to the website, you'll get a vibe.

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's one that that really helped me a good summation statement.

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think if you if you look up a video on YouTube, Movieland Park 2018, it's from the user Parksmania.it.

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you just want a little like fly through, that helps a lot, including just one thing that illuminated for me was that how much the entrance like you said, it's the big universal gate.

155
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And not only that, but it's very much the universal Florida main drag like they didn't go.

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, other weird foreign theme parks like in China have ripped off Main Street.

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But this is like that that drag that ends in the in the New York facade and there's little businesses on the side.

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And instead of the Today Show Cafe or whatever, I really like this that there's an ice cream shop in a familiar font and it says ice stone creamery.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have that too. Which what is what does that mean?

160
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What's an ice stone ice cube, an ice cube that they cut ice cubes and put them in cones for you.

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Did you did you look is there a video of it inside the ice stone creamery?

162
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I haven't seen a comprehensive review of ice stone creamery.

163
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No, I can I can look for such though.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll look it up because I I wonder if even they have because the cold stone, of course, the big draw,

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
which we all love about cold stone is that big cold slab where they make your ice cream concoction.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I wonder if they even have that in ice stone creamery.

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like, is it just copying the name or do they also have a different type of cold stone ice stone?

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I might guess that they don't even have ice cream there.

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Again, ice stone is like a trick.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's like calling crab crab with a K.

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Maybe they just have like flavored ice.

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going to text you guys another.

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is a sign from a video I watched of a restaurant that you can find here.

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And their advertisement in the window is just a giant poster that says club sandwich.

175
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Cool. One word.

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Run to get no space between club and sandwich club sandwich daily fresh.

177
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, I was watching a video.

178
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was watching I forget which YouTube video I was watching people eating this sandwich and they were over the moon about it.

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They loved it. Really?

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I just because I've been in my apartment for so long.

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was like, that looks good.

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I would love to. Yeah.

183
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A sandwich in a hundred degree heat in the middle of Italy right now.

184
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I watched an hour long video about this park like this couple who are vloggers.

185
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The you can look them up on YouTube.

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A very pleasant couple.

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They said they're from northeast England.

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I watched the same video.

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I thought Tom and Stace.

190
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did you watch Tom and Stace?

191
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, I also watched Tom and Stace. Yes, I saw them.

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I like Tom and Stace and I have to give them credit because so they this park is in a part of Italy called Lake.

193
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Lake Garda Lake Garda Lago di Garda.

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is not this is the second theme park in the big theme park is called Gardaland in Lago di Garda.

195
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, and which seems better.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, they went to both.

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
OK, and I have to they they were pretty good at like as soon as they walked at this park.

198
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They're like, well, this is the Universal Studios gates.

199
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So we didn't really read a lot about this park.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So we're going to be surprised.

201
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And Gardaland definitely looks more polished, but this one definitely looks weirder.

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I mean, we couldn't stay away from this.

204
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, wait. And we haven't talked about why we landed on this.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And in fact, the entire Europe series, which was a discovery from Mike back in the episode stunt show showdown to would you care to remind us?

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What what you found? What brought us here to glorious movie land?

207
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, it was a I was I it was a stunt show in my mind.

208
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was really it was a little show based on the movie Flashdance, which it was a bit unusual in the year whatever.

209
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Twenty I forget which video that maybe twenty sixteen twenty fifteen was what it was from.

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And it was just like one single performer loosely mimicking the dance moves from the movie Flashdance with a small crowd.

211
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And that's where I learned what I learned about movie world or movie studio or movie land studios.

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The Hollywood the Hollywood Park.

213
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And we started looking at some of the other rides and immediately we were like, oh, this this feels like that we would like to look at this look at more of these.

214
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah, which now knowing more, I think we totally went the right way because that thing in general is a little encapsulation of what it is.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like also Flashdance.

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, I guess they just must have struck oddly struck a deal with whoever the distributor is.

217
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is it MGM or some I don't know where make made Flashdance.

218
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But OK, so they tried to pull a thing out of it, but I don't think so.

219
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't think they have the rights to anything.

220
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, yeah. I don't think they've ever used.

221
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
At first I was like, oh, interesting. They licensed all this stuff.

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then I was like, wait a minute, there's a ride based on a TV show that they don't use the name of the TV show.

223
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They use the name of the vehicle on the TV show.

224
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes. Yeah.

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Although even that hat like it does have.

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Did you watch any video of that ride?

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I sure did.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I.

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's awesome.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, yes. Yeah. And you know what?

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is why this place got a little bit of press because of this ride.

232
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oddly, I saw an L.A. Times article about it.

233
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's sort of shockingly so because this does look good.

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, what we're talking about is called Kit Super Jet, which is a delight to me.

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm a big Knight Rider fan, a big Hasselhoff fan.

236
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And this is a world where I don't know if they actually convey this in a video or anything.

237
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I can't tell because I don't speak Italian.

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But I think that they may have overlaid the premise that Kit, the alive car voiced by William Daniels in America,

239
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that is, has teleported his presence into a big boat instead,

240
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
which is a funny, you know, being that the Simpsons did Nightboat, which is obviously a Knight Rider parody.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So Nightboat is real here and it's called Kit Super Jet.

242
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And the the rides, it's interesting because it's it's like the kind of thing you would do

243
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
if you travel to a place like with a lake or where you go near waterfalls.

244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You know, this is like a touristy, like, you know, exciting boat ride that you would do and like do a little like hour long class for

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and then get your life vest and then, you know, and then go see some place of beauty.

246
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's more akin to like we're going, you know, mild snorkeling in Hawaii or something.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But instead.

248
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Instead, where the ride takes you is the OK.

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Listeners, you know, the Waterworld stunt show at Universal, we know with a like a lagoon and some sets and some stands.

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And it is basically this boat takes you.

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Imagine you're going into the Waterworld arena and just doing donuts in it.

252
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're not out on the lake on Lake Garda, a legitimately beautiful looking lake that is mere feet away.

253
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're just doing donuts in the arena for a different attraction, which I guess they just have to not operate at the same time.

254
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's like it's like your buddy stole a boat and he somehow got it into the Waterworld stunt show.

255
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And you're just going to like just see what you can do in there for a while.

256
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There's not like much of a plan.

257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're just going to he's going to like kind of start to scare the shit out of you.

258
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like, hey, man, you you scared you scared of this.

259
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What we're doing in here. This feels wrong, doesn't it?

260
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And you're like, yeah, it does. Please stop. We're not supposed to be in this stunt show.

261
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then like, well, wait, the see this.

262
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then it's just the same thing you already did over here.

263
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Like, well, then you get like more used to it. You're like, this is stupid, but it's not actually that scary.

264
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We've just been going in a circle.

265
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It is so bizarre. This experience is so bizarre.

266
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You, of course, saw that there is an original video.

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, yes. Yes. Music to my eyes.

268
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There is a there is a pre-ride video that I think come if you think you get a tape of it after the fact, which people posted on YouTube before you go.

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You get a little like, you know, send off greeting from David Hasselhoff himself, which maybe doesn't sound like a big deal because he's like a shady guy who does weird European stuff all the time.

270
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
However, it's a big deal for this park because as far as I can tell, there's no other instance of an actor of any renown appearing in an attraction in movie land world.

271
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, I didn't see it. I didn't see any other version of this.

272
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It took it took a second to find this. I found saw it in one brief glimpse of it in one video, and then I found a slightly better version of it in another.

273
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's wearing a Don't Hassle the Hoff shirt.

274
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes, which I guess rules out him being Michael Knight, his character from Knight Rider, because I guess he is David Hasselhoff, not which again, maybe you're right again that they never licensed Knight Rider because that's NBC Universal.

275
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Right. So they just reached out to Hasselhoff and gave him six hundred dollars and off they went.

276
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, you just like somebody came up to him like outside his house and was like, hey, here's here's six hundred dollars.

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Would you just say these these words into this camera phone?

278
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then he's like, yeah, all right, I'll do it.

279
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Let me just finish wrapping up with the other European film crew that I'm filming with right now.

280
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then let's you know, let me I can only give you 10 minutes because I got five more of these coming later today.

281
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
He is he does. Yes, he does intros across Europe, I assume, for most theme park rides.

282
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's odd. It's the whole thing is odd because it's a boat.

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like, why? Why did this need to be Knight Rider?

284
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Why is this Knight Rider?

285
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, because it's a boat that's doing jumps and stunts and spinning around.

286
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It doesn't appear. I think the video I watch, it doesn't look like there are seat belts in the boat, but you do have to put on a life vest.

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And on top of all that, the arena definitely does, yes, look like the water world arena.

288
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And the show that goes on in there is simultaneously referred to on their website as US Army Stunt Show.

289
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But when you pull up a video preview, the logo is changed and says John Rambo stunt show.

290
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So I'm a little confused.

291
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So they run shows in here in addition to running a ride through it.

292
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So that's like I'm so confused.

293
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's as if the Universal Water World show.

294
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's like, OK, it's water world at three o'clock.

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then we run 20 groups of boats through it and then we do another water world show after.

296
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Maybe I like it now that I'm saying it out loud.

297
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Maybe I actually like this because how cool would it be to ride through water world?

298
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, it would be actually awesome.

299
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm at the atolls. I'm right next to the atolls, baby.

300
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But they have more space water where I've been told the water well backstage doesn't complete a full circle.

301
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Jason, I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit how much space is.

302
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I want to drive a fucking motorboat around the water world set.

303
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't care how small it is.

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
If the water world boat, like if something happens or a piece flies off, it will fly at a six story office building.

305
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Up into a window. Yes.

306
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, into a window room where I interviewed to be a tour guide.

307
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think there was a water world show going on during my interview and it really threw me.

308
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If we could take one of those boats, I mean, I don't know how we would transport it.

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
One of the tiny boats you and I drove drove around in on the Seven Seas Lagoon in Florida.

310
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If you take one of those boats into the water world set, that would fit better.

311
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It would fit better.

312
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, all these places are going to be in dire straits when they open again.

313
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So I want these. I want weird like that on top of admission, you pay, you know, an awkward amount.

314
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You pay $18 to put around in a paddle boat at water.

315
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think they're going to need it. Yes.

316
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
More things to do in each ride like in Transformers, like you can eat like you can eat a meal just like sitting on the side of one of the scenes in Transformers.

317
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And that's an extra upcharge.

318
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And when you're done, when you finish the whole meal, Optimus Prime tells you he's proud of you.

319
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You have you have cleaned your plate. Congratulations, Michael.

320
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I couldn't be prouder of you. I love you.

321
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You finished an entire family style meal. Didn't have to throw out one morsel of it.

322
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You have not wasted any food. You are my son. You are one with the earth.

323
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And Michael, you're right. They should have a smaller family size plate for one.

324
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You were right all along. Your opinions are correct.

325
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, they're running a bad business.

326
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know, since you bring up ideas to the drum up business for parks worldwide when they start to reopen,

327
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I think they should look to movie land, the Hollywood Park and their policy.

328
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
They're posted on a side policy of wait 30 minutes and we give you back the ticket.

329
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So if you wait 30 minutes in line for something, you can come back the next day for free.

330
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Hell, yeah. They have like a like a pizza delivery guarantee. Yes.

331
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Wow. Like 30 minutes or your your next pizza is free.

332
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The only thing is, I did not really see any lines for any of these rides. Maybe a 10 minute line.

333
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
For them to make that guarantee, you know, it's almost impossible to wait longer, like 30, anything close to 30 minutes.

334
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because if they were having lines that were 25 minutes, that's not a guarantee you would want to make because you're just giving away tickets.

335
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So they must be confident that these lines are not longer than five to 10 minutes consistently.

336
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
They're probably also confident that no one would want to come back the next day.

337
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You know, or yes, or you're right. All the lines are extremely long sometimes and no one's ever taken them up on this.

338
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
This has never been something that's been cashed in.

339
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We'll pay you. We'll pay you twenty dollars to come back. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

340
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We're good. We did the boat. We're good.

341
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I have a kind of a broader theory, but you know, with that John Rambo show as a case study, I think, you know, where it became it was started as John Rambo became US Army stunt show.

342
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And there's other examples of things like this that had a theme and now don't have a theme.

343
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And I think maybe that's what's happened to the entire park.

344
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think they opened very boldly with a ton of IP and they have slowly stepped them down.

345
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I don't know because there aren't even any Google results for this.

346
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So it's all off the table and never hit the press.

347
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But what I'm imagining in my head is that they just like, yeah, let's just see what we can get away with.

348
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And then as IP owners started bothering them, they just pulled them one at a time.

349
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And some of that theory came from I thought about busting out a very handy tool, the way back machine where you can see what websites used to look like.

350
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And I found I think this is from this park in 2005 or 2006.

351
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Let me throw it up for you guys to see.

352
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Look at this frame.

353
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
There's a lot here and a lot that I don't think that I had.

354
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I certainly didn't find because none of this has been in the park in the 2010s.

355
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We talked a little bit about this, I think, on the episode with the stunt shows, because I saw a picture that was not this picture, but it had it clearly a Doc Brown in the picture.

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes, there is some and they pushed the Doc Brown presence as far as it would go.

357
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But let's just call out things as we see them.

358
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Doc Brown is in this picture and he's standing next to poison Ivy from Batman and Robin.

359
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Very much Uma Thurman.

360
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
There's no mistaking that version of poison Ivy.

361
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's Uma Thurman from Batman and Robin.

362
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
With a human face and she is several.

363
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:19,000
She is one Doc and several stormtroopers away from a joker with a big plastic face whose chin goes down below his armpits.

364
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So you have a plastic joker mixed with real walk around a poison Ivy.

365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Right. That's not Jack Nicholson joker.

366
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That is like, is that Brian Boland killing joke joker from Jason from the graphic novel?

367
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, let me look a little closer.

368
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's similar to that.

369
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's an artist.

370
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I had like a pencil with like an eraser cap with a joker head.

371
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's what it is. It's like it's a it's a plastic eraser head joker.

372
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's how generic of a joker it is.

373
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It is a very generic joker.

374
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Who is who's next to who's grinding on the joker next to him?

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He's in a big.

376
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Boa.

377
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Cruella De Vil.

378
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Could be. It's very small.

379
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So it's hard to tell, but she might like she looks like an alive version of Madame, the puppet of Wayland Flowers.

380
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh, yeah, like the fancy lady ventriloquist.

381
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Of course, of course.

382
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And then you got a Ghostbuster singular.

383
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But not in a bad, a really bad looking outfit.

384
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, yeah, that's that's weak.

385
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The stormtrooper outfits are like perfect, but this Ghostbuster looks like he's just got like loose paint clothes, like loose birthday party Ghostbuster.

386
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, you got a Burton Batman.

387
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You got a Zorro.

388
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, you got blues brothers, blues brothers.

389
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I sent you guys something in the chat.

390
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm not sure if it went through right, but probably an property that we're all excited to see in this park.

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You know it, you love it.

392
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's the Academy Award winning film, The Artist.

393
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What? Wait, I miss this.

394
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Huh?

395
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Standing in front of the poster, two people like dancing, some text in both Italian and English that reads, My heart burns with passion.

396
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What if pirates captured both of us?

397
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What?

398
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Hang on, I haven't gotten this up yet.

399
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Huh?

400
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What if I can't wrap my head around that phrase at all?

401
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What if pirates captured both of us?

402
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm just trying to remember, is that one of the cards in the movie?

403
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No fact, no human being has watched The Artist since 2012.

404
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah.

405
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It has not once been in a DVD player.

406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's not on any streamers, none of them bought it.

407
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Once those Oscars were done, we were done with this film.

408
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We're out of there.

409
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, conversely, I found in the movie land Facebook group a number of pictures of not just storm troopers, but Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Kylo Ren.

410
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I was like, well, surely this is a Halloween event where people can dress up.

411
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And I realized, oh, it appears these were posted in the official Facebook group by the official Facebook group account.

412
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So, yeah, and then, of course, that other character you want to see in a family amusement park, Uma Thurman's, the bride from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.

413
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hell, yeah.

414
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Two Thurmans.

415
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Two Thurmans.

416
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How many more?

417
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I wonder if there are more Thurmans lurking.

418
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Who else could it be?

419
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The Avenger, you know, the other Avenger, the British Avengers.

420
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Truth About Cats and Dogs, Thurman?

421
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, there isn't.

422
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
OK, at least in a poster form, I saw a wall of posters in this park and right big center was a Gattaca poster.

423
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No way.

424
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's a Thurman.

425
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Whoa, that's a Thurman.

426
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That's a Thurman.

427
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That's a Thurman.

428
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
There's a room that's a closet that's just a TV playing Letterman's Oscar monologue.

429
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
He said Oprah, Uma, Uma, Oprah.

430
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That's a Thurman.

431
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Oh my God, can you imagine if the late shift characters were in this park?

432
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh, man, with that, well, just like paint over that Joker mask they can't use anymore and make it J.

433
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah.

434
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Just paint flesh colors over it instead of white.

435
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Wow.

436
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That would be great.

437
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So, yeah, they're they're they are just spitting in the face of any sort of copyright law.

438
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, and well, you know, the one that I missed also, Mary Poppins and Burt.

439
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And only them, only that.

440
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's no other Disney.

441
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean, maybe a smattering throughout the rest of their history.

442
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But in this photo, I mean, isn't that an odd only them?

443
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You don't go with like Donald Duck or something.

444
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah, I don't.

445
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There's no rhyme or reason why unless they like did a poll or something.

446
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And it's like those characters, Mary Poppins is English.

447
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Maybe there's a European for the British.

448
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The British tourists like that.

449
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

450
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe this is like weird off brand Halloween costumes and they can reasonably say if Disney comes and complains,

451
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
they can say, no, no, no, that is Parasol, Madam and straw hat Phil.

452
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
These are original creations we saved over them.

453
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying that it looks similar.

454
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I do see that.

455
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But this is a totally different you have to hear them talk to they sound different, totally different backstory.

456
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Are you going to say that it is illegal for a woman to carry a parasol?

457
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If so, how many women across this planet will get scorched on a hot bay?

458
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Mm hmm.

459
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Disney, this is unreasonable.

460
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I would love to see their like shady lawyer arguing this with like the Disney lawyers.

461
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

462
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We can't you can't copyright that jacket that our character that suit jacket that Bert wears and Mary Poppins.

463
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I can wear it.

464
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You can assume me.

465
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You can't sue me.

466
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The width on the stripes is much different than the width on this Bert, was it?

467
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the film.

468
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:51,000
If we stay in the Disney area, maybe the funniest ride to talk about is in the photo that I'm looking at.

469
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And that is a ride called Hollywood Tower.

470
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes.

471
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Which I'd stumbled on years before and thought, what is this shady shit?

472
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This is just the most like this.

473
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
This is where like I certainly would not be comfortable getting on this ride.

474
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This seems to at risk of snapping in half.

475
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah.

476
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Look, if we if this were in Six Flags, I would say I don't know if I really want to go on Hollywood Tower.

477
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
If we were in Europe, I think I would have to do it because we're in Europe and it's funny to go on Hollywood Tower.

478
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
A clear ripoff of the Tower of Terror down to stealing the Twilight Zone music and using it on the ride.

479
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Unlicensed Twilight Zone music.

480
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah, unlicensed.

481
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And the letters get, oh, this was an innovation when right before it drops, the letters get like a skew on the big side.

482
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh, yes, they kind of tip.

483
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

484
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I think when like inspectors come to the park or something, they're like there's a switch and they just turn they're like, turn the Twilight Zone music off.

485
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We don't want them to notice or like they hide the Burt and Mary costumes.

486
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Then they're just like, all right, we have somebody coming to make sure we're not stealing copyright.

487
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Just turn Twilight Zone music off and the costumes in the vault.

488
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah.

489
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And they change the names of everything.

490
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, they just I mean, it's it's hard because whether you're in a court or you're a ride safety inspector, you can't really see anything because everyone's just smoking all the time.

491
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then after you're done doing your work of smoking all the time, you take a two hour lunch and then a three hour nap.

492
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And that's kind of the day.

493
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So like even if they wanted to prosecute copyright violations, like just goes a little slower there.

494
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So how do you not move to Italy?

495
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I you know, that's a great question.

496
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's like your dream.

497
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It sounds nice.

498
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You get those three weeks off everywhere in your life.

499
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Those are not even more than that, but they will just do a three week vacation for no reason.

500
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You get three weeks off a month.

501
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I think so.

502
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

503
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think that's Italy wide.

504
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You have worked two hours a day.

505
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, that's a lot of it.

506
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Disney shows up and they're like most likely they're on a vacation.

507
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So right.

508
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They probably some.

509
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So yeah, this thing, this this ride is how do you would you describe it?

510
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It like takes you up in a way that's like just a normal drop ride.

511
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But then it kind of like shoots you out kind of slide like almost like it's like the Superman ride at Six Flags.

512
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes.

513
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Where you where you end up on your back.

514
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah.

515
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

516
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You start sitting upright, but then it's like a bit of curve.

517
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So when you're let out of the attraction, you're lying on your back and have been for a little while.

518
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

519
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And it's the one the vlogger I saw said it was a first generation Intamin drop tower, which is a ride manufacturer we've talked about before.

520
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I feel like Six Flags went on a run where they were putting one of these in every park that you drop and then swing down.

521
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think they've fallen out of fashion.

522
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I I had not I have not done the Superman at Six Flags because and Geo and Anthony Geo and I were going to do it the night of Fright Fest.

523
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But it was closed, we think we weren't sure if it was closed.

524
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't know if we mentioned that.

525
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think we probably touched on it.

526
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
There was just like like almost like a velvet rope in front of the line.

527
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And we were like, it's running.

528
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But maybe it doesn't have people on it.

529
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
No one was outside to tell you like, hey, this ride isn't working.

530
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It'll be back up in an hour.

531
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So we were just like we walked like a little bit into the queue.

532
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And then we were like, we don't see we don't see anybody.

533
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I guess it's closed right now.

534
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And then we walked and did something else.

535
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But I would have tried to tell we couldn't tell.

536
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There was no one to let you know.

537
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And there was no sign that said closed.

538
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
There was just kind of a loose like there was a loose piece of something.

539
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It would they may as well have just like, you know, put up put a cone in front of the ride.

540
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And like that will keep people away.

541
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You might have gotten on it.

542
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And then they told you it was closed.

543
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, we would have gotten like halfway up like halfway up the ride and someone be like, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

544
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Get calm down.

545
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You guys, what are you doing?

546
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I it's so so shady.

547
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And I mean, I don't know if we should go and get some of the people in a row or something.

548
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's what are you doing?

549
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I it's so so shady.

550
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And I mean, I don't know if we also properly did it justice.

551
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This is it is just like it's Twilight Zone themed.

552
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It says Hollywood Tower, but it's like if the Tower of Terror had no tower around it, like there's no there's no building part.

553
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's just scaffolding.

554
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's like the Malibu boomer.

555
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's like if they just went the Malibu boomer is the Tower of Terror.

556
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You sign slap it on your view from when you get up to the letters.

557
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm looking at a still of what you see, and it's just like pistons and loose wires that you could like unplug the ride if you reached out.

558
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You could you could hit a button and the CD playing the Twilight Zone music would eject and you could take the CD out and take it down with you.

559
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That's probably how you have to change it out.

560
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And then you play at the top.

561
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You can you can steal the CD at the top of the ride.

562
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's yours.

563
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I saved myself ninety nine cents on iTunes.

564
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And they get really annoyed, obviously, when you figure it out and you do it, because somebody's got to go back up there and put the new CD in.

565
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You got to burn a new CD.

566
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We can't afford that.

567
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I think we have fifty four cents sitting around.

568
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
All the music at this park is played off of a CD player from 1998.

569
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's just all the personal CD players and everyone who works there.

570
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This part of it.

571
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, you want a job early when the day when it opens up, you have to ride the Hollywood Tower, set your CD player there, plug it in and then hit play like repeat play.

572
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And then the ride goes and then you can have music on the ride.

573
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But if like if like the guy doesn't come in and he doesn't have a CD player, then the ride's not going to have any music.

574
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
No sound. Yeah. And if they're skipping, it might just like click click click click click.

575
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Before the park even opened, that guy had to fly to American parks, buy the CDs they sell in the gift shops at the exit.

577
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it's like, OK, we got music.

578
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
We got the music for movie land, the Hollywood Park.

579
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Now put our own label on it with duct tape movie land originals.

580
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Great. You know, this this ride itself also, Jason, your defense of it was, well, it's made by this company that we know.

581
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And that's correct. But that's because this ride used to be at the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, which has a theme park that I'd love to talk about.

582
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Or I forget if they still do Galaxy land or fantasy land.

583
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It was called one. Now it's the other.

584
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And that's not the only ride where that's the case, because, again, you know, like stepping it down, you know, situation.

585
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They had a Tomb Raider ride that now is called something generic.

586
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And this is the Tomb Raider ride at Kings Island, Ohio.

587
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's the literal one that I went on in like 2005 without knowing what it was.

588
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And it scared the shit out of me. It was like way beyond my ride depths.

589
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:43,000
They just bought that from Ohio, kept to the Tomb Raider theme, but didn't build a building around it again because that was an indoor ride, which is why I didn't know what it was.

590
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So they just took it, flopped it outside.

591
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Eventually somebody complained about Tomb Raider. All right.

592
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So it's, you know, cave lady and there it still sits.

593
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Wow. I am always I would love to see a chart.

594
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:11,000
This is just maybe we do this one day of like I want to see the different rides that have moved because that seems to happen a lot where like they dismantle a roller coaster or something like a drop like this and then they move it somewhere else.

595
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And I would love to see like the chart of what rides have rides moved like three times and move like four.

596
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Like it's interesting.

597
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Let's move them. What's the what's the most military brat?

598
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Right.

599
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's in a new city every year.

600
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, sad. The ride can't make friends with other rides.

601
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, it's a tough life.

602
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So yeah, this is a very strange ride. There's just so much to get to.

603
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Should we do? We could talk about another ripoff.

604
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I mean, there's a lot. There's a lot.

605
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But maybe we could talk a little about Terminator five D. Did we learn about Terminator five D?

606
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yes.

607
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yes, that is that is not there right now.

608
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Not there anymore.

609
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It was for a long time.

610
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:28,000
This is like if you tried to do T2 3D in your backyard, like if if if an enterprising haunted house owner tried to make Terminator two 3D with all the steps with a video at the beginning, it gets interrupted and there's like a lady talking over it.

611
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Kimberly Duncan ask person and but but in the pre show that I found, it's not cyber.

612
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Well, there is cyberdyne exists within this, but they spell it with an I like eating dining cyberdyne.

613
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And then the video that they play isn't of cyberdyne stuff.

614
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's of Arnold Schwarzenegger on the set of T2 3D.

615
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And they show that that's what their pre show is.

616
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And he's dubbed over as was Hasselhoff, by the way, they have the American actors and then just told them they never you never hear their actual voice.

617
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So Arnold might be dubbed with like movie land.

618
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
My favorite park.

619
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I always visit when I'm when I find myself in Italy.

620
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And I in fact, I hate Universal Studios and I only worked for them for the paycheck.

621
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like is the footage like public domain footage so that they can show Arnold legally?

622
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It can't it can't be unless there's weird rules because it's another country.

623
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Right. Is there is that the loophole or have they again, have they never gotten away with this?

624
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And just as soon as anybody asks, they go, never mind.

625
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Just put a tarp over it.

626
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And it was never there.

627
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It feels like they're getting away.

628
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It feels like they've gotten away with a lot.

629
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I was trying to find there's no information for some reason.

630
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Journalists have ignored the movie land studios controversy.

631
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I yeah.

632
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And Arnold keeps showing.

633
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, first off, yeah, Scott, like you said, it's like they try to do T2 in a backyard, but also where it bought a bunch of scrap metal and tried to recreate the back draft set and then had some very janky versions of like the minion mayhem vehicles.

634
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Like there is so much going on in this and also actors.

635
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
There are live actors.

636
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Yes, who drive in on motorcycles very much like T2 3D.

637
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But everyone who's seen it picture T2 3D in your head and picture how far away the motorcycle is.

638
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Now picture that motorcycle driving into your living room.

639
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And that's basically this thing.

640
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Everything is very close.

641
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
The stunt shows are very close to the audience.

642
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Both of the parks in Lake Garda.

643
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It is like a simile of European cities where everything is very close together.

644
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And that's a little unnerving with massive rides.

645
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:05,000
There's a thing like the it was in Paris and Disney where the lights motors action stunt show like a very car oriented show.

646
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But it's it's in like an alley.

647
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Like jammed in a little like alfresco courtyard where cars spin around and get lit on fire.

648
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And there's a clip from the Terminator 2 5D on YouTube.

649
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And there's a scene where I'm looking at the audience and they're getting blasted in the face with fog.

650
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
They're just getting nailed like it feels like it would hurt.

651
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It would feel like you were getting pelted with like hail.

652
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's like it looks so forceful.

653
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's like any you know it's like it's the universal water thing.

654
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But it's like fog and it's aggressive.

655
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I should send this to you unless maybe you saw this.

656
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah. Well, yes.

657
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Sure. The screen.

658
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Please do. Yeah.

659
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It I another weird thing about this is that I think it was open for a while just as Terminator 2 or some other name.

660
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And it was just a miniature version.

661
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And by the way with like up on the video screen there is video of like they made a janky their own version of the T1 million with their own bad CGI.

662
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh yes Mike. Yeah.

663
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Let's see what I got.

664
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
This is from 2010.

665
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh my God.

666
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
No. See that again.

667
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
See that again here.

668
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because zero to 100 full fog penetration in one second.

669
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Jesus.

670
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's like it's like it's like people have fire fire extinguishers.

671
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They're just shooting it in your face from two feet away.

672
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Well they're just collecting the cigarette smoke from the restaurant next door and blasting the other recycling the cigarette.

673
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
They're recycling the cigarette smoke.

674
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I will say one thing I like about that show Arnold the Terminator gets lowered into the molten metal.

675
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
He gets lowered into a vat at the end.

676
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yes. Yes.

677
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That is a cool thing that maybe should have been done in T2 3D.

678
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's cool to see live.

679
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah. Absolutely.

680
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Then for some reason they redid this and made it.

681
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You didn't think there was enough going on Jason.

682
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They just now they gave everybody little laser guns like Buzz Lightyear.

683
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And now there is no live actors but it's just the robots who come up and you just fire lasers at it.

684
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
There's just walls of adults and children all firing lasers at the show.

685
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Is this Android? Is that what it's called now?

686
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well no that's something different.

687
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I think they I think they redid Terminator to be a shooting gallery.

688
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yes it was.

689
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yes it was. It looks like it was first this weird show then they just added guns to the ride.

690
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And that's a different thing than Android which is what you're talking about which is a mix of Terminator and Transformers.

691
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's a 3D like a Minion Mayhem 3D movie.

692
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah.

693
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But then the robot they have outside on the top of the sign of Android looks like Chappie.

694
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Looks like Chappie for the movie Chappie.

695
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
A movie I've never seen but I know the unpleasant fact that the robot gets molested at some point.

696
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh my God what?

697
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yes that happens to Chappie.

698
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Jesus Christ.

699
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's going to make it a dark day when eventually during quarantine you and we all inevitably make it to.

700
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Ah shit we're out of things.

701
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That's Chappie day.

702
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We all have about five movies left.

703
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I did watch maybe the best thing I've watched so far in quarantine is that I watched the movie Unstoppable about a runaway train.

704
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Denzel Washington?

705
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Denzel Washington and Chris Pine.

706
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Chris Pine yeah yeah.

707
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And the supporting cast is like Kevin Corrigan and Rosario Dawson and this other guy who's in a bunch of stuff.

708
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And I had a great that was just so fun.

709
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't know why it was just so chaotic.

710
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The train roars like a monster.

711
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And I don't know everyone just seemed like they were having a it's Tony Scott.

712
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
He's made some fun movies.

713
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So check out folks check out Unstoppable a movie I cannot believe is not represented movie land the Hollywood Park.

714
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Send them an email and see if you could maybe give them an idea for just like rebranding one of their trains Unstoppable.

715
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah.

716
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah.

717
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Ciao Bella.

718
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You all love trains in Europe.

719
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I know this for certain.

720
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Which they could maybe get away with is the is the word generic enough.

721
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I think that's partially how they do this.

722
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Well you can't.

723
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
What are you going to tell me?

724
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I can't say the word Unstoppable.

725
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Right.

726
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Android 3D.

727
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can say Android.

728
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It doesn't matter.

729
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You know no one owns that word.

730
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Mm hmm.

731
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
There's a similar it's similar to that.

732
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah.

733
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
One of the main bullet points when I was researching this place was oh that's weird.

734
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:21,000
There is an attraction based on you five seven one the you know the submarine film with Matthew McConaughey I guess and John Bon Jovi seemingly.

735
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So that's that's odd still less odd than that the Disney Studios Park in Paris has a it's a back out to where you see a little scene from this Christian Bale movie is it rain of fire.

736
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Do you guys know this thing?

737
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh I know.

738
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

739
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah I think you're right.

740
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah I just like the shadiest like what can we get our hands on what like what like you know like barely released Robert De Niro film.

741
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
From 2012 is up for grabs.

742
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Why didn't they go with K-19 the Widowmaker.

743
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That feels like a bigger.

744
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah there's something like straight to video Hunter at October 2 they could.

745
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
There's gotta be.

746
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah there's gotta be.

747
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Sounds right.

748
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But anyway but as I dug into it I'm like this is the one that's most on the line for me where I think it's possible that they made a deal with the filmmakers and studio behind you five seven one and I say that because the font is sort of correct sometimes because not all I saw other ones where it's for sure not the font from a poster I saw in passing 20 years ago.

749
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But I again maybe they're just like you can't own those had a letter and those numbers.

750
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
You guys I can't use the numbers five seven one.

751
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Some submarine is not like the Batmobile there's plenty of different kinds of submarines.

752
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yes no one owns the IP of submarines.

753
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You can't own an ocean.

754
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Get out of here.

755
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Jonathan Moss style director of you five seven one.

756
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We knew his name.

757
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
There was no need to go over that.

758
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We all know it.

759
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:16,000
This ride this is this is this I will say from what I saw seems like better than other experiences and a little bit.

760
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But yet here in Corona virus times and this being Italy which had the virus very hard I'm like maybe this is where the virus started.

761
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
This sucks.

762
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This is like you imagine that like just imagine your couch being like.

763
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Having room for 20 people and then that same couch gets put two feet in front of you and then that's all in a big tube and that tube is like tipped over a bunch of times.

764
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That's that's this ride.

765
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It's the most claustrophobic like there's no there'd be no worse place to be in the current world than inside this ride.

766
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And the and the park is open we should say right now we're recording this a couple of weeks before it comes out.

767
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Park is open.

768
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Is this ride open.

769
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
This feels like the worst ride to have open right now.

770
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think it can't be unless they're only letting in one person at a time.

771
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah.

772
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Now according to the movie land whatever the hell it's called movieland website they say unforgettable emotions in total safety.

773
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And that's their sort of brand they're going with right now.

774
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So I would hope they don't open this thing.

775
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Unforgettable emotions in total safety.

776
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah I mean I I tried not to spend all day yesterday just screen grabbing the whole website and going like wow these translations are weird.

777
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
But there's just so much the Garthaland website hired a translator much cleaner.

778
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
This website was just so excited to tell us about these rides.

779
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They did not do an edit on the descriptions of the ride.

780
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yeah it's the best.

781
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You know I feel bad.

782
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You can't let's sometimes not these places faults that the bizarre translations but man does it result in the craziest sentences you've ever seen.

783
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You know you don't think there's like I do wonder what the Italian equivalent is of the show titled Total Candy Jacket.

784
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Sorry full candy jacket.

785
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Full candy jacket.

786
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Full candy jacket.

787
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It seems like a play on full metal jacket.

788
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I think you're correct.

789
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:32,000
We found this in the when we talked about this the first day when Mike brought that thing to our attention which I watched it there you know it's what they do that Christine Aguilera candy man there's not a lot going on.

790
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
The only thing I thought was odd and I'll screen share here.

791
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I didn't know Drew Tarver was doing Italian theme park theater.

792
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
He's always got a lot of irons in the fire you know.

793
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's an eye demand.

794
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's super funny guy.

795
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah I know.

796
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Yeah he's hustling.

797
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's great.

798
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Or it's an Italian cousin or something.

799
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
A long lost Italian cousin.

800
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah.

801
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If true is that if there's a cousin Drew's been looking for.

802
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Here's a clue.

803
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
There is.

804
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's European like pop culture stuff.

805
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Like there's a ride based on the Italian comic book character Diabolic.

806
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Diabolic.

807
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:24,000
See I always thought it was Diabolic and then I went and found the trailer from the Mario Bava like 60s Diabolic movie and they called them Diabolic.

808
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So interesting.

809
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Hard to tell.

810
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
This is like a very popular Italian comics character.

811
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
He's kind of a thief.

812
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:42,000
He was very clearly the basis for a more recent in the last 20 years X-Men character whose name is escaping me right now.

813
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Mike do you know it's off the top of your head.

814
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Phantom X.

815
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yes Phantom X.

816
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We've talked about Phantom X on the show before.

817
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah and then also walking around the corner of the room and seeing the movie.

818
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
We've talked about Phantom X on the show before.

819
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah and then also walking around is like a walk around Asterix and Obelix for the French Viking comic book characters.

820
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
There's a whole park of them somewhere right there came up in our research.

821
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
They still might be unlicensed.

822
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
They still might be unlicensed.

823
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's hard to say.

824
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I don't know how you would do a very good or a very bad Asterix and Obelix.

825
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The Obelix might be the only one that's official.

826
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That seems like the art.

827
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It seems as licensed as a Six Flags property and the coaster seems fine.

828
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Right.

829
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like if you only were looking at that coaster and that branding you might go OK right on popular European character.

830
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
They did it right.

831
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Just don't look anywhere else in the park.

832
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Right.

833
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I mean I have to say the thing that upset me the most was the off-brand Flintstones.

834
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Like there's some weird Flintstone stuff in this park.

835
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Obelix statues look really sad.

836
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
They look like they need to be put out of their misery.

837
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
There's a kiddie coaster called Bronto Ring that I just call Long Dino because it's very clearly Dino.

838
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But he's like too long.

839
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You sit in his body.

840
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Like I just don't care for it.

841
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You don't care that he's too long.

842
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You don't like it that he's too long.

843
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You want it more accurate.

844
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Yeah.

845
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's just it's just too long.

846
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And it seems like it goes slow enough that the couple recording footage on it were having a normal volume conversation while they're going up and down the little hills.

847
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Talking about Texas.

848
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah.

849
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Getting worked in.

850
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Is it too early to talk about the original characters?

851
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
No.

852
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm not even sure what to who you refer.

853
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh you.

854
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Of course I'm talking about movie and the character who I assume is the official mascot of movie land.

855
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Is he the guy with kind of a rectangle head?

856
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He looks he looks a lot.

857
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
He seems very like an Olympic mascot.

858
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yes.

859
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
He's got like orange boots, orange gloves.

860
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
He's got kind of a singlet on and he has I assume a TV shaped head.

861
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's what it's like mimicking maybe.

862
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And his name is M.O.V.Y.A.N.

863
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Wait you know what?

864
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I take this back.

865
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
His name is actually just movie.

866
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
They did not put a space between the word and and movie.

867
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I thought his name was movie and but his name is not movie and it is just movie M.O.V.Y.

868
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
They needed to put a space after that.

869
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You thought this guy's name because of their typo that it's it's movie and which you've been like trying to wrap your head around for 24 hours.

870
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Would that have made any less sense real or more?

871
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
No it seems totally in the character of this relatedly.

872
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
There's been a video on their YouTube channel for four years for Christmas.

873
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
A video following around our beloved character's Santa Claus.

874
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Guys check the spelling.

875
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Santa Claus?

876
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
He's trying to grow up like Ricky Schroeder.

877
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Sorry it's Santa Claus now.

878
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But movie and though as I will keep.

879
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Movie and is how we have to now refer to him.

880
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It is clearly movie M.O.V.Y.

881
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Here's how here's the two different ways you would read this sentence.

882
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Here's the first one.

883
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Hi this is how I thought.

884
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Hi my name is movie and I am here to help you choose help you to choose the best ticket for you or hi my name is movie and I am here to help you to choose the best ticket for you.

885
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I kind of like the first one better.

886
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Yeah he's movie and we're missing a comma too in the first version.

887
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But I assume there was just missing a comma.

888
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's a it's possibilities what movie and like movies and what are movie and what.

889
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Movie and club sandwich movie and pack of cigarettes.

890
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
When you go out on a date if you're going to see a movie on a date you're going to movie and romance.

891
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
We'll see movie and chill.

892
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Hmm.

893
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Hmm.

894
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Hmm.

895
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
That was uncomfortable.

896
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
The two of you did it so I had to do it.

897
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Hmm.

898
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
The prospect of a romantic evening.

899
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I haven't been single since the Netflix and chill with.

900
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I haven't been single in the age of Netflix whatsoever so I've never.

901
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:44,000
When you were last single you would have to after the movie was done put it in an envelope and put it out at the mailbox for the veil.

902
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
We were Aaron and I got together on flickster.

903
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yes.

904
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Movie and return it in the mail.

905
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So what is movie and tell us what you can surmise about his character.

906
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Well he's mostly here to help you purchase tickets movie and as part of all of like the main like logo on the website.

907
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah.

908
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah.

909
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I think he's in some shows.

910
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I think he's in some of the kids shows.

911
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh yeah.

912
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh really.

913
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I missed them that it seemed like he was he there's like a one of the.

914
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
There's like a walk around version of him.

915
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
If you look under shows I feel like he's in a couple of those there.

916
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,000
There is so much content on this website and on YouTube.

917
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's almost impossible to let's see here.

918
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Sort of headache inducing what with all of the misspellings and the bizarre translations and not being sure what the name of it is.

919
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And again like seems like zero seat belts like there are two attractions.

920
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:01,000
We haven't really the magma two point one and Pantanjeeya and one is the giant Jeep ride I was talking about earlier like Kilimanjaro safaris and then Pantanjeeya.

921
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It seems like that is a car and it seems like that is partially controlled remotely but also one of your guests are kind of driving it at some points like and it just looks like a modified Jeep Wrangler.

922
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The video Jason that we watched of the two bloggers vloggers and I can't think of what their names are.

923
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Help me out here.

924
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
John and Stace.

925
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
John and Stace Stace went on the Tollywood Tower ride and she kept over and over saying that she's like they didn't check to make sure I was in OK.

926
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Like she kept saying over and over again that she felt unsafe as the ride was starting because no one had like done that usual double check to make sure you're strapped in.

927
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah.

928
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah.

929
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Also don't breeze past the fact that that ride is called magma two point one.

930
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Yes.

931
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
What does that mean?

932
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Is it like a Richter scale measurement?

933
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Because if so that's very small.

934
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I'm not worried about a two point one.

935
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
No but is a two point one volcano eruption different than a two point one earthquake?

936
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Well it's kind of like it has a catastrophe canyon kind of scene.

937
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It has an earthquake kind of scene like that's that's what that ride is.

938
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And then the other one is essentially you drive through different manicured areas with dinosaurs that move a little.

939
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So one is clearly like Studio Tour and one is clearly more like Jurassic Park.

940
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's you know just like a trip into the world of the dinosaurs where you you go and it culminates in seeing a T.

941
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Rex who is hovering over a triceratops about to eat it because it's already injured and which you can tell because of its exposed bone.

942
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It's just like a it's like a truly grisly like if you saw that in a person you'd never forget it.

943
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You'd be scarred.

944
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Aren't there intestines also showing?

945
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And the T.

946
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Rex is chewing on like a red flap of paper that never goes away.

947
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It's like hanging out of his mouth.

948
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
There's like entrails loose from this poor dinosaur.

949
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It's what the Verhoeven Disney dinosaur would have been.

950
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They based it on his concept art.

951
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Speaking of safety, maybe that could take us into a ride again another step down.

952
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And this one's recent.

953
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
This is since I started doing the research about this because a couple months ago.

954
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
OK, so I just checked the website today and this ride is called Panorama Tram.

955
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But a month ago or less, it was called Back to the Backstage and which when I found it was that's just written in a regular font.

956
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But several years back from that, it was written clearly in the Back to the Future font.

957
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And you would go on this ride and the Back to the Future music played.

958
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And there's a video with a doc just like a guy in a wig.

959
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And he's got like next to him the little you know where you're going, where you've been like the console of the DeLorean.

960
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But OK, so we know Back to the Future, the ride, that's where you time travel, you know, because it's a time travel movie.

961
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
What do you do in Back to the Backstage?

962
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You ride a very narrow monorail around the backstage of all of the other rides in the park.

963
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And Doc talks about what he thinks the rides might be.

964
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So he's like, you five seven one, huh?

965
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
A submarine looks pretty crazy.

966
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I wonder what it'd be like to be on that.

967
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
What? I missed this.

968
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
What? Why?

969
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Yeah, I I I this is I almost did, too.

970
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I just went down to the wire, finding back the backstage.

971
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:08,000
What? And then you're like, so but then why is he only talking about just like what the rides are?

972
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And you think that's all it is. But then occasionally he'll direct something to Marty, even though there's no representation of Marty anywhere.

973
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
He's talking to us as far as I know.

974
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And then, you know, he'll he'll refer to Biff having caused trouble.

975
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
My favorite is when he said when Doc says the line, I am the great doc.

976
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I am the great doc.

977
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Well, and this is also like it's just a slightly elevated monorail that like a lot of Six Flags and like Gardaland had one.

978
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It has one of these Hershey Park has one of these.

979
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Unlike those, this one collapsed a little.

980
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Just a baby little collapse last year.

981
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's just there's been injuries.

982
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't think anyone died.

983
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, the whole thing just fell.

984
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It toppled over.

985
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah, it's just a little baby collapse.

986
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
It's like onto a lawn.

987
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
This video you can watch if it's all like this.

988
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
There's a little you know, it's a stretch of grass.

989
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
If you were going to if your ride was going to fall anywhere is the safest place for it to happen.

990
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So somewhere in fixing that up, they also bailed on the great doc.

991
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And then, you know, like they're playing the music when you come back around and the rides over, you see a DeLorean, something we were just talking about in an episode.

992
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
How do you just get a DeLorean and then put a bunch of wires on it and like great and people buy it.

993
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There's people taking pictures in front of this thing.

994
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This is not from the movie.

995
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:43,000
This DeLorean has no significant this metal and these wires added have nothing to do with Back to the Future.

996
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
OK, here's another theory I have that I'm formulating right now because there's a show.

997
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I don't know. You're familiar with the show they do called Choice of a New Generation.

998
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah.

999
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Choice of a New Generation features Marty McFly and the DeLorean pretty heavily.

1000
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
OK, yeah.

1001
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Maybe the properties are almost kind of like a shell game where if you keep moving things around legally, you can kind of skirt around.

1002
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,000
So like maybe they catch the universal catches wind that they're using the great doc on a ride and they say, well, let's let's sue them.

1003
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Let's get rid of it.

1004
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And as soon as that they catch wind that they're going to get sued, let's move it to Choice of New Generation.

1005
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Choice of a New Generation.

1006
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Maybe there's there's something to that where if you just keep kind of shuffling things around, you can legally kind of skirt these issues.

1007
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So like for a while, that outdoor show was Doc Brown, US Army stunt show.

1008
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah.

1009
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
They they claim that all the soldiers you're seeing firing rifles were all the invention of Doc Brown.

1010
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Right. He armed all those soldiers.

1011
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Isn't that far off from like original Doc, who is like, you know, working with terrorist groups and stealing.

1012
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Oh yeah, he was corrupt.

1013
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Just having just rewatched the movie.

1015
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I mean, I'm sure there's been plenty of observation on this point, but yeah, boy, just like stealing plutonium from terrorists.

1016
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That is so funny to put that in a movie.

1017
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That is a crazy choice.

1018
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And then the mean, concerned principal who thinks that he should focus on school and not hang out with a.

1019
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Yeah, old man.

1020
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Staling.

1021
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah.

1022
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
A disgraced inventor.

1023
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,000
There's the stories and there is a script that like Doc and Marty sat around smoking weed a lot more and selling bootleg VHS tapes.

1024
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
That got smoothed out a little.

1025
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, they had a band together.

1026
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That's why they met.

1027
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But like, yeah, you got to.

1028
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
They're called penny stocks, man.

1029
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We could be rich.

1030
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Like you could like though, once Universal threatens to sue over choice of a new generation live show, then Doc and Marty will move to like Android.

1031
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It'll be like Doc's Android Marty Marty's Android.

1032
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Or yet now.

1033
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yeah, Marty is enlisted with the full candy jacket.

1034
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Right.

1035
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yes.

1036
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah, it's just it's just shuffling things around.

1037
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I want to know in terms of copyright infringement, the horror house, 600 seconds of fear again that that that branding is implying it's a 10 minute long haunted house, which would make it twice as long as like any horror nights house has like the Exorcist and Freddy Krueger and all of these scenes.

1038
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
No cameras allowed in there also.

1039
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
No, I am.

1040
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
But I did.

1041
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I found one.

1042
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Oh, you did.

1043
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I found one walkthrough and it's very dark.

1044
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Of course, it's a haunted house.

1045
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But also this might take 10 minutes because it appears to be a haunted house that is mostly long empty hallways with maybe eight scare actors.

1046
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's scary because it's dark and empty.

1047
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
All portraying IP though, right?

1048
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It seems like, yeah, there might be one or two generic zombies, but like on the signs, it's like leather face and there was a Freddy Krueger walking around.

1049
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
There's the bedroom with Linda Blair's character.

1050
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh my God.

1051
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:36,000
When the inspectors come all the like Doc Brown hides out in that house of horrors.

1052
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
With this leather face mask on.

1053
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Also, they like a lot of time.

1054
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
This is those long hallways are also the offices where they those are the like internal offices of the park.

1055
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So if there's like a meeting at four o'clock, House of Horror has to go on hold for half an hour.

1056
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, and if inspectors come by, of course, they can always reach out for help to the master thief Diabolic to distract them and fool them.

1057
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So the show, I will say just real quick, the choice of a new generation show features Marty McFly and Michael Jackson and the Terminator and Rocky and the Terminator and Rocky.

1058
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So the new generation shows characters from that stars from the 1980s.

1059
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The choice of a pretty old generation of long ago, yeah, Rocky's that older film.

1060
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I don't know. Well, if that's that refers to the choice, not the new generation is choosing that old generation.

1061
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
We can't control their choice.

1062
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
No to new stuff.

1063
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And we know it's a Pepsi park.

1064
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It's a park that serves Pepsi.

1065
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So it is the Pepsi generation.

1066
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
They made their choice, which again, maybe maybe it's not Pepsi.

1067
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Maybe it's or they like stole it.

1068
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Maybe they wait for Pepsi trucks to fly off the road and tip over.

1069
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:21,000
They go spikes on the road and then the Pepsi truck runs over and then like Doc Brown and Mary Poppins run out and steal all the Pepsi from the back of the truck.

1070
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And they bring it into the park.

1071
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Get the Pepsi, get a cigarette, get it.

1072
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:42,000
They send out minion costumes, which secretly have tanks inside like a cat for those is and then somebody's got to like, what do you call it, gas like huffing it like siphoning.

1073
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:49,000
They've got a siphon loose Pepsi into a minion suit before it dries under the pavement.

1074
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
That's the biggest surprise that there's not off brand minions in this.

1075
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
No, no, no, there is.

1076
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
There is.

1077
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
There's like wide minions or five eyes or.

1078
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I don't know if they're bold enough to just do the real things.

1079
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's just them.

1080
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's them just poorly made.

1081
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I. Yes.

1082
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No, no, don't worry.

1083
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
They covered that too.

1084
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Also, like, here's a confusing mashup that there's not just the Knight Rider presence with super jet.

1085
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
There's also a kids ride called Kit Mini Jet.

1086
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And those are little boats that you drive around.

1087
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And so their kit, but also they have eyes on the windshield like the cars.

1088
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Yeah, they look like cars.

1089
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
They look like boats that are the Disney Cars.

1090
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yeah. And I don't think there's a Hasselhoff video for that ride.

1091
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I don't believe so.

1092
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
No, you're right. And you know, a three year old doesn't know Hasselhoff yet.

1093
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Unfortunately, you don't think in Europe they teach kids at an early age who Mr.

1094
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Hasselhoff is?

1095
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
That's true. Maybe in like Germany and Austria.

1096
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And obviously I will teach my son.

1097
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
That'll be one of the first things.

1098
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You know, he's really slacking music videos, dude.

1099
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's so funny.

1100
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You're playing his records for him, right?

1101
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
To to calm him, to calm him.

1102
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh, yeah, I'm already I'm already playing get in my car.

1103
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
What's that?

1104
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
What's that? Do you ever that song?

1105
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Jump in my car.

1106
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I want to take you home.

1107
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Um, is best.

1108
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Um, that's I haven't said my son's name.

1109
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
That's Hasselhoff.

1110
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Maybe I'll make his middle name and in the movie.

1111
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And so often Gardner.

1112
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Um, similarly to there's so there's a little cars kind of ride, but then also a different one.

1113
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,000
In what has to be made or inspired, but that leads you to the disturbing name name Cooters rodeo.

1114
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, God.

1115
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Is that Route 66?

1116
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Get on board real cars and drive on Route 66.

1117
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Maybe.

1118
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But I also saw it as Cooters of on this.

1119
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
These are different rides.

1120
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, they are different rides.

1121
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
They are different rides.

1122
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Cooder is made or right.

1123
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The Cooder like Cooder is a knockoff mater.

1124
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I guess I don't know if you see Cooder, though.

1125
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That's an original.

1126
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's a movieland original IP, I assume.

1127
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
One of many.

1128
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They have dozens and dozens.

1129
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Um, here.

1130
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Why don't we close out the park so that we can move on to outside the park because there's a lot.

1131
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So excited for outside.

1132
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, I mean, we could just get to it.

1133
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Is there anything else?

1134
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Hold on.

1135
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Hold on.

1136
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah.

1137
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Fantasmic.

1138
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1139
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
What?

1140
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The one there.

1141
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:40,000
There is a whole child's haunted house that is very Disney inspired because it has like cute little songs and projections.

1142
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I'll be honest.

1143
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I like Fantasmic.

1144
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Maybe it's Fantasmic.

1145
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I don't know how to pronounce it.

1146
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I missed it.

1147
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And he is a little character, a little poorly designed character.

1148
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Let me send this picture to you right now.

1149
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's one of my favorite logos from the park.

1150
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
One of my favorite pictures.

1151
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
He looks like he's in agony.

1152
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Fantasmic looks like he's in pure hell.

1153
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
He's living in hell.

1154
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
There's constantly ghosts haunting him.

1155
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
He's got a child equally as scared behind him with a flashlight.

1156
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And let me just.

1157
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So, yeah.

1158
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So you walk through this little walkthrough attraction and there's like a nice, there's little fun little songs and stuff.

1159
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And it's obviously the budget isn't very high, but, you know, they did what they could.

1160
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And I bet I would like it as a kid.

1161
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Let me show you, send you one picture from the website that I think really sums up the budget on this ride.

1162
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Here we go.

1163
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You're receiving it now.

1164
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It is a picture of a slide.

1165
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Slide slide.

1166
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Just a slide with like a net under it.

1167
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And it's like it looks like somebody put a slide in a warehouse, like a warehouse with like some slightly fun colors in the back.

1168
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
They could put up colored lights and that's it.

1169
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Yeah.

1170
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So.

1171
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And this is what makes Fantasmic, the green ghost, that scared?

1172
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah.

1173
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Fantasmic.

1174
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Now on the website it says Fantasmic, where a fright makes you happy.

1175
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So children discover Fantasmic's house, where even a fright makes you happy.

1176
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
To you parents, if you don't feel like entering, in the meantime, you can enjoy a good coffee.

1177
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
What are you waiting for?

1178
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Exclamation point, not question mark.

1179
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
What are you waiting for as a command?

1180
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Real tiny f**k.

1181
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's real tiny f**k.

1182
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's wise.

1183
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Oh, imagine my delight.

1184
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I mean, I'll read one when we get outside, but there's so many of them like this one.

1185
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't know much about the show Medusa, but in a Greek archaeological site among ancient mysteries, twists and special effects,

1186
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
you will become the protagonists of an incredible discovery.

1187
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Protagonists of a discovery.

1188
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
The human and divine have never been so close.

1189
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
What will be the consequences?

1190
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And then my favorite is a show.

1191
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Again, is that typo?

1192
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
The show is called Pre-X Story Factor.

1193
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:15,000
And the description of it is a musical game where there are two groups of little singers.

1194
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Are you ready to win a talent show battle?

1195
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So strange.

1196
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Mike, I sent you guys yesterday the picture, the Route 66, the little kid driving ride.

1197
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
There's just a sign in the background behind this smiling child that just says Doctor Movie.

1198
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And I can't even begin to fathom what Doctor Movie is about, but I love it.

1199
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I love that.

1200
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Is it a soda?

1201
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Yeah, it kind of does kind of look like the Dr. Pepper logo.

1202
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So why does this kid have a pacifier?

1203
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
He's like eight years old.

1204
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yes, there's an old child with a pacifier and then a smiling, like perfectly coiffed hair child driving.

1205
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I think that pacifier is photoshopped in there because it's like slightly below his lip.

1206
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Something's really wrong with this.

1207
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Maybe Dr. Movie isn't a soda.

1208
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's like a sweet pacifier.

1209
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It's like covered in sugar.

1210
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
This kid's sucking on a Dr. Movie.

1211
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I would like a Dr. Movie right now.

1212
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

1213
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Speaking of great snacks in the park, this is going to require screen share.

1214
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
This is for, and let me credit the website because it's a pretty specific, this guy's blog, pirouettes.org,

1215
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
who had a pretty tough time on a roller coaster called Bronto Jet.

1216
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And I liked the way I liked his write up of that where he concluded it with Bronto Jet.

1217
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You are the fuck boy of the coaster world.

1218
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm sure what that means, but I like it a lot.

1219
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:07,000
But anyway, look at this crazy snack only at maybe it's not only at the movie land.

1220
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Please enjoy a Dakota stick.

1221
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
What are we looking at?

1222
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
What is that?

1223
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:23,000
That looks like a corn dog turned upside down, stuck on top of a very large poached egg.

1224
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Like a cream puff or something?

1225
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Or like just a roll with, you know, seasonings on top, like a slightly like it's a roll with like flakes of thyme.

1226
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Like bagel toppings and then like a little like kind of a sloppy little puff of tin foil.

1227
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Is this?

1228
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's I mean like like of course any of course a corn dog is a little penise anyway.

1229
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But this will put on top of a little like puff.

1230
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
This is I mean this is the most penise snack I've ever seen.

1231
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
This is like the shaft on top of one giant testicle.

1232
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm trying to think if there's anything else that it's more penise than this.

1233
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1234
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You're probably right.

1235
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It's probably the top penise treat of all time.

1236
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I would I guess I guess if I'm thinking about it, you're probably right.

1237
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
It looks like he's peeing.

1238
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It's peeing a stick.

1239
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, it's passing a stick stone.

1240
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It does look like you could teach kids sex ed with this.

1241
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You could explain to everyone where the vas deferens is using a Dakota stick and where the Cowper's gland is using a Dakota stick.

1242
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
This could be a good tool for children, for teens.

1243
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But yeah, the tin foil kind of is like where pubic hair would be.

1244
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah, it's silver pubic hair, the pubic hair of the future.

1245
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The Dakota stick is the first sex ed tool that you can learn and then eat.

1246
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Little treat for barren with it.

1247
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yeah.

1248
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So I can't look at the Dakota stick anymore.

1249
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Also, by the way, I don't know if you saw under that.

1250
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
There you go.

1251
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
This they also way back in the day had an Indiana Jones thing.

1252
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Oh, yeah, I do.

1253
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Indie filming sets in the Indie filming set.

1254
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That meant indie independent.

1255
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
That didn't mean Indiana Jones.

1256
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It's an it's a shooting of an indie film.

1257
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It looks like he shows up in the Medusa show.

1258
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
That's it.

1259
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So they're shuffling again.

1260
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's what I'm saying.

1261
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
It's a shell game.

1262
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's a shell game with IP.

1263
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's you can you can stay out of legal problems if you just shuffle everything around.

1264
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And then the the Overdrive show is the one where it's like 70s cops on those hard streets of San Francisco.

1265
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And they're stopping drug dealers.

1266
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And that's the one where it's like you can reach out and slap the cars like you can reach out and high five the stuntman firing a gun.

1267
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Or I guess give him a kiss, like kiss on both cheeks.

1268
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Like, I don't do the high five in Italy.

1269
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
You could change the air conditioning settings in the car.

1270
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yeah, take the CD out of the player.

1271
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
This is the narrowest park.

1272
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So thin.

1273
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
There's not enough space for any of this.

1274
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Yeah.

1275
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Oh, boy.

1276
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
So have we have we covered everything in the park?

1277
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Because we're folks buckle up because we're with what's coming.

1278
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
We're not even close to done.

1279
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Yeah, no, I've worked up an appetite now that we're out of the park.

1280
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Yeah.

1281
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So where do you where do you go?

1282
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
What do you like the part?

1283
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The park's closed.

1284
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:10,000
There's surely there isn't a district of shopping and fun and dining and shows for me to you know, there there couldn't be because there isn't nearly enough land around here for there to be such a thing.

1285
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Right.

1286
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You know what?

1287
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I think you're incorrect.

1288
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Oh, boy.

1289
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Oh, look at that.

1290
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yes, we can cruise right on to Sunset Boulevard.

1291
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Folks, you're about to hear a little miniature version of some Sunset Boulevard saga.

1292
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It won't require daily episodes because it's not that many things.

1293
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:41,000
But boys, there are a lot to talk about and boys, a lot of it like things in the city walk saga.

1294
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, just a few things we mentioned Rockstar restaurant, Safari pizza.

1295
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
How about that?

1296
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
How do you like the sound of that?

1297
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
How about a medieval times?

1298
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Well, you're acting as if I don't have things to say about all of these things.

1299
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I know.

1300
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I'm just giving I'm letting the whistle.

1301
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And don't forget, Mike, one most pertinent to your interest.

1302
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Of course, I know exactly what you're about to say.

1303
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yes.

1305
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Anyone want to say the name Margarita's cocktail bar?

1306
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
That's right.

1307
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Margarita's cocktail.

1308
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Um, and what's in that logo?

1309
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What?

1310
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Can you guys see the Margarita's logo?

1311
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I can't.

1312
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Well, I don't have.

1313
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Oh, let me pull it up.

1314
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I know what you're talking about, but I just want to make sure we're on the same page here.

1315
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Is there a plane in the logo?

1316
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
There sure is.

1317
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Yes.

1318
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Wow.

1319
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
There's a plane also outside of Margarita's cocktail bar.

1320
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And it is a plane.

1321
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
This is a Margarita restaurant with a seafarin plane outside.

1322
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yes, it is not this plane that is outside of the Margaritaville restaurant in City Walk, Orlando.

1323
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
The Hemisphere dancer, which real quick.

1324
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yes.

1325
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:14,000
In case people out there don't know, was Jimmy Buffett's plane that was shot at by the Jamaican government,

1326
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
which is an incident that he wrote a song about called Jamaica Mistake.

1327
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Jimmy was not on the plane.

1328
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Bono was on the plane.

1329
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But that was just a big misunderstanding.

1330
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It was nothing weird going on.

1331
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Sure.

1332
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Well, it's a pretty different story with this plane because with this plane, Jimmy.

1333
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:42,000
One day, Jimmy Buffett was not on board this plane and the plane was not shot at by the Jamaican government.

1334
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And this incident was not commemorated in a song called Jamaica Mistake Faker.

1335
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
What about whatever the fake Jamaica Mistake?

1336
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yes, sure.

1337
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:06,000
That would also be a good way to frame the song that does not exist about the plane that has no stories about it.

1338
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Jimmy Buffett, I imagine, is very litigious.

1339
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I would have to think with a corporate, the IP.

1340
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,000
This is one of the most egregious things in this whole property.

1341
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Maybe it's just because of my personal connection to the IP I so love.

1342
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
But the logo is exactly the Margaritaville logo.

1343
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Does this upset you? Does this make your face hot?

1344
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Do you buff it wrong this way?

1345
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We talk about corporations. We make fun of them a lot.

1346
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And I feel it's always good to poke fun at them, except for Margaritaville, which is a brand I cherish.

1347
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And this just boils my blood to see a company like this just use, just take...

1348
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Jimmy Buffett created liking palm trees and margaritas. He created that.

1349
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So it sucks that they're just taking what he spent so long building, a brand, and just...

1350
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
People might not even know. They might see it and they might get confused.

1351
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And they're not getting the authentic Margaritaville experience.

1352
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Well, no, but they're getting a themed terrace with a unique style.

1353
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Well, that's true. Now, would I go there? Of course I would go there, but I would be a little upset the whole time.

1354
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
You can't take that vibe and put it in a bottle.

1355
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And you especially can't do it just like next to the parking lot.

1356
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:43,000
All of these places, again, the narrow space that we have here, all of the places we just mentioned are all jammed together,

1357
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
just like right next to where cars pull up, where you do the drop-offs.

1358
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's like there's four entire establishments in a space that's like one seventh the size of City Walk.

1359
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It seems like you could throw your drink and hit a car pretty easily if you were sitting on the terrace here for this restaurant.

1360
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Like that's how close it is to vehicles.

1361
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yeah. With that, I started...

1362
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Because this was another thing. When you started talking about this, Mike, you said...

1363
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Because you probably just quickly looked at the website and you said, like, yeah, I think there's a Medieval Times there.

1364
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And I'm like, oh, interesting. And that put some legitimacy to it in my head.

1365
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And then I started looking at the website and like, no, no way. This is not that Medieval Times.

1366
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
They just chose a similar font. It isn't. And I compared the two logos.

1367
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
There's no mention of an Italy Medieval Times on the website of the Medieval Times that we know.

1368
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It's not it. And then I... And then somewhere they said how many people they conceded at a time.

1369
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And I looked it up and it's a third the size of the Buena Park one.

1370
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So yet again, sorry to be a broken record, but like you could be eating and your food could get speared by the jousting stick or whatever.

1371
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
You got to watch out for your corn on the cob because a knight might take it accidentally.

1372
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:16,000
It is like this. I mean, in all seriousness, this is truly like theft.

1373
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Yes. Like that one's unforgivable.

1374
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
That name is the name of a brand. You can't do this.

1375
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And like the crowns and all the outfits.

1376
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We're getting off to a good... We thought we were just going to have like a nice European trip.

1377
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And then we've immediately uncovered a world of crime and nefariousness.

1378
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
We're having this little like national treasure kind of adventure now.

1379
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
We have to alert the authorities who I feel like might be out.

1380
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Like we're going to end up chased around by knights and androids and the great Doc Brown.

1381
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Or, and I agree with what you're saying, but let me put this out.

1382
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:04,000
We oftentimes talk about taking IP legally, obtaining IP that we like that is not being used.

1383
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Maybe we follow the movie land playbook. Just use them.

1384
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Just start using it.

1385
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Just write a script about Marvel McFay and say, fuck it. Let them come after us.

1386
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Yeah. And maybe they just like, maybe nobody ever catches people.

1387
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I think that's what this thing is. This place is indicating.

1388
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
What's the worst? Do you have to, you know, have a tense conversation with a lawyer and then you blow smoke in their face and they leave?

1389
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The best case scenario is nothing ever happened.

1390
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I would like to announce a new podcast that the three of us will be doing called the official Medieval Times podcast.

1391
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
And to try to stop us.

1392
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah. Interviews with the knights who are definitely not us.

1393
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
We got the real guys.

1394
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Right.

1395
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Right.

1396
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Marvel McFay can be like in it or our logo.

1397
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And if someone comes after us, we just change his name to like Mitchell McRichardson.

1398
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah. Marvel McFay will be in it.

1399
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Batman will be in it. Wolverine will be in it.

1400
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It doesn't. We have official. We're using them now.

1401
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
No way. That's that's Eared Man and Scissor Fingers.

1402
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
We're narrowly avoiding two copyrights with Scissor Fingers.

1403
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I would say that and then we'll shuffle Batman into the regular podcast, the ride feed.

1404
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So we'll skirt by.

1405
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Batman will then be a co-host for a couple episodes.

1406
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah. And then we can trade him to a friends show or something.

1407
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
He'll go hide in action boys for a while.

1408
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And then when the coast is clear, he's back where he started on the official Medieval Times podcast coming soon.

1409
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah. Man, this is just so funny.

1410
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:56,000
This is inspiring. It's time for us to start doing business like the Italian theme parks do, or at least this one.

1411
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I've always wanted to write like an X-Men movie or a Ninja Turtles movie.

1412
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And maybe it's time for me just to officially declare I'm going into production on an X-Men movie right now.

1413
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And I don't care. I don't own it. Doesn't matter.

1414
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I would like to say I'm now officially in pre-production on both an X-Men movie and a Ninja Turtles movie.

1415
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Yeah. Damn. You're really doing it.

1416
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:25,000
People should just pay you money already because you have these properties and not ask any more questions.

1417
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Jason, would you like to announce going into production on like a Dagwood movie or?

1418
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Yeah, it's going to be like a Hope and Crosby kind of like buddy travel adventure movie.

1419
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And it stars Dagwood and Mickey Mouse.

1420
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And they're friends and they're like stuck in Egypt.

1421
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
They're like tour group left without them.

1422
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:54,000
They have to get back to Toontown and who else is in there?

1423
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Like Bugs Bunny, Asterix and Obelisk.

1424
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Wimpy?

1425
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Wimpy, the Michelin Man and whatever.

1426
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
The Nike swoosh. The Nike swoosh is in there.

1427
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Whoa, that's cool.

1428
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah. And he talks. He's super cool.

1429
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
He's really slick.

1430
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And sometimes the whole gang just drives up and watches Neil Young perform his most famous songs for 15 minutes or, you know,

1431
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
and you go to Led Zeppelin.

1432
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's all in the up and up.

1433
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Yeah. And of course, they all ride in the Ecto one.

1434
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Right. Of course. Yeah.

1435
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Wow. This sounds like a hit.

1436
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
This sounds like the spiritual heir to Ready Player One.

1437
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It sounds good.

1438
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I think so. Yeah.

1439
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Well, congratulations on pre-production, Jason.

1440
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Oh, thank you.

1441
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Congratulations on pre-production on you both on your respective projects.

1442
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, I'm doing a joint biopic of the Rolling Stones.

1443
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
It's part Rolling Stones biopic in part a new Dick Tracy.

1444
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
It's a film that is both of these things at one time.

1445
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,000
It's going to be tricky math to do because one's in the 40s and one's, you know, all through the 20th century.

1446
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But, you know, it'll sort of actually they don't marry.

1447
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It's just they just alternate scenes because you get bored with a movie having the same plot.

1448
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
So, you know, every five minutes it changes.

1449
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Yeah. Just quick bites kind of one and the other.

1450
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Well, it's very exciting.

1451
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,000
And I encourage all the listeners to just go into pre-production on any projects you'd like.

1452
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Just start. Get it moving.

1453
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Doesn't matter.

1454
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
This is we've seen the way now at Movie World.

1455
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
We've seen the way things need to happen.

1456
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
This this feels like almost a wrap up point, but I can't not talk about Rockstar Rock and Roll restaurant.

1457
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1458
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And Safari, a little bit of Safari pizza, too.

1459
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I don't know much about Safari pizza. What can you tell me?

1460
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Oh, it's a buffet style of the grossest pizzas I've ever seen.

1461
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
But less gross than the Rockstar food, the Rockstar food.

1462
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I mean, I've eaten some garbage in my time.

1463
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
The Rockstar Rock and Roll restaurant food is the most disgusting food.

1464
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I will say Safari pizza looks fun as hell.

1465
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I love the look of Safari pizza.

1466
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Yeah, it is the wildest place to have dinner.

1467
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
That's what it says.

1468
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It's got some fun like lion and monkey cartoons and it's got, you know, like plastic characters around.

1469
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Honestly, this is one of the best themed things from just the look of it.

1470
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Yeah, it looks great.

1471
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Number one on property.

1472
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I think it's maybe the best thing on property.

1473
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Wow.

1474
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I mean, where else can you get a pizza topped with what appears to be schnitzel and french fries?

1475
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:52,000
God, what is it with the just fried bullshit?

1476
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
That's everything at this place. Yeah.

1477
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Like just weird, like like little fried balls.

1478
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And I wouldn't even venture a guess what's inside.

1479
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Is it cheese? Is it potato? Is it rice? Is it just is it just bread?

1480
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I like I'd be there.

1481
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
They're like little Easter eggs.

1482
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I don't know what's inside these little just breaded nuggets that are everywhere.

1483
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I can I can list some of the pizzas if you want.

1484
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Yes, please.

1485
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah, they're all named after animals.

1486
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I'm trying to find a Zambezi, which I don't know what that is.

1487
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Tomato sauce. One word mozzarella, ham, mushrooms, artichokes, peppers, olives.

1488
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Pretty good.

1489
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I will say the pizza looks like they didn't really blend the toppings.

1490
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:46,000
It just looks like they dumped them all in different corners of the pizza.

1491
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I said that as a text.

1492
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I'm now on God, the Congo River with anchovies on it with really stringy long anchovies.

1493
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Here is what Jason was referring to. It's called the Hakuna Patata.

1494
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Yes.

1495
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Oh, there it is. Oh, tomato sauce, mozzarella, worstal and french fries.

1496
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
The German french fry pizza. What are you talking about?

1497
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
You know, we're still my piece. I could be wrong.

1498
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
That's all I think is that the rock and roll restaurant.

1499
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I'm sorry. Good.

1500
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I know. I was just going to say I again.

1501
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It looks like somebody was carrying a different meal by the pizza and they spilled on the pizza.

1502
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And that's when they got the Hakuna Patata.

1503
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Look at the Lake Victoria.

1504
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It's just pure sauce.

1505
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It says tomato sauce, garlic, and then it's just like there's three little like they look like beetles,

1506
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,000
little garlic beetles having a little meeting in the middle of the pizza.

1507
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
But otherwise, they're just they're in a lake of tomato sauce.

1508
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:03,000
The pizza looks like like you let the you like let your son make a pizza like a pizza while you were making a pizza.

1509
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And like it doesn't come out right.

1510
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,000
But it was pretty good for him. And it doesn't look professionally made.

1511
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I also you know, it's weird is the fact that only some of these pizzas are named after animals and pizzas,

1512
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
by the way, can have ingredients and often do that come from animals,

1513
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:36,000
which makes it so bizarre that you can get a hippo pizza, which comes with tuna fish, crocodile.

1514
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
That why that has a ham.

1515
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But this it's such a like brain collision.

1516
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And then like there's pop up ads every two seconds on this thing.

1517
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I can't look at it.

1518
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I just got a big thing with a giraffe that said, check out the offers.

1519
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I can't. It won't let me pick a pizza.

1520
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:07,000
The tropical pizza and like I said, I'm trying to eat less meat and like I've never seen grosser looking meat than on this tropical pizza.

1521
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Do you see what I'm saying here?

1522
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It looks like ham, ham.

1523
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I know Jason's a big ham fan, so I don't want to offend you.

1524
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
But Jason, it has been a while, though.

1525
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Could I trouble you for a certain catchphrase?

1526
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Oh, hey, I'm in the house.

1527
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Yeah, I can tell.

1528
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I haven't bought a while, but I can assure you my father texted me the other day a picture of recently purchased ham and I went, hey, look, I'm in the house.

1529
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So does he know the phrase now?

1530
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Well, he knows. Yeah, he knows it from us.

1531
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Oh, good. Oh, geez.

1532
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
That's a family thing now.

1533
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah, so recent ham purchase.

1534
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Ham purchase.

1535
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
The elephant.

1536
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Why the exotic toppings on the elephant pizza are tomato sauce and mozzarella.

1537
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It is a cheese pizza.

1538
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
They call their cheese pizza elephant with no reason and nothing to back it up.

1539
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And just a reminder, this park is in Italy, the country of Italy.

1540
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I like forgot that we've been on this trash island for an hour and a half or whatever.

1541
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:25,000
This is what drove me out of my mind when I was trapped in the in that bad mall at Disney Parade.

1542
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Like I was just in the most beautiful places I've ever been in my life.

1543
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Now I'm here, which I think maybe brings us to a question.

1544
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Could you guys see yourself going to this place?

1545
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Oh, I want to go tomorrow.

1546
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I want to see this. Yes. Yes. I want to see this.

1547
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Absolutely. I'm going to go to Gardaland.

1548
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I would go here. I'm sort of there, except I would need to get out of there.

1549
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I couldn't spend a night. Maybe I'd love to go.

1550
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
But yeah, I need to make sure that's I think a recurring thing,

1551
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
because I've asked myself this with all the parks that we're going to go to.

1552
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
And often the answer is yes, except that so many of them seem like, well, you have to take a weird bus for five hours.

1553
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Like that's where like how how worth it is it to me to go laugh at a hippo pizza?

1554
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Well, when I have the grid, the literal greatest pizza on Earth, like an hour away,

1555
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
you'd really have to break down exactly the time it would take to get to the place.

1556
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
If it was some insane thing, perhaps I wouldn't go.

1557
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But if it was an hour away, yeah, you can get a good six hours.

1558
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I mean, I'm now I'm dying.

1559
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I'm kind of dying to go on these rides now and be movie and oh, my God, I would love to.

1560
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I would I would slow dance with movie and at this point, I would be so excited to see movie and.

1561
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And, you know, we all want to try the new formula with great plates.

1562
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:00,000
The way they advertise rock and roll restaurant from on their website, new formula with great plates.

1563
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Let me acquaint you with Rockstar Rock and Roll Restaurant by again going into a little bupities.

1564
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Become the star with our jukebox.

1565
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Choose the soundtrack of the night with the songs that made the history of music a fully themed venue with all the rock and roll vibes.

1566
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And then later on a different thing, become the star of the night.

1567
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Taste our 12 eat parade.

1568
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Huh? Are you saying hit is eat is it's a eat parade.

1569
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:37,000
OK, all prepared with fresh ingredients and all the taste of rock unlimited iced drinks and watch out for sweets.

1570
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Not a warning. You need give Jason.

1571
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Yeah, he doesn't need to watch out. Hey, no, I mean, I love that they're too big, disgusting looking restaurants are like half buffets, the buffets with unlimited refills.

1572
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And don't worry, the Rockstar restaurant is definitely not a hard rock cafe.

1573
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Never mind the giant pillars.

1574
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Never mind the design of the building, which sure does look like that old art, rock cafe at University of Orlando.

1575
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:13,000
They've since demolished is it looks exactly like the fanciest hard rock cafes.

1576
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:21,000
And then you go inside and it says like live all serve all or some nonsense on the back.

1577
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Like in this is the same layout, the same lettering.

1578
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
And then and then, of course, you got the guitar outside, which I'm sure you guys saw.

1579
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:38,000
But just like here with me, just look at the quality of the construction of the Rockstar restaurant guitar.

1580
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
It's just like it's like Christmas lights stapled to a pole.

1581
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And then the way the like the letters fall off of the star.

1582
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
You know what I'm saying?

1583
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Like they're like some of it's on the cardboard star they attach.

1584
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Some of it isn't.

1585
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And this is just one of the ugliest items I've ever seen.

1586
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It's like I cut it out of cardboard.

1587
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Like it's like I feel like in my mind, I was like, I know what a guitar looks like.

1588
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And I cut it out of cardboard and then it's pasted it and like it looks like very cheap.

1589
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Like, yeah, I mean, it looks sucks.

1590
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It looks shitty.

1591
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It looks terrible.

1592
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And this, by the way, is the first thing you see when you pull up to the property.

1593
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And if you're coming in for a exciting day at movie land, the first thing you see is this like Styrofoam guitar.

1594
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Or if you crashed into this with your car, it would like not even it would tip over and not even make a noise.

1595
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
There just would be like a slight little foam puff.

1596
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
It might float away, honestly.

1597
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
The wind might take it into the air like a balloon.

1598
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Yeah, it's so light.

1599
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
So cheap.

1600
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Oh, my God.

1601
01:50:50,000 --> 01:51:01,000
And then the items at this place, which is a it's a it's an it's an all you can eat restaurant as opposed to and you can watch video of this.

1602
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:11,000
People get like choosing from the like, well, I have like a very dry onion ring or a very dry hush puppy or a dry mystery ball.

1603
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:19,000
One that I'm staring at, it's called Dance Supreme Chicken, where I might as well just screen share that you might be looking at.

1604
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I'm looking at it. I'm looking at it.

1605
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Sure. We're all looking at we're all salivating at Dance Supreme Chicken.

1606
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So it's like very thin.

1607
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
You want you want a piece of chicken to be as thin as possible.

1608
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
You want it like just crushed with an iron and then with a fatty.

1609
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1610
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I think it's chicken schnitzel because it's got a lemon wedge on top and I believe.

1611
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
OK, OK. Jason's got that eye for schnitzel.

1612
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I always got that eye for schnitzel.

1613
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It's a little weird looking.

1614
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It's very odd looking, very dry looking.

1615
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And then and then I like this little like Jenga tower of fries.

1616
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Why do they stack them up that way?

1617
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I really didn't do it for the other dishes.

1618
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yeah. Disco burger or Golden Disco cheeseburger.

1619
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
You know what else?

1620
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:18,000
My favorite is just called Kiss Kiss Dog, which I don't know if that's a reference to the band kiss or the term kiss kiss bang bang, which is how Europeans would describe like James Bond movies back in the in the day.

1621
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Hmm.

1622
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Hard to tell.

1623
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
And then it's like some of it.

1624
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I feel like every theme restaurant is this way where like only four of the things have the theme and the theme.

1625
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
In this case, some of them are rock bands.

1626
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,000
So just in descending order of well done, you've got the red hot chili dog.

1627
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Great. Good. Got it.

1628
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Makes sense. Adds up.

1629
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And then right after that, Rolling Stones ribs.

1630
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Sort of OK, maybe.

1631
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,000
And then that brings you to Jackson Sandwich.

1632
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Jackson Sandwich, I think is the best one easily.

1633
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Jackson, which Jackson Jackson, they have to hedge their bets because we don't know what Jackson's we contribute at this point.

1634
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Marlon or like maybe not even maybe it's maybe it's Randy Jackson, the judge, the American Idol judge.

1635
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
That's his name, right? Yeah.

1636
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Joe Jackson. It's it's stepping out.

1637
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It's Joe Jackson. Right.

1638
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
It's. It reminds me of a lot of how one of my favorite bizarre Michael Jackson clips.

1639
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
He's being interviewed by Barbara Walters and he's very upset about the paparazzi term Jacko.

1640
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
And he doesn't want anyone to call him Jacko anymore.

1641
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
And that leads him to say, I'm not Jacko. I'm Jackson.

1642
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I'm Jackson.

1643
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Is it like I just calling Michael Jackson only Jackson is just giving me a seizure.

1644
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:07,000
It doesn't make any sense. No. Was that a change when it was that a chain was event like Michael Jackson and they were like, well, we better be careful and let's take the Michael off.

1645
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But we don't want to lose the name because it sells so well.

1646
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Very upset about these allegations.

1647
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
We has lost the right to have his full name in a sandwich.

1648
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
From now on, it is Jackson Sandwich.

1649
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
People love this very thin lettuce and onion sandwich.

1650
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
What is that? There's eggs on the sandwich.

1651
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It's a shocking. It's been in a panini press.

1652
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
This food across the board looks awful.

1653
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It is really I mean, Rolling Stone ribs, I thought was the worst one.

1654
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But as we've I've been looking at it, the weirdness of the very first one that just says ABBA veggie be and be is in quotations.

1655
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I don't know why that's unnerving me so much, but I don't care for it.

1656
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I think you would have to time a trip.

1657
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
How about this? I'll go to I'll go to what's this place called?

1658
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I forget every time movieland.

1659
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Movieland, the Hollywood Park.

1660
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I think I've said this before.

1661
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I think where my personal kitsch dies is when it comes to food.

1662
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I can view ironically, I can have fun ironically.

1663
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I can't eat ironically.

1664
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I would rather die than eat any.

1665
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:28,000
So I need to if I can bring like a cooler with food from real Italy, I just can't I can't be here during a meal.

1666
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
That's I can't be done.

1667
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Huh. All right. Well, I mean, that's that's fine.

1668
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I would argue, though, this food, even eating it ironically, it's not it doesn't even look interesting.

1669
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
It just looks cheap. Yeah.

1670
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yeah. So I would approve that plan of yours if you're going to bring a cooler with like authentic Italian pasta.

1671
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Yeah. There might even be like somebody in the neighborhood, which, by the way, this is this place is like you walk out of rock star rock and roll restaurant.

1672
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
And within a hundred feet, you're at somebody's house.

1673
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:09,000
So if I could make a deal with whoever that like probably that person could make me a better sandwich than rock star rock and roll restaurant.

1674
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Some old like Italian grandmother was like right there and you make a deal with her and she like feeds you probably probably be like the greatest food I've ever had.

1675
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Right. Yeah.

1676
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
So if you're going to this park, just go knock at her house.

1677
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Say podcast the ride sent you and then hopefully you don't get like shot.

1678
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
She doesn't know what that phrase means.

1679
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
There's only like three guns in all of Italy.

1680
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
You know, that's right.

1681
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I think we're going to get like there's going to be a lot of Italian Italian penetration when this comes out for our podcast.

1682
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Italian penetration.

1683
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I look kiss kiss bang bang.

1684
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
This is now the third or fourth time I've said the word penetration on podcast.

1685
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
The right. Yeah.

1686
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Why do you keep going to that?

1687
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Someone's concerned about body nets going mask off in quarantine.

1688
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
This one.

1689
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Yes.

1690
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
My whole persona is a lie.

1691
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
But face mask on.

1692
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yes.

1693
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Thank you.

1694
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
What if I one eighty?

1695
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
What if I like horny heel turned?

1696
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And it was just a pervert from now on.

1697
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Just some episode you come in hot and like welcome to podcast the ride where horny guys fuck with cocks.

1698
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Whoa.

1699
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Hey, horny heel turn.

1700
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Scott Garner and Jason Chardon have left the meeting.

1701
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
We check back in on the link just out of curiosity.

1702
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Four hours later and Mike's just streaming hardcore porn for no one else.

1703
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Yeah.

1704
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Yes.

1705
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And our listeners, we get like a hundred times more listeners.

1706
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Yeah.

1707
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Podcast way more successful.

1708
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
All right.

1709
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Now, let's that's enough of that.

1710
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Let's get to the bottom of this wayfair business.

1711
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Again, we tell a hundred times more popular.

1712
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Yeah, we're ripping the lid off of the Hollywood pedophile rings.

1713
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Everyone look, they're kidnapping the kids and all we can do is try to distract from it by, you know, watching some hot adult porn.

1714
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Boy, I guess the ride.

1715
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Well, in deference to the new movement that we're all adhering to because we went crazy during quarantine, it's quad cast the right.

1716
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
We replaced the P with a Q.

1717
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Yeah, we're all Q heads.

1718
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Yeah, we're all Q.

1719
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Yeah.

1720
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And it's just the libertine.

1721
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
It's more relaxed vibe from Europe, too.

1722
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Yeah.

1723
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
It was really the European.

1724
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
The European vibe drove us into the arms of more already.

1725
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
We're already getting so much looser just from being around this.

1726
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So I feel like, yeah, we may all three of us will have a cigarette next next episode and yeah, let's just keep free sexually.

1727
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
God, what's next episode?

1728
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
We got these zoom cameras on.

1729
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Let's do it naked.

1730
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Yeah.

1731
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And not just sitting in the chairs.

1732
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
That's that's a cop out.

1733
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Let's stand naked and listeners just know the next time you hear us, we're standing up naked smoking cigarettes.

1734
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
We're recording it at five a.m.

1735
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
That's going to be a whole new podcast.

1736
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
The ride.

1737
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Where the guys would be funny if I came out of this all and I had picked up smoking like long Ellen Ems like weird ones.

1738
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I don't think it's impossible.

1739
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I don't think so.

1740
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Everybody's losing it.

1741
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:55,000
We're the we're going to be the people who went who pretended to go to Europe and came back super pretentious.

1742
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Right.

1743
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Yeah.

1744
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Well, that's what's in progress here so far.

1745
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And I think we're off to a great start.

1746
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I guess I guess I can say you survived.

1747
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I placed one of podcasts, the rides, European vacation.

1748
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
This is great.

1749
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
We're off to a great start.

1750
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We should get our we should get our passport stamped.

1751
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

1752
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Yeah.

1753
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Let's let's get it clunk.

1754
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Hey, look, look at that.

1755
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
It's a fun little design.

1756
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
It says Italy.

1757
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
But then what's that shape there?

1758
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I think well, isn't that it's a Dakota stick.

1759
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Oh, no.

1760
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Oh, no.

1761
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
But what better way to remember?

1762
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I'm comfortable with the.

1763
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Okay.

1764
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I like it.

1765
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Wow.

1766
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Beautiful.

1767
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
A beautiful Dakota.

1768
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I mean, what better way to to emblemize the food of Italy than with the famous treat, the

1769
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Dakota stick.

1770
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Yeah.

1771
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Which which I was Googling as we were recording at the first result I found after typing Google

1772
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Dakota stick food.

1773
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Italy is that guy's blog.

1774
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Oh, really?

1775
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Okay.

1776
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
So there is no other.

1777
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
The Internet doesn't want it.

1778
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
The Internet of Italy does not want to own up to the code stick.

1779
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
The Internet of Italy.

1780
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
They're trying to keep it secret.

1781
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Yeah.

1782
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Understandably.

1783
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Well, hey, that was a blast.

1784
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I think we're off to a fun start, a bizarre start.

1785
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm glad that we're skewing the usual topics and we're going to keep doing it.

1786
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
So here's how this is going to work.

1787
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Next Friday, we'll be back in the main feed, like always, and we'll go elsewhere on this

1788
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
great continent.

1789
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:46,000
But there's going to be over on the second gate on a couple of these Wednesdays.

1790
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,000
We're going to be doing little if you don't want to follow us on the main excursions,

1791
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
we're going to be doing little little day trips.

1792
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Look, look, look, quick side ventures.

1793
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
You see, and we got one of those coming up on Wednesday.

1794
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I don't want to say where we're going with any of these other than saying that we're

1795
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
heading to the sea.

1796
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:09,000
So if you want to join us on the sea near the sea, that's that's where we're heading.

1797
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
If you want to follow our excursion in general, we'll be posting little maps and stuff

1798
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
and they're fun on the Twitter.

1799
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
But this is I think we're going to have some fun.

1800
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
We're all we're going on.

1801
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
How many people listen to the show?

1802
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,000
We're going to thousands of persons tour group together.

1803
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And let's let's you know, everyone stay in one place.

1804
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Don't get lost as we head to our next adventure.

1805
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Mm hmm.

1806
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Yeah.

1807
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And the show is going to get very loose and very comfortable.

1808
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
That's just what I'd like to say.

1809
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
That's a promise.

1810
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
That's a promise.

1811
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Loosening up.

1812
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We are not we're not afraid of being naked, smoking cigarettes, accidentally singeing

1813
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
our genitals with those cigarettes.

1814
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
No, that's fine.

1815
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
We don't fear a thing.

1816
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Bodiness is to be celebrated.

1817
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
European Michael is the new way.

1818
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Yeah, I'm feeling yeah, I'm just feeling good.

1819
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
You know, just feeling good.

1820
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
We've all said a lot in the last two months.

1821
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Yeah, yeah, I see.

1822
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Yeah, I've been saying it often.

1823
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Yeah, I feel good.

1824
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I'm saying it a lot, but just but like many, many times in a row and also type it in.

1825
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Hundreds and hundreds of times, whichever way you need to get it out into your yeah,

1826
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
into your underwood.

1827
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
All right.

1828
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh, you know, and one more thing when we cover entire parks, as we'll be doing, I think

1829
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
it's easy for stuff to fall through the cracks.

1830
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
So if we missed anything about any of these parks, please let us know.

1831
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
The podcast, the right at Gmail dot com, and we'll make sure that we, you know, we

1832
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
cover anything that we left behind in these places or anything else.

1833
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
We should go in Europe is already clearly we need to do this again.

1834
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
And maybe just live here.

1835
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
This is what the podcast is from now on.

1836
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Yeah, no more.

1837
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
We never go back to Disneyland ever more.

1838
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Disney.

1839
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Yeah.

1840
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Yeah.

1841
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So this is episode one of a new podcast.

1842
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Hope you're enjoying it.

1843
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That is simultaneously about medieval times, sometimes be about porn and otherwise be about

1844
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
European theme parks.

1845
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And we'll be back for more of that next week.

1846
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Yeah.

1847
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Well, all right.

1848
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
All right.

1849
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
What did Chow?

1850
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Chow Bella.

1851
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Chow Bella.
