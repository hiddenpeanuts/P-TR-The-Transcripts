1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,680
Lazy Club Three, start here, no pressure.

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,640
Jason, hi.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,000
Mike, hi.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,840
Hello.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
You know, let's like ease into the pool

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
because we have our work cut out for us.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
This is the most, you're gonna hear a lot of me going like,

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,560
and what does this say?

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,840
What are my notes?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,760
What does this even mean?

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Why did I write this?

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,240
It's there, it's sprawling scene notes.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
You almost went into the Biden right there.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
Yeah.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,360
Biden explaining Kingdom Hearts.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,200
On a Patreon episode.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,960
I, I got a square gown, square jeans.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,080
Goofy in a ship, he's in a ship.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,800
Mickey doesn't live in, he doesn't live in suburbia.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,000
He's not wearing the pants.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,840
He's with Zorai, red shirt, polo shirt.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
He's in Traverse Town.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,240
Okay.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
I grew up in Traverse Town.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,840
I took the train from Traverse Town, Washington, DC.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
I used to live.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,080
Folks in Traverse, you could buy things at the store.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,400
You could buy things for some sin.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
How are we?

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,080
It used to be red and green.

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,800
You'd buy the, you'd do a Louis, right on the shop.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,000
They wouldn't be there.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,320
People turn in Harless foes, they're turning in Harless.

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
They're not Harless, Harless.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,360
Harless.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,920
This might be five years of doing this show.

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,080
This might be the most I've ever been like,

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,080
ah, I am in over my head.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,840
That's completely right.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,080
We are talking about Kingdom Hearts.

42
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
That was the suggestion.

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll go into some of the other Club 3 things.

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,480
But what you reminded me of is something

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
that I wanted to say right up top.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,600
That the general suggestion was,

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
we wade through Kingdom Hearts.

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
I think the audience knew that we are not

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,640
previously familiar with it really, unless I'm wrong.

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,440
But there was also something that people threw out

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,480
when it won the poll was maybe a video game

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
and seemingly Kingdom Hearts enthusiast,

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,640
Matt Apodaca, could join the guys.

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,760
And the only reason Matt is not with us

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,600
is because I think you want the over in over your head.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
We don't wanna guide.

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,600
We wanna be in an unfamiliar world like Sora

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,040
going through the realms of light.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
Trying to piece together what's going on.

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
I hear you.

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
You don't wanna guide like,

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
I guess Donald and Goofy are not guides somewhat.

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
They haven't been in any of the places either.

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,960
Yeah, they're fresh too.

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
So yeah, I think that's right.

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm also intrigued by the listeners.

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Do they,

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,640
what do they think this episode's gonna be like?

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
Cause like,

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
do they think like,

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
oh, I know Kingdom Hearts very well.

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,120
It'll be funny to watch these guys struggle through it.

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Or are they like, oh, it's so ridiculous.

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,400
Like watching some kids who don't know how to swim.

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,480
Just swatting and swatting around and getting nowhere.

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
Only getting deeper and deeper.

77
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
Yeah, I guess maybe that's what they're looking for.

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
I mean, look, they're just looking,

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I guess we're the professionals.

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,640
They're kinda looking to spin gold

81
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,240
with anything that we get thrown.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,080
So, you know, look, I'm up to the challenge.

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,560
I hope you mean spinning earths.

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,200
That's what we're gonna be spinning a lot of today.

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,520
I, you know, I'm not opposed to

86
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,440
convoluted continuity or lore.

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,920
I was walking around the other day

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,800
and I saw like a tweet.

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,880
I was looking at my phone.

90
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,040
I saw something about the X-Men and I was like,

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
oh my God, I've been reading X-Men comics for 30 years now.

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
It's like second grade.

93
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
That's true, yeah.

94
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
They're like extended family members.

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
And if you ask me to explain, there would be,

96
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,880
there's some goofy bullshit in there.

97
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
Sure, yeah.

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,920
There is some really convoluted stuff

99
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,760
and some stuff where it's just like,

100
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
the young X-Men traveled through time

101
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,920
and now they're on the regular X-Men.

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,960
No, there's some stuff that sucks here.

103
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,560
In their mix with all the like different stages

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,880
where I was like, and this was really cool

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,000
when I was this age and then this happened at this age

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,160
and this person came on board.

107
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
So you haven't spent 30 years with Kingdom Hearts.

108
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,080
I haven't spent, no.

109
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,760
You could spend what, 20 years?

110
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
It's been out for, yeah.

111
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,560
The first one came out 20 years ago.

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Happy 20, Kingdom Hearts.

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,680
PlayStation 2.

114
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Yes, that was when I knew I was in over my head

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
because I was like, oh yeah, there's been three Kingdom Hearts.

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
I remember my brother was really into those games.

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
No, no, no, no.

118
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
And I looked it up, oh no, it appears

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
there's been the 13 games if you count.

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,040
Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, mobile games,

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
browser games that are no longer available on browsers.

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah, and look, we're gonna limit it.

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,800
We're gonna put up some barricades

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
because the madness has to stop at some point.

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Before we get into that Club 3 business,

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,480
I wanna mention, because look, first of all,

127
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,480
this was the stats-wise biggest mandate we've ever received.

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,720
48% to 21.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,880
This demolished.

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,200
I couldn't believe how well Kingdom Hearts,

131
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,040
we got hit by, we all got smacked in the head

132
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,840
by a very powerful keyblade.

133
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,000
The runner-up though, just to mention it,

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
and I like to read the full thing written,

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,480
and this is from Shane Cannon,

136
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,960
who gifted us Garfield Eats and also the pros

137
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,760
that made Garfield Eats so fascinating

138
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,800
because he spit out the whole story, very contained.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,160
And I think a pretty good effort by Shane Cannon here

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
as well, this is the runner-up.

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,760
Please discuss the 1999 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,600
featuring Lou Baga, Verne Troyer on an Austin Powers

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Spy Who Shagged Me-thiefed float,

144
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,720
an Ask Jeeves float, Rudy Giuliani,

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,480
and a special performance by the Bacon Brothers.

146
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,760
By the way, that's just a smattering

147
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,960
of when you watch the actual opening as they did.

148
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,960
That's just some of who gets mentioned at the top,

149
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,120
which at the time the person doing the announcements

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
was Don Pardo.

151
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,400
It was a rare outside of SNL in the 90s,

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,760
Don Pardo appearance saying, Lou Baga!

153
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
Something he never got to say

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
because Lou Baga didn't do SNL.

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,960
Those snooty bastards didn't let Lou on.

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
So that will carry over to the next round.

157
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm not gonna say the whole thing again,

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
but the 1999 Macy's parade, this is very intriguing, right?

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
I was excited when this showed up.

160
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,320
I think we were all like, not rooting for this over,

161
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,480
but if it had landed here, would have been exciting.

162
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
So it moves on to the next month,

163
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
and that might be weird because it's November now.

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
Are we really in December going to do a Thanksgiving parade?

165
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,680
But Christmas parade.

166
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Yeah, sure.

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,340
There's a parade.

168
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,840
It's the holiday season, I think.

169
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,120
That's not so far removed, I think.

170
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,960
And what does the Macy's parade end with,

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,720
but an appearance from Santa Claus.

172
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
The big man himself.

173
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
Who never hosted.

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,720
The big man himself.

175
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
Santa never did it.

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,600
Alec all the time and never Santa.

177
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,920
Yeah, you know Santa, he did mad TV.

178
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
It was more his seed.

179
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,840
We had him on Fridays once, and it didn't really pop.

180
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,000
So I guess, I think this very well could carry over.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
I actually think it does make sense for December.

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,480
So if your heart is in the 1999 Macy's parade,

183
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,400
feel free to vote for that.

184
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
But this brings me to December.

185
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,320
That is the next club three.

186
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
We've never done a holiday.

187
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,480
So I would say the encouraged areas for your suggestions,

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,600
which we encourage you to post below in the Patreon app

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,240
or the webpage, something holiday oriented would be great.

190
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Look, we love our parades and our Christmas specials.

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
There's a lot of odd amenities in that realm,

192
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
but also there might be rides or seasonal attractions

193
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
we don't know about.

194
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,320
I think there's a lot of possibilities.

195
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah, there's the we wish you a turtle Christmas,

196
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,360
Ninja Turtles movie that is something I didn't even know

197
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
existed until a few years ago.

198
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
I don't wanna say you vote for that,

199
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
but I'm just saying if somebody wants to throw it

200
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
in the mix.

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
We can always campaign.

202
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
We can see we can nominate.

203
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm gonna toss this out in the vein of the Macy's parade

204
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,600
that everyone's thinking like, oh, Christmas and Hanukkah.

205
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,920
Don't forget about New Year's.

206
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,000
Cause I'm sure there's a lot of weird New Year's

207
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,000
specials and ceremonies, you know?

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
True, true.

209
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Don't sleep on New Year's.

210
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Don't sleep on New Year's, especially because some

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,640
of that block on local affiliates is usually a local

212
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,160
fireworks display or something.

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean, like the, you ever watched the Jamie Kennedy

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
disaster?

215
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,320
That's one of the best videos.

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,320
There's an amazing cut down of a local affiliate LA,

217
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,440
Jamie Kennedy hosted in front of the Chinese theater,

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,240
a New Year's special that went horribly awry

219
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,520
and where they didn't really have security or control over.

220
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,480
There's just like, just absolutely, I was gonna say wasted,

221
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,960
but I will say hammered people.

222
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,000
It's like insane how fucked, it's the most fucked up people

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,080
you've ever seen on TV and right towards the end

224
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
a fight breaks out.

225
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
It's so, and if you can imagine that Jamie Kennedy

226
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,960
is not the consummate broadcaster to maintain control.

227
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,400
He's not the art link that was needed.

228
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
So that's a good one.

229
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
I think you're absolutely right.

230
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,800
There's a ton there, but also don't forget,

231
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,960
we've announced our theme for some of December's,

232
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,840
I mean all of December, but it would fit in the realm

233
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,480
of the topics to do something avatar related

234
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,000
because we are celebrating Feliz Navidad, the way of winter.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
So if there's some particular facet of avatar,

236
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,280
Pandoran culture that you think belongs on club three,

237
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,800
I think that could be possible as well.

238
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,200
A lot of choices, a lot of options.

239
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
Yeah, yeah, so get creative, get a little creative writing.

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah, do some work.

241
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,240
Yeah, yeah, it is a work for us.

242
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,760
So that's it, and I think I maybe,

243
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,560
I wanted to take a little time with that

244
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,840
just to talk about something that isn't Kingdom Hearts

245
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,560
before we launch, before the journey begins.

246
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,920
You know, Kingdom Hearts has always,

247
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,800
it feels like when you're a passenger in a car at night

248
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,120
and you kind of see, maybe you're a little tired

249
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,360
and you kind of see little streaks of light

250
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,840
or buildings kind of lit up out of the corner of your eye.

251
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,800
Like I remember Kingdom Hearts always being around

252
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
and I knew it had a very passionate fan base

253
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,840
and it was a huge hit multiple times over.

254
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,880
Oh, continues to be.

255
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,360
Look, there's no disputing of that.

256
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,720
It's just not anything we've ever, unless, am I mistaken?

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,520
Do you have experience with Kingdom Hearts that I don't know?

258
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,800
I don't have experience.

259
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I think that I'm the biggest gamer of the three of us.

260
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Yeah.

261
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,880
And I'm not a big, I'm not an insane gamer,

262
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,480
but I still, I have the Switch, I have a PS5, I had a PS4.

263
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
I will play if Mario Galaxy when that was Wii, right?

264
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,400
No, the new one was, I can't think of Mario Odyssey.

265
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,120
I played through that, I played through new Zeldas.

266
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
Yes.

267
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,000
I play wrestling games still, but I'm not like constantly,

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll do like a month where I'll play a game

269
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,360
and then I sort of won't play video games for a month or two.

270
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,720
Like I'm not consistently gaming.

271
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
Not always playing something.

272
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,600
Yeah, I have video games that I still like.

273
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,880
A lot of stuff is just unfinished.

274
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
I like those, Batman Arkham games, I still like.

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Those are my dream come true, those games, how good they are.

276
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,240
I have not played Gotham Knights, supposedly not as good.

277
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,680
But those games are amazing.

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,360
I told the story when you lit a horse on fire during Zelda

279
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,000
when we got it five years ago.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
We did tell that on the show.

281
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,880
Yes.

282
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,720
Okay, I have that in my note.

283
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,800
No, no, I wasn't gonna tell, I wasn't gonna build.

284
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
Get ready for a tale, everyone.

285
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,720
I couldn't, we talked about that somewhere recently

286
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,440
and I couldn't remember if it was on here.

287
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,200
Yeah, you stripped Link's clothes off,

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,520
you put him in his underwear

289
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
and you immediately lit his horse on fire

290
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,920
and the horse were sent running

291
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,360
and Gio and I were laughing more than I've laughed

292
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,840
in like a decade, because we didn't know that was possible.

293
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,040
Kind of not intentional.

294
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,640
No, you just sort of, you mashed buttons,

295
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
his clothes came off, the horse was lit

296
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
and it ran and we were laughing so hard at it.

297
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Before that, my big video game,

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
I think that the games I was invested in before that

299
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,680
were like Max Payne 2 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City

300
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,120
and that's coming up on like 20 years for both those games.

301
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,520
Right, and again, Grand Theft Auto, all pandemic,

302
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,600
I was playing with Susser and Gio and her friend Tim.

303
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,120
So yeah, so I'm playing games.

304
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,560
I will say this about Kingdom Hearts.

305
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,160
I was always excited about the idea of it.

306
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,400
I think because it's like kind of an RPG,

307
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,240
even though it's not a straight RPG, like Final Fantasy.

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
I never played the Final Fantasy games,

309
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,600
which are classic games that everyone should play.

310
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
I just never got into those

311
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
and this is made by the same company

312
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,680
and a lot of the same people.

313
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
Silver Juno Square.

314
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah, and there's so much in common.

315
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,120
Cloud shows up from Final Fantasy 7, Cloud Strife.

316
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
I know the names.

317
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,400
Sephiroth shows up, one of the bad guys.

318
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,000
But I'm just saying like those types of games,

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
I didn't really play very much.

320
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,440
Zelda was a little more action oriented than some of them.

321
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
I think that's why I was more with Zelda,

322
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,400
but I was always a Nintendo kid first.

323
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,880
So I was always like, oh, Kingdom Hearts,

324
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm gonna get to this one day, much like Yellowstone.

325
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm gonna get to Kingdom Hearts one day.

326
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
I played Epic Mickey.

327
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
I don't know, were you around?

328
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
We would play, yeah, we would play a little.

329
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
So Epic Mickey was in a similar way to this

330
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
where it was like, we're gonna take a bunch of,

331
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
you remember this?

332
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah.

333
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
We're gonna take a bunch of Disney stuff

334
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,920
and sort of put it out in one big universe

335
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,760
and Oswald, right when they got him back.

336
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Oswald is a villain, that's cool.

337
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,960
Yeah, and so we played that.

338
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,520
That game is pretty good.

339
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Not quite as-

340
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
Just as great as I wanted it to, yeah.

341
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,320
I thought it would be like jaw-droppingly.

342
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah, then there was art.

343
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm sure I've said this many years.

344
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,160
I think we talked about this years ago,

345
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
but there was art, promo art for it,

346
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
that looked incredible.

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,240
Looked like cool and stylized dystopian versions of things

348
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,000
and like return to Oz,

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
but it's the Magic Kingdom or something.

350
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,160
And you're like, this looks awesome.

351
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800
And then it sort of ended up being a big cartoon game,

352
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
which is fun, but not quite,

353
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
it didn't quite live up to the promise

354
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,720
of what it could have been.

355
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,560
Sure.

356
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,720
So I did play some of that, but yes,

357
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
Kingdom Hearts, for 20 years, I've said,

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,080
I gotta play this game.

359
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm gonna get to this one day.

360
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,240
And you're being made to.

361
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,920
And I bought the game three weeks ago.

362
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,760
Wow.

363
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,240
Three or four weeks ago, I bought the game,

364
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,760
which has like many, many of the games in it.

365
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,520
And I said, oh, this is, here's what I'm gonna do.

366
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm gonna be the guy that plays the game.

367
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
So I'll have that perspective.

368
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah.

369
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
And I'll get, and you gotta go,

370
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm probably not gonna be able to beat it

371
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,840
cause it's a long game,

372
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,080
but I'll at least have some time with it

373
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,160
and I will have some perspective.

374
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
Here's the thing.

375
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,720
Having a child,

376
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,080
it's not the easiest thing to play video games sometimes

377
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
when the baby is very young.

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Also, I said to myself,

379
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm not going to look at strategy guides.

380
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm gonna just do this.

381
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
I can do this.

382
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
Cut to a couple of days ago where I go,

383
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,880
I haven't gotten out of fucking Traverse Town.

384
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,560
How have I, I've spent so many hours,

385
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,720
I feel like playing this.

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,480
I'm still stuck in the first like 5% of the game.

387
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,120
This is where you are before you get to go

388
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
to like the real places.

389
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
This is the like gathering supplies place.

390
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,320
So I'm playing this like a couple of days ago,

391
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,720
holy shit, I haven't gotten anywhere in this game.

392
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,200
I haven't done anything here.

393
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,120
I go, I've been playing this in like little pieces

394
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,360
for like two weeks.

395
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
Oh my God.

396
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,760
I've barely done anything.

397
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,360
Mike, you are describing,

398
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,720
I ran into a similar problem where I was like,

399
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,560
okay, I know how to get a grasp on this.

400
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm gonna go to YouTube

401
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,160
and I'm gonna type in Kingdom Hearts Explained.

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,160
And after watching five Kingdom Hearts Explained videos,

403
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,280
I went, oh no, this might be harder than I thought.

404
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,880
So then I tried to find play through videos

405
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,960
and my options were, do you want a 10 hour one

406
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,560
or a 20 hour one?

407
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
And I was like, oh no.

408
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,160
Yeah, I was watching the 10 hour one then

409
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,480
to sort of catch up with the rest of it

410
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,160
because yeah, I was like not getting very far.

411
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,760
And I was, again, I should have gone

412
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,400
to strategy guide immediately.

413
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,120
Cause I would sort of play for 45 minutes

414
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,200
and go, I don't know which way I should go here.

415
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,240
And then I would kind of, I would miss a doorway

416
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
or something, which is where you would push

417
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
the story forward.

418
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,600
Cause like Donald, I don't know,

419
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,480
we should start at the beginning,

420
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
but like there would be certain things

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,120
you'd have to trigger going on.

422
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
And I was like very casual about it.

423
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
I go, it's okay, you'll do it at a certain point

424
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,320
and you'll figure it out.

425
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
And then a couple of days ago I go,

426
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
I barely play this game, I think.

427
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,560
I think I've just been roaming around this town casually.

428
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
What's going on?

429
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,560
I watched, I tried to look at videos

430
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,160
that like IGN had done

431
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,280
where there was another company called Giant Bomb,

432
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,080
which I was like, okay, I know I've seen Giant Bomb videos.

433
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,880
I kind of know what this is.

434
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,680
And so I watched it and it's these two guys

435
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,640
worked for the company and they're like, yeah, all right.

436
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,480
We're finally gonna try Kingdom Hearts.

437
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,240
And I scrubbed through like a while in

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,560
and they're like setting up the control options.

439
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,760
And I was like, oh, this isn't working either.

440
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
I spent so much time on the island.

441
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,400
There's an island to start out in the game.

442
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,000
I realize now I spent like days on this island.

443
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
The way this episode's gonna go, we aren't careful.

444
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
We're gonna be on there, we'll do two hours

445
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
if it's only on the island.

446
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
Okay, here's what's gonna make this doable.

447
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
Guys, here's the assignment.

448
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,120
Well, this helps a little bit.

449
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,560
And this is from Alex Tucker.

450
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,840
Thanks for the suggestion.

451
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,720
Alex, congrats on winning the poll.

452
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,440
We need an episode of the boys trying to figure out

453
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
the plot of the first, first Kingdom Hearts game.

454
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,800
Please, boys, it's so confusing and nonsensical.

455
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,600
Donald is a wizard.

456
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
Yes.

457
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,960
Well, he's the Grand Mage, she's the Grand Mage.

458
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,720
And Goofy is the head of the Royal Guard, I believe.

459
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
Okay.

460
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,720
For King Mickey.

461
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah.

462
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,240
Okay, what I'm getting at here, first game.

463
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,760
He's limited it, so let's cut any expectation

464
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,040
that we did anymore in the first game

465
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,120
because there's plenty in the first game.

466
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,960
Yes.

467
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,000
I was curious about everyone's strategies.

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,400
My strategy ended up, I found a mirror,

469
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,400
a helpfully breezy four hour 38 minute cut scenes.

470
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,280
Yeah, that's good, yeah.

471
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,760
I, guys, let me say this out loud for the first time.

472
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
I hate the phrase cut scenes so much.

473
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
Really?

474
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,120
Because it sounds like deleted scenes is what it sounds like.

475
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,200
Now, it took me so many times going like, cut?

476
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
So these were cut from the game?

477
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,360
No, no, no, they're cut, like edited.

478
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
Oh, interesting, I've never even thought about that.

479
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,920
It's always stuck, it's been like a bristle

480
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,720
in my brain for a long time.

481
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,040
Did you ever read, like when you were younger,

482
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,640
did you, like in the same way that we all,

483
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,120
I think, read Entertainment Weekly pretty religiously,

484
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,920
I found a bunch of my old Entertainment Weekly's

485
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,200
a couple days ago, did you ever read like Nintendo Power

486
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,400
or any of the other different gaming magazines?

487
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,920
Not like, to recreationally, if it was like something

488
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,440
specific that I was, and I'm like the least gamer,

489
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,760
by the way, I'm like, I play the new Mario carts

490
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,560
when they come out and that is all.

491
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,080
Doctor, you're a Doctor Mario fan though?

492
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Yes, the original 8-bit Doctor Mario, correct.

493
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,880
Okay, that's something.

494
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,400
Yes, that was a big relaxing wine habit for a while.

495
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
Yeah, nothing since the Wii U for me, no Final Fantasy.

496
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,320
So any Final Fantasy familiarity of characters,

497
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,720
not gonna help me out, I don't know what any of this is.

498
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,920
So we're all going in a little blind,

499
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
but all we have to do is the first game.

500
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,320
That's it, that's it.

501
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,760
Unfortunately, a lot of the explainers I saw

502
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,600
were going in chronological order where you have to,

503
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,320
okay, well, you have to go, this game takes place

504
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,060
before the first game.

505
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,740
No, out, it's out, it's out.

506
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,760
You can tell us anything that you found interesting

507
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,920
from that, however, it's gonna get dark,

508
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,320
we're gonna wanna be out of here.

509
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,480
Yeah, I gotta say, the best video I saw

510
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,800
and other people, I guess, agree,

511
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,240
because it has 1.9 million views.

512
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,160
Can't argue that.

513
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,520
But it's called, where did it go?

514
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,440
Kingdom Hearts, but there's no context.

515
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,560
And this is what I, this took a while to find

516
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,720
because the parts, if you just Google

517
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,680
Kingdom Hearts funniest moments,

518
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,320
that doesn't give you what you want.

519
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,160
I wanna see-

520
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,280
There's nothing funny in this entire game.

521
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,120
I want-

522
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,520
This is the most humorless drag ever.

523
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,180
I wish something funny happened.

524
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,780
I wanted to see the two second moment

525
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,820
where a ladim runs by and goes,

526
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,580
oh, hey, Sora.

527
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,620
That's what I wanted.

528
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I wanted to see, oh, in one part,

529
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,340
you can push Winnie the Pooh on a swing,

530
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,860
and if you push him hard enough,

531
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,580
he flies over the 100-acre woods.

532
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,420
Whoa.

533
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,300
That is my interest.

534
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,140
Oh, that's cool.

535
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,860
I have a video I'll play towards the end,

536
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,700
which breaks the rules a little,

537
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,660
but is, I think, worth it based on some things

538
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,140
we've addressed in the past.

539
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,260
So, do you have a starting place?

540
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,740
Maybe.

541
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,820
Okay, Basics 2002, 20 years ago,

542
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,300
made by Square Enix, the makers of Final Fantasy.

543
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,460
Finally, the Disney universe

544
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,780
and the Square Enix universe collide.

545
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,740
So, it's a chance, it's merging Disney stuff

546
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,260
with Final Fantasy stuff, and characters

547
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,300
are very at peace with the Final Fantasy universe

548
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,160
and vibe.

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,080
Let me, I'll say one more thing before I do,

550
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,840
which is maybe my previous familiarity

551
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,040
with this game series.

552
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,560
This is the only way that it had come across my desk before,

553
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,840
which is that in early days of YouTube, 2007, 2008,

554
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,400
that I would sometimes be looking for a song,

555
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,080
and I would find not the music video for the song

556
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,240
or a clear version of the song,

557
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,040
but rather an AMV or anime music video

558
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,040
that takes a song and cuts Kingdom Hearts footage

559
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
to the song.

560
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,120
And this, so my only awareness was from the,

561
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,760
and I'm like, okay, what can I glean from this?

562
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,560
All right, it's like, this game is about

563
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,560
12-year-old waif nymphs with perfectly spiky hair,

564
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
and there seems to be a lot of angst involved,

565
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,560
and then it's always, here's what, okay,

566
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,920
because I started thinking, like, what,

567
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,720
I was just typing in, I was like,

568
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,480
I think I get a sense of the kind of song

569
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,400
this stuff's edited to, and it'll be like Evanescence,

570
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,040
Lincoln Park, Nick, yes, for sure that,

571
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,880
there might be a hundred of those,

572
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,360
or like Tattoo, anything of that,

573
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,800
and that neck of the woods.

574
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,600
And then just footage of like longing and reaching

575
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,880
and grasping, and like with these characters

576
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,040
who are like mainly very anime-looking characters,

577
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,880
but then sometimes like Sebastian the crab

578
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
will eek in there.

579
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
I don't know why.

580
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,760
Like, this is not knowing the context,

581
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,240
I'm like, wait, so how come, boy,

582
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040
it seems like these people are really going through a lot.

583
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,520
Why is Dewey there?

584
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,780
And these things always struck me so funny.

585
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,920
It's like, actually, here, let me do, let's do a challenge.

586
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,560
Can you name a song that you think is sort of in that,

587
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,680
in that realm?

588
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,760
Here's what I get, Evanescence,

589
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
Lincoln Park, Tattoo, Nickelback.

590
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,240
I also, I looked up some Trident Trees.

591
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,320
Puddle of Mud.

592
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
Oh, Puddle of Mud, that's good, okay, okay, yeah, yeah,

593
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,640
let's see, all right.

594
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,440
Puddle of Mud, Kingdom Hearts.

595
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,440
Is it Band Seether?

596
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
What about the band Seether?

597
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Oh, Seether's gonna be good, here, I'll do that one.

598
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,280
Kingdom Hearts, AMV, Seether.

599
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,440
What was Seether?

600
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm trying to remember.

601
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,440
World Falls Away.

602
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,080
Yeah, World Falls Away, there's so many, there's so many.

603
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
What was the first idea, Puddle of Mud?

604
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Yeah.

605
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,960
I, these things, basically, I would, yeah,

606
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
so a lot of Puddle of Mud, so much Puddle of Mud.

607
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,120
Here's Kingdom Hearts 2, the Puddle of Mud Blurry opening.

608
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,280
So I would stumble across these,

609
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,800
and I would equate my feeling about it to being like,

610
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,220
you know in The Simpsons, in the Burlesque House,

611
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,540
when Grandpa walks in and he's whistling

612
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,200
and puts his hat and coat down,

613
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,060
but then sees that Bart is the doorman

614
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,640
and then just keeps whistling,

615
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,800
and then grabs his hat and coat again and keeps walking?

616
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,060
That's me with like, all I know is this fucking,

617
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,620
you know, hate to say it, but American idiot,

618
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,620
mashed up with 21 guns, mashed up with these waif nymphs.

619
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,820
That's on the second level.

620
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,060
I don't want any part of any of this.

621
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,180
So that is my backstory, so that's all I know.

622
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,460
I knew that it's waif nymphs,

623
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,220
and I know that sometimes Jiminy Cricket is around.

624
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,540
Yes.

625
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,020
If I can bring us into the very recent midterms,

626
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,540
the Kingdom Hearts midterms connection.

627
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,620
Oh yeah, I saw this, yes.

628
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,460
Did you see this?

629
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,280
Uh-huh.

630
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,960
This was so bizarre to be reading about Kingdom Hearts

631
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,320
and reading about midterm news at the same time

632
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
and see the crossover.

633
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Maxwell Alejandro Frost, the first member of Gen Z,

634
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,560
elected to Congress, had tweeted,

635
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
I haven't played video games in years,

636
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,880
but I'll always remember how awesome Kingdom Hearts is.

637
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,800
Bizarre coincidence, really strange.

638
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Member of Congress was a Kingdom Hearts fan,

639
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,560
and we defeated a real world, what's his name?

640
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,400
Ah, shit.

641
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
Zeena.

642
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
No, who's the actually worst one?

643
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,760
Arson with Ansem.

644
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,520
We defeated a real world Ansem, that being Dr. Oz.

645
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,360
Right.

646
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,180
Yeah.

647
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,020
Take that.

648
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,200
The Heartless, AKA the GOP, huh?

649
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,840
Okay, so let's, all right, that said,

650
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,240
we've all established our connection to it,

651
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
so I was kind of dreading having to get into

652
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
actually experiencing this.

653
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Yeah.

654
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,840
But now I understand the game.

655
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,280
I have a full grasp on the game,

656
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,600
and I can tell you what the game is about.

657
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,480
The game is about zippers.

658
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,040
It's about characters with clothes with complicated zippers

659
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,920
and in places that zippers are not normally,

660
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,540
zippers on hats, maybe zippers are on pants,

661
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,160
but they're on like the knees,

662
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,200
or they're like, maybe it's on the crotch,

663
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
but like all zigzag.

664
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
And to a lesser extent, complicated belts.

665
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,800
Complicated belts are also a part of Kingdom Hearts,

666
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,520
but I would say zippers more than anything

667
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,080
is the theme of the game.

668
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,800
That may, yeah, that's the main takeaway for you, at least.

669
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,640
That's what I got out of it.

670
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,400
Chain wallets, kind of.

671
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,440
It's kind of, it's a very chain wallety game,

673
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,020
and all that music is kind of,

674
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,880
maybe you'd put that in the genre of chain wallet music.

675
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
That's 100%, yeah.

676
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
Those are fan made though.

677
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,440
Again, I don't want people to be confused.

678
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,080
Puddle of Mud is not in the game.

679
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,920
No, no, no.

680
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,740
No, no.

681
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,720
That would be very funny.

682
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
Music's great, honestly.

683
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,680
Music's nice and pleasant.

684
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,160
But Sephiroth, occasionally voiced by Lance Bass.

685
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Sure.

686
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,840
I know that.

687
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Oh yeah, you got a music connection there.

688
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,680
Yeah.

689
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Okay, so, but basics.

690
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,800
You play the game as Sora.

691
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,680
Sora is the main waif nymph.

692
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,080
He is played by Haley Joel Osment,

693
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,200
who's having a big 2002,

694
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,880
because he has also voiced Barry Barrington,

695
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,720
the star of the Country Bears movie.

696
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
Jason, would you like us to talk about this

697
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,640
for 20 more minutes, or should we keep proceeding?

698
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
Look, it's been long enough.

699
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm ready to revisit.

700
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
You know?

701
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
All right, good.

702
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,200
Please just don't make me look up the difference

703
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,060
between Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

704
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,640
and Kingdom Hearts Coded.

705
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,720
No, no, this will not,

706
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,240
we have not been given this assignment.

707
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,060
We can't do it.

708
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,120
We were forbidden.

709
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,960
We'd love to do it.

710
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,800
We can't do it.

711
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,620
You know what?

712
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
That's fine, because Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

713
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,520
turned out to just be a dream that Tigger was having.

714
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
Is that true?

715
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,480
I today was like, all right,

716
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm gonna refresh myself with some Kingdom Hearts stuff.

717
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
And the first thing I watched, rewatched a video,

718
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,600
and they're like, and that game didn't really matter,

719
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,880
because it was just a dream in Tigger's mind.

720
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,400
I was like, God damn it, come on.

721
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,920
Tigger gets to have an entire game dream?

722
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
It's like his Starlight Express.

723
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh, that's right.

724
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,920
So, Sora is a cheerful teenager

725
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,080
who lives on the Destiny Islands

726
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,360
and has been best friends with Riku and Kairi

727
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
since childhood.

728
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,920
So, there are three waif nymphs.

729
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,680
Three, they have perfect hair.

730
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,360
Their hair that would poke your eyes out.

731
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,520
It's so spiky.

732
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,900
They're all four foot tall,

733
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,160
and a foot of that four feet are their eyes.

734
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
Their eyes are very big.

735
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Three youngsters who live in a little paradise

736
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,120
and yet really wanna leave the paradise

737
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,400
and go do other stuff.

738
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,640
Yeah, they're restless.

739
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
Yeah.

740
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,960
Yes, because their circumstances change a lot.

741
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,760
Quick notes about Riku and Kairi.

742
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,720
Kairi, female character, played by Hayden Panatier,

743
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
who was, of course, in the 2000 Disney film, Dinosaur.

744
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,240
She plays Suri.

745
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,240
So, Hayden plays Suri and Kairi, not Sora.

746
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
Suri is not Sora.

747
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Riku, the other boy, is voiced by Seventh Heaven's

748
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,600
David Gallagher, who was the blonde-haired kid

749
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
on Seventh Heaven who would run a foul

750
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,020
of light marijuana use, or in one case,

751
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,320
having to huff paint or being tempted.

752
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
No, I think he did huff paint.

753
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,360
I don't really know.

754
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,800
I should watch the full episode.

755
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,320
But here's what's crazy about this.

756
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,440
For some amount of time, spoiler, I guess,

757
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,080
a villain of this guy, a major character in this game,

758
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,160
voiced by David Gallagher, who at the time

759
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,800
of the release of this game, had the locker next to mine

760
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,840
at my high school.

761
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,600
I went to high school with this guy,

762
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,540
which everybody thought was really funny,

763
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,540
because this Seventh Heaven, I mean, Seventh Heaven's insane

764
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,240
if you watch it now in general, and he probably had

765
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,600
the most insane stuff to do.

766
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,160
So, I feel bad about it now, because it was kind of

767
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,900
that ultimate, like, you know, oh, boy,

768
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,700
that guy thinks he's so big because he's on Seventh Heaven.

769
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,540
Does he?

770
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,860
Has he ever indicated that he thinks he's so big?

771
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,520
Or have we applied that?

772
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,220
Is he a regular guy who everyone in this high school

773
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,500
is being terrible to?

774
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,920
I don't know, I don't remember.

775
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,600
Guys, that guy spoke to him twice and he seemed fine.

776
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,460
But anyway, it was a good situation for me,

777
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,580
because he was always off filming Seventh Heaven,

778
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,980
or maybe in some cases, VO sessions for Kingdom Hearts.

779
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,260
And you know, you have that double up with the lockers.

780
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,700
I never had anybody below me or above me.

781
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,140
I had plenty of space when getting my books,

782
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,020
because he was never around.

783
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,700
It was essentially like an empty locker.

784
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,820
Thank you, Kingdom Hearts.

785
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,020
Kingdom, I thank you, Kingdom Hearts,

786
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,820
for sending him on these journeys.

787
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,820
These incredible journeys that gave me locker room.

788
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,660
That's great.

789
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,780
So, I was flipped out that David Gallagher is part of it.

790
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,260
So, yeah, they live in paradise, but they wanna explore,

791
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,780
and maybe they've done the math that there's only one Kyrie

792
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,020
for the two of them, so at some point,

793
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,800
dating is gonna get difficult.

794
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
They're gonna have some difficult choices to make.

795
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,800
They're competitive.

796
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,420
You can sense these guys are not good.

798
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,540
There's a race you run on the island.

799
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,460
Oh, see, this is what you don't know.

800
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,260
I only watch scenes, so I don't know what's going on.

801
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,860
You can maybe fill us in on only that scene.

802
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,900
I spent a lot of time on this island,

803
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,820
and there's a race between the two characters,

804
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,700
sort of for the affection of Kyrie.

805
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,260
Okay. And I lost.

806
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,460
Oh, shit. I lost badly.

807
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,980
Oh, you lost Kyrie.

808
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,420
Yeah.

809
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,780
Riku, you bastard.

810
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,700
Yeah, and when you're on that island,

811
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,140
you have to gather a lot of stuff for your journey,

812
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,140
including fish and some rope and some water,

813
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,400
and this took me forever,

814
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,560
to the point where eventually I did have to look up

815
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,580
where you get the rope, where you really find the rope.

816
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,580
If you wanna go to a fantastical world and find rope,

817
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,140
Kingdom Hearts is the game for you,

818
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,700
because, look, they don't know that they're going

819
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,660
on a crazy journey to all the Disney worlds.

820
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,300
They're going on a raft journey

821
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,740
to see what else is out there,

822
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,180
but then there's a big invasion

823
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,380
and a bunch of scary monsters show up,

824
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,060
and these we find are the Heartless.

825
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,900
Yeah.

826
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,900
They are kind of pitch black, jerry guys who are,

827
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,620
we don't know everything about them at first,

828
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,020
but they seem like pure evil.

829
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,540
They're bad news, clearly.

830
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,180
I hate the Heartless.

831
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,620
Oh, you said it. I really hate them,

832
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,800
and it's not because of whatever their motivations are.

833
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,440
It is because fighting them is the most monotonous thing

834
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,440
you can do, and they keep respawning,

835
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,160
which is a big pet peeve of mine in video games

836
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,960
when character, not all the time,

837
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,800
but if things respawn, meaning that they keep popping up,

838
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,560
when you defeat a bunch of them, you leave that area,

839
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,880
you come back to the area, and then they're there again.

840
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,240
That's always kind of annoying to me.

841
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,120
I always liked it better when you would defeat enemies,

842
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,560
and if you go back, they weren't there.

843
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah.

844
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,080
Because this is a hack slash game for much of it,

845
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,920
and then it has role playing elements.

846
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,160
If I had heard more that it was hack slash,

847
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,960
I probably would have gravitated more.

848
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
Exactly.

849
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,160
I think I thought I was more into hack slash

850
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,720
than the RPG elements.

851
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,560
Yeah.

852
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,680
Meaning it's like a weapons oriented game.

853
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,840
Yeah, you're fighting sort of more than

854
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
sort of turn-based RPG games, which were very much like,

855
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,640
especially in the early days,

856
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,480
you were kind of solving problems via text.

857
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,680
It was almost like Dungeons and Dragons in a way,

858
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,080
where it's like hit points,

859
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,040
and it was not necessarily an action oriented game.

860
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,280
When they made a Super Mario RPG game,

861
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,320
and I didn't know what it was, and I rented this,

862
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,880
this was one of the most angry I ever was as a child.

863
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,720
I was gonna say, I bet you didn't know.

864
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,200
I had no tolerance for this.

865
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,080
What do you mean?

866
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
Why am I picking items?

867
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,440
Then I just go to a screen.

868
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I don't get to jump on the Koopa.

869
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,800
I have to pick something,

870
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,040
and then there's nothing satisfying that happens

871
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,440
when it hits him.

872
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,760
This is the opposite of what I want.

873
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah, I was not into that game,

874
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,160
even though for people who like RPGs, it's a masterpiece,

875
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,800
the other ones.

876
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,680
Paper Mario is sort of in between.

877
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,000
Paper Mario's sort of got some RPG elements,

878
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,640
but is a little more action.

879
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,480
I didn't play that one as much, but yeah.

880
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,000
This one's hack and slash.

881
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,760
It's more fighting, and I'll say this.

882
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,160
This is a video game thing, and maybe the future games.

883
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,000
I did not find any of the action in this game

884
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,520
fun or satisfying.

885
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Wow.

886
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,720
This is the perspective you can bring.

887
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,760
I just watched video.

888
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,360
For all I knew, maybe the gameplay is great.

889
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,040
It might be to people listening, but you didn't like it.

890
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,320
There is something so, you take for granted

891
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,800
playing almost all the Mario's, the regular Mario's,

892
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,680
and the other Mario's.

893
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,600
You take for granted the important controls are,

894
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,560
and how satisfying it is to just do

895
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,440
the basic things in the game.

896
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
Even playing the 3D Mario games,

897
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,440
playing the 2D Mario games,

898
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,880
there's something so satisfying about jumping on the Goomba

899
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,680
and the Koopa Troopa's heads,

900
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,840
bouncing from things to things.

901
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
There's a rhythm to it.

902
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,880
The sound effects are perfectly chosen.

903
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,360
You really feel like you're doing it.

904
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,520
You feel like you're doing it, but then there's also,

905
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,280
there's a lulling almost effect to it,

906
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,680
where you kind of crave doing it more.

907
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,920
And if you play video games that feel like

908
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,840
they haven't figured out that sort of,

909
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,240
they haven't figured out their version of a calm,

910
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,560
or not calm, but a fun, satisfying version of it,

911
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,920
it is monotonous, and it isn't as fun to make your way

912
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,840
through maybe the slower parts of the game.

913
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,760
This is the case with this.

914
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,240
I have my big key, and I'm swinging into these things,

915
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,880
and there's not a ton of precision to it,

916
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,480
and it gets very boring, very fast,

917
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,440
and there's a lot of these characters everywhere.

918
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,320
The whole game is the heartless.

919
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,920
If you didn't like this at the beginning,

920
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,000
you're in a lot of trouble.

921
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
You're in a lot of trouble,

922
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,760
because they're everywhere, they're in the town,

923
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,800
and I went, I don't know about this at all.

924
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,360
I don't think the story could maintain me

925
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,000
playing the whole game like this.

926
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,720
Now, maybe they figured out more.

927
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm sure the controls are different,

928
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,280
and maybe more satisfying in the future games,

929
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,480
but the actual action of playing, I was like,

930
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,360
I don't like this.

931
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,040
I would stop playing this if it wasn't for work.

932
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,880
Are you?

933
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,120
This is your work.

934
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,640
Did you get to a point where Goofy and Donald show up?

935
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,760
Yes, yeah, yeah.

936
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,480
I got to that point, but it was,

937
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,400
or again, early in the game,

938
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,040
and I fought a lot of these characters.

939
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,560
I fought a lot of these little characters

940
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,600
in an unsatisfying way.

941
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,360
Video games, and I'm not an ex.

942
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,440
This isn't, how did this, what is it called now?

943
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,280
Get played?

944
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,120
I'm not this guy.

945
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,440
I'm not a pro gamer, but you take,

946
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
when you see a game that's figured out

947
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,640
its controls like the Arkham games,

948
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,120
the Arkham games are amazing.

949
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,240
I don't know if you, you know what I'm talking about,

950
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
Scott, these, these.

951
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,520
I haven't played them.

952
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,240
The Arkham games figured out a system

953
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,160
now that it's been copied by almost every superhero game

954
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,680
that's come out after the Spider-Man games.

955
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,960
The most satisfying way to fight is Batman.

956
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,000
There's a rhythm to it.

957
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,720
It sort of like time slows down a little bit,

958
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,320
and you lock on, and you can do these massive,

959
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,400
crazy combos fighting like eight guys at once

960
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,440
versus Batman Forever on Super Nintendo.

961
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,200
Pretty boring, pretty bad controls.

962
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,080
That was a game I couldn't figure out

963
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,360
how to get out of the first room.

964
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,040
Yeah, I mean, it's a bad game in general.

965
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,000
There's obviously much better fighting games,

966
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
but even when you play the old turtle games

967
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,520
on Nintendo or whatever, you're like,

968
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,800
okay, we've got, you get the point of it,

969
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,560
but there's so much variation on like the fighting system

970
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,240
for the Arkham games, and you get,

971
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,080
you add like gadgets to it.

972
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
You add moves to it.

973
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,120
There's like skill in like building up hits,

974
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,480
where like if you don't get hit, you build up more.

975
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,360
So there's so much variation on the fighting,

976
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,200
and it's almost endlessly entertaining.

977
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,120
You can fight, you can just head on punch people

978
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,360
and beat them up, or you can hang from the rafters.

979
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,320
There's so much, like, I only start,

980
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,760
I start to like get very tired in my old age

981
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,800
if I don't immediately enjoy the controls

982
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,280
and the actual action of the game.

983
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,960
I am realizing, for Genesis,

984
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,600
I played the Batman Forever game a lot,

985
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,120
because I was trying, I was like mesmerized by the,

986
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,440
I will say hostile aesthetic.

987
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,560
Oh, it's unpleasant.

988
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,400
Yeah, yeah.

989
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,240
I have it for Superintendent,

990
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,600
I have it if you wanna play it.

991
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Oh, I do.

992
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,800
I just could not stop looking at it,

993
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,680
and I think it was just cool to have a Batman game,

994
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,880
and I'm pretty sure I found it in a remainder bin

995
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,360
or at a used store for very little money.

996
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,240
So that was a big part of the appeal.

997
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,520
I dug through those remainder bins,

998
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,080
because you would find weird stuff.

999
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,640
I loved the 7-Up game, where you played as a spy.

1000
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,920
It was so fun.

1001
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
That game was fun.

1002
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,560
Batman Forever was like similar to Mortal Kombat

1003
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,880
when it came out, it was very innovative,

1004
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,160
because it was like kind of,

1005
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,400
they had recorded human beings, basically,

1006
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,320
so it looked a little more real, quote unquote realistic,

1007
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,680
versus Street Fighter, which was purely animated,

1008
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,560
or whatever the term would be for a video game.

1009
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,280
And Batman Forever felt like Mortal Kombat,

1010
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,520
but I feel like it looked worse,

1011
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,920
and it played badly.

1012
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,960
They shot real people with the lost highway filter.

1013
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,760
The stuff that people say is like,

1014
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
oh, that's David Lynchy,

1015
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,960
and it's always the most basic surface level reading.

1016
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,800
The weird stuff, that's where the Batman Forever was like,

1017
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,920
people, but kinda.

1018
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,240
And I don't know the making of it,

1019
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,280
but yeah, you could be fooled into thinking

1020
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,920
it looked good maybe at the time,

1021
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,240
because it looked a little different than things,

1022
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,720
but playing it was, you'd have to really like,

1023
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,760
be honest with yourself and be like, this sucks.

1024
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,600
Yeah.

1025
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,720
It sucks for a lot of reasons.

1026
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,080
Well, let's keep plowing, because there's,

1027
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,280
I know we get so excited when there's anything else still,

1028
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,640
oh, I know something we can talk about for 50 minutes

1029
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,880
that's not this, but the sooner we get it done.

1030
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,720
Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right,

1031
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,560
we gotta do this.

1032
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,560
So, all right, the Heartless, all,

1033
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,720
and then it separates this group of three friends,

1034
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,520
and Sora, in the midst of this, ends up with his weapon,

1035
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,920
the Keyblade, it's a big sword that is also a key,

1036
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,800
that also has a dangly with a Mickey Mouse ear on it.

1037
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,200
We should also say Sora is like,

1038
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,880
kind of Disney bounding as Mickey.

1039
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,000
Yes, yeah.

1040
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
His outfit is like, the color scheme of Mickey.

1041
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,880
Red shorts, yellow shoes,

1042
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,040
because they think they wanted Mickey

1043
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,080
to be the main character,

1044
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,080
but then Disney would not allow violence to be happening,

1045
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,640
administered by the characters,

1046
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
which factors into the rest of it.

1047
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,440
That's 30s Mickey, where he's like,

1048
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
picking up cones left and right.

1049
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
Where he's hunting and poisoning people.

1050
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,800
You know, when he was in the comic strip,

1051
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,280
read by like 30 million people a day.

1052
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,600
Also, the violence in this game is a guy swinging a big key

1053
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,720
around some little clouds, like little dark clouds.

1054
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,760
Like it's not.

1055
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,480
Yeah, I would not call this a particular.

1056
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,360
It's not like Mickey in an Arkham City game,

1057
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
where he's pounding the shit out of like,

1058
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,720
prisoners skulls on the ground,

1059
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,280
like driving their necks into the concrete.

1060
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,480
Like that's not what Mickey would be doing in this game.

1061
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
So I don't know.

1062
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,640
It's all fairly magical.

1063
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,640
And we're purely, it's like, island and keys and magic.

1064
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,440
And then all of a sudden,

1065
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
22 minutes into what I was watching,

1066
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
probably longer if you, much longer if you played it.

1067
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,320
Now suddenly look, it's Cinderella Castle.

1068
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,840
Why?

1069
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,360
And now suddenly we're with Donald and Goofy.

1070
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,200
And briefly at the beginning, Minnie and Daisy.

1071
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes.

1072
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
And we don't really get why.

1073
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,000
I would say that the why of the nymph waves,

1074
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,480
plus the Disney characters,

1075
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
I don't think there is a why.

1076
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,760
It just is.

1077
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,600
No.

1078
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,440
They're together.

1079
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,280
That's kind of a thing I always appreciate

1080
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,160
about Kingdom Hearts, is that they played it straight.

1081
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,720
If they're under the sea,

1082
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,840
if they're in the Lion King or the Hundred Acre Woods,

1083
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,520
like you just accept it and you move on.

1084
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,120
Well, like a Mickey's Christmas Carol,

1085
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,560
which obviously that's a famous story,

1086
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,320
but it's like, there's no like, here's how they got here.

1087
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,880
And I don't think, that actually I think doesn't show up.

1088
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,600
Three Musketeers Mickey shows up in one of them.

1089
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,600
But yeah, like even the Ghostbuster short that we all like,

1090
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,720
it's not like there's some backstory of why,

1091
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
why are these guys doing this?

1092
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,080
Wait, you mean the Mickey cartoon?

1093
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,840
Yeah, the one Donald Goofy and Mickey are all busting ghosts

1094
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,760
in that old cartoon, which I loved as a kid.

1095
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,760
But it's not like there's any, like what, why?

1096
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,680
Yeah, I guess you don't want that, but I still am.

1097
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,800
Oh, it's confusing as hell.

1098
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,880
I think it's jarring to go to and that, wait, okay,

1099
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,360
Donald is a wizard.

1100
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,400
Goofy's a, he commands a guard.

1101
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,040
But it is, it's just a little more,

1102
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,240
it's a little weirder than those other setups.

1103
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,080
But I'm just saying there is some precedent

1104
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,400
for these characters to just be all of a sudden

1105
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
the reality of what they're doing is just given to you

1106
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,520
and not explained.

1107
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,360
Yes, that's true.

1108
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,840
But this is maybe the weirdest scenario where you go,

1110
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,680
wait, what?

1111
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I would say so.

1112
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,800
They get, they're wondering where the king is.

1113
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,640
Yeah.

1114
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,920
I mean, I think if you're playing the game,

1115
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,520
I think the reveal is after a very long time,

1116
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
the king is Mickey.

1117
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,560
Yeah.

1118
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,440
But we might as well just say Mickey is the king.

1119
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,680
Yeah, you know it,

1120
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,720
because everyone refers to him as King Mickey.

1121
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,960
They do say King Mickey earlier,

1122
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
but there's a little tease of like who he is.

1123
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,280
Uh-huh, right?

1124
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,840
Well, he refers to, in his letter, he writes to Minnie.

1125
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,400
So you're like, well, if he's talking about Minnie,

1126
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,640
then probably.

1127
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,720
Seems likely.

1128
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,120
Yeah, I just know it's like a moment

1129
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,280
when then he shows up.

1130
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,480
Right, right.

1131
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,440
I don't know, I haven't seen all of it, so I don't know.

1132
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,840
I guess I just meant in people making videos

1133
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,080
about Kingdom Hearts.

1134
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,680
Yeah, that's fully- Everyone's on the same page.

1135
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,960
We're calling him King Mickey.

1136
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1137
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,720
But I think if you play it, it's like, oh shit,

1138
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,000
like at the end of Star Wars, Hullabaloo,

1139
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,920
whatever the fuck.

1140
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,760
Yeah.

1141
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,600
Fuck Mickey.

1142
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,960
Well, that's a little more exciting.

1143
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,040
Well, that's the most exciting thing that's occurred ever.

1144
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,360
Because he dances.

1145
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,000
Through a letter, they discover that Mickey left in a hurry

1146
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,040
and left them orders to travel the worlds

1147
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,880
and find a certain key.

1148
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,880
So Sora got a key, and I guess the key came from,

1149
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,200
no, it didn't come from Mickey, he just knows it's out there.

1150
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,000
So Donald and Goofy go find a key.

1151
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,720
It's somewhere in the worlds.

1152
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,160
What are, are we on planets, or are we just on-

1153
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,480
We are on planets.

1154
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,400
It is planets.

1155
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,160
I think, because they get in a ship.

1156
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Because they're in the ship.

1157
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes.

1158
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,840
Oh, the gummy ships.

1159
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,680
The gummy ships.

1160
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,920
They're in a gummy ship.

1161
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,080
They travel, so, I mean,

1162
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,880
this would be a little more to be said, I guess,

1163
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,040
but mainly Goofy and Donald travel from world to world

1164
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,640
in a gummy ship.

1165
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,440
And I saw that in a Wikipedia, and like,

1166
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,680
oh, so this ties in gummy bears.

1167
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,560
No, no, it's a gummy ship.

1168
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,080
Is that because it bounces?

1169
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,200
Like, gummy berries make you, no.

1170
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
It is called the gummy ship.

1171
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,040
Why?

1172
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,880
Because it's made of gummy blocks.

1173
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,240
What do gummy blocks do?

1174
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't, what do you want from me?

1175
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,840
Stop it.

1176
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,120
Stop the third degree.

1177
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,080
Do you feel the same way?

1178
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,960
What's gummy?

1179
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,800
Why is it gummy?

1180
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,640
I don't know.

1181
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
I have probably, out of three of us,

1182
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
watched the most anime.

1183
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,840
And I have, when I was young,

1184
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,040
I watched a lot of hours of Dragon Ball Z.

1185
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,960
And that takes dozens, in some cases,

1186
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,880
maybe hundreds of episodes to like,

1187
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,280
wrap up a storyline.

1188
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
So, I'm willing to suspend some disbelief.

1189
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,200
But I found this all very perplexing.

1190
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,840
Looking at it from the outside.

1191
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,520
You did too, even with anime.

1192
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,480
You still wonder why.

1193
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,840
You wanna know why it's a gummy ship?

1194
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,680
Yeah.

1195
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,520
They just like, I don't, yeah, is it like,

1196
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,760
I guess, because Chip and Dale maintain the gummy ship.

1197
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,120
Yes, they launched the ship.

1198
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,960
They launched the gummy ship.

1199
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
Chip and Dale get them already on the gummy ship.

1200
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,680
Yes.

1201
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,160
But it's not like it go,

1202
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,320
like it's not.

1203
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,160
It's just a ship.

1204
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,980
It's a ship.

1205
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,820
It's sort of normal.

1206
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,240
I guess it kind of looks a little more like,

1207
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,760
it could be gelatinous.

1208
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,600
Yeah, but I don't think,

1209
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,240
when you see the inside,

1210
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,200
I think it's all just normal gear.

1211
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,040
Yeah, so.

1212
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,560
And by the way, we're in like a fairy tale realm

1213
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,520
with castles, but then we got a rocket in play.

1214
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,560
Well, also the game there turns into like,

1215
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,280
an actual like, kind of Star Fox or something as well.

1216
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,200
So you do get to like, shoot from the gummy ship,

1217
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,160
which changes the format of the game.

1218
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,720
You fly the ship. In between those levels.

1219
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah.

1220
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,840
And it also looks different.

1221
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,840
It looks like a completely different game.

1222
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,680
Cheaper too.

1223
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,720
It's a 100% different game.

1224
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,960
Scott, let me try and get you back on board.

1225
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,660
And I'm going outside of the first one,

1226
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,900
but did you know that Kingdom Hearts Coded

1227
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,840
starts with Jiminy Cricket trying to figure out

1228
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,300
what happened to his journal?

1229
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,080
I cannot imagine higher stakes.

1230
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,720
Jiminy Cricket's journal,

1231
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,240
this bad guy, he controls the destiny.

1232
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,480
He's the conscience of characters.

1233
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,600
He's got to know where his journal is.

1234
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,480
Where all his inspiring thoughts are.

1235
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,320
Is it a dream?

1236
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,520
Ideas for songs too.

1237
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,920
That's a good point.

1238
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Is it a dream at the end? Do we know?

1239
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,400
Unclear.

1240
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,800
Jiminy, there's a weird part of in the cut scenes,

1241
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,440
it's like, okay, so Goofy and Donald,

1242
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,740
you have to go into the different worlds

1243
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,880
and find the key blade, okay?

1244
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,380
And guess who's coming with you?

1245
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,060
Someone to record all of it.

1246
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,240
And it's Jiminy Cricket.

1247
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,320
And then as far as I can tell,

1248
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,680
Jiminy Cricket doesn't show up again for hours.

1249
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
He's not around?

1250
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,440
Way later.

1251
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
And then he shows up and seems to know Pinocchio,

1252
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,280
but he's not in Pinocchio world.

1253
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,120
He's in Kingdom World.

1254
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,360
Here's what I'll say about this in general.

1255
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,360
I don't know that all the famous Disney characters

1256
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,480
are utilized to their full potential.

1257
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,880
You mean they don't exhibit any qualities

1258
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,400
that are what you expect out of them?

1259
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,320
Yeah.

1260
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,360
Because in theory, you go,

1261
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,160
oh my gosh, all the characters are in this.

1262
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,480
This is awesome.

1263
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,800
And then it's basically like,

1264
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,680
you're walking by a statue of them at the Disney store.

1265
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,440
Yes.

1266
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,240
Yeah, like what, you know, I've always wanted to know,

1267
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,480
what if Donald and Goofy weren't funny?

1268
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,480
What if they talked and just said like,

1269
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,400
but the keyhole is gonna open.

1270
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,760
We don't have much time.

1271
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,600
There's something,

1272
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,680
did Donald say something about

1273
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,520
smiles powering the ship or something?

1274
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,360
Not sure.

1275
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,400
I think he said something about like smiles.

1276
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,920
I was trying to do the Donald again.

1277
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,560
I still can't.

1278
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,400
I saw a.

1279
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,640
That was the best I can do.

1280
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,760
You have two words with it.

1281
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,920
I saw a cut scene where Donald said to Goofy,

1282
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,120
oh, what do you,

1283
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,920
oh no, that's Mickey, shit.

1284
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,560
Oh, what. That was your Donald.

1285
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah.

1286
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,240
Oh, what do you know, you big Palooka?

1287
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,480
That's pretty funny.

1288
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,320
That's pretty good.

1289
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
Yeah.

1290
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,760
Yeah, there's some, I mean, they're trying,

1291
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,320
Donald and Goofy have some spirit of the character,

1292
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,400
at least, like it's Bill Farmer doing the voice.

1293
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,200
There's a big thing about the whole thing.

1294
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,480
It is big voice central.

1295
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,520
It's real voices.

1296
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,360
It's Bill Farmer.

1297
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,200
It's Tony and Selmo and throughout,

1298
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,800
I don't know if we should reveal characters.

1299
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,640
Oh sure, yeah.

1300
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,520
But like, I mean, whatever, we could say them as well.

1301
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,560
But it's like, it's pretty stacked in line.

1302
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,200
It is like, this is another venue to hear

1303
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,160
in some cases, it's like,

1304
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,840
it's a voice of Alice in Wonderland.

1305
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,680
Yeah, right.

1306
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,480
From the 50s, but now in this video game.

1307
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,200
And again, saying exposition.

1308
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,880
It is nothing but. Yeah, not a fun use.

1309
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,200
Just like, just get you from point B to C.

1310
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,680
Pretty much.

1311
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,160
Does this sound like it's in Mickey's voice?

1312
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,320
This is the letter he sends to get the plot going.

1313
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,280
We need that key or we're doomed.

1314
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,040
So go to Traverse Town and find Leon.

1315
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,160
Which they do.

1316
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,080
Then Goofy at some point in this says,

1317
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,280
well, we gotta protect the world order.

1318
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,080
Yes, that's, I wrote that down.

1319
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,080
It's like, what?

1320
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,800
Seems like something Goofy could wrap his head around.

1321
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,240
The world order, Goofy.

1322
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,400
That sounds like some Alex Jones conspiracy.

1323
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,480
Yeah, that's a bit.

1324
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,240
Well, figure out who you're not allowed to criticize.

1325
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,240
And Leon, is the character from Final Fantasy VIII?

1326
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,640
You're asking the wrong people.

1327
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,640
I'm reasonably certain when I was looking up other cameos.

1328
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,680
What do you know?

1329
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,920
I know that he's David Boreanis.

1330
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,000
It is all of the most dynamic voice, pure voices.

1331
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,160
David Boreanis, David Gallagher.

1332
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,680
What voices are more exciting than this?

1333
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,720
From the doll, all the all stars of the WB circa 2000.

1334
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,520
I know Boreanis' voice anywhere.

1335
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,040
Final Fantasy II, Leon, it says is from Final Fantasy II?

1336
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Geez, well, they're coming from everywhere.

1337
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,680
Eight, two, what's next, seven?

1338
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,320
Oh wait, the character Squall Leonhart from Final Fantasy VIII,

1339
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,480
who is known as Leon in the Kingdom Hearts series.

1340
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,320
There we go.

1341
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,520
So that's what you're talking about.

1342
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,440
So Leon is Squall Leonhart.

1343
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,640
Squall Leonhart.

1344
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,080
Great.

1345
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,160
There's a lot of knots out there, but this one is.

1346
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,280
He is Leon.

1347
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,240
So it's like, if Jason were in Final Fantasy II,

1348
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,240
then it would be like, I'm trying to think Jason Hart,

1349
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,440
Rogue Jason Hart. Jason Patch.

1350
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,120
You might know Jason from Final Fantasy II,

1351
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,080
but Rogue Jason Patch is the same character

1352
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,280
from Final Fantasy VIII.

1353
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,560
Great.

1354
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,800
So yeah, so Donald and Goofy,

1355
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,680
basically they use the Gummi ship to go to Traverse Town

1356
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,120
and they find Sora who's drifted there

1357
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,880
from his destroyed world.

1358
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,280
And they realize that his key blade is the key

1359
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,120
that the king, Mickey, ordered him to follow

1360
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,720
and the three become a team

1361
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,080
and they begin wandering together.

1362
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,760
Okay, I hate to stop in the middle

1363
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,800
of that riveting sentence you just said.

1364
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,160
Please stop as many, let's all stop a lot.

1365
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,200
The aesthetic of the Disney characters is sort of similar.

1366
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Like they're wearing, like I would say, like very,

1367
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,000
not steampunk, but like futuristic-y versions

1368
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,240
of their own outfits, not dissimilar to some of the outfits

1369
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,440
that you would see at Tokyo Disney,

1370
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,080
see the characters that Mickey and friends wearing.

1371
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,520
Oh yeah, like fancy colorful royal clothes.

1372
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,720
Yes, but yeah, like they feel like a little bit different,

1373
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,360
a little future-y or something.

1374
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,200
It's still their color schemes.

1375
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,480
Like I said, it's complicated zippers.

1376
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,240
Donald has a zipper on his hat.

1377
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,840
Goofy has boy band pants.

1378
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,440
He looks like he's in SYNC's pop era.

1379
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Which was happening at this time.

1380
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,960
Right around this time.

1381
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,680
But it's future, everything's future.

1382
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,080
It's a little bit futuristic too.

1383
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,240
It's like a futuristic Cinderella's castle

1384
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,800
and that's why they're in like a spaceship and whatever.

1385
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,760
But then also like there's a lot of gears around as well.

1386
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah, yeah.

1387
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,200
There's a lot of gears.

1388
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,320
So there's some steampunky type things.

1389
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Staffs and chains.

1390
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,440
Stuff you could render in a PlayStation 2 engine

1391
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,440
and then really embellish in like covers and guides

1392
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,800
and supplemental material.

1393
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,160
Oh, they look immaculate in those forms

1394
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,080
and then everything's just really pointy.

1395
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,520
A little more simplified.

1396
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,640
It was sort of, I remember when Final Fantasy VII

1397
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,200
was at its peak and the cut scenes looked so cool.

1398
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,000
And when you watched actual gameplay,

1399
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,320
everyone was real tiny.

1400
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,160
Like everyone was real little.

1401
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,960
Yes, you're right.

1402
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,240
And I, as a 12 year old was like, what the,

1403
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,920
what is going on?

1404
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,240
So many times it would be like you get excited

1405
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,440
because of the cut scenes you would see

1406
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,640
and then you would see the game and you go,

1407
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,080
well, the cut scenes look a hundred times better.

1408
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,080
And I remember just, I don't remember what the first one was.

1409
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,560
Maybe it was a Resident Evil or something

1410
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,200
where it was like the cut scenes look as good

1411
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,720
as the gameplay.

1412
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,200
And that was like, holy shit.

1413
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,040
Wow.

1414
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,880
They finally did it.

1415
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,720
It's like recent Kingdom Hearts.

1416
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,880
It almost is like, it's pretty even between.

1417
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,720
Yeah.

1418
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,560
Oh yeah.

1419
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,840
I'll get to recent.

1420
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,360
I'll get to it in a couple of years with this rate.

1421
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,200
False promise.

1422
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,040
At this rate.

1423
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,320
You're gonna go, you're gonna play all.

1424
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,160
You know what I wanna watch?

1425
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,560
I wanna watch Tulsa King, which is the Stallone show

1426
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,720
in the set in the Yellowstone universe.

1427
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,560
Oh.

1428
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,840
I didn't realize that.

1429
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,680
Oh.

1430
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,440
I believe it's in the Yellowstone universe.

1431
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,280
Wow.

1432
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,160
There's a Harrison Ford, like spin-off

1433
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,680
Yellowstone reverse, I think.

1434
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,360
And I believe Tulsa King is in,

1435
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,920
which is Sylvester Stallone as a mob boss going to Tulsa.

1436
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,320
I believe, sorry if I'm wrong,

1437
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,840
I believe it's all in the Sheridan verse,

1438
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,520
the Taylor Sheridan verse.

1439
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,040
Careful.

1440
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,600
We're gonna get real confused

1441
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,000
if you start using that a lot.

1442
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,520
Not the Jason Sheridan verse.

1443
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,360
Oh.

1444
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,440
And not a not.

1445
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,640
The Taylor Swift verse, you can't do Taylor.

1446
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,080
No, no.

1447
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,920
That's a different thing.

1448
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,160
So many Taylors that are,

1449
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,920
she plays all of them in that commercial.

1450
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,200
How do you keep those straight?

1451
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,400
She's the problem and she had versions of her in the video.

1452
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,520
The scary one who wore black.

1453
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,360
I haven't gotten into that.

1454
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,440
Reputation.

1455
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,760
I don't, I haven't gotten into the album

1456
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,880
as much as I did gotten into Evermore.

1457
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,320
I don't think it's as good as Evermore,

1458
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,040
but there's some cooks in there.

1459
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,680
There's so much to get through.

1460
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,040
But I'm flirting with the idea

1461
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,760
of just starting at Tulsa King.

1462
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,200
Next, cause this comes out next.

1463
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,400
It will, this is, it'll be out by the time this comes out,

1464
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,440
but I'm flirting with the idea of it.

1465
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,960
But I know by the way,

1466
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,600
I don't remember where I started with this thought.

1467
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
It's gonna be a lot of those.

1468
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,440
We don't remember.

1469
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,280
I thought you were gonna just keep.

1470
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,560
You were in Traverse Town.

1471
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
I don't remember where I,

1472
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,040
look, I haven't slept that much this week.

1473
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,560
You get so excited when any other words pop up.

1474
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,520
Tulsa King, Tulsa King.

1475
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
Oh, Tulsa, interesting.

1476
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,920
Oklahoma, I saw the Oklahoma City Thunder.

1477
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,600
Did you know?

1478
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,560
Basketball's fun cause the guys fly so high and they dunk.

1479
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,240
And one time Michael Jordan was in Space Jam.

1480
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,360
We'll do anything, anything, but we have to, okay.

1481
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,000
How much further do we have to go?

1482
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,840
I don't know.

1483
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,120
We were barely started.

1484
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,960
I know.

1485
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,280
But I guess it's, we have to define what the plot means

1486
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,560
because the plot doesn't mean we have to talk about everything.

1487
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,360
The plot is, look, the worlds, they just go to the worlds.

1488
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,960
It's our choice what we say.

1489
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,880
The main thing is Donald is a wizard.

1490
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,520
Goofy is a Royal Guardsman and they find Sora,

1491
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,160
the Wapethnimp from the island.

1492
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,480
And he once needs to find Riku and Kairi, I think.

1493
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,840
And he has the key blade.

1494
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,520
And the key blade is going to come in handy.

1495
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,480
A, for smacking people and heartless.

1496
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,560
And B, because there's key holes

1497
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,960
and the heartless travel through the key holes.

1498
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,080
And we have to seal the key holes.

1499
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,320
And we need to say the word key hole as many times

1500
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,760
as possible to where everyone's wondering,

1501
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,840
why does key hole sound so weird to me?

1502
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,080
And it's not until three hours through this, you go,

1503
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,960
oh, cause it rhymes with pee hole.

1504
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,640
So that is why key hole has been just like,

1505
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,960
wow, just bumping against my brain this entire time.

1506
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,720
So the more you hear like, garsh, the key, seal the key hole.

1507
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,560
I, you know, you do,

1508
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,960
you're putting that into my head for the first time now.

1509
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,800
And now my world will never be the same.

1510
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,640
Can't unhear it.

1511
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,840
Wow, really?

1512
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
I'm hearing of this for the first time.

1513
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,840
You're telling me this for the first time.

1514
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,880
Well, the heartless, they've done a lot, you know,

1515
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,240
and they, I think I'm very sad to hear that the,

1516
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,160
the key hole has been sealed up.

1517
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,960
And it's very bad what we've done to those heartless.

1518
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,160
It's bad what we've done.

1519
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,600
What we've done is very bad.

1520
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,840
And don't even get me started on the nobodies.

1521
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,680
The nobodies don't even come to play in this one.

1522
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,520
Can someone edit the video,

1523
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,960
I forget what you're Kingdom Hearts,

1524
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,400
the video where Goofy dies in Kingdom Hearts

1525
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,080
with the Trump reaction.

1526
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,800
This was another thing.

1527
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,880
This was also in the air recently.

1528
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,440
This went around where someone's like,

1529
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,520
hey, this happens in Kingdom Hearts.

1530
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,400
And it's just Goofy just getting domed by like a giant rock.

1531
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,160
And then Mickey throws off his cloak and pull,

1532
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,960
like does the Arthur clenched fist

1533
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,000
and then pulls off his cloak and he has a key blade.

1534
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,840
I've got it.

1535
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,360
It's not from the game, but we need,

1536
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,120
I think we need this as sustenance for the rest.

1537
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,080
So look, Mickey doesn't,

1538
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,760
you don't really get to see a lot of Mickey

1539
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,600
in Kingdom Hearts one,

1540
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,640
but this is in Kingdom Hearts two and it rules.

1541
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,320
It's a bit of a long one, but I think we all need it.

1542
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,960
So I guess we better all pull together

1543
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,440
and finish this battle for good.

1544
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,280
He looks like Darth.

1545
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,440
Yes, your majesty.

1546
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,480
Yes, your majesty.

1547
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,520
He looks like Darth Vader, but he's good.

1548
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,480
Right.

1549
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,800
And then a big, then up above a cliff, a big rock falls.

1550
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,280
Look out.

1551
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,320
Dives.

1552
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,120
Bean trying to save King Mickey.

1553
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,120
Don't know, don't know what that.

1554
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,760
This is not happening.

1555
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Getting to see the moment of Donald watching Goofy's death.

1556
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,080
Going through the denial stage of grief.

1557
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,320
And then you get this.

1558
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,040
I think this is the main reason we've been sent

1559
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,640
on any of this because we really liked

1560
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,600
Agro Mickey going, oh yeah.

1561
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,440
Guards in the Splashtacular show.

1562
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,040
And this does not disappoint, vengeful, violent Mickey.

1563
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:11,040
They'll pay for this.

1564
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,960
He looks so mad.

1565
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,040
Keyblade.

1566
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,040
And then you just, at the end of it,

1567
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,600
they just linger on dead Goofy.

1568
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,360
I think he turns out to not be dead, but it's all,

1569
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,480
I mean, that's worth the journey,

1570
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,200
but it's not in this game, guys.

1571
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,360
It's in two.

1572
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,680
We're in one.

1573
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,120
In one, we have to go meet Leon and Areth.

1574
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,480
I don't, I just don't have a lot of notes about this.

1575
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,680
What's important to know about Leon and Areth?

1576
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,520
Anything?

1577
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,680
If no, if it doesn't occur to anybody

1578
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,040
in the next three seconds and we move on.

1579
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,720
We can move on.

1580
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,080
Great, okay, so the thing is,

1581
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,120
once we get past Traverse Town,

1582
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,360
then you start going to different worlds

1583
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,560
via the Gummi Ship.

1584
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,680
And the different worlds are all different worlds

1585
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,160
from Disney movies.

1586
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,720
I don't know if there's a set order,

1587
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,640
and the one that I watched, there's Wonderland.

1588
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,160
We go to Wonderland, real voice of Alice.

1589
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,040
There's so many, you have a century

1590
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,840
after doing the voice of Alice, incredible.

1591
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,600
But it might be more fun if it wasn't like,

1592
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,800
then you end up in like a sham trial

1593
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,160
presided over by the Queen of Hearts,

1594
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,240
who needs, ends up being like,

1595
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,840
bring me evidence of Alice's innocence.

1596
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,400
Four pieces of evidence,

1597
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,480
but one will be tricky to find.

1598
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,160
So now you have to wander,

1599
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,080
wander Wonderland looking for evidence.

1600
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,720
Yes, I know, I watched this part.

1601
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,200
I didn't get here in the game, but I watched this

1602
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,320
and I felt like, oh, that it's gonna be as monotonous

1603
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,720
as finding the fish in the ocean.

1604
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,360
Boxes, not even, I don't.

1605
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,320
They're so, oh, God.

1606
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,040
It was so boring and I was so,

1607
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,640
and I know I'm spoiled by modern games.

1608
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,960
Like the last Zelda,

1609
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,720
you get all this different fruit and vegetables

1610
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,760
and you can like cook up different meals

1611
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,800
and it gives you different things.

1612
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,760
Like there's so much and Alice is like,

1613
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,680
oh, you gotta go and find some fish.

1614
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,760
Find the evidence.

1615
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,920
I know it's old. Alice in Wonderland, Alice,

1616
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,600
you know Alice in Wonderland,

1617
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,560
who goes on the crazy adventures in Croquet.

1618
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,160
And no, now it's a trial and you are,

1619
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,840
I know you just got here, but you're her defense attorney.

1620
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,040
The read. You need to go find the evidence in Wonderland.

1621
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,040
Ignore the magical creatures you see.

1622
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
You are looking for boxes of evidence.

1623
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,160
Box of evidence.

1624
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,960
And the land, when you're walking,

1625
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,240
like you're traveling,

1626
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,680
and again, this is the limitations of the graphics.

1627
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,280
I am sorry, but it looks like you're going to some,

1628
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,760
like you ever go to like a kid's birthday party

1629
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,640
at like some sort of family fun center.

1630
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,400
And there's like, they got like trees painted on the walls.

1631
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
And it's just like, yeah, I can tell

1632
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
they put some effort into this,

1633
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,120
but there's not a lot of theming.

1634
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,120
That's what it feels like being in the Alice in Wonderland

1635
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,800
world in the game.

1636
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,920
There's not a lot of excitement that you're there.

1637
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,920
You see the card, the card guards, whatever you call them.

1638
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,440
Well, you get to see the Cheshire cat who does not speak.

1639
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,280
There is not a voice for him.

1640
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,920
Some characters are just thought bubbles.

1641
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,480
And whoa, the Cheshire cat.

1642
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,640
Wow. What does the Cheshire cat do?

1643
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,560
Well, he does appear in the magical way,

1644
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,560
but then you get to see him talk to Sora, the 12 year old.

1645
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,520
And the dialogue is this.

1646
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,160
Now he can save Alice.

1647
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,360
Don't be so sure.

1648
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,800
She may be innocent, but what about you?

1649
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,840
What do you mean?

1650
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,240
I won't tell, but I will give you something.

1651
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,960
And then a full frame thing says, attained the power of ice.

1652
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,240
What?

1653
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,200
Why have ice?

1654
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
Why is that gonna help?

1655
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,040
Worse.

1656
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,680
I'm at trial now.

1657
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,680
And then you do present evidence.

1658
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,040
And then she just says off with your heads anyway,

1659
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,840
because you're being insolent for having found the evidence.

1660
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,200
The thing you told me to do,

1661
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,520
but then you get to fight the cards, which I like.

1662
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,120
I like that you get to see Donald fighting the cards.

1663
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,520
Yeah, I like that's good.

1664
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,600
It's still the same play mechanics.

1665
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,200
So frustrating.

1666
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,320
But at least it's the cards.

1667
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,960
Like it's not like you fight cards the whole game.

1668
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,680
At least there's some novelty of like,

1669
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,680
oh wow, I get to fight the famous cards.

1670
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,240
Yeah, it's one of them to fight the cards.

1671
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,200
You get to see them really swing those spades down.

1672
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,920
Yeah, so Donald and Goofy are fighting with you

1673
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,280
alongside you.

1674
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,800
Yes, they don't, you don't have,

1675
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,680
don't control them.

1676
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,000
You're only Sora.

1677
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,120
You're Sora.

1678
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,080
They have, and they can't really fight much.

1679
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,800
They can't be violent because this is Disney.

1680
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,320
Right, and this is my number one thing I wrote down

1681
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,160
when I'm watching this.

1682
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,600
And I'm like, if I was a kid, I'd be like,

1683
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,640
I want to play as Donald and Goofy.

1684
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,960
I don't know Sora is.

1685
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,200
This is my complaint about like all the focus on like,

1686
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,760
you're the superhero.

1687
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,720
And I'm like, no.

1688
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,000
No.

1689
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,440
Just make me Spider-Man.

1690
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,640
I want to be Spider-Man.

1691
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,720
Yeah.

1692
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,840
I suck.

1693
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,960
I'm nobody.

1694
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,400
Didn't Walt Disney learn this 50 years ago?

1695
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,200
It's exactly the same lesson from the Dark Brides

1696
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
that they had changed.

1697
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,120
I just want to see the main people.

1698
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,640
You're Alice on the journey, or not Alice,

1699
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,200
but you're Snow White on it.

1700
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,760
And it's like, no, they want to see Snow White.

1701
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,960
They know they're not Snow White.

1702
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,000
You get to see Goofy hold a shield next to you

1703
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,160
while you fight as you, Sora.

1704
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,280
I like that idea, but I want to be Mickey fighting then.

1705
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,120
Yep.

1706
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:18,940
No, no Mickey.

1707
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:19,780
Mickey is the king.

1708
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,620
He's away.

1709
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,960
He's dealing with the heartless problem.

1710
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,040
Isn't that what I'm doing?

1711
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,880
No.

1712
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,120
Well, it is, but you have to do it in your own way.

1713
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,880
You have the keyblade.

1714
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,680
Mickey's got to try to find another keyblade.

1715
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,520
You know, he's busy.

1716
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,640
Mickey is busy.

1717
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,480
It was.

1718
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,880
He's like the Marvel characters.

1719
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,880
Like the Marvel characters.

1720
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,920
They've got other stuff to do.

1721
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,760
Busy.

1722
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,480
If you like the characters, if you like,

1723
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,200
and I forgot the main characters in the game.

1724
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,040
Sora.

1725
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,880
Sora.

1726
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,040
Sora's the hero.

1727
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,480
I'm sure plenty of people like Sora.

1728
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,800
I don't dislike Sora.

1729
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,640
Don't get me wrong.

1730
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,920
I don't dislike Sora.

1731
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,040
But if I was a kid, do you remember the thrill of playing?

1732
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:57,080
Did you play X-Men, Mutant Apocalypse on Super Nintendo?

1733
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,640
No, I played Clone Wars.

1734
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,480
On Genesis.

1735
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,300
On Genesis.

1736
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,960
Yeah, the ironically named Clone Wars.

1737
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,000
The thrill of being like Gambit,

1738
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,680
one of your favorite characters.

1739
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,160
The thrill I felt at the time when you go,

1740
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,680
oh my God, they're making an X-Men game.

1741
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,680
I'm going to get to play as one of my favorite characters.

1742
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,480
And the disappointment I would have felt at being a kid

1743
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,840
and going, wait a minute, I'm not allowed all the,

1744
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,360
wait, how many Disney characters are there?

1745
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,640
All of them?

1746
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,880
I can't play as any of them?

1747
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,560
They're all next to you.

1748
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,380
What?

1749
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,220
Everyone.

1750
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:30,280
I get to know what it would be like to be near Donald.

1751
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,360
I would drive me absolutely crazy.

1752
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,080
You were saying you are not excited in later games

1753
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,360
that you get missions from Yen Sid.

1754
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,080
The wizard from Disney backwards.

1755
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,920
Yeah.

1756
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,720
Okay, that's a, yeah.

1757
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm sure if I was a kid, maybe I would have played the game

1758
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,760
and I would have liked it and then I would have fell in love

1759
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,400
with all the original characters.

1760
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,040
We like original characters.

1761
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,240
I like that they made new stuff out of it.

1762
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,800
I do like that, but purely first, like a first impression,

1763
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,160
especially if I was a kid, man, I would have been bummed.

1764
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,600
I like later on you fight Maleficent.

1765
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,440
Sure, great.

1766
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,120
Henchman is Pete, big Pete.

1767
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,200
That's funny.

1768
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,600
Is he in this one?

1769
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,480
I thought at the end of this one.

1770
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,600
I didn't see him in this one,

1771
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,440
but I didn't watch everything.

1772
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,280
There are slight differences in the American and the channel.

1773
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,880
I don't know if that's that, but I read it

1774
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,760
because I played like what's called like the final mix

1775
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,120
or something of the first final final final fantasy.

1776
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,640
I'm losing my fucking mind.

1777
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,840
Here's what, I'm very interested

1778
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,120
in what you're about to say.

1779
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,320
However, I have to go to the bathroom

1780
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,960
and I've never done this in an episode.

1781
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,800
I would like you to keep going,

1782
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,280
say whatever you want to say about any of this

1783
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,400
and maybe try to get to one of the other worlds.

1784
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,840
You know what, so this, I'm gonna make this

1785
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,080
a real time bathroom trip.

1786
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,560
Here's the problem is when you probably saw me on my phone,

1787
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,040
I was trying to figure out if the Tulsa King

1788
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,400
is in the Yellowstone universe definitively.

1789
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,160
I'm not gonna, you need to close this out before I leave.

1790
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,600
You need to get back on Kingdom Hearts

1791
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,920
and stay on Kingdom Hearts until I come back.

1792
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,760
Do you hear me?

1793
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,600
I do hear you.

1794
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,400
But finish what you're saying about Tulsa King, that's fine.

1795
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,840
All the articles refer to it as the Sheridan verse,

1796
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,680
but I don't know what that actually means.

1797
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,880
So please don't have a verse, Jason.

1798
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,000
I don't know if that means that it's in actually canon

1799
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,080
that they're in the same universe

1800
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,120
or just means in his like media, his TV empire.

1801
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,080
So it's unclear.

1802
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,160
I hope it is mixed with it

1803
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,800
because I do think I'm gonna try to start with Tulsa King

1804
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,640
in the Sheridan verse.

1805
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,480
Work your way back.

1806
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,300
Maybe work my way back.

1807
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,760
Because Yellowstone, I know is premiering soon as well,

1808
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,120
the season five.

1809
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,520
It's the same logic of like,

1810
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,200
okay, there's a new comic book starting.

1811
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,520
It's a spin-off from this big complex book.

1812
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,360
Correct.

1813
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,440
But this is a good jumping on point.

1814
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,640
Yes, perfect.

1815
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,920
Well, Scott, as you are.

1816
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,560
Okay, you have to talk about Kingdom Hearts

1817
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,720
the whole time I'm gone.

1818
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,720
Make some progress.

1819
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,880
If you wanna get past Tarzan world entirely,

1820
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,080
you have to promise not to do a tangent.

1821
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,720
You have to, I wanna come back when the door open

1822
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,200
because I know you might trick me

1823
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,520
and talk about something else.

1824
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,360
Okay, okay, here's.

1825
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,040
Talk about fucking Randy Gerber or the new guy

1826
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,640
or Green Day.

1827
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,080
But I'm gonna open that door

1828
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,040
and if the sentence I'm hearing is not about Kingdom Hearts.

1829
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,040
That's fair, but I will say this right before.

1830
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,440
Green Day has its own coffee I just was made aware of.

1831
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,680
No, back on track.

1832
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,520
Well, you're here.

1833
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,000
I didn't break the rules.

1834
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,840
But if we break the rules, I might.

1835
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,560
No, I have to pee.

1836
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,400
Let him go, let him go.

1837
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,240
I'm just saying.

1838
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,440
If we break the rules, a couple more ghosts

1839
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,520
we're not allowed to talk about

1840
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,960
in the Haunted Mansion episode next year.

1841
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,000
We can put that down.

1842
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,560
All right, yes, real punishments, good.

1843
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,400
Okay, talking.

1844
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,240
Checking ghosts are not allowed.

1845
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,060
When I open the door,

1846
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,600
the sentence had better be about Kingdom Hearts.

1847
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,440
All right, fine.

1848
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,160
You could jump three worlds if you want.

1849
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,040
There's nothing that I need to be here to say.

1850
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,880
All right, I'm going to the bathroom.

1851
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,720
Go to the bathroom.

1852
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,640
I have to pee too, but I'm gonna hold it for the rest.

1853
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,080
All right, Jason, Jason, what's the next world?

1854
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,520
Is it Hercules world?

1855
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,360
I'm trying to find.

1856
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,920
I also wonder when I believe it's Hercules world.

1857
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,760
I think so, yeah.

1858
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,000
Okay.

1859
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,200
So it gets flicked by Hades at some point.

1860
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,880
Just for the listener for the context,

1861
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,360
as we're recording this, it's about 5.15.

1862
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,040
Daylight savings time has happened.

1863
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,040
So the sun is setting and I'm starting to get cold.

1864
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,880
So that's probably adding.

1865
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,840
Yeah, and there's a barbecue in the distance,

1866
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,640
but we're not allowed to talk about that.

1867
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,040
You see Danny DeVito's character from Hercules.

1868
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,600
Here's the thing about the game that is funny to me,

1869
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,080
especially now seeing the first,

1870
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,640
the cut scenes of the first, the 20 year old game,

1871
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,920
is that there's an awfully long time in between dialogue.

1872
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,560
So do you know what I'm saying?

1873
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,400
Yeah, kind of.

1874
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,040
In a very funny way.

1875
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,320
So it'd be like the Danny DeVito,

1876
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,680
which I don't believe it's Danny DeVito

1877
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,040
doing the voice of his character.

1878
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,960
And I can't think of the character's name.

1879
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,400
He's the shorter, you know what I'm talking about?

1880
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,240
Yeah, I do.

1881
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,960
You're looking at me like you've no acknowledgement

1882
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,800
of what I'm talking about.

1883
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,240
Because I'm trying to think of the character's name.

1884
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,080
Okay, I just wanna make sure you're on the same page.

1885
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:37,920
So keep talking and I'll find it.

1886
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,740
Because there's like some,

1887
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,680
I feel like somebody started up a barbecue grill here

1888
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,880
and I'm inhaling fumes.

1889
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,280
So there's like a pause.

1890
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,640
So basically like how the cut scenes will work

1891
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,400
is like goofy, be like,

1892
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,080
gosh, we gotta protect the new world order.

1893
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,320
Beat, beat, beat.

1894
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,960
And then somebody will go, yes.

1895
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,720
And this happens over and over again.

1896
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,800
And it's obviously, no, it's an older game.

1897
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,960
So they're not rendering, they're not making the game.

1898
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,080
So it's like moving at a blistering pace.

1899
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,840
But it's funny to watch everything

1900
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,720
because you feel like it's in slow motion.

1901
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,680
It feels like you're in molasses.

1902
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,280
And boy, is it slow moving.

1903
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,400
You know what I'm talking about, Jason?

1904
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,880
I know what you're talking about.

1905
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:24,040
Yeah, I was amazed there was as much dialogue as there was.

1906
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,080
Because there's also captions.

1907
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,080
There's text on screen, right?

1908
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,040
Yeah, there's captions.

1909
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,800
And some characters have captions

1910
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,920
and then sometimes it's all dialogue from the characters.

1911
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,520
Sometimes it is just straight up dialogue

1912
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,920
from the characters and it can be inconsistent.

1913
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,280
I mean, like a lot of games are very inconsistent.

1914
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,000
And then even the Nintendo Zelda still uses text captions

1915
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,240
versus using actual...

1916
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,880
Danny DeVito is Phil.

1917
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,280
Phil, thank you.

1918
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,480
Phil Octetes.

1919
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,080
So Phil's like, ah, we gotta move this block.

1920
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,680
Beat, beat, beat.

1921
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,080
And then someone's like, yes.

1922
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,880
There's that long of a pause in between some of the dialogue.

1923
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,120
So it's funny to watch it sort of as a movie

1924
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,600
because especially video games

1925
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,760
where cut scenes have gotten so cinematic.

1926
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,400
Obviously, again, 20 years ago,

1927
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,640
I know when the newer cut scenes are, I'm sure, better paced.

1928
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,880
My video, this kind of inspired me.

1929
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,960
Like I started poking around on the Steam store

1930
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,120
and it's like, oh, maybe I can get a newer Grand Theft Auto.

1931
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,000
Maybe I can get such and such indie game.

1932
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,600
You should have been playing with us over the,

1933
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,240
you should have gotten a PS5 or 4 and played.

1934
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,640
I know.

1935
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,240
Well, that's at the start of the pandemic, James.

1936
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,160
Like, why don't we get a Nintendo Switch?

1937
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,840
And I'm like, how long is this gonna take?

1938
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,400
We don't need to get a Switch.

1939
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,960
So egg on my face.

1940
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,040
Yeah, you should, because there's Switch.

1941
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,640
I should have gotten the Switch version of this,

1942
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,640
I think in hindsight,

1943
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,520
because I got the PS4 version of all of this.

1944
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,000
And the Switch, you can play a Lion Down.

1945
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,280
Oh, that is true.

1946
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,680
You know?

1947
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,720
Yeah, I don't, oh, he's coming back.

1948
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,080
Do you want to jump to the end?

1949
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,920
Jump.

1950
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,760
All right, what's happening?

1951
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,080
All I would say is that as far as people,

1952
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,520
when they would play, 20 years ago,

1953
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,520
I'm green with envy of the day that people played.

1954
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,360
You motherfuckers, you got off to fuck.

1955
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,240
There was no, no, go back and listen.

1956
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,800
We were talking about this the whole time.

1957
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,640
We were looking.

1958
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,480
Go back and listen,

1959
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,720
because we don't want to give up the ghost.

1960
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,840
I had the Hercules Wikipedia open,

1961
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,800
because we couldn't remember that.

1962
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,760
I made a good point about how the cut scenes

1963
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,520
were very slowly paced.

1964
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,360
So we're like, gosh, the New World Order,

1965
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,960
we have to save the New World Order,

1966
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,720
which is not what he says, but the World Order.

1967
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,960
And then it's beat, beat, beat.

1968
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,800
Yes.

1969
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,640
Oh yeah.

1970
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,280
That's how all the cut scenes are.

1971
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,040
And that's what we were talking about most of the time.

1972
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,360
Well, I went in right at the moment

1973
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,960
that my son had come back from a play outing.

1974
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,600
And he, I came in and he burst out and said,

1975
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,800
dad, dad, he was one of the happiest

1976
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,800
I've ever seen him see me.

1977
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,520
And I'm like, I have to go.

1978
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,360
I'm in the middle of the Kingdom Hearts episode.

1979
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,200
You facemasked him.

1980
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,080
And you said, not now.

1981
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,080
Not now.

1982
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,320
My real friends are Riku and Kairi.

1983
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,160
Vaunted over him.

1984
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,640
We are not friends anymore.

1985
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,600
Do you want to jump to the end of the cliffhanger?

1986
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,080
Sure.

1987
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,360
Of the game?

1988
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,200
Oh yeah.

1989
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,480
Oh, well, they all get reunited.

1990
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,000
We're going all the way to the end?

1991
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,600
That's great.

1992
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,400
Oh, I don't know.

1993
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,480
Are there other worlds that you felt the need to discuss?

1994
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,280
Well, there are other worlds.

1995
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,040
As far as do I need to discuss them is a good question.

1996
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,680
I'll say this, early on in the game,

1997
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,120
there's a section where you're going through,

1998
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,080
it's kind of when they're teaching you how to play the game

1999
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,000
and you're going on these great glass floors with like,

2000
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,480
it almost looks like stained glass with famous Disney

2001
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,120
characters.

2002
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,600
And I'll say this, I like that.

2003
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,400
I think that looked cool.

2004
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,840
Just from cinematically, visually, it looks cool.

2005
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,560
I know they've remastered these graphics.

2006
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,680
But I did like that part.

2007
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,040
That gave me a little hope for some interesting use

2008
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,800
of the iconography of the Disney movies.

2009
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,360
What do you think of this?

2010
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,160
Go ahead, Jason.

2011
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,520
Oh, I was going to say, the logic of like,

2012
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,280
these seven Disney princesses or whatever number it was,

2013
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,480
they each represent part of shards that you have to,

2014
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,800
you had to save them to get there.

2015
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
You just quit.

2016
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,200
Keep in mind, at the record show,

2017
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,720
that sentence began with, I think this is interesting.

2018
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,640
I don't know.

2019
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,040
Quit, your brain quit on you.

2020
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,080
Your brain got out and drove away.

2021
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,360
It's like a real Homer Simpson.

2022
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,680
You got to the word shard.

2023
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,400
Oh, Homer Simpson, you say?

2024
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:34,600
Well, do I have a clip for you of a different character?

2025
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,240
No, wait.

2026
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:35,920
What happened?

2027
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,280
Your dearest wish is granted.

2028
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2029
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,200
Aladdin, congratulations.

2030
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,240
That, of course, is?

2031
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,560
Alien race.

2032
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,280
Patience, my fine brother.

2033
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,320
Fake genie.

2034
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,520
That's the genie.

2035
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,560
That is the genie.

2036
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,920
It is not Homer.

2037
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,440
It is the genie.

2038
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,840
Otherwise, it's a stacked, because like so many other.

2039
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,800
Billy Zane's in this game.

2040
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,240
There's a lot of big ones.

2041
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,000
You go to Tarzan World, and you get the voice of Clayton.

2042
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,440
Clayton from Tarzan.

2043
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,200
You got to see Clayton.

2044
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,640
You could go anywhere you could in the Disneyverse.

2045
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,240
You would have to see Clayton, and you

2046
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,360
would have to help Tarzan help the gorillas.

2047
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,400
But I didn't know what Clayton was.

2048
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,920
That's Brian Blessed, and he's the voice of Boss Nass.

2049
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,400
So you get Boss Nass in this game.

2050
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,360
Now I'm back in the conversation.

2051
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,520
Anyway, Jason, you were saying about the shards.

2052
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,440
Yeah, Jason, what were you saying about the shards?

2053
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,200
I know they all get reunited.

2054
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,880
Everyone gets reunited at the end,

2055
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:38,480
but then Mickey and Riku have to stay behind a big door.

2056
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,240
Yeah.

2057
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,200
You have skipped truly all the way to the end,

2058
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,240
and I'm fine with that.

2059
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,800
I watched other stuff.

2060
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,680
But if that's where this is going, I'm happy to not.

2061
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,280
I'm more than happy to not.

2062
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,360
I'm just shocked by you of all people going off.

2063
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,360
Yeah, he's the one who wants to say.

2064
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,640
I've never seen this big of a skip from you.

2065
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,280
This is all I.

2066
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,200
Well, you said video games are kind of in panorama.

2067
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,200
I will say this, Scott.

2068
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,880
Really briefly, when you were gone,

2069
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,280
Jason mentioned how cold he was getting.

2070
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,280
That's the wind.

2071
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:06,800
Because the sun.

2072
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,920
The sun was setting, and we're all getting cold.

2073
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,320
That's part of why I went in.

2074
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,440
I got a sweater.

2075
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,520
I'm fine to not talk about any of the things.

2076
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,680
I think we need to at least run through the world.

2077
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,880
Yeah, let's name the worlds.

2078
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,560
We don't need necessarily see or speculate.

2079
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,160
Not speculate.

2080
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,800
Talk about them at length.

2081
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,240
But we owe it to at least acknowledge

2082
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,000
the different lands you go to.

2083
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,360
And hold on, let me find them.

2084
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,200
Oh, come on.

2085
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,240
Well, you see fake genie.

2086
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,840
It's one of these consortium of villains things,

2087
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,080
where there's the heartless, right?

2088
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,960
And then there's Riku, who becomes

2089
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,680
under Maleficent's spell.

2090
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,000
So Riku's kind of a villain.

2091
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,800
But then it turns out that really, it's not

2092
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,720
Maleficent's spell.

2093
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,320
It's Ansem's, right?

2094
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,160
Ansem's spell.

2095
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,480
Maleficent is being controlled.

2096
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,320
So I guess they left it open so she could

2097
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,920
be a good guy in the Maleficent movie,

2098
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,960
the Angelina Jolie Maleficent movie.

2099
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,800
I saw that for you.

2100
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,160
I don't think they were thinking about it.

2101
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,880
I'm just saying, well, it makes sense to my brain.

2102
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,160
I'm not sure this is canon in a lot of ways.

2103
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,760
But why couldn't she just be bad, then, is what I'm saying.

2104
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,560
She's a bad guy.

2105
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,800
You get a bunch of villains all in that classic.

2106
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,680
They're all like, oh, those meddling fools.

2107
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,000
Which I love.

2108
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,280
But one of them is Captain Hook.

2109
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,080
And I always find it odd when Captain Hook is like one

2110
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,440
of the, like, oh, it's all the worst villains.

2111
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,880
There's Captain Hook.

2112
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,320
Because he's like a boob.

2113
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,160
He's an idiot.

2114
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,240
I'm not scared of Captain Hook at all.

2115
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,280
At least not that Disney one.

2116
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,640
He's a numbskull.

2117
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,240
I was turning into you, Scott.

2118
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,200
The pan in this is really grating.

2119
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,360
Hell yeah.

2120
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:41,880
Yeah.

2121
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,440
I was watching this like, I dare these guys to tell them,

2122
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,360
that's good.

2123
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,000
I like what this pan is doing.

2124
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,200
I don't think anyone likes this pan.

2125
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,640
Wait, I have a line of dialogue.

2126
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,280
It's like, goofy.

2127
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,160
Who are you?

2128
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,200
Pan, I'm the answer to your prayers.

2129
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,920
You are the answer.

2130
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,000
No prayer could be answered by you, Pan.

2131
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,120
My greatest prayers that you go away.

2132
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,240
I don't look.

2133
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,880
I'd love to say I love the pan.

2134
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,840
I don't love the pan in this.

2135
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,360
But what do you think about the Little Mermaid

2136
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,880
world and the dialogue?

2137
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,840
Where is the keyhole, daddy?

2138
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,280
It's in your grotto.

2139
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,280
I do like that.

2140
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,880
I don't know about that.

2141
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,360
But now that you put P-hole in my head.

2142
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,080
This is another awful part.

2143
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,200
You go to Little Mermaid world, and everybody

2144
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,160
changes a little bit.

2145
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,520
Now, some of the changes I like.

2146
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,960
Is it called Atlantica?

2147
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,560
Yeah, that's not what it is in the movie.

2148
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,680
It's not that in the movie.

2149
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,120
Atlantica is made up from old cloth.

2150
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,120
All the goofy, they become sea creatures, right?

2151
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:44,640
Yeah.

2152
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,240
Goofy becomes a turtle.

2153
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,160
I like looking at Goofy as a turtle.

2154
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:48,520
Yeah.

2155
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,720
Donald is an octopus.

2156
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,320
And Sora is a mer-boy.

2157
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,920
He's a little mer-boy.

2158
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,520
And I don't want to see Sora without his shirt on.

2159
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,960
I'm not one of the people making the AMVs.

2160
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,120
This is too young of a character.

2161
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,480
Well, Jason did it to put Link.

2162
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,960
And Link's a young guy.

2163
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,320
Jason stripped all his clothes off in Skyward Sword.

2164
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,720
I don't know if I intended to do that.

2165
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,960
I think I was trying to access the inventory.

2166
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,840
It was in his underwear.

2167
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,000
Yeah.

2168
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,800
So no, he's a mer-boy.

2169
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,880
He's a little mer-boy, which, look, we all

2170
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,240
want to be little mer-boys.

2171
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,200
But it's impossible.

2172
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,040
I tried to go to the seats.

2173
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,240
Like, watching all this stuff, I was like, all right,

2174
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,160
maybe I need to give video games another shot.

2175
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,200
And I went to the Steam store, which is, I thought,

2176
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,280
cross computers.

2177
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,800
And the system requirements were all in Windows.

2178
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,520
And I'm like, well, I guess I'm fucked.

2179
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,600
I don't know what's going on.

2180
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,880
Tell me the story while that was going.

2181
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,560
Did we say this?

2182
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,520
Someone cut me off.

2183
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,560
I didn't think I finished it.

2184
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,520
Well, maybe you didn't finish the thought.

2185
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:51,880
Yeah, yeah.

2186
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,640
This was about to be said.

2187
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,360
This is possibly, it was not said,

2188
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,320
but this was almost a five-timer within an episode.

2189
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,040
I don't know.

2190
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,720
I can't remember.

2191
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,080
We recorded an episode before this.

2192
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:01,720
And I have not.

2193
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,800
The sleeping again.

2194
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah, the sleeping's not good.

2195
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,800
This is also, we have had the most,

2196
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,840
we've been buzzed by the most planes and helicopters

2197
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,360
we've ever.

2198
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,200
Yeah, we've stopped.

2199
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,000
If you think we're frustrated, we've cut it off.

2200
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,720
We've had to stop and restart like seven times.

2201
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,560
It'll be seamless.

2202
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,120
I think Jason had the right idea.

2203
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,520
The stories that they go to different worlds.

2204
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,320
Atlantica, Monstro.

2205
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,400
I have a clip of Monstro.

2206
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,480
OK, go ahead, please.

2207
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,200
This kind of tells you the tone of it

2208
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,480
and what you get to see all our favorite characters do.

2209
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:35,560
They find you're in space in a gummy ship.

2210
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,080
And that gets to all.

2211
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,400
Monstro's in psychedelic space.

2212
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,520
And then you end up in his stomach.

2213
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,720
And this is a scene between Geppetto and Riku,

2214
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,880
who is holding Pinocchio like he grabbed him.

2215
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,560
And he's holding him over his arm.

2216
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,800
Pinocchio.

2217
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,480
Pinocchio.

2218
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,760
Please give me back my son.

2219
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,400
Sorry, old man.

2220
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,680
I have some unfinished business with this puppet.

2221
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,280
He's no puppet.

2222
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,960
Pinocchio is my little boy.

2223
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,320
He is unusual.

2224
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,200
Not many puppets have hearts.

2225
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,320
I'm not sure.

2226
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,880
But maybe he can help someone who's lost theirs.

2227
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,800
Wait a minute.

2228
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,400
Are you talking about Kairi?

2229
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,040
What do you care about her?

2230
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,400
And he walks off to the unfinished business

2231
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,320
with this puppet.

2232
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,840
That's the best part of the whole game.

2233
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,520
I don't know what he's going to do to him,

2234
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,000
but it doesn't seem good to me.

2235
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,440
Yeah, I know that Geppetto is a real suss.

2236
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:38,320
What do you want with your wooden son, old man?

2237
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:41,280
Shut the fuck up, you old shithead.

2238
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,240
I'm Kairi.

2239
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:47,320
I do whatever I want with any little wooden boy I find.

2240
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,480
I'm taking this puppet back.

2241
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,080
I don't give a shit, old man, what you say to me.

2242
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,720
I have perfect hair, and I will dramatically kind of

2243
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,440
toss it back several times.

2244
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,120
I'm so wispy.

2245
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,280
I could do anything I want.

2246
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,240
I'm going to give this little wooden boy his own head of hair.

2247
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,920
Real hair.

2248
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:07,880
Real hair.

2249
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,000
Gertner's lucky I'm not using the locker under him.

2250
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,560
If I stood up one time, I'd stab him right in that dirty chin.

2251
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,480
That wooden boy, Scott Gertner.

2252
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,600
That little wooden boy, we have unfinished business.

2253
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,640
Put him under my arm.

2254
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,840
I'll carry him away.

2255
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,120
No, David Gallagher, no.

2256
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,040
That's my Scott.

2257
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600
Not today, he's not.

2258
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,080
He'll say no, saying whatever he says, like, no, old man.

2259
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,720
No, man.

2260
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,880
He's also, I don't know if they really conveyed the stakes of it to David,

2261
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,240
because it's always like, plead.

2262
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,320
Wait here, I have one more.

2263
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,200
This is another one where the character, the famous character who we have feelings

2264
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:58,000
about, the emotion is not really matched between the character and Riku.

2265
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,760
It'll be a reveal for the listener.

2266
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,440
This is towards the end of the game.

2267
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,080
No help from the heartless.

2268
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,000
So tell me, how'd you get here?

2269
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,720
Hmm.

2270
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,720
I simply believed.

2271
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,720
Nothing more to it.

2272
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,720
When our world fell into darkness, Belle was taken from me.

2273
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,720
Who is the beast?

2274
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,720
I would find her again, no matter what the cost.

2275
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,720
I believed I would find her.

2276
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,720
So here I am.

2277
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,720
Sorry, hang on.

2278
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,720
She must be here.

2279
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,720
I will have her back.

2280
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,720
Take her if you can.

2281
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,720
Nah, I don't think so.

2282
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,720
There's this lame jump in slow motion.

2283
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,720
The beast just misses once and that like fells him.

2284
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:53,720
So now we have like, all right, wow, it's a Disney, it's a video game where all the

2285
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,720
Disney characters, well, what if the beast, what if you could play as the beast or

2286
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,720
watch what he would do, like ripping somebody apart?

2287
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:04,720
Like he'd probably make mincemeat of a wispy 13 year old with an attitude.

2288
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,720
What if I could watch him do that?

2289
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:11,720
No, Riku took one step backwards and that's the end of this 600 pound monster.

2290
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,720
They make him look like a fool.

2291
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,720
He's a fearsome beast, no longer.

2292
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,720
Tricked me.

2293
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,720
I slipped on a banana peel.

2294
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,720
No way, you furry asshole.

2295
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Nice try.

2296
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,720
I don't think so.

2297
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,720
I made you look like a fucking dick.

2298
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,720
You old, you fucking moron.

2299
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,720
Trash shaving.

2300
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,720
Eat my shit for a ball.

2301
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,720
If we're sharing clips, this jumps ahead to a future game.

2302
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,720
I guess Kingdom Hearts 3.

2303
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,720
Woody and Buzz show up.

2304
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,720
Oh, great.

2305
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,720
Yep.

2306
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,720
And yeah, I don't know.

2307
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,720
I just thought that Woody was pretty funny here.

2308
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,720
I sense a Jim Hanks.

2309
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,720
Jim Hanks.

2310
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,720
Well, that's sort of the main.

2311
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:00,720
Whatever you're talking about, I don't care.

2312
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,720
Put Buzz back the way he was, then get lost.

2313
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,720
Or else what toy?

2314
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:11,720
Yeah, I am a toy and a friend.

2315
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,720
My guess is no one's ever loved you before.

2316
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,720
Who's he talking to?

2317
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,720
Because you know nothing about hearts and love.

2318
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,720
There's another good line read coming.

2319
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,720
You can't.

2320
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,720
Okay, so the pacing is just as bad.

2321
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
There's a snake in my boots.

2322
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,720
You can't and you can't mess with me.

2323
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:57,720
I rewound it so many times just to hear you can't keep us from Andy.

2324
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,720
Like what?

2325
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,720
The voice drop man.

2326
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,720
Yeah.

2327
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Hearts are where love comes from.

2328
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,720
What does he say?

2329
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,720
Can you play the first part with Woody again real quick?

2330
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,720
Yeah, sure.

2331
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:12,720
Because it sounds like something John Taffer screamed at the manager of the Scottsdale improv.

2332
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,720
That's also very funny.

2333
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,720
The reason I clipped it initially is just because like, wait.

2334
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,720
So in this video game, Woody tells a character he's never experienced love.

2335
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,720
That's the line.

2336
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,720
Yeah.

2337
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,720
Whatever you're talking about, I don't care.

2338
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,720
Whatever you're talking about, I don't care.

2339
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,720
And get lost.

2340
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Or else what toy?

2341
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:42,720
Yeah, I am a toy and a friend.

2342
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,720
Something you'll never be.

2343
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,720
Now clean this shit up.

2344
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,720
Wait, wait, we'll go back to that one.

2345
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,720
You're over boring.

2346
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,720
My guess is no one's ever loved you before.

2347
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,720
That's it.

2348
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,720
Yeah.

2349
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:05,720
The Scottsdale Arizona, he goes like, there's a literally line on that episode of Bar Rescue where he goes, this is why your wife left you.

2350
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,720
No, this is why no one's ever loved you before.

2351
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,720
No one's ever loved you before.

2352
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,720
That's it.

2353
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,720
Seal the keyhole.

2354
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,720
And I had to work so hard.

2355
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:23,720
I watched like 10 videos before I found one that is just clips of Disney characters saying weird things.

2356
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,720
Oh, stiff.

2357
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,720
None of them talk like them.

2358
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
So it's all like they're so serious.

2359
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,720
Everyone's so serious.

2360
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:38,720
It's kind of when you look into other like niche fandoms and stuff and you're like, oh, what are the memes?

2361
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,720
What do you guys think are funny?

2362
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,720
And then you're just like, I can't I can't understand a lick of this.

2363
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,720
I don't know.

2364
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,720
This is something that's in my notes.

2365
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:55,720
King Mickey used the gummy ship to visit Ansem the Wise in Radiant Garden to discover the reason why the worlds were disappearing.

2366
01:28:55,720 --> 01:29:00,720
Both Ansem and his apprentice Xehanort were fascinated by the gummy technology.

2367
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,720
It's Mickey Mouse.

2368
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,720
What is this?

2369
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,720
But he let go of our ship and then he sings a song.

2370
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,720
The description of that, though, at the very least, could be fun in another context.

2371
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,720
Maybe.

2372
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:23,720
Yeah, I feel like I would love to go back and play Epic Mickey now because I think I would go like Epic Mickey is like so exciting compared to this.

2373
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,720
Some of this Kingdom Hearts stuff.

2374
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:33,720
You mean the game where a man named Sid angrily chewing like a straw stalk makes character makes goofy.

2375
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,720
Find a book for him.

2376
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,720
I'm sorry. Deliver a book for me to an old man.

2377
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,720
Yeah, that's a long thing that happens.

2378
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,720
And Epic Mickey does not have dialogue, right?

2379
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,720
You mean like voice acting, voice acting, isn't it?

2380
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,720
Just text.

2381
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,720
Yeah, I think it's mostly text.

2382
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,720
I could be wrong about that because I was so weird to me.

2383
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:58,720
I think when I was at your apartment once and I was playing it and I was like, why are none of these classic cartoon characters talking?

2384
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
Well, but there's also newer games.

2385
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,720
Like I said, the Zelda like still has a lot of text.

2386
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,720
Yeah, like they can't do voice acting in this one.

2387
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,720
I mean, I guess it's now built in.

2388
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,720
It's baked into the game or whatever.

2389
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,720
But they had to figure out how to set the course.

2390
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,720
They have to the designers.

2391
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:20,720
Miyamoto is working on the horse on fire effect so much they didn't have time to record dialogue.

2392
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,720
Mario. Yeah, Mario still.

2393
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:28,720
I mean, Mario has a still as Charles Martinette voice lines, which we will not see in the movie, which is good.

2394
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,720
Real.

2395
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,720
I want to see the stars of today.

2396
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,720
I'm hip.

2397
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:41,720
I want to see all of the comedies hottest talents.

2398
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,720
OK, what do we have to do to get out of here?

2399
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,720
Did I say all the names of the world?

2400
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,720
We have to.

2401
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,720
I guess we don't have to.

2402
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
We have to do is say we don't have to.

2403
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,720
The mission was to say the plot.

2404
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,720
I'm just going to say some things from Goomba Stomp dot com.

2405
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,720
Go for it.

2406
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,720
Yeah, I think will they go.

2407
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,720
You go to the world.

2408
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,720
You're sent on missions.

2409
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,720
What the it's sealing the keyholes.

2410
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,720
That's what you're doing.

2411
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,720
Yeah. The point is you go to Ariel.

2412
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:12,720
You interrupt the events of the movie like the now the drama with Ursula isn't about the voice and Prince Eric.

2413
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,720
It's about you being there.

2414
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,720
Yeah, kind of the same stuff happens.

2415
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:21,720
You fight Ursula and then the fight causes the keyhole, the seal and the more kills you seal.

2416
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,720
Maybe the heartless won't come out anymore.

2417
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,720
But then it all ends at Maleficent's home, which we know is hollow Bastion.

2418
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:38,720
And that's where you they confront Riku who and realize that Riku is just under the control of Ansem Billy Zane and more of Billy Zane.

2419
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:46,720
Ansem comes out through that and you realize that's why Riku got so muscly and why his shirts started to change.

2420
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,720
That's why he started having so many wardrobe changes because he's as flashy as Ansem.

2421
01:31:52,720 --> 01:32:05,720
But so Sora wait Riku says let's fight without your precious keyblade and Sora realizes that his strength is in his friends and not in the weapons.

2422
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,720
I don't need a weapon.

2423
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:15,720
My friends are my power says Sora something that people probably were very emotional about and made some very serious Linkin Park music videos about.

2424
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:19,720
But to me, I don't know what why this matters.

2425
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,720
So then Ansem shows up.

2426
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,720
The sea says it is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.

2427
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,720
And they real I don't know.

2428
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
Some say anyone else say anything.

2429
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
I'm just trying to try.

2430
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:44,720
I was trying to do the assignment moved by Sora's spirit any time always moved by Sora's speech golf goofy, golfy, golfy and doogled return to Sora's side.

2431
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,720
And so does the keyblade.

2432
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,720
Riku is defeated only to be stopped by a man named Ansem.

2433
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:54,720
He teaches the kid out to unlock the darkness in his heart and becomes stronger.

2434
01:32:54,720 --> 01:33:02,720
Oh, I guess what Goomba Stomp dot com is telling me is that Ansem and Ansem the wise are two different characters.

2435
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,720
Good.

2436
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:07,720
I know that's what becomes over 12 games.

2437
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:18,720
Multiple characters are VR simulations of the actual characters or dreams characters have or time travels.

2438
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,720
Yeah.

2439
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,720
Yeah.

2440
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,720
Tigger dreams.

2441
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,720
Yeah.

2442
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,720
Or you're just a part of a Tigger dream.

2443
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:29,720
So anyway, they get with Maleficent and defeat her.

2444
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:38,720
And then they and then they you find out that Kyrie, one of the friends from the beginning, is the last princess of power needed to unlock Kingdom Hearts, which is a place.

2445
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,720
Yeah.

2446
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,720
Did you know that?

2447
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,720
Not before I started doing this.

2448
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,720
This name the whole time.

2449
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,720
I assumed Kingdom Hearts was what all the characters were.

2450
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,720
Sora and Kyrie and Mickey and Pluto.

2451
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,720
They're all Kingdom Hearts.

2452
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,720
It's a place.

2453
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,720
It's a place.

2454
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,720
I thought they were trying to acquire Kingdom Hearts.

2455
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,720
No, no.

2456
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,720
Kingdom Hearts is a place and seemingly like mainly a door.

2457
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,720
But shards there.

2458
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,720
But about the shards.

2459
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,720
But about the shards.

2460
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,720
The brief form the X-blade.

2461
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,720
And then one character turns out to later be a blade.

2462
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,720
Uh-huh.

2463
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,720
We're almost there.

2464
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,720
We're almost there.

2465
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,720
Uh, Sora.

2466
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:30,720
This Ansem shows up and somebody references that a keyblade that unlocks people's hearts.

2467
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,720
And he says a keyblade that unlocks people's hearts.

2468
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,720
I wonder.

2469
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,720
And he unlocks his own heart by stabbing himself with a keyblade.

2470
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:47,720
And you think that Sora is dead and magic bubbles shoot out of his heart and the bubbles fly at the different princesses such as Belle.

2471
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,720
Someone who Sora has never met and his friend Kyrie.

2472
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,720
And I don't know.

2473
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,720
Then at some point Cinderella says we've been waiting for you keyblade master.

2474
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,720
Sounds like Cinderella to me.

2475
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:07,720
Anyway, Sora's sacrifice saves Kyrie and he only has to be dead for a couple minutes.

2476
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,720
And he is back.

2477
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,720
And then but then their home disappears.

2478
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,720
The island from before it goes away.

2479
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:17,720
Destiny Island is gone.

2480
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,720
And Kingdom Hearts is a place.

2481
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,720
I said that.

2482
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,720
Look, honestly, I don't think my notes are going to cut it.

2483
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,720
I don't know if I.

2484
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,720
If you go to Halloween town.

2485
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,720
That was a while ago.

2486
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,720
Oh, sorry.

2487
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,720
I do like that there's an eyebrow for Christmas stuff and it's the voices.

2488
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,720
Like, look, we got to get we got to get to the end.

2489
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,720
Sorry.

2490
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,720
But behind the door.

2491
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:47,720
So, yeah, Kingdom Hearts is a place and Ansem opens the door and he thinks it's going to be a world of darkness, but it's actually a world of light.

2492
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,720
So jokes on Ansem.

2493
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,720
This all means something to someone, right?

2494
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:52,720
Yeah.

2495
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:53,720
People are still listening, right?

2496
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,720
Is there anyone listening that's like a big fan and are like, this is blasphemous?

2497
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,720
Well, we're doing this is a great.

2498
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:06,720
Yeah, either if you're a fan, we've made you mad or if you're not a fan, you don't know what we're talking about.

2499
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:10,720
And hopefully you're at least enjoying the madness and hopefully you're somewhere warmer than we are.

2500
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:16,720
It is cold out and there's somebody who's running like a barbecue grill and I was getting this wafs of like smoke in my lungs.

2501
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,720
There's a gas.

2502
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,720
I have a fire.

2503
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:23,720
We should start recording this by the fire pit as we head into the winter months.

2504
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,720
But what was the twist ending you were talking about that we should have listened to you and just ended?

2505
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,720
Oh, sure.

2506
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,720
Yeah.

2507
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,720
Mickey and David Gallagher.

2508
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:39,720
And David Gallagher, I believe, have to sacrifice themselves and stay behind the door behind the door.

2509
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,720
They closed.

2510
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,720
We're keeping the siren.

2511
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,720
Yeah, we're going to.

2512
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,720
No more stopping.

2513
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,720
We've got to wrap this for me.

2514
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,720
Jason called 911.

2515
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,720
You just greatly called the emergency button.

2516
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:55,720
If you call Lyft Amp.

2517
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:06,720
There is there is an ambulance missing foul or yeah, fouls in Los Angeles called Ambulance like and I have no idea what it does.

2518
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,720
Yeah, I don't know how to find out why there's a hip ambulance.

2519
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,720
Why is there a lift of ambulances?

2520
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,720
Ambulance.

2521
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,720
King Mickey shows up and sacrifices himself.

2522
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,720
So you don't.

2523
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:22,720
Sora did not find all of his friends and Donald and Goofy briefly found Mickey, but now he's gone again.

2524
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,720
So the goals of the game were not met.

2525
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,720
No, some of them were not all much like the episode.

2526
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,720
We didn't explain all of it.

2527
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:39,720
We did as much as we could stand and and it ends in kind of a here we go again way where because they haven't found anybody.

2528
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:45,720
So it all moves to Kingdom Hearts 2, a game where Goofy is hit by a rock and briefly dies.

2529
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,720
Right.

2530
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:59,720
Now, if you're wondering if things pick up and get a little more exciting because of Mickey's presence, here's a random clip from Kingdom Hearts 2.8.

2531
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:04,720
It's time with this key and Sora's in the realm of light.

2532
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,720
We're going to close this door.

2533
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,720
Now all we need is Riku.

2534
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,720
Hey, Mickey, my friend is telling me funny stuff.

2535
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,720
Here's more funny stuff, he says in Kingdom Hearts 3.

2536
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:21,720
Exam when Master Xehanort made his grand return.

2537
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,720
That's the Xehanort I remember.

2538
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,720
Wow, man.

2539
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,720
Mickey, you remember a way different Xehanort than I do.

2540
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,720
He's I don't want to know anymore about these.

2541
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,720
Well, Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at one point.

2542
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,720
Oh, baby.

2543
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,720
Alert inside the magic.

2544
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,720
I'm sure they know already.

2545
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,720
They play it every fucking night.

2546
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:54,720
One of the one of the writers at Inside the Magic made their own patch for the game where Jeff Beck gets added to the character.

2547
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,720
That's the Jeff Beck I remember.

2548
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,720
Wow, my favorite blues legend.

2549
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,720
So then also here's something else to know about too.

2550
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,720
And I know we're wrapping it up, but you got to know.

2551
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,720
You have to know that in two, you're not Sora, you're Roxas.

2552
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,720
I don't know.

2553
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,720
I'm not saying that right.

2554
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,720
But he's voiced by Jesse McCartney, you know, did I know if both.

2555
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:21,720
So which is probably this probably a Kingdom Hearts mashup of and if not somebody should make one.

2556
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:26,720
There's questions online about why does Roxas look like Ventus?

2557
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,720
I couldn't tell you.

2558
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,720
I don't know the full story about that.

2559
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,720
But Roxas looks like Ventus and he's not Sora.

2560
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,720
But you don't know why you're watching Roxas and not Sora.

2561
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:46,720
But suddenly Roxas has a realization that he's supposed to help Sora, someone who he's never met before, and that Sora has been asleep for the entire runtime of Kingdom Hearts 2.

2562
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,720
I am going to sell the games I bought.

2563
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,720
Hey, reach out to Mike.

2564
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,720
No, I'm going to GameStop tomorrow.

2565
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,720
I'm selling the games.

2566
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,720
Well, that's a real insult to injury if you're giving games.

2567
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,720
Wait a minute.

2568
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:04,720
There's what you would you still want to sell them after you hear this?

2569
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:13,720
That while sort that since the end of Kingdom Hearts 1, Sora has been napping and Donald and Goofy have been waiting for him to wake up from the nap.

2570
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,720
I have Miles Morales Spider-Man PS5 game I haven't finished and it's a good game.

2571
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,720
And it's been sitting there.

2572
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,720
I need to finish that.

2573
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,720
There's a lot of games I should finish.

2574
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,720
But Mike, it turns out the master doesn't matter.

2575
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,720
What?

2576
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:29,720
That is a phrase I had in my notes and I don't know what it means.

2577
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,720
Yeah.

2578
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,720
And also it turns out that Ansem is not who he says he is.

2579
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,720
He's not Ansem.

2580
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:41,720
He's he's Zen or so Ansem is Zen or every time you say Ansem, I think of Ansem Williams from Happy Days.

2581
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,720
That's nice.

2582
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,720
That's a nicer thing to think about, isn't it?

2583
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,720
Yes.

2584
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,720
Sit on it, Pottsy.

2585
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,720
And that's a phrase I keep.

2586
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,720
Sit on it.

2587
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,720
I think of Ansel Elgort.

2588
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,720
Does Disney own Happy Days?

2589
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Do any of the Happy Days characters appear in Kingdom Hearts 2.75?

2590
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,720
They should show up in 5, I think.

2591
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:04,720
Yeah, Donnie Most is in 358 over two days.

2592
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,720
As the actor Donnie Most or as his character Ralph Malf?

2593
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,720
Oh, no, they find Ralph Malf and he says, we have to beware.

2594
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:15,720
These Heartless come from Organization 13.

2595
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,720
All right.

2596
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,720
Do you want to like Jitterbug or something?

2597
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,720
No, no, I don't.

2598
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,720
There's too much to learn about the nobodies.

2599
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:28,720
Can't Square Enix make a combination Final Fantasy Happy Days, can't we?

2600
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,720
Make a new set of characters and they interact with a Happy Days universe.

2601
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,720
That was in Laverne and Shirley's as well.

2602
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,720
So you can have all the different of the sitcoms.

2603
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,720
And you get to find out whether you're Shlomozzle or Shlomozzle, you know?

2604
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:42,720
Yes, you can.

2605
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,720
You can play as Shlomozzle, but not Shlomozzle.

2606
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,720
So that's computer controls.

2607
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:51,720
Sora and then you're flanked by Laverne and Shirley.

2608
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,720
Fighting different characters.

2609
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,720
On the beer line.

2610
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,720
Hurry, fill the beers.

2611
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,720
It's the only way to help Kyrie.

2612
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,720
Not like root beer dapper.

2613
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:03,720
Fighting Lenny and Squig?

2614
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,720
I guess they're your friends, Lenny and Squiggy.

2615
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,720
No, Squiggy's been inhabited by Ansem.

2616
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,720
It's not the Squiggy we know.

2617
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:15,720
An early moment that threw me for a loop where I was like, oh, let me read about Square Enix.

2618
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:20,720
And it's like Square Enix is also known as Square and Square Soft.

2619
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,720
Now, the reasons are because of ownership.

2620
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:30,720
And I was like, oh, no, the ownership says ban us again.

2621
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:36,720
Audience, if there's something that we didn't do that you would like us to do, we're all ears.

2622
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,720
But this is as much of this as we could do right now.

2623
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:40,720
Please let us know.

2624
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,720
I spent a lot of time playing the game.

2625
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,720
I don't really tell people that.

2626
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,720
I did not half-ass it.

2627
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:53,720
I was sitting down playing this game and realized I wasted so much time in Traverse Town and on the island, on Destiny Island.

2628
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,720
I couldn't have been spending in Tulsa Town.

2629
01:42:55,720 --> 01:43:00,720
I watched so many compilation videos that had millions of views each.

2630
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,720
Yeah, you're right. It is a town.

2631
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,720
Millions of views.

2632
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,720
I was like, oh, what?

2633
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,720
The music's nice.

2634
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,720
I was listening to music.

2635
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:20,720
Before I sell the games, I will do a quick run through three, see if maybe the gameplay is more pleasing to my hands and my brain.

2636
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:27,720
Look, my guess is that why we were given this assignment was to torture us.

2637
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,720
I think so.

2638
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,720
So I think we did do the assignment.

2639
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:31,720
We definitely did it.

2640
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:35,720
If that's what was being thought here.

2641
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:48,720
But if not, and this is a pile of nonsense, then it's in your hands now to pick a topic that you want to hear more because next month is Christmas and Christmas is a time of rebirth.

2642
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,720
And we can all start over and forget about Ansem and Xenorth.

2643
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Isn't Easter the rebirth?

2644
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,720
They all are.

2645
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,720
It's so important.

2646
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
The child is born.

2647
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,720
They're all wherever you want them to be.

2648
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,720
But not rebirth.

2649
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,720
That's first birth.

2650
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,720
Christmas is a time of first birth.

2651
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:10,720
But for now, I think this has to be it.

2652
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:14,720
You survived podcast the right and thank you for subscribing to Club 3.

2653
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
Your bravery saved our podcast.

2654
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
Well done, freedom fighters.

2655
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,720
Do you want to take one more guest on an AMV like here for a song to go out on?

2656
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,720
Alien Ant Farm.

2657
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,720
That's a little too much fun, though.

2658
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,720
It could be, though.

2659
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:29,720
I don't know.

2660
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,720
I bet some of it.

2661
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,720
We got it.

2662
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,720
All right.

2663
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:36,720
We got out with with visual help from Riku and Kyrie.

2664
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
Definitive version of the song.

2665
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:44,720
I if I understand, it's over footage like I saw Pluto for a second.

2666
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:50,720
You and Riku never came home, so I came looking for you.

2667
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,720
They spun the visual image around.

2668
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:55,720
That's great.

2669
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:00,720
To quote the song, ow.
