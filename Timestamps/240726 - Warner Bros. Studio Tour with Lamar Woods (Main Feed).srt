1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Warning, the following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
photo op stress tests,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mr. Spock's napkin,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Burbank statue rumors,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and a place to rent famous lamps.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All that plus Lamar Woods returns to chat about his time working at Warner Brothers Studio Tour

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on today's podcast, The Ride.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
hosted by three men who are only interested in historical tours

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
if they include seeing clothes worn by dead actors

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
who have been dead at least 80 years.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always is Jason Sheridan.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Those clothes are hanging on.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They are literally hanging on.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, you mean in existence.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In existence, yeah.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're not just hanging on like a hanger.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, they're doing that too.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But if they are jostled too much,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
like the trench coat from Casablanca will just fade.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, Scott Garner here as well.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, I don't disagree with that statement except for maybe the 80 years

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because that implies that we're a level of film historian that we aren't

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
because 80 years takes us to 1944.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And like now let's all name people who we know died before 1944.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Jason, please, if you would.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's got to be people who died in the war maybe.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's got to be people who were drafted.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, either.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Either of the wars.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
OK, probably a Barrymore.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's a lot of them if you look back.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's hanging on.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first one without a specific name is really making us look bad.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't remember Lionel Barrymore was pretty old, like in the golden age of Hollywood.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Died in 1954.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Damn, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was so close.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In Van Nuys, California.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Should I re-edit the joke so I said 60 years at least?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Possibly.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, because what you're after are people who then were alive

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and in old and bad shape just long enough to be on a bunch of hokey 70s variety shows.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, like on Death's Door on the 70s variety show.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, that's optimal.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then barely, barely hanging on enough to tell three bad Bruce Belange jokes.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A young Bruce Belange.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To the actor who played Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, great idea.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He looked pretty old by the time that movie was made.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He was probably one of those.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He was probably 54.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
42 years old in that movie or something.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
OK, the joke didn't work.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I hear there's going to be jokes that don't work when I do it at the top of episodes.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That is Lionel Barrymore.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, that is Lionel Barrymore.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There you go.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, Jason, you're making us look foolish again.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wow.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Rosemary Clooney.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, she was alive longer than 90s at least.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is so humiliating.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Henry Potter is the name of that character.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Confusingly close to Harry Potter, the character who figures into the events of today's episode.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, a lot.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think right before we get to the events of today's episode, let's get to events happening today as you're hearing this.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you're hearing this the day that it drops, which is Friday, July 26th, 2024, unless you're hearing this many years from now, then you're totally shit out of luck.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
80 years from now.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But if you are hearing this today and you're in San Diego and at Comic-Con and have a badge already, there's a lot of layers of access here.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But if you have all of those things, then certainly you need to come see us at our panel.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Street Sharks, 30 years of Jawsome done in tandem with Mattel.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're celebrating Street Sharks and a new release of Street Sharks.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
1 p.m. at the San Diego Central Library featuring special guest and completer Griffin Newman.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you want to complete all of your times having seen us with Griffin in the live setting, then you really got to get down there today.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's today.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you're in line for Hall H right now and tomorrow you're waiting to see Kevin Feige come out and announce that they've written their 17th draft of the movie Blade, get out of line and see us.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
See Street Sharks.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Boring.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's corporate.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is well, it's corporate in that Mattel is involved.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
However, we're we are at a table and we're not checking everything we say with them.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It can't be done.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's technically it's from our mouths straight into the microphone.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am doing a shift tapping badges when people get in.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You know, they have the RFI.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You need to tap in to get into things.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is news to me.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is how much of not a Comic-Con.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, not in a long time.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So, yeah, this you watch me learn about badge tapping among other things.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, please make it down.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't take up a ton of time.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But it's happening today.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes, if you're there.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on out.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But that's that's separate from the guest who is sitting here.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's returning the returning guests.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's a he's a writer, an actor, a musician.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's a wax expert.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I would say we called him maybe the wax man last time.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We were wax guys.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We were wax guys last time, but you were the wax man.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We're waxing poetic about our days with the wax man.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I'm glad that we're back in wax glory days again.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Lamar Woods.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Some wax.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was about to say his name.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, shoot.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OK.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, do it.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do it.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lamar Woods is back.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That intro.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The story of my life.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We're humiliating ourselves left and right today.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, man.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What's up, y'all?

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's up, Jason?

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How you doing, man?

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm good.

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How are you doing?

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm looking directly at Jason.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're directly across from each other.

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's like, Jason, and then a guy with a chainsaw behind him.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, old leather faces hanging out as you record most days.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Strange context of doing shows here.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's so good to see y'all.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So good to be back.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm happy to be here.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, wax man in a full effect.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We're so happy to have you for a listener, any newer listeners, because it was a little

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
while ago.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,840
But if you don't remember, Lamar was our guest for, and it's been long enough that I don't

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,600
remember the proper pronunciation of Madame Tussauds versus Madame Tussauds.

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Was there a go-to for you?

156
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,480
I mean, I always said Madame Tussauds, but I think Tussauds might be the correct one.

157
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,040
But I feel like we didn't respect that.

158
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,480
We just said what we wanted.

159
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,000
No, yeah, Madame Tussauds, Madame Tussauds, Madame Tussauds.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Did I tell you?

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,720
I don't want to repeat stories I said in the last step, but I remember this guy, he called

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
her Madame Muzelle.

163
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,000
He was like, yo, so what's up with this Madame Muzelle?

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He was like a guy from Brooklyn or something.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He was like, yo, tell me the story about Madame Muzelle.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I was like, sir, it's pronounced Madame Tussauds.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please don't disrespect.

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is she available?

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Is she?

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I know she's a mademoiselle, not a mademoiselle.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry, she's actually a mademoiselle.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Madame, we're on Hollywood Boulevard.

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So yeah, is this, I don't know, is this some sort of lady of the night facility or no,

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry, it's a tour through Hollywood history.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It says someone walked in there thinking like, oh, there's a prostitute.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is the nicest brothel I've ever seen.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm very disappointed.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I say that having pounced on one of the characters.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Disappointed when they didn't move.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It is a lot like a cat house in HBO where you go through

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and you choose the person you're going to be with.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, the lineup, that's why you have the lineup.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, is that what it's called, the lineup on the cat house?

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's when it, yeah, the sex worker, you know, when everyone lines up in a lineup,

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
like lines up in a line.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do they, wait.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And it's like, here is our stinky little theater that shows a weird CG Avengers movie.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But going back, is the lineup something they say on the HBO show about the brothel

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
or is that something you just know in your head?

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because you really pounced on that.

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know it is a term.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm assuming they say it in the show.

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Right.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Got it.

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just wanted to make sure.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I just wanted the terminology to be correct.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sure everything is booked online nowadays,

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but I'm sure there's an in-person walk-in lineup.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not sure that that's true.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't think everything's booked.

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't think you want a record of that.

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everyone fill out this paperwork.

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Send us an address and your ID.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Send your Venmo record.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I mean, obviously you could just write it for like a soup or something.

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Roses.

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Gifts.

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, sure.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, listeners, let us know by replying to this episode's tweet with your personal record.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Send us a screenshot of your online prostitution.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We've never.

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The vans tell me Backpages is back.

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like that's what all the vans that are parked.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Backpages is back.

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In LA.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Got it.

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, we'll review these things one day, I guess.

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Backpages is back.

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is that a themed experience?

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They're physical items in our city.

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Maybe.

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Kind of themed.

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can come back and talk about it.

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Episode three.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Episode three, topless maids, the company.

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a thing you'll see in Los Angeles, by the way.

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There'll be like trucks driving around that say topless maids on them.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it took me maybe 10 years to realize that's prostitution.

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was like, well, that's kind of a weird thing I have.

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I knew it was ironic in some ways, but then I finally put two and two together when I was in my 30s where I was like, oh.

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You were just concerned like they're going to spill caustic cleaning chemicals on their tops.

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
With under chests.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My only association with that is the Broad City episode when they were like, they needed to make some money, I think, to get to a little wank.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, yeah.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Something like that.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And they were like, we'll do this.

247
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But they didn't want to take their clothes.

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then, what's his name?

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Fred Armis.

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It was just like creepily watching them.

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But yeah, I didn't realize.

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, I can't imagine.

253
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I didn't realize.

254
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I just thought it was like they just cleaned.

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I don't know.

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I didn't realize they were like having sex or stuff.

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't put that together either.

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I assume that's what's going on.

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I could be wrong, but there has to be some elements.

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I love that episode where it's like, it's the idea of like, you're just sitting there like you're naked.

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like, you're just watching the clean.

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Like, woo, this is crazy.

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't forget the dust on the ceiling.

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That would be, Jason would do it and then BSBS be the most clean and concerned person.

265
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't reach it.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The coffee mugs go in the second shelf.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm so sorry.

268
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't want to be a bother.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I've got a system.

270
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You look beautiful by the way.

271
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I should have written this down for you.

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you want a drink?

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you want a glass of water or some orange juice?

274
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Have you scrubbed my lettuce crisper?

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No one thinks about cleaning out the fruit and vegetable crispers, you know.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But so Madame T says you were here before because to refresh listeners memory, you not only, you were not on just as a fan of the organization,

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but someone in the organization for many years running the show and with wild tales of dealing with the Hollywood Boulevard.

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was a big part of my life.

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I mean, we were, you know, I was telling my because I'm kind of helping this like a student like with writing and stuff.

281
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And, you know, she was asking advice about balancing her career and her actual job and wanting to do comedy.

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I was like, yeah, like I was just talking about it today.

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like I've been that was like my career.

284
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean, it was like there was no other version of like I wasn't sure if I was ever going to get into comedy stuff.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But it's like I was working every day.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like the success of that museum was very important to me because it was like it was like a new place like in Hollywood.

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I just don't understand.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, that that Boulevard is still not really gotten ever back to glory.

289
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I feel like.

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But the person who does that, who actually does that, I think, well, I don't know.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mayor Bass is up for it.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's like not on her agenda, but someone's going to do something over there.

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's like it's still fun, but it doesn't fit.

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I wish it was more like exciting, like that people really want to go there.

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, have you checked out the redone Hollywood and Highland, which I believe is now called Ovation Hollywood?

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Am I making that up?

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The area where just listeners, if you haven't been, there's this whole zone on Hollywood Boulevard.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Manatee says is part of it kind of right next to the Chinese theater.

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then this pretty hellish shopping center kind of over to the right of all of that.

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That is also where the Academy Awards take place.

301
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And it's weird thinking about how all the biggest stars in Hollywood have to walk past the Hard Rock Cafe and Beard Papa on the way into the most important night of their lives.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But anyway, yeah, it's no, it's a whole other ballgame.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's Ovation Hollywood now.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's painted different.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Different establishments are closed instead of the ones that were closed before.

306
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They have artificial grass.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They have grass there.

308
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Really?

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I gotta get back over there.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
David Buster's still there?

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Still David Buster's.

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo's still there.

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think that's been closed for an extremely long time.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But it's not closed closed.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think it's closed closed.

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What?

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And you know, and confusingly, there's another thing that I think is called Cabo Cantina.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, that's because my friend who works at Kimmel is always walking past and like, wait, is it the Sammy Hagar place?

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And no one's ever in here.

322
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I'll go in and then sit there for 10 minutes and no one helps me.

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And then I will just leave.

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then I look in the Yelp reviews are all like, I sat there for 10 minutes and no one helped me.

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So I left.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And yet they have very desperate promotions outside like come in.

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Really great drink deals.

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, basically it's free.

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Basically, just come in and then you try to and nothing happens.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's a hell of a visit.

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Listen, if you've ever been to Hollywood Boulevard in general, what a scene.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know that I'd recommend it.

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
How do you feel at this point?

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, I don't I haven't been there in decades.

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, I still I mean, I still love the Chinese theater.

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I mean, that's like when I would go see I want to see Dune there.

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So yeah, that that's still my anchor into the Boulevard.

338
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And what else?

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, the Roosevelt Hotel is like really dope.

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I do like a lot of that classic Hollywood shit that's there, even like the gypsum theater.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But but the general like for entertainment for like just hanging out is tough.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, I haven't I haven't really got back to it.

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, my friend invited me to Dave and Busters.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
My friend, my girlfriend, my girlfriend.

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You should be.

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We were friends.

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And you still should be.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And you still should be.

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's an important part of the relationship.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He was like, we're going to Dave and Busters.

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You should meet us there.

352
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But we have we have really good boundaries.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I was like, and I was like, I don't think I feel comfortable.

354
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't feel up to it today.

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So that was my one opportunity.

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But yeah, I love the Chinese theater.

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I love, you know, I love the the theater.

358
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's the theater where they have the Kodak theater, right?

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is it Dolby currently or has it changed again?

360
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So don't go there.

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's like aging.

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm aging myself.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's a way back.

365
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They started holding the Oscars there.

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't remember now.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There's something like a camera.

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where the slap happened.

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's really.

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, yeah.

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They should call it the slap theater.

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
At the slap theater.

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What about the slap theater?

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's like like how the Laugh Factory should just be called the Michael Richards place.

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So should the whatever theater just be called the slap theater?

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You want landmarks in Hollywood and Los Angeles at large to be named after the most infamous thing that happened?

378
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why I want the Tello's to be just called Blake's.

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Just call it Blake's.

381
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Does Robert Blake own it?

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No.

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's where he went to go get his gun.

385
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Right.

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I take him at his word.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's his alibi.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

390
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Proven not guilty.

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I believe it.

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I believe in it.

393
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Sure.

394
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Wow.

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Of all things, there's a Muji.

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do you know Muji?

397
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Japanese department store.

398
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Right block pass like Hollywood and the Highland.

399
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Really?

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like kind of attached to it.

401
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And it's a lot.

402
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They have clothes and home goods and stuff.

403
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But I think got big in America for their like journals and pens and stuff.

404
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay.

405
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like kind of high end stationery.

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So you can get journals and pens at Hollywood and Highland now?

407
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was looking at the journals and pens once.

409
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let me get a quick journal real quick.

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He's like, I have a thought.

411
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I need to jot it down right now.

412
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was in there once and a man was kind of like, you know, picking up a box of pen and he had a sack of journals and stuff.

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was looking around.

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I was like, oh, what is that smell?

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And this man had very clearly shit his pants.

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, okay.

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was very, but he didn't look like just, you know, Hollywood.

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He just seemed like a guy.

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What if he had to shit his pants?

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He's like, I'll just go where that happens a lot.

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So no one knows.

422
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, there.

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's time it doesn't.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So we went to the very like calm, like chill Japanese department store to do it.

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I went, I have enough pens and just put everything down and walked out.

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know what's going on here, but I don't want any part of it.

427
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want to go back to my car and go home.

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think it's important to remember anyone can shit their pants at any time.

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes.

430
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No.

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And that is likely what the realization that horrified me of like this could be me at any moment.

432
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But I think you would not just continue shopping.

433
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, hold on.

434
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If the pens or the notepads were very good.

435
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If there's no one at the register, I might go ring up some, get some pens.

436
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I might sign up for the loyalty program if no one's paying me any mind.

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sign up for a loyalty program with pants full of shit.

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, it's already there.

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm not coming back.

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There's no coming back from this.

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh my God.

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's an interesting spot, Hollywood and Highlands.

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes.

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But not to sidetrack too much.

445
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I brought up that context of you and your history running the show with Madame Tussauds

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because this led to this other chapter of your career besides your comedy career,

447
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
which has taken off since.

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You also have kept a foot in the themed entertainment neck of the woods.

449
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Brought your expertise from that into today's main topic, the Warner Brothers studio tour.

450
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Absolutely.

451
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

452
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That was a big deal because I was in it from the beginning.

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I opened this, not the tour itself, but what they call Stage 48 is the script to screen experience.

454
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And it was a new installment into the Warner Brothers tour.

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I got recruited over there to do it.

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But it was directly related to my Wax Museum career.

457
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This was basically just kind of like going from writing on one show to another.

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was not the same company, but people were talking.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They were hearing about me at Wax Place.

460
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
At the Wax Place I worked at, at Madame Tussauds.

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And then I got recruited out of there.

462
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of fun.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you're listening, audience, you should listen to this episode right after the other one

464
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
because it's basically like there was a continuation of my life after that.

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
After my experience at Madame Tussauds.

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You were poached.

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You were like headhunters.

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Did I tell you all that?

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Or do we talk about that?

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You teased a little at the end of what had happened.

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, basically I was doing very well.

473
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So this is where it gets a little complicated, but I'm going to explain this only once.

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And don't ask no questions.

475
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's like a very specific thing that companies do a lot.

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But I think it makes it hard to talk about the Warner Brothers thing without explaining this part.

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So basically I worked at Madame Tussauds, a company that's owned by Merlin Entertainment,

478
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
which has a bunch of theme parks in the UK and all over the world.

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I was a manager there and for a long time I ran the photo department,

480
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
the people who would take your picture when you walk in.

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But the people who provided that equipment is a company called Pixov, right?

482
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So Pixov, they do them at Six Flags, at Legoland.

483
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
They're the ones who's basically operating the photos

484
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and then sort of trying to sell you at the end.

485
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Figuring out how to, do they give you a card with the codes that you can have the opportunity later

486
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and storing and managing all that.

487
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And is it green screen?

488
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, they install the green screen.

489
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And whenever we had tech issues, that's who we were calling.

490
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So the person, Jessica, who was kind of like the liaison for Pixov,

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
we worked together for years while I was working at the Wax Museum.

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So she's the one who basically, she knew me very well.

493
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And she was like, we're opening up.

494
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And this was like, had to be secret because they were literally poaching me like underneath Merlin's nose.

495
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Merlin the wizard.

496
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm a wizard, I should understand it.

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You should have had a sense that it was happening.

498
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, yeah, some wizard he is.

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So she took me out to dinner up in the motherfucking, speak at Hollywood Boulevard

500
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
because she comes into town every quarter.

501
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And she'll take me out because they kind of woo us, they want to keep us as clients.

502
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And she's super cool.

503
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And one of those girls who is always injured because she is always climbing mountains and doing crazy shit.

504
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Like every time I see her, she has like a boot on her leg or like crutches, but she's awesome.

505
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So she takes me to dinner at that Japanese restaurant that's on the hill up in.

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

507
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yamashiro.

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

509
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can see the whole city from there.

510
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

511
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I felt so cool.

512
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, it was heavily, it was super immersive and yeah, just like transportive environment.

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And they have like a giant Buddha like statue and you can walk around like the Zen Garden and all that.

514
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Food is OK.

516
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, that's probably what you're there for.

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
We've talked about it many times on the show.

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The better the theming, probably the worse the food.

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But yeah, cool place to be for sure.

520
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So she was like, yo, I'm just between us, but we made a deal with Warner Brothers.

521
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We're going to open up this new experience inside the tour.

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So basically the tour will drop them off into this place and experience the script to screen thing.

523
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And they're going to get to ride the Bat Bike and they'll ride Harry Potter.

524
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And we have this really cool technology where you get to take the video home and it's awesome.

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Right. I'm like, this is dope.

526
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And but I was like really loyal to the way, you know, I'm the wax man.

527
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I was like, I was like, Jessica, I can't believe you would try to take me away from them like that.

528
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And she's like, I know, I know.

529
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Look, we just love you a big fans.

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm like, look, I don't know.

531
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Let me think about it.

532
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Also, I'm thinking like, I don't want to if I do this, I'm just forgetting my comedy career.

533
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I was just like in this headspace of like, if I don't stop taking these jobs, I'm just going to do this forever.

534
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What year are we talking about?

535
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is twenty twenty fourteen.

536
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So this is like twenty fourteen and up to twenty fifteen.

537
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah. So I was like really conflicted and also like I'm such a I hate conflicts.

538
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I was like, I don't even know how I would tell my my boss's stuff.

539
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Who was, you know, he's I told you last, he's like a short British guy who cusses a lot.

540
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Like I was like terrified of him.

541
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I was like, I don't know.

542
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, I'll think about it.

543
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So a couple of months go by, then she they make an offer and it was pretty good.

544
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I mean, at the time, I was like, I was like, I've never seen any money like this.

545
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I mean, I was making like fifteen dollars an hour running a whole museum.

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So I'm like, I wouldn't get paid shit.

547
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I mean, at the time, I just was more like just trying to survive.

548
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Right. And then but the money they were offering was like, I mean, it didn't even compare.

549
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It was just like, oh, this is like a career job.

550
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So I went to my boss and went to his office and I was like, you know, like picks off.

551
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
They offer made me this offer.

552
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But, you know, because I kind of looked down like a mentor a little bit to just like, what should I do really?

553
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And he was like, he was like, how much they paying you?

554
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I showed him. He was like, you got to take that.

555
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
He was like, we're not going to match this.

556
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I was like, oh, shit.

557
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So then I was like, so now I'm like, I got his blessing.

558
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But now I'm like, man, I don't want to open up a whole.

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm responsible for this site and I'm trying to do comedy.

560
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm doing improv.

561
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Like I was back when I was doing one love improv at like 11 p.m. on a Monday.

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's just like surely grinding on that shit.

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I was like, but but it's just I had no money.

564
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I mean, I was like, I need to live like and like it was, you know, I'm getting older.

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm like, we got to do something.

566
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So I ended up taking it and and basically leaving.

567
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That's when I had a whole little goodbye and all that to mount yourselves.

568
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But it was like directly off of off of that job into this job, which was crazy.

569
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But but yeah. And then we had it like really like I mean, you're talking from the ground up.

570
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Like like they hadn't even built it yet.

571
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So it was like, I don't think I have you ever done anything like that,

572
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
been in a company where something is fully opening, like doing like the ribbon cut in type of thing.

573
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Not done. We don't really.

574
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah. Physical.

575
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We don't do manual labor.

576
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well, we don't do manual labor. That's true.

577
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We don't use our hands.

578
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We use our voices.

579
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah. These are our tools, you see.

580
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
These are our hammers.

581
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's in a lot of ways harder than lifting and doing swinging things.

582
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But is this the whole is this the zone that because I know that the tour leaves from a different like

583
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
it's there's like I don't even I don't know if I know the street,

584
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but there's like a whole like dedicated parking garage facility, little like store, cafe, neck of the woods.

585
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I that that's like a little like cul-de-sac near the studio.

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Or is that what you're talking about? That like that was being built?

587
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Or what is the or is it something within the were you mainly doing like the like a stop within the tour?

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah, it wasn't the whole the entire building hadn't exist yet.

589
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It was like when I so there's there was like gift shops and stuff.

590
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But this was like, OK, you're on the tour.

591
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They take you, you know, because I had I remember writing and I take, you know,

592
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
to where I shoot all this stuff and and Batman and all that.

593
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And then they just stop the tour and you go into this thing.

594
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There is a gift shop in it and that but it's very specific to Harry Potter and the Dark Knight,

595
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
because those were the two sort of like experiences.

596
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's not where the tour begins and ends. That's not.

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah, it's like literally the middle of the OK.

598
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, which is I'll tell you why that's a problem. Oh, big problem.

599
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So OK, so they hire me. I mean, this is like crazy.

600
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean, even as talking about it makes me so uncomfortable because it's like it's like it's just a lot of pressure.

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's like it's like because the company, it just felt like I got a job.

602
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You know what I mean? It's like I got it's like I'm a I'm a corporate man.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Like I'm like, oh, doing this thing.

604
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So they take they send me to Florida because that's where picks off is located.

605
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The original the main headquarters.

606
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And I had to go down there and meet the whole company and like train and stuff.

607
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And they're like in Orlando. I bought this really like fancy.

608
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was like mad, man, like like it was like I had read like a red dress shirt and like a black suit.

609
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I look fly as fuck. Like it was crazy.

610
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But then I go to Florida and it's just I don't know.

611
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It was just fucking so hot, like so humid and like no one is dressed like everyone's wearing like T-shirts and and shorts because they're like we know we live in Florida.

612
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We would never dress like this to work.

613
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And I felt so awkward because I was just in there just like I'm like, you know, like just like trying to, you know, trying to impress them.

614
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But they're like, they're like, bro, you know, you don't need to dress like that here.

615
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then so what they did is they took me to Legoland and because there's a Legoland and where is it?

616
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's not in Orlando, but it's like outside.

617
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's like a winter garden.

618
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yes, it's like it was like an hour away from the old Cypress Garden.

619
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because they took over it.

620
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah. And they changed it to Legoland, which is all part of they wanted their clients, but also another Merlin company.

621
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So it was like still connected to the wax life because there were people.

622
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The person who used to be my boss was running that Legoland at the time.

623
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So I was trying to avoid him.

624
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So but it was so like it was in the country.

625
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But I was like there for like three months, just sort of like they're like training me how to do all the like all the tech stuff that I used to have to call them to do.

626
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But now I'm learning that stuff.

627
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You lived in. Wait, were you based in Orlando or Winter Haven?

628
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Winter Haven. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The company was in Orlando, like the heck where the CEO and stuff.

630
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
He was cool. Like his name is Don.

631
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
He was like he's like I'm like he had the slick back hair.

632
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I was like this. I was like this is it.

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It was such a different vibe from the British because Madison was such a British company.

634
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is like this is like a real American Florida company.

635
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's an hour south of Orlando.

636
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
OK, OK. Oh, weird. So did the trainer came back.

637
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And then this guy Chris was cool guy.

638
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He was like my kind of regional supervisor and he kind of we like just started higher.

639
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like we started doing the group hires and everything.

640
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It was crazy. Like it was like I was like, man, I'm in charge.

641
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm picking my staff, everything.

642
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I'm picking I'm doing like, you know, I'm putting it on.

643
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
This is what this will be important later when I tell you how crazy it got.

644
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But like I'm putting on, you know, as on Craig, listen, you know, just trying to get people to come in.

645
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And it's like very L.A., like local, like not actors or whatever, just like people who want a job.

646
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And they were all really cool.

647
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And like I was like really proud of the staff that I built.

648
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It was like and I poached somebody from Man of Two Souls.

649
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So I took one of one of our employees with me and they were mad about that.

650
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And this was all L.A. and L.A. staff you put together.

651
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah. Yeah. You were done with Florida at that point.

652
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, yeah. I'm back in L.A. now. Yeah. After the train is over.

653
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That was like, yeah, a couple of months, learn how to do the thing.

654
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And now like we're all in Warner Brothers.

655
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So then I go to Warner Brothers and also feel free to join.

656
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I feel like I'm talking too much.

657
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But yeah, like I go to Warner Brothers and the first thing.

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah. LeBron James is there doing the fucking back.

659
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like we have it. It's starting to get built up now.

660
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And they gave him like a private like pre like experience of it.

661
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So he got to like because, you know, I think at the time LeBron had a overall deal with Warner Brothers.

662
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So he was there and he did the back bike and him and his kids and they did it.

663
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And it was like, this is going to be fucking tight.

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's going to be awesome.

665
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
No, it wasn't.

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No, it wasn't.

667
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It wasn't celebrities who topped LeBron James every day.

668
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We start with LeBron.

669
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It only gets better and better.

670
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm like, no.

671
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Can I ask what your height the hierarchy was and what your title was?

672
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah. OK.

673
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So what do you call it?

674
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So the guy, Chris, was like the regional manager.

675
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So he was overseeing all the West Coast.

676
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah, like like there was like a theme park in Arizona and one in San Diego and then one in LA and then what we're doing in LA.

677
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So he was above me.

678
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And then my title was basically like what was it like?

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't want to say store manager, but it was like I was basically like the head of operations.

680
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I guess you are like, yeah, like something that I guess I don't remember.

681
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But I think it was the most senior person in L.A.

682
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

683
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like when we do our we would do these conference calls and it would be so early because it had the people from you who worked in UK on it.

684
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And I'm like the only I was the only West Coast person that was California, West Coast.

685
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Right. And they would I'd be up at like six a.m.

686
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Like on these calls. But I was literally representing.

687
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right. Like I was like representing this this establishment.

688
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
There was no one else speaking for it.

689
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And that was like really intense.

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But we were like they but they were all excited because I did such a good they heard about me through the man of two souls.

691
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So they knew like I had a pretty good rep.

692
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So they were like it was kind of like they they're like it's like Paul George going to the Sixers like we heard about you.

693
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, is it going to work?

694
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No.

695
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because there is a Warner Brothers studio tour in London.

696
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You know what you mean?

697
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't know that. Oh, there is.

698
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There is a Harry Potter thing.

699
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think they do something there.

701
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And also they also work that like all the mountains all that because they have this huge partnership with Merlin.

702
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So they're like the London Eye and the Whack Madame Tussauds in London.

703
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They were also working on.

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So I was still kind of weirdly in the world of Madame Tussauds even though I wasn't working for them anymore.

705
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
All through Pixar.

706
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And Pixar was not previously part of the tour.

707
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It was that like they were going to establish this new thing that is a way to get like photo opportunities.

708
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Exactly.

709
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
With Bat-Bike and Harry Potter and others.

710
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's so strange.

711
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So more of an American.

712
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So that the tour is not just like hey look at that soundstay.

713
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's where they did Friends.

714
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Can I go in?

715
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No. Okay.

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You keep going.

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's so that you get like something like physical and tactile.

718
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

719
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You know, guaranteed when you take this tour.

720
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And they do it like it's like in this way.

721
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
In this way that's like it's literally script to screen.

722
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Like you're like it's script to screen.

723
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's an experience that's script to screen.

724
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It starts with like the script process and there's like literally scripts that you can look at.

725
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like they have like memorialized.

726
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And then you go into like casting.

727
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
A section about casting.

728
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And then you get to sit on the Friends couch and like and they pretend to be like you're with your friends.

729
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Pretend you have friends.

730
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah.

731
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And then you go into the experience which is like the Harry Potter broom where you basically get on the broom and you're just riding it through quit.

732
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What is it called?

733
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Quit.

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I should know this.

735
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The Quidditch game.

736
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah.

737
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You're right.

738
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And then the bat bike is like you're riding through the dark night.

739
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That truck scene basically.

740
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So then.

741
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But basically.

742
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What they would do is like because they don't want it to be no separation.

743
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So it was like we got we had to wear.

744
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's like everyone's wearing the uniform of a Warner Brothers tour guide.

745
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So it's like you wouldn't as a customer wouldn't know that these people are working for another company.

746
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's like we're all kind of seamless.

747
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah.

748
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Like the scripts to screen experience.

749
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
One seamless process.

750
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The magic of the movie.

751
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Probably with magic.

752
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:54,000
But let me tell you like that place Warner Brothers as a studio is like very when I say I am saying using the word conservative in a loose way like just like very strict like not like they don't mess around.

753
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like it's like very much like everything's got to be buttoned up.

754
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It was just like a lot of rules and stuff.

755
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So now I'm like coming in picks off guy and I got all these L.A. like people straight from like Crenshaw like you know like you know like real humans.

756
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.

757
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But it's like you know they got their hair dyed and they're like I mean they're like people that I would that are like OK this is this is real L.A.

758
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah.

759
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And it's I mean it's so fast a fascinating and I think the people they've hired for the tours are more like attractive kind of not that my people I mean my people were attracted.

760
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I shouldn't be talking about that.

761
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I mean like they're like you know put together but they get like the clean cut.

762
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah like you know actor types like good posture white.

763
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm trying to like I'm not trying to call them raises but but but it's like you know there was a clear difference like it would be like you go on a tour and it's all these like it's like these beautiful you know like crispy actor white actors.

764
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And then you come into my area and it's like it's like it's like diverse and like cool like like hip street hip hop music starts playing out.

765
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But it's like it's like it's like oh there's like a clear it's like if you were for the shirts it's like a clear shift right.

766
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Right.

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And it did feel like we were like if we felt like not a part of the thing it was like and they are so we was like in the beginning it was kind of like we were kind of I mean think of it like we were like the bad news.

768
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Bears kind of thing like we were like they were like they weren't like you don't belong.

769
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But it was like it did feel kind of like we was like just this like outcast a little bit like all of us me and the whole staff and everybody because one day had their own setup already and we're like coming in with this new thing.

770
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Right.

771
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And it was kind of like a Disney movie.

772
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So then but no one had faith in like they just thought we were just ruining the you know the vibe.

773
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But we were like cool like I mean you know we come in you know I'm like afraid to say I will go back and cut some stuff out if I have to.

774
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Sure yeah.

775
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Like one girl had it like you know it's just funny to me like as someone who like doesn't give a fuck anymore looking back.

776
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But it's like you know one girl had she got the pants kind of low waist with this the thong showing you know how they do it when it's like it's like a little bit of that and it's kind of like you know my boss would cut the not my not my boss it picks off but the Warner Brothers boss would be like can you you know go talk to your employee.

777
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But I'm like it's cool.

778
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You have to have that conversation.

779
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah I'm like I don't know I'm like this is I'm like let them be I'm kind of I'm all like let everyone be who they are.

780
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That's how I'm feeling.

781
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Sure.

782
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And but you know it's like we got one standard one rule like that.

783
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So are you joining then this is like this new outpost and the rest of the tour is like Hollywood magic robots who've been doing it for 20 years.

784
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Right.

785
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Who are who are buttoned up and potland like because they're yeah there's a way that tour guides can be just like yeah super slick and kind of yeah like like cyborgs.

786
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

787
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And you and you guys are not as.

788
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah we're like we're just more like you know just like chill like I don't know it was just a reflection of me basically.

789
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It was just like I just hired what I thought who I want to hang out with you know not thinking about what they're doing over there.

790
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And also I think I kind of was avoiding maybe I subconsciously avoiding hiring actors or not hiring people that wanted to be in Hollywood.

791
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Right.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Because that was an issue for me at the Max Museum where they would always leave and go on audition.

793
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So I was like I just want people who just need a job and want to work.

794
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So it felt like more like the working class or whatever.

795
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Right. But but no disrespect to either side.

796
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Whatever you do is good.

797
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I support it.

798
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But so you know it was kind of like there was just this energy where they were like we ain't fucking with y'all kind of you know I mean and but we hadn't opened up yet.

799
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So yeah so there was so much pressure on it and like it really felt like they had Mighty Ducks 3 where it's like because it's like it was like you know how to like they just want.

800
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's what I'm trying to think of.

801
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
We're like you know how they came into the school.

802
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They weren't like it wasn't like it was like they were kind of like yeah we're like a ragtag group of people.

803
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And it's like you're only at this school because they're trying to like make the school look cool or whatever.

804
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But you guys don't really belong here.

805
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I haven't actually seen D3.

806
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Is that is it's like a kind of a stuffy boarding school kind of environment.

807
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then the yes but the but the ragtag Mighty Ducks have a different vibe.

808
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I mean I'm going off of D2.

809
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Is it called D3?

810
00:41:46,000 --> 00:42:02,000
D2 where there's the evil Icelandic team who are a very very stiff shirt buttoned up and who don't appreciate the odd idiosyncrasies of the Mighty Ducks.

811
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That's right.

812
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's a similar thing.

813
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Yeah.

814
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It was nothing like nothing that we need to like you know tweet tweet about or anything.

815
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But like it was just like it was just like OK we got a different vibe coming in.

816
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We're not we're not we're not cut from the same cloth.

817
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It was like goodbye.

818
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But this is the makings of a great story where you have the underdog story where you turn around and show them you had you always had it the whole time.

819
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Man let's get into it.

820
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes.

821
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes.

822
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Did you have it.

823
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Did the underdogs rule the day.

824
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Triumph here at the end.

825
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We just killed all of them.

826
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Are we going to sneak in and fuck up the tour.

827
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Because it did start to feel like the tour people versus the inside people.

828
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
The inside the studio.

829
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The State 58 people.

830
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But I don't know what I haven't worked there in like years.

831
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I have no idea what's going on there.

832
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah.

833
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is yeah it's like 20.

834
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Now it's we're in 2015 now.

835
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
A lot of turnover.

836
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I bet.

837
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah.

838
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah.

839
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

840
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I mean that those jobs turn over like crazy anyway.

841
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Sure.

842
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sure.

843
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So we so now it's like all this pressure and people are like you know we got this big it was kind of like a friends and family kind of event where they're going to try it all out for the first time.

844
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So I got everybody trained up you know I'm like feeling good.

845
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We got the everything working and it's like all right.

846
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Like this is like our big like our big showcase to show everybody who we are.

847
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
What why they brought us here because we ain't fucking around.

848
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I mean fuck everybody gave everyone.

849
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

850
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I was like man.

851
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Fuck.

852
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Like this is our shit.

853
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's show them who we are.

854
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You know what I'm saying.

855
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So because it was just weird like I mean it's like but that's a weird thing anyway.

856
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's why I always explain that did that difference of like the company within a company.

857
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Right.

858
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Because you're like we don't work for them but it's like we work at the same place.

859
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Like there's one like it's like they would even get mad.

860
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well I don't know.

861
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
OK.

862
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But so then.

863
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
All right.

864
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Here comes his friends and family night and I'll just take it as a friends and family night.

865
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I invited all my homies from Madame Tussauds.

866
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
They came through my old boss came through.

867
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
He wanted to check it out.

868
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So it was great.

869
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It was great.

870
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And then but what I didn't know it was like also supposed to be like a stress stress test

871
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
for that for the thing.

872
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So we watched Bar Rescue.

873
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We know about stress test.

874
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah.

875
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah.

876
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's where it can all fall apart.

877
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Right.

878
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh man.

879
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It does.

880
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah.

881
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's like it's like you're stressing me out.

882
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The bike back to the back bike tipped over.

883
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
He got crushed by the bike.

884
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Shut it down.

885
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Shut it all down.

886
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Shut down.

887
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I want it all shut down.

888
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
He flew off the broom.

889
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
He flew off the broom.

890
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
He's flying around the whole building.

891
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Custodial is using the broom to clean.

892
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
They stole the broom.

893
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's a broom.

894
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's getting real dirt on it.

895
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh man.

896
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It was great.

897
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And so it started off great.

898
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And it was like holy shit.

899
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It's like it's got to be.

900
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I mean I found out later it was like three thousand people.

901
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Wow.

902
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
They sent through this thing.

903
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

904
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

905
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm like why is there so many people here?

906
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And it's also like in a matter of like a few hours.

907
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And it's just our shit is not handled.

908
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Our tech stuff is not handling it at all.

909
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Right.

910
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Because we never hadn't.

911
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We stressed this I guess.

912
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But we're like.

913
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So now everyone's.

914
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's hype.

915
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Like people are loving it.

916
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's hype.

917
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's hype.

918
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's hype.

919
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's hype.

920
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's hype.

921
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's hype.

922
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's hype.

923
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's hype.

924
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's hype.

925
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's hype.

926
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's hype.

927
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's hype.

928
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's hype.

929
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's hype.

930
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's hype.

931
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's hype.

932
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So that was it's hype.

933
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Like people are loving it like like emotionally loving this experience.

934
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So I'm like happy about that.

935
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But then now they can't get the video of it to take home and the pictures because it's

936
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
basically what happened is the way it was sending to the computer was all out of order.

937
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So every time someone come up the arc my employee would have to go through the whole everything

938
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
that's taken.

939
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Look at physically looking at them and trying to find their picture in the computer.

940
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And it took out.

941
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I mean it took forever.

942
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So like I mean there was a point where there was I mean the entire tour was just stuff

943
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
right.

944
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And it was because they kept driving people off like and it was the whole building was

945
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
packed and people were pissed like and complaining.

946
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And it was just and I did is nothing I could do because it was it wasn't really anything

947
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I could do because it was a tech issue.

948
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah.

949
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And you know I'm calling them like they're all in Florida like and it's like nine o'clock

950
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
on East West Coast time.

951
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So it's like midnight over there.

952
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm like I'm like yo we need help man this is going crazy.

953
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Why we brought you to Winter Haven so you wouldn't have to ask these questions.

954
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We changed you in Winter Haven.

955
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You learned nothing in Winter Haven.

956
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I was like they don't respect women in Winter Haven.

957
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So then I'm like yo what the fuck.

958
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
OK so now I'm like just trying to you know I'm like just telling you know just keep trying

959
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to keep people happy and whatever.

960
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm running around I'm like you know trying to help them out and jumping on registers

961
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
and stuff.

962
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And then my boss who's like this like cool slick back guy not my picks off boss but

963
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the guy who runs the whole tour.

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
He's like he's like he does the like Lamar come with me and I'm like oh man I'm like

965
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
this is bad.

966
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
He's like and he just man he let me have it.

967
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm getting emotional now because I started crying like because he was like he was like

968
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
this is unacceptable.

969
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Like you know just a full like I just you know just like I've never in my life seen

970
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
anything like this just like dressing me down.

971
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And I was like I'm like I don't even want to be here.

972
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I want to be a comedian.

973
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And I'm just like in the cry ball the choke and I'm like I'm like a full failure right

974
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
here.

975
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And then so and it was like also they all have now they really feel like you know we

976
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
really don't belong here now.

977
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because now all the tour guys people they're mad even though they're I don't know why they

978
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
care so much but they're like you're ruining the tour for all the people you know like

979
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
the tour has been going so well except for the stage 48 or whatever.

980
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And I'm like yo man chill out.

981
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Anyway so.

982
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's like a mean kids camp.

983
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

984
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And they're shitting all over the meatballs.

985
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Do they call themselves the meatballs in the movie meatballs?

986
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know.

987
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I don't know.

988
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well let's just say they do.

989
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You guys are the meatballs.

990
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You mean well.

991
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah yeah you mean well but.

992
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
This is a test.

993
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This is a test night.

994
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah.

995
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That's what I'm saying.

996
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I know.

997
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Maybe that's why you test.

998
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You know it is you are right it is very strange to put that sort of thing in the middle of

999
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
the door.

1000
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

1001
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Because I've been like on tours and stuff like the NBC one at Rockefeller Plaza.

1002
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The Rock.

1003
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
In New York.

1004
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Thirty.

1005
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Seven seasons.

1006
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Do you know what it is?

1007
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I was tripped up on Plaza Center.

1008
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Both.

1009
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Both.

1010
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Sure.

1011
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And the green screen thing was right at the end.

1012
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Right.

1013
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So that if people didn't want to do it they're like all right I'm just going to leave.

1014
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'm going to buy a t-shirt and then leave.

1015
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm going to buy a today shirt.

1016
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to buy my full length Matt Lauer tee.

1017
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And then leave.

1018
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's a long tee.

1019
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh it's a tall tee.

1020
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So it's nearly his full size.

1021
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Get this your fired mug which I will cherish always.

1022
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
This phrase will always mean a lot to me.

1023
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'll never have different feelings about the host of this show.

1024
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But yeah right in the middle then it's holding up the back half.

1025
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And it was it did everyone get the pictures and video or was it like a money ad.

1026
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh yeah yeah.

1027
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Oh no wait.

1028
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Were things included?

1029
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It was free.

1030
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah it was free.

1031
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Okay.

1032
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah so nobody was spending money but also that also means everybody wants to do it.

1033
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Like nobody was skipping it.

1034
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So it was just like yeah we were giving them away but it was like it was like fuck like there's nothing we can do here.

1035
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And then then we just started having to eventually we got it fixed.

1036
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But it was by that point it had already died down the guest count and stuff.

1037
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And so we failed that test man.

1038
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I was like I'm about to get fired.

1039
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
This is crazy.

1040
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And then and then we we know we we know the CEO the guy Don he had to come out like it was we were in trouble.

1041
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It was crazy like so he came out and had had it like you know calm everybody down and like we had this meeting where it was like you know like kind of what went wrong.

1042
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You know like the inquiry was that call when you when you go back like the mission and I love it.

1043
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It's like it was like what the hell happened.

1044
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's like ultimately it was like also like it wasn't really on me.

1045
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You know it really was just like the equipment just couldn't handle all that people.

1046
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It was just like not made for that.

1047
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So like you know in a normal day you're not getting a thousand people coming in.

1048
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Right.

1049
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So but ultimately like we squashed it all got our shit together opened up and then we started making money money.

1050
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And like it was just like now we're like number one.

1051
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We end up becoming number one and out of all the picks off thing and everybody was doing it because we were like because I knew what I was.

1052
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I mean I knew what I was because I brought a lot of the what I did at the BACS exam over to it.

1053
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And it was like the price is everything was just perfect.

1054
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Like we were just like cashing out and everybody was like dang like nobody could say shit.

1055
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You know because we were like now we're fucking taking out on you.

1056
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And then and it was great.

1057
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And then that was like probably two months of doing that.

1058
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And then my friend Phil hit me up like yo are you still looking for a job?

1059
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And then like I was and then I met with this show runner for Survivors of Morris just thinking you know long shot like he read my pilot or whatever.

1060
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And then he's like hired me.

1061
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And then I like basically was like I got to start work next.

1062
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It was like the next week.

1063
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So I just left.

1064
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I was like oh and I was like yeah I was like I was like a real Hollywood situation where I was just saying I'm out of here.

1065
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm out of here y'all sorry.

1066
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
My dreams just came true.

1067
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I was like literally script to screen like I was like I'm out of here.

1068
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So and so I left my they were all happy for me.

1069
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I mean the picks off we were happy because they knew I want they knew they knew that about me.

1070
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
But I was like but it was like I had like I felt bad for the employees because we felt like we built a little community and I was like I got to go.

1071
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But so I haven't been back since so I don't know what it's like now.

1072
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Did you ever like fantasize that you would like be on the actual tour where you're on the tram and then you just step off with like a packet and you'd be like I'm in this building now.

1073
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I work here.

1074
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm a writer.

1075
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah.

1076
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I do fantasize about.

1077
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I might I probably have more because I have less of a connection to that place but more.

1078
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But I have more of a fantasy of becoming a wax figure like famous enough one day.

1079
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
That's where they like put me in my uniform.

1080
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I got the manager like with the walkie talkie and they could be like that's he used to work here or something like that.

1081
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That would be cool.

1082
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But that's if you write if you write the pilot and the smash hit show about working at the wax museum.

1083
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And then your character is so iconic the wax museum guy and then the character and you and characters put into the wax museum.

1084
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That would be in the spot where you worked and where it was all based on.

1085
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I mean it's funny because the possibility that is not that unlikely.

1086
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yeah it's like very like I'm working on something when the wax man has nine successful seasons on Peacock.

1087
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I just I did this tour a couple of months ago.

1088
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We got invited to this or I got invited to this.

1089
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I don't know why actually.

1090
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Usually I have to beg to get invited to things and this just came into the into the inbox.

1091
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I think weirdly I thought this had come through Lamar like this episode was brewing and he hit up his contacts and he set us up with some sort of VIP.

1092
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You had nothing to do.

1093
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I have no news to you.

1094
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
All right.

1095
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
OK.

1096
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
No thanks required.

1097
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah.

1098
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Really. So I was just out of nowhere.

1099
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yeah.

1100
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I don't know.

1101
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
There's like a mysterious benefactor.

1102
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I think there's some listeners over there.

1103
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Maybe.

1104
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But no one like no one like DM to me like hey heads up I'm going to send you an invite to this because this was a big event.

1105
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Ben Menkowitz was there.

1106
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
This was a whole thing.

1107
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I sat outside.

1108
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
There were there were pastries.

1109
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I didn't know that all this I knew like there was going to be a little presentation of something but there was like food and stuff.

1110
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah.

1111
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Is this because they have recently opened something with TCM components.

1112
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yes.

1113
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Well I don't know.

1114
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's why the thing happened.

1115
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That's not why we were invited because it's not.

1116
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It wasn't because that stuff is new that there's new like this videos that you watch that are TCM.

1117
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah.

1118
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm just saying that is why people were invited but I still don't know our direct connection to why we got invited.

1119
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't know.

1120
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Is that maybe they list the you know.

1121
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We're the top dogs in the entertainment game and they got new TCM stuff.

1122
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah.

1123
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They probably went out to talk about it.

1124
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We're doing it.

1125
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We're doing it.

1126
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Geez.

1127
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Well now I feel pressure that we're fulfilling the other end of some kind of invited.

1128
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Well at the very least I didn't beg like I usually have to on the show.

1129
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I beg for I beg for press invites the things on this.

1130
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm pathetic on the show.

1131
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Please let us come for free.

1132
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We want a free drink please.

1133
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Your knees are unscuffed.

1134
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You haven't been on the ground groveling lately.

1135
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Your knees look fantastic.

1136
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Thank you.

1137
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I mean I'm also curious if the employee you know if there's anyone still working there that I use.

1138
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And I hired everybody.

1139
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Carl worked there.

1140
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh yeah.

1141
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
For a little bit.

1142
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't know if you know.

1143
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Carl Turner?

1144
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah Carl Turner.

1145
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Wow.

1146
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I had all the homies for a little bit.

1147
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Vlad and like yeah they were all it was it was fun for a bit.

1148
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
What did Carl do?

1149
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He was he was taking the pictures like you know he was like you know like right go to the left go to you know.

1150
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Because let me not to get too far away from what Mike's talking about but like I as you've been talking I looked up like Warner Brothers Studio Batpod.

1151
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And what I found is that people have posted this on YouTube that it's you get like a minute long sequence where it's footage from the move from Dark Knight like you were saying intercut with like you know here's real footage.

1152
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And then there's it'll go to a kid and he's on the.

1153
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
What do you call it?

1154
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Batpod?

1155
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Batpike?

1156
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah.

1157
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah there you go.

1158
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But like the cameras like the cameras moving and the bikes moving it actually blends really well.

1159
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And you can tell that the kid is getting direction like look up look down okay now make a face like whew like wipe sweat off like oh barely avoided that truck.

1160
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Oh and then he's shaking his fist like oh hey Joker get back here.

1161
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So that's just so Carl's doing that stuff.

1162
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah.

1163
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Directions for kids.

1164
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's something we came up we came up with the direct so I could take a little credit for that like.

1165
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Here's some of the things you can tell them to do.

1166
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Right.

1167
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But Carl in that you know these guys you know they're performers so they're they're having they're like killing it in there like because they're directing them to all types because if you don't tell them they'll just sit there.

1168
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Right.

1169
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And then they'll see the video and be like I don't want that.

1170
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This thing.

1171
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I don't want me listlessly riding a batbike.

1172
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Looking sick.

1173
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Also kids you probably get like they're excited to do it and then once they get there and there is a light on them.

1174
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
They're terrifying and your entire family's watching you like I mean it's pretty well.

1175
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Things like that then terrified me so much more than like a full audience today.

1176
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:29,000
You like things like that when you were a kid feel like I am now I am suddenly doing a recital at Carnegie Hall and everybody paid to come here but I forgot to have a talent to do.

1177
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Right.

1178
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And I'm going to I'm going to be laughed at and I'm going to pee my pants like anything like anything of that nature.

1179
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That's the video I did with my mom in Disney World the Gloria Stefan song and I'm sitting singing karaoke with my mom on this video you bought it at MGM Studios and I'm just grabbing my penis like I'm just like nervously touching myself.

1180
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm not like stimulating me.

1181
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Right.

1182
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I don't know what to do.

1183
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Like you're just like I don't.

1184
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah.

1185
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That's terrifying.

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So I was like I remember being like freaked out that like focuses on me and I don't know what to do.

1187
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't know the song.

1188
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I don't know what's going on.

1189
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Any memory of having to tell an awkward young boy please don't touch your crotch.

1190
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Did that happen for you?

1191
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah.

1192
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It must have some at some point.

1193
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't think you were allowed to do that to you.

1194
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You can't have a Suicide Squad picture and doing that.

1195
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Yeah.

1196
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I feel like parents back then would just be like they had no respect for like you might not want it like it was just like stop being a little like just get out there.

1197
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Yeah.

1198
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It's like like as if like forcing you to do it.

1199
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You'll realize this was fun.

1200
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Right.

1201
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Thank you for making me do that.

1202
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But sometimes I mean I mean this was an interesting thing because it was people from all over the world were coming there.

1203
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So it was like a lot of people from different countries.

1204
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm not sure how much of them were like clocking like it was I'm not sure what they were clocking but it was very interesting seeing different cultures of stuff react to Batman.

1205
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Right.

1206
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I wonder if it's still the bad.

1207
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I mean that feels like almost dated at this point.

1208
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
This is do we know what you did.

1209
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Is it.

1210
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Is this stuff going at all.

1211
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yes.

1212
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
OK.

1213
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It is still going.

1214
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I did not do it.

1215
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I guess I should have done it.

1216
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
But they have.

1217
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Let me see.

1218
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I have a photo of it here.

1219
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah.

1220
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
This is the same.

1221
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah.

1222
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That's kind of a bad photo.

1223
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But that's the bad bike.

1224
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
OK.

1225
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's green screen.

1226
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
That looks the same.

1227
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It looks exactly like it.

1228
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah.

1229
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
This is also a good old demonstration of green screen at all.

1230
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yeah.

1231
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah.

1232
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Yeah.

1233
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah.

1234
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

1235
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah.

1236
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

1237
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah.

1238
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah.

1239
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah.

1240
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah.

1241
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah.

1242
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah.

1243
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1244
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah.

1245
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah.

1246
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1247
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah.

1248
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah.

1249
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah.

1250
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah.

1251
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah.

1252
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah.

1253
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah.

1254
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1255
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yeah.

1256
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah.

1257
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah.

1258
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,060
So the children are at Hogwarts.

1259
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,500
And typically, unless there's students who've been held over, there could be a 40-year-old

1260
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,360
stuck at Hogwarts, being held back many, many years.

1261
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,160
Actually, if you count the Christopher Nolan one, there's been three Batman's.

1262
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Right.

1263
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,200
There's been an Affleck and a Patton.

1264
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,360
Oh, since you mean?

1265
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
Huh?

1266
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
Since then?

1267
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
Since then.

1268
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,680
So there's actually a number of Batman.

1269
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,800
And hundreds of children who've taken this tour.

1270
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,400
Technically, the Batman number is 3,000.

1271
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,240
Yeah, yeah.

1272
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,640
That'd be still my favorite Batman,

1273
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,720
the Dark Knight classic, I guess, at this point.

1274
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,680
But I do wonder if they were to change it up

1275
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,760
to something else.

1276
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,600
Like, what's up, Warner Brothers?

1277
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,360
They got all types of properties.

1278
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,720
I mean, you could do anything.

1279
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,480
Oh, Dr. Pimple Popper.

1280
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,280
What's all the stuff they like now?

1281
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,760
It's hard.

1282
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,280
I mean, a lot of it's been thrown in the trash can,

1283
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,160
I think, at this point.

1284
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

1285
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,880
Yeah.

1286
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,720
Zazlov.

1287
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,560
He's throwing it away.

1288
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,520
Is Vanderpump in that umbrella?

1289
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,360
Oh, maybe.

1290
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,400
I don't remember the ownership of Vanderpump.

1291
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,120
You're gonna be in the bar yelling at someone.

1292
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,440
Everything is still Batman heavy,

1293
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,320
like DC heavy, Batman heavy.

1294
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,120
They have like models of the Batman Forever Batmobile,

1295
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,680
which is cool.

1296
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,200
They have the original, they have like the Keaton outfit,

1297
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,240
the Christopher Reeve outfit, and then-

1298
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh, that's dope, yeah.

1299
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,320
And they have, I got very excited,

1300
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,240
they have Mr. Free, Arnold's Mr. Free's outfit.

1301
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,480
Oh, yeah.

1302
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,080
Which is really cool, and it was lit up.

1303
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,360
I remember, I used to, some of my awareness of this area

1304
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,000
and the tour zone in general is that I worked

1305
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,400
in this building across the street from the lot.

1306
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,560
Wasn't Warner affiliated, really.

1307
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,520
But like, the nearest Starbucks, I think,

1308
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,240
technically was the Starbucks in the tour.

1309
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,760
Or was it like, there was, all right,

1310
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,240
there's one a little bit closer,

1311
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,480
or there's one that's a little bit further,

1312
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,120
and if we all take a walk over there,

1313
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,800
we can go see the Mr. Free's costume before we get our coffee,

1314
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,520
and we would always choose that one,

1315
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,800
despite it being further.

1316
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,640
Yeah.

1317
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,480
What a little boost to the,

1318
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,760
that's better than a caffeine boost,

1319
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,920
is seeing the real, the lit up Mr. Free's 100%.

1320
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,760
Yeah, it's so cool.

1321
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,200
It's actually a pretty dope costume, I mean.

1322
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,040
Yeah.

1323
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,880
That movie was insane.

1324
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,720
Yeah.

1325
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,560
It's fun, though.

1326
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,120
It also looks a little shittier than you think

1327
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,520
when you're really like up close.

1328
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,000
You're like, oh, this is like,

1329
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,240
oh, it's falling apart a little bit.

1330
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,760
But like, when it's lit up and you take a picture,

1331
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,120
you go, oh, it looks awesome.

1332
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,960
Yeah.

1333
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,800
Yeah.

1334
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,360
But they've got like, they got a lot of new stuff.

1335
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,200
They have the Pattinson Batman costume.

1336
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,840
Oh, so they, yeah, I should take the tour again.

1337
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,520
They have the Batmobile.

1338
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,800
They have, they have, from Batman versus Superman,

1339
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,480
they have Robin's costume that he was wearing

1340
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,720
when he was killed by the Joker hanging up here,

1341
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,520
if you remember this from Batman versus Superman.

1342
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,880
I have never seen this film.

1343
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,920
I don't think I knew Robin was in this stuff.

1344
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,840
He's not.

1345
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,600
His costume is hanging in the Batcave

1346
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,800
that Batman has hanging there so he reminds himself

1347
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,080
of when Robin was killed by the Joker,

1348
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,560
but Robin is not in there.

1349
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,400
Jesus.

1350
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,240
Gotcha, gotcha.

1351
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,880
That would make storyline in the 1980s in the comics

1352
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,680
that they kind of use as background material in the movie.

1353
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,520
Yes, that Batman wants to torture himself even more

1354
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,920
by having his dead partner's outfit hanging.

1355
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Yeah, I'm just gonna physically put it up

1356
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,680
in a way that's like, he's gone.

1357
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,360
I don't want to bring us down,

1358
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,840
but does he do it in a whimsical Joker way

1359
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,280
or does he just shoot him in the face?

1360
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,720
Well, it's unclear.

1361
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,480
He has, he's spray painted on it.

1362
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,880
It says, ha ha ha, jokes on you, Batman.

1363
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,160
So I guess it's open to interpretation.

1364
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,840
I don't think Affleck says exactly how it went down

1365
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,680
in that movie.

1366
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,360
Okay, so that's the Joker whimsy,

1367
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,040
but the rest was just.

1368
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,720
Yeah, and they got the big part of the plane in here,

1369
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,440
the Batplane, from which one.

1370
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,720
Did they take it to the Gilmore Girls set?

1371
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,800
I feel like that was something I remember doing.

1372
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,760
Is there a Batplane in the Pattinson?

1373
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,800
Is there a plane?

1374
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,200
I didn't actually identify, this is embarrassing.

1375
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,040
I didn't identify.

1376
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,120
I can't remember.

1377
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,320
Because it's not the original Keaton.

1378
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,200
This is like a newer thing.

1379
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,080
I think it's maybe in Dawn of Justice or something

1380
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,240
there's a Batwing, or one of the Snyder movies.

1381
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,280
They do have the Keaton Batmobile.

1382
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,320
That's my ship.

1383
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,200
I remember the McDonald's commercials.

1384
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,040
Oh yeah.

1385
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,840
Weren't we recently having a conversation

1386
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,480
about which Batmobile we would have sex with?

1387
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,800
Yes, that was a topic on this show recently.

1388
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,440
I don't want to make you get in on that,

1389
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,320
but do you have a thought?

1390
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,120
It doesn't have to have sex, just attracted to.

1391
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,960
Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,600
Like the sexiness of it.

1393
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,760
You don't have to go near it.

1394
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,920
Probably the Pattinson one, I think.

1395
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,120
Oh really?

1396
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:32,960
Can you pull it up?

1397
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,800
I don't have a good photo of the Pattinson one.

1398
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,680
I was reminded because I said the Keaton one

1399
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,000
because it has that kind of big nub up front,

1400
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,280
which I feel has.

1401
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,120
It's very phallic.

1402
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah, I think that has some.

1403
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,800
But it could be a nipple as well.

1404
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,400
Yes, you can interpret that.

1405
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,520
You can interpret the nub however you want.

1406
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,800
It's a single nipple on the front of the Batmobile.

1407
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,080
Well of course the nipples come into play

1408
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,800
in Batman and Robin.

1409
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,640
Well that's true too, but we're not,

1410
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,640
yes, that's a different point.

1411
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,480
Yeah.

1412
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,320
Sure.

1413
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,600
Yeah, that's a whole different sex act.

1414
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,480
A pioneer of, yeah, before the Schumacher nipples,

1415
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,360
the car had one giant nipple,

1416
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,960
and that's why I think I have to declare it

1417
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,400
the most attractive.

1418
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,200
I mean that was my first thought,

1419
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,320
but then I was like, I really like the one

1420
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,800
in the Robert Pattinson one.

1421
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,640
Or maybe I just like Robert Pattinson.

1422
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,640
Maybe I just wanna have sex with Robert Pattinson.

1423
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,600
You're inscribing Pattinson.

1424
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,440
Sure, yeah.

1425
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,880
It's cool, cool weird.

1426
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,160
Just a couple, they have the Toon Squad jersey here

1427
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,720
from the first Space Jam.

1428
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,320
Nice, nice.

1429
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,160
They have a big Selena.

1430
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,040
Did they have Algie Rhythm's bomber jacket

1431
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,400
from the second Space Jam?

1432
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,240
Don Cheadle's Algie Rhythm bomber jacket.

1433
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,320
I didn't see it there.

1434
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,160
Hey wait a minute,

1435
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,520
there was a problem on the server

1436
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,360
when Lamar was trying to do his thing

1437
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,400
and do the Friends and Family.

1438
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,360
There was a big mysterious tech problem

1439
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,880
on the Warner Brothers lot.

1440
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,080
It was probably the nefarious Algie Rhythm

1441
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,920
from Space Jam.

1442
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,000
That's played by Don Cheadle,

1443
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,680
who lives in the WB server verse

1444
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,520
and messes everything up.

1445
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,600
From Space Jam 2, a new legacy.

1446
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,040
2015.

1447
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,040
He was in there, that was.

1448
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,720
Dude, are you implying he escaped

1449
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,560
and in the current news site,

1450
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,760
he is responsible for the worldwide computer.

1451
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh yes, the recent, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,840
I mean, I think, I don't remember how.

1453
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,640
They never stopped him, right?

1454
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,520
See, I don't know because I fell asleep

1455
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,640
the hardest you could possibly fall asleep

1456
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,360
while watching Space Jam, a new legacy.

1457
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,360
So I don't actually know what became of.

1458
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,400
Me too, I fell asleep right before I found out

1459
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,000
if they won or not.

1460
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,400
I know the game, but I'm like.

1461
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,560
They won, Bugs Bunny dies

1462
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,280
and then comes back to life

1463
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,680
and it's not really, it's like,

1464
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,080
I don't know what happens. Oh yeah, he does die.

1465
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,400
He comes back to life, like a camera cut later.

1466
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,880
I think a computer deletes him, maybe?

1467
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,640
Yeah, you were asked to feel emotion.

1468
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,280
You were asked to, with all of your experiences

1469
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,400
and feelings about Bugs Bunny,

1470
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,760
now process Bugs Bunny's death

1471
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,600
and then unprocess it approximately two minutes later.

1472
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,840
Yeah, the next scene, he's just kind of standing

1473
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,720
in a street corner talking to LeBron and his son.

1474
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,000
Never mind, that was pretty crazy.

1475
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,200
Yeah, did you see the old penguin

1476
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,360
in the watching our basketball game?

1477
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,400
Are you guys gonna play together one day?

1478
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,720
Maybe. They'll get it right

1479
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,600
with the third one, I think.

1480
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,040
Yeah, who's gonna play,

1481
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,480
who's gonna be the basketball player?

1482
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,240
Oh, I don't know, it could be Brawny.

1483
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,440
Yeah, that's true.

1484
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,240
Let's bring Jordan back.

1485
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,920
Yeah, yeah, it's so wild

1486
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,680
when you think of how young basketball players are,

1487
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,920
you're like, yeah, Jordan could totally do it.

1488
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,640
He's very physically healthy.

1489
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
He could totally just play.

1490
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,000
It'd be a great way to follow up on Last Dance, too.

1491
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,240
It's Last Dance Mania, just take it into Space Jam.

1492
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,640
Today's Space Jam 3 is more of a documentary.

1493
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's just doing an interview,

1494
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,480
he's like, so then I had to go back to fight the Monstars.

1495
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,840
Oh, yeah, wait, I wanna, yeah, yeah,

1496
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,760
and the Monstars said they were gonna turn my friends

1497
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,240
into theme park attractions, and I took that personally.

1498
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,080
Yeah.

1499
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,120
And if I see Isaiah Watt Thomas there,

1500
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,160
I'm gonna fight him.

1501
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh, man.

1502
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,840
That's a pretty good idea.

1503
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,400
Talking trash on Bill Murray and.

1504
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,240
Yeah.

1505
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,800
I would totally watch that.

1506
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,640
That sounds good.

1507
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,760
Why didn't you even do that parody,

1508
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,640
they're all about Space Jam.

1509
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,920
Yeah, that sounds like a slam dunk.

1510
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,400
That's the thing, actually, when I, yeah, well, hey.

1511
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,880
What'd you say, Mike?

1512
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,200
That's a good thing.

1513
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,040
To bring up.

1514
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,400
Actually, that is a thing that I think about

1515
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,400
when we pass by,

1516
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,720
because one of the studio in Burbank,

1517
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,040
very close to where we all live,

1518
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,360
that is a thing that I think about now when I pass by it,

1519
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,960
is that the tidbit in The Last Dance

1520
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,800
that when he was filming,

1521
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,840
when Jordan was filming Space Jam that they,

1522
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,920
that was one of his, he's like,

1523
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,000
hey, I need to stay in shape,

1524
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,720
like the movie, whatever, huh, fun,

1525
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,600
but I have to be the best basketball player

1526
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,560
in the world again.

1527
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,000
Can you just build me a court?

1528
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,120
And they go, yeah, sure.

1529
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,760
And then this cut to this immaculate facility

1530
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,440
where all the greatest players,

1531
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,240
everybody traveled to make a point

1532
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,880
of doing these cool private games.

1533
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,320
And that's a thing,

1534
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,080
I've watched that part of it a lot,

1535
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,760
just like that's so crazy that on this studio,

1536
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,040
there was just Michael Jordan's private basketball facility

1537
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,280
where he'd go play four hours after filming all day.

1538
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,400
That's a thing I'd like to know.

1539
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,480
That's the thing I would ask about if I were on the tour,

1540
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,400
is where was the private Jordan facility?

1541
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,680
Oh yeah, that's a great,

1542
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,560
because I'm sure they don't have it on the little plaque.

1543
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,920
And is it somewhere that now official building

1544
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,320
has been built, or is that a long-term question?

1545
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,160
Yeah, I wonder,

1546
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,680
because they must probably turn that stuff

1547
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,440
into other things, I guess, at some point.

1548
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,160
Yeah, yeah, a lot of like,

1549
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,960
any lot has the situation,

1550
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,000
I feel like I was recently talking about how like,

1551
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,320
if any studio lot had a giant Western Sets area,

1552
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,040
that got blown up a long time ago

1553
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,120
to build a fancy new office building or something.

1554
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,600
There's a thing I wanted to bring up

1555
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,560
while we're talking about the tour.

1556
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,760
There's only one,

1557
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,240
I've only seen one source on this ever.

1558
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,800
There's a YouTube channel I think

1559
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,280
called Pardon or Dust or something,

1560
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,960
that brought up how,

1561
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,240
I don't know how far this got,

1562
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,120
but in terms of like,

1563
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,000
tourist attractions on the Warner Brothers Studio tour,

1564
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
have you guys ever heard of this,

1565
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,840
that there was talk of doing something called

1566
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,560
Superhero City?

1567
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,640
And what Superhero City was gonna be,

1568
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,440
is that like,

1569
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,320
I'll get hyper-specific and local.

1570
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,760
If you're like on the Hollywood Way olive entrance,

1571
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,800
basically like,

1572
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,760
Hollywood Way is a big long street,

1573
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,840
takes you all the way from the airport.

1574
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,200
From very far away,

1575
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,120
the street is such that for a while,

1576
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,440
if you're driving south in Burbank,

1577
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,960
you are facing the famous Warner Brothers water tower,

1578
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,520
where the Animaniacs live.

1579
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,000
Which is kind of cool that like,

1580
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,560
that's like looming over the city.

1581
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,400
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of fun,

1582
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,400
because it's like icon from our childhoods.

1583
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,160
But so on that side of the studio,

1584
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,960
basically they were gonna like build around that

1585
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,560
and make that kind of a centerpiece of it.

1586
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,840
But that you would drive onto the studio that way,

1587
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,360
because currently it's all private,

1588
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,520
unless you're doing the tour.

1589
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,840
But they were gonna take a big strip on that side of it

1590
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,320
and make like sort of a city walk.

1591
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,600
A little bit of a city walk,

1592
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,320
like a tourist attraction,

1593
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,200
with stores and restaurants and stuff.

1594
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,640
And as part of this,

1595
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,760
gigantic Batman and gigantic Superman,

1596
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,480
as tall as the surrounding office buildings,

1597
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,600
looming over the studio,

1598
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,480
and a full Batcave that you would have gotten to hang out.

1599
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,920
With like immersive attracts,

1600
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,760
I don't know,

1601
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,960
maybe some little experience like this too,

1602
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,280
where they film you or whatever.

1603
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,080
This is a thing that would change the fabric of the city,

1604
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,680
because it's like a pretty stately kind of classic lot,

1605
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,800
as it is now.

1606
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,920
There's nothing as stupid as giant Batman and Superman,

1607
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,080
like rewarding.

1608
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,520
It's very much like how there were these Disney plans.

1609
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,800
Michael Eisner wanted to build a hotel

1610
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,440
that just looks like a gigantic Mickey Mouse,

1611
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,440
that would have been straddling Riverside Drive.

1612
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,080
And everybody was kind of like that.

1613
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,920
What's that?

1614
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,920
Oh yeah, yeah.

1615
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,760
Everybody's staring,

1616
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,000
yeah everybody's staring up while you're under Mickey's crotch.

1617
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,320
Oh man.

1618
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,160
I love to,

1619
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,440
I feel like Burbank is just like no to all that stuff.

1620
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,280
Maybe,

1621
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,100
because I think,

1622
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,940
yeah there's kind of,

1623
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,780
I don't know,

1624
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,600
there's a style,

1625
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,440
I would like to think,

1626
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,960
there's a style classiness to Burbank,

1627
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,960
and that's all pretty stupid.

1628
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,880
But that's all kind of of the nature of now,

1629
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,440
that there's a big minion overlooking the 101.

1630
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,880
That feels like a pre-minion situation.

1631
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,720
Right, right.

1632
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,560
But they did those,

1633
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,400
a couple years ago,

1634
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,560
they did like Halloween mazes on the studio tour.

1635
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,560
Or I don't know if it was on the tour,

1636
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,480
but it was a separate event.

1637
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,320
But you would go,

1638
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,780
like they made Arkham Asylum in one of the sound stages.

1639
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,120
They only did this one year though.

1640
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,960
2018, yeah.

1641
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,920
So I don't know if it was a bust or what.

1642
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,400
And it's like pre-haunt,

1643
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,520
it's like right around the time

1644
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
when I started going to these.

1645
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,240
So I'm a little upset that I didn't get to do this,

1646
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,960
because it feels like they didn't want to do it ever again.

1647
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,800
Yeah,

1648
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,720
what could have went wrong?

1649
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,560
I mean,

1650
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,400
it's a cool idea.

1651
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
I know, it's pretty, yeah.

1652
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,280
I don't understand that.

1653
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,800
I mean, I guess like,

1654
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,640
I just feel like people,

1655
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,520
it's like the same thing that happens in Hollywood too.

1656
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,520
It's just like,

1657
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,320
they green light a show,

1658
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,160
and then the people who did that got fired.

1659
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,600
And now there's new people who are like,

1660
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,760
I don't want to do that.

1661
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,800
And then they kind of like kill an idea.

1662
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,640
That was cool.

1663
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,460
This is really the thing.

1664
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,080
Can executives just keep their jobs for longer?

1665
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,000
For God's sake.

1666
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,720
It's the story of anybody,

1667
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,360
we know all the biggest shows in the world and movies,

1668
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,760
like then the executive got fired,

1669
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,840
and then we couldn't do it anymore.

1670
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,680
I know.

1671
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,500
Garbage,

1672
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,920
just keep these people in their jobs for longer,

1673
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,900
so people can work,

1674
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,740
God damn it.

1675
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,700
I mean, Burbank,

1676
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,620
they've been,

1677
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,780
different superhero statues have been,

1678
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,860
or at least the Batman one's been popping up,

1679
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:32,860
and I heard tell that there's maybe a Green Lantern

1680
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:35,260
going up at the Empire Center.

1681
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,860
Like there's going to be more.

1682
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,700
Really?

1683
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,180
Yes, I think Green Lantern and Wonder Woman.

1684
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,020
I can't remember.

1685
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,180
I think it's Green Lantern outside the tour.

1686
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,140
Outside of the new episode where you,

1687
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,460
that's like the entrance, exit point

1688
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,300
for the Warner Brothers story.

1689
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,140
The visitors,

1690
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,780
and that's where the Starbucks you would go to.

1691
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,860
No, it moved, actually.

1692
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,700
No, it moved.

1693
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,540
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1694
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,180
There's like a commissary building.

1695
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,100
It used to be over there,

1696
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,620
and then they moved it kind of across the street,

1697
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,980
which that's a little pro tip hack.

1698
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,620
If you don't want to pay for the tour,

1699
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,480
but you just want to kill a little bit of time

1700
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,060
and see some themed bullshit,

1701
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,940
it is free to go into the visitor's center,

1702
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,180
where you don't even have to go in

1703
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,460
to see the Wonder Woman statue,

1704
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,300
and then you can go in and get

1705
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,620
the most expensive Starbucks you could imagine,

1706
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,420
like a big brass Bugs and Daffy,

1707
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,180
and the store you can just walk around.

1708
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,580
Like, we were killing time before dinner one time.

1709
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,940
Like, you want to go see what's in there?

1710
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,500
And then like, I don't know,

1711
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,300
there's like a big Harry Potter bell or something.

1712
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,260
If you like Harry Potter, do you know what,

1713
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,420
oh no, it's a big cup.

1714
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,860
It says Wiz.

1715
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,140
Anyone know what that's about?

1716
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:41,980
No.

1717
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:42,800
All right.

1718
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,640
Like the Wiz?

1719
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,900
Not like the Michael Jackson's Wiz?

1720
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:45,740
No, it's not.

1721
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,780
I don't think it's that,

1722
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,020
unless I'm vastly misinterpreting.

1723
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,820
No, I think this is a Harry Potter thing.

1724
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,700
It's probably the cup.

1725
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,540
The cup.

1726
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,980
Is it the god blade of fire?

1727
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,420
Could be.

1728
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,260
This really shows you.

1729
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,500
Well, yeah, that coffee shop thing is true,

1730
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,020
because when we were doing interviews,

1731
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,540
like we would, I couldn't get into the lot

1732
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,340
because I didn't have access yet.

1733
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,980
That was like the one place we would go and meet,

1734
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,020
because I would do stuff there,

1735
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,340
and that's in that Starbucks,

1736
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,940
and it was like, yeah, you can just walk.

1737
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,900
It wasn't like...

1738
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,340
It's a little bit of free stuff to see, yeah.

1739
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,500
You just gotta do the security screening.

1740
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,260
That's why it's a hassle.

1741
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,300
The current thing, and the one I used to go to at work,

1742
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,140
is that having to get a security screening

1743
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:28,220
in order to get a cup of coffee is very silly.

1744
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,420
But worth it, if you get to see Mr. Freeze.

1745
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:34,100
I do see that one pop up on the app every now and then,

1746
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,860
but years ago, I knew someone who lived over there,

1747
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,480
because there were apartment buildings

1748
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,980
kind of around the Weir brothers' lot,

1749
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,900
and they would talk about walking

1750
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,340
to get Starbucks in the morning.

1751
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,860
I was just like, where the fuck is there a Starbucks

1752
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,420
in that part of Burbank?

1753
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,140
And it turns out, I think they were walking to the visitors

1754
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,460
that they were walking to that Starbucks.

1755
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,380
It seemed like you were very suspicious, or angry,

1756
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,220
or wondering if they were lying.

1757
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,060
I was feeling this.

1758
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,900
Why are people lying to me about this?

1759
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,260
It's a good thing the desks were built,

1760
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,900
counter built into the wall, or would have flipped it.

1761
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,300
Jason, would you be excited to know in the gift shop

1762
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:12,140
you can buy a Wonka's jacket from the new Wonka movie?

1763
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,060
Which, the Chalamet Wonka?

1764
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,660
The Chalamet Wonka, yeah.

1765
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,300
You can buy his jacket.

1766
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,300
It looks a little big.

1767
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,140
Yeah.

1768
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,960
It does look a little big.

1769
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,380
It was on sale.

1770
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:26,380
It was marked down from, I think it was $119.

1771
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,620
It is now $19.99.

1772
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,460
Wow.

1773
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,300
Wow.

1774
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,820
That's so cheap.

1775
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,660
That was a few months ago at this point.

1776
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,860
That's an ambitious ask, I would say.

1777
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,700
Yeah.

1778
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,060
Yeah, I think so.

1779
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,540
Oh yeah, I forgot, sorry, a couple things real quick.

1780
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,340
They have, in the tour, they have Leonard Nimoy's

1781
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,140
cloth napkin from a Big Bang Theory episode.

1782
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,980
Cool.

1783
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,340
Where he says, live long and prosper,

1784
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,180
and he says it's done.

1785
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,420
It's on one of those mobile vacuum things.

1786
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,980
Yeah, it looks like that, yeah.

1787
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,900
To Sheldon, live long and prosper, Leonard Nimoy.

1788
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,860
It's a napkin.

1789
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:03,860
Oh, it's a napkin on the Roomba, the famous episode.

1790
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,180
Did you ever, did anyone ever go,

1791
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:09,860
anyone ever go into the prop-like soundstage,

1792
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,700
not soundstage, but whatever, the area,

1793
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,060
they keep all the props that are rented out

1794
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,540
for commercials and TV and movies.

1795
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,500
Yeah, I went in there when I did the first time.

1796
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,580
I don't remember it too well.

1797
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,620
Yeah, because it's interesting if you've ever gone

1798
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,260
in anything like this, it's just,

1799
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,580
there'll be a room of chandeliers.

1800
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,140
There'll be a room of lamps.

1801
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,820
There'll be a room of just weird stuff

1802
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,260
that just get rented out, like old telephones.

1803
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,620
There's just a row of them.

1804
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:38,260
People come in for an old movie, and they go,

1805
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,620
I want this, and they sign it out,

1806
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,060
or whatever the money is, and I'm like,

1807
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,420
I'm keeping my eye out for exciting stuff for me,

1808
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,020
and the most exciting thing I saw,

1809
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,940
and they didn't mention it, the person didn't mention it,

1810
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:53,940
but the big skeleton-like skull head from Batman Returns

1811
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,660
that the goons wear at the start of the movie,

1812
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,500
that they're on the motorbike,

1813
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,340
do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1814
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1815
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,460
I was with my friend Luke, and I think he goes like,

1816
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:04,260
oh my God, look over there, it's the skull head.

1817
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,100
And I was like, yeah, it is,

1818
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,180
but it was like hanging out in the corner,

1819
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,420
and I'm like, does anybody,

1820
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,900
why do they even have that in here?

1821
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,900
Is somebody gonna come in and rent that?

1822
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,100
Like, why is it here?

1823
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,260
But that is a cool part of the tour,

1824
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,460
because they do have some things with,

1825
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,180
I think we could take photos in there,

1826
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,780
but they have some things that'll be like,

1827
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,580
ah, this is the telephone from My Fair Lady, or whatever.

1828
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,580
Yeah, no, the telephone from My Fair Lady.

1829
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,420
I don't remember.

1830
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,380
Maybe like an early one.

1831
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,660
They don't know what to do with it.

1832
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,500
Yeah, yeah.

1833
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,780
So wait, did you take the full tour?

1834
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,620
I took the full tour.

1835
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,100
I listened to a full presentation

1836
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,580
about the magic of the movies with Bang Mankiewicz.

1837
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,420
Wow.

1838
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,260
I was eating pastries,

1839
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,460
I was having like a little orange juice or something.

1840
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,180
We're gonna end up with a very jealous Jason.

1841
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,820
105 degrees out, it was just the sun,

1842
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,820
they didn't have any covering over us.

1843
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,660
Oh really?

1844
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,500
Oh my God.

1845
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,820
And then we got, then we stood up and we're like,

1846
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,180
okay, because we're not sure what was happening.

1847
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,500
I think we were taken there on a tram

1848
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,900
into this area of the back lot,

1849
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,140
and then we were like,

1850
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:10,180
oh, I guess we're gonna do the rest of the tour or whatever,

1851
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:14,020
and then a tram pulled up with Bang Mankiewicz

1852
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,500
and everybody on it,

1853
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,220
and a whole marching band playing like 76 trombones

1854
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,220
in the big parade.

1855
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,060
What?

1856
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,460
Yes, my dream.

1857
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,940
They did a full like little song and dance.

1858
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:25,780
The dream.

1859
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,620
The dream.

1860
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,740
I do trust that Jason has long referred to this

1861
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,580
as the dream.

1862
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,420
And a full marching band.

1863
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,260
Yeah, I know.

1864
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,220
Jason wasn't there, my God.

1865
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,500
He was invited to go.

1866
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
I didn't know there was gonna be a marching band.

1867
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,340
Wow.

1868
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,820
I couldn't even go.

1869
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,100
He invited you?

1870
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,180
I invited him.

1871
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,620
I'm not keeping that to, I forget why.

1872
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,780
But that's the, you know, when you hear about it,

1873
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,140
like Warner Brother, okay, okay.

1874
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:51,380
If the headline had been a 76 trombone parade

1875
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,940
playing 76 trombones in the place where the music man

1876
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,780
was filmed, apparently, I have learned

1877
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,540
from looking at Wikipedia's today.

1878
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,380
Uh-huh.

1879
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:02,500
So, we got a little show.

1880
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,980
That's what's happening right now.

1881
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,020
And then, yes, we got in the tram

1882
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,660
and then they did the whole thing.

1883
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,780
They, you know, pointed out sound stages

1884
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,740
where things filmed.

1885
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:16,460
And then we drove by the Conan Studio that's empty.

1886
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,300
Oh, yeah.

1887
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,140
Is it just empty?

1888
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:18,980
It's all been over there.

1889
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,420
I don't know, it just seemed kind of empty.

1890
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,700
I don't know, I didn't go in, but.

1891
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,540
Weird.

1892
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,940
But the like prop area, or whatever you'd call it,

1893
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:28,100
the prop house is not so far from there.

1894
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,540
By the way, Mike, the place you and I met.

1895
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,380
That's right, yeah.

1896
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,700
We started this whole, that's the biggest

1897
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,540
Hollywood history.

1898
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,220
It really is.

1899
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,500
It really is, yeah, shooting a bit for Conan

1900
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,540
that's not directed.

1901
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,740
Goat, yeah, wait, if we've never said this on the show,

1902
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,540
that it was like, yeah, when I worked,

1903
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,860
because I worked on the lot for the Conan Show,

1904
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:47,700
and I got a call for a bit like,

1905
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,620
hey, the writer is gonna do this, he's busy,

1906
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,220
so you need to go downstairs, there's a guy,

1907
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:55,020
and he's like jumping onto a big futon made of ramen, go.

1908
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,260
And I didn't know what it was,

1909
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,220
or what was considered to be the successful version of that,

1910
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,500
but that was Mike.

1911
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,580
I was there, yeah.

1912
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:06,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a really thrust together,

1913
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,860
and me having to pretend that I knew what was doing,

1914
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,260
or what I was doing, or what to tell you to do.

1915
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:14,580
Yeah, it was fun, you worked there,

1916
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,500
but I was like, I actually was here a couple,

1917
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,140
like a good amount of times.

1918
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,140
Was that your first time there,

1919
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,860
or did you, they called you?

1920
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:23,780
The thing you directed, yes, that was the first time.

1921
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,620
Wow.

1922
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,180
But then I was there for a couple meetings,

1923
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,620
there were other things that happened in that building,

1924
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,940
so I was like, oh, it's that building,

1925
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,340
and no one's there, I don't think.

1926
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,140
Did it seem like I knew what I was doing,

1927
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,140
and that I'd carefully crafted the ramen bit?

1928
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,900
Did I present a professional front,

1929
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,620
as opposed to I had no idea it was happening

1930
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:43,460
until 60 seconds before?

1931
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,580
No, I think I was probably like,

1932
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,540
ooh, I have to really impress everyone

1933
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:50,580
with my jumping onto this thing here,

1934
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:51,820
and I was not paying attention

1935
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:54,020
to if everybody else was comfortable.

1936
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:57,380
I remember I was worried that I was gonna hurt my teeth

1937
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,140
biting into the ramen, which is crazy,

1938
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,260
because ramen is so brittle, it's not a big deal,

1939
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,940
and then, yeah.

1940
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:06,380
I remember referencing that I kinda made a meal

1941
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,300
out of putting my hands above my head,

1942
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,060
and I said it was like a Mike Hanford move,

1943
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,060
that's what I remember saying.

1944
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,460
Yes, which did get my attention.

1945
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,580
You were like, oh, I know who that is.

1946
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,980
You know Mike Hanford, all right.

1947
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,020
The beginning of the connection.

1948
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,580
This guy's on the level of friend of Hanford.

1949
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,100
So that was sad, seeing that.

1950
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,940
It's like driving by your...

1951
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:23,780
Let's get coffee sometime,

1952
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,580
because we have to go through a security check, though.

1953
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,420
Yeah.

1954
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,420
So yeah, the prop place was right by there,

1955
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,140
and we got out of the tram at that point

1956
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,740
and walked through it, which is fun.

1957
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,260
So yeah, I don't know, the tour was cool.

1958
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,300
How long was it overall?

1959
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,420
I know it was shortened.

1960
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,820
We were not being given the full tour,

1961
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,420
but we were probably done.

1962
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,380
Once the marching band came out,

1963
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,540
it was probably 45 minutes.

1964
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,540
Where did the marching band?

1965
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,740
Was that on the back lot?

1966
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,700
Was that in a music man type environment?

1967
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,220
Kinda, it was on the fake streets and stuff.

1968
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,540
So we were all set up in this sort of section.

1969
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,100
I don't even know if I have a good photo of it.

1970
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,540
We were all set up in this section

1971
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,180
of like one of the back lot areas,

1972
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,660
and then around the corner,

1973
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,740
we all kinda walked and waited for the tram,

1974
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,100
and that's when the marching band came down.

1975
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,700
This is amazing, my God.

1976
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,540
Yeah, that's like a Beyonce concert.

1977
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,620
Yeah, yeah, it was fun.

1978
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,740
Again, on the tram, and I forget,

1979
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,980
I should really know his name.

1980
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,340
They had like one old actor there,

1981
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,140
one guy who was at least in his 80s,

1982
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,460
who was like a cowboy.

1983
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,700
He's like good blazing saddles and a few other things,

1984
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,540
and he was there,

1985
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,820
and they didn't have much for him to do.

1986
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,020
They were just like, here's an old guy

1987
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,500
who's just seen things.

1988
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,020
He had like his boots on,

1989
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,180
and oh, well, very nice to be here, or whatever.

1990
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,180
But then he's on the tram at the front.

1991
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,420
So I swear they were all waving something

1992
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,700
in their hands or something

1993
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,980
as they turned the corner in the tram.

1994
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,940
So like, Pam Mankiewicz, this guy,

1995
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,260
this old actor guy, and I was like,

1996
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,500
oh, this is really good, this is really funny.

1997
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,340
Wow.

1998
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,580
What a strange little show you got.

1999
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,100
I gotta, yeah, it was really, it was really good.

2000
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,340
What was Ben doing while the marching band was playing?

2001
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,180
Was he just tapping his toes?

2002
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,820
He was in the tram, like waving something around.

2003
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,020
Like he was trying to like be part of it.

2004
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:03,860
Streamers, banners.

2005
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:05,860
Streamers, something like that, yeah.

2006
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:06,700
I should remember.

2007
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,620
They really put him to work.

2008
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,500
They really did.

2009
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,780
Yeah, they made him do physical effort,

2010
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,700
something that we've said we try to avoid.

2011
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,540
Exactly, yeah, so.

2012
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,300
And this aligns right with the time

2013
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,140
when like Steven Spielberg and a bunch of other directors

2014
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,740
had to call David Zaslav at Warner Brothers

2015
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:25,860
and go like, please do not shut down Turner Classic movies.

2016
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,700
Oh, that's right.

2017
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,140
Maybe, yeah, yeah, so.

2018
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,300
Is this whole thing in response to,

2019
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,220
like let's give it a presence on the tour,

2020
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,940
let's show the work committed in a public way to.

2021
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,420
Showed like David, like pictures of my face

2022
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:41,100
being like excited when I saw the marching band or something.

2023
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,020
And he's like, well, I will keep around the classic films.

2024
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,420
I love that pocket.

2025
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,260
Oh yeah, I love it.

2026
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,220
Maybe David invited us.

2027
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,180
He listened, he zapped off.

2028
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,980
Hey, well, if you're listening, David, we love you.

2029
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,460
We approve of everything you've done.

2030
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,460
Please don't look at any old tweets.

2031
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:58,940
Yeah, yeah.

2032
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,740
We like that you deleted Batgirl.

2033
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,060
We heard that it wasn't releasable.

2034
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,660
And we're sure you're right.

2035
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,860
Bold decision making.

2036
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,140
It's just like, he just hit delete.

2037
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,500
Wait, he deleted our show.

2038
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,820
He didn't believe us and he deleted Podcast the Right.

2039
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,020
How could he even do that?

2040
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:15,500
He doesn't know.

2041
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,380
Yeah, people seem to love this new Bad Boys

2042
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,420
and that's the same directors,

2043
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,340
but I'm sure the other Batgirl was unreleased.

2044
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,860
Must have been, yeah.

2045
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,540
There's no way they could have sold a Batman property of any kind.

2046
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:27,580
Who would ever see that?

2047
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:32,300
They put the tour, they have all the stuff they didn't release.

2048
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,100
The deleted room.

2049
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,700
Yeah, that's called the deleted room.

2050
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,100
Yeah.

2051
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,380
Would you come out of retirement

2052
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,460
to put together the photo op for the deleted room?

2053
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,660
I would totally do that.

2054
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,420
Yeah, in fact, I would love to.

2055
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:47,900
Oh, it's the Western digital hard drive with Coyote versus Acme.

2056
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,820
It's like, we've got to do a stress test.

2057
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,220
No, I can't do it.

2058
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,500
I can't do it no more.

2059
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,220
Oh, it's USB 2.0, not 3.0.

2060
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,140
It's not going to be able to handle the strain.

2061
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,260
Yeah, you're going to have war flashbacks

2062
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,380
if we keep this bit going.

2063
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,900
I'm going to have to take a nap after this.

2064
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,100
Yeah.

2065
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:13,820
Yeah, geez.

2066
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:14,700
But yeah, yeah.

2067
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,220
So you wouldn't necessarily choose to go take a spin

2068
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:22,220
on the studio tour for fun, given your legacy of history.

2069
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,500
I don't know.

2070
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:23,980
It's hard.

2071
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:29,340
Like I said, it's such a weird time in my life.

2072
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,180
But I don't know.

2073
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,020
I would have to like people who have someone

2074
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,780
have to come in town and really want to do it.

2075
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:35,100
Yeah.

2076
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,380
And I'd be like, all right, let's do it.

2077
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,100
But you do it in disguise or something, to be sure.

2078
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,300
Yeah.

2079
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,900
Just like, hmm.

2080
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:42,620
I mean.

2081
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,820
Dressed like Wonka.

2082
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,460
I would love to.

2083
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,180
I mean, definitely.

2084
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:49,660
Just a quick 1999 jacket.

2085
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:51,820
It's like, this is a great tour.

2086
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:57,500
But yeah, I think I would do it just to see that I can't believe it's still.

2087
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,900
I would actually just care who still works there.

2088
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,220
Yeah.

2089
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,580
I would love to see the employees because I did like them a lot.

2090
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,500
They were like really cool people.

2091
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,460
But there's no way they all still work there.

2092
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:09,820
People are quitting left and right.

2093
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,940
It was crazy.

2094
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,900
Like even within that time, I hired like so many different people.

2095
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:19,180
But yeah, man, it was long.

2096
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,580
I remember feeling long just when I did it, when I had to do it just for fun,

2097
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:24,780
for just to experience it.

2098
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:26,620
Too long?

2099
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,380
Because this is like, I don't know, for anybody who might visit or consider

2100
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:35,020
taking this kind of thing, you've got the Universal Tram Tour, which I did.

2101
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,740
And that's a very like theme parkified.

2102
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,060
That's a 50 minute.

2103
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,340
That's a very different beast.

2104
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,860
That's like kind of a ride.

2105
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:49,580
And it's not at all what a like studio tour is where you're on a smaller vehicle

2106
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,660
and you're getting out and you're looking at stuff.

2107
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,580
But that's going to be a longer experience.

2108
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:57,180
Something you got to commit to for more time.

2109
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,940
And there's not like a ton of these either.

2110
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:04,940
Disney has never offered one, which I've always found odd,

2111
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,820
because I think a lot of people would be interested in seeing the Disneyland.

2112
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,220
Yeah.

2113
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,300
Paramount does it, which I don't know anything about.

2114
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,780
Paramount seems like maybe sort of a dry one, a little bit.

2115
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,620
I don't think they have anything that compares to the back.

2116
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,660
That's my favorite lot.

2117
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,180
The Paramount lot is my favorite lot.

2118
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,220
It's a cool lot.

2119
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:20,540
Yeah.

2120
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,180
I like that lot.

2121
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,380
That big like sea they can fill up.

2122
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:31,340
You probably park in what can be turned into that you can fill it with water.

2123
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,500
And they've got like a backdrop, like a blue sky.

2124
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,180
That's cool.

2125
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,340
It's the coolest gate to drive in.

2126
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:37,580
Yeah.

2127
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:43,100
It feels like a very Sunset Boulevard, like really in Hollywood.

2128
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,900
You're in the 40s.

2129
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,140
Yeah.

2130
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:44,620
Yeah.

2131
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,340
I like the Disney.

2132
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,860
I mean, we were all doing a strike.

2133
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,020
It was like a lot of like, what lot do you like?

2134
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:50,940
What lot did you like?

2135
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:51,660
I was at Disney.

2136
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,380
I mean, it's close to me, but also a lot of shade.

2137
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,860
And like I am mad at Disney, but also I kind of like looking at the architecture,

2138
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:03,740
like seeing the Robert Graves building with the dwarves holding it up and seeing the big Mickey hat.

2139
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,860
I mean, I'm mad at them, but I'll see the Sorcerer's hat, though, too.

2140
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,460
I think Disney was my favorite, too.

2141
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:08,960
Yeah.

2142
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:15,260
And then just the sort of the time it takes to go around.

2143
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,340
You would go around once and you would like, it would.

2144
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,540
That's a healthy walk.

2145
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,020
Yeah.

2146
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,300
I feel like I was getting exercise.

2147
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:20,540
Yeah.

2148
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:23,660
I think a lot of other lots like Netflix had very little,

2149
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:26,940
I don't think I ever went to Netflix and there was very little like space to.

2150
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,180
Yeah.

2151
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:27,980
You can march here.

2152
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:31,820
You can march in this like one block little, it's like a little dog run.

2153
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,940
But Disney, you got to, yeah, that's like, that's a big story.

2154
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,540
Yeah, it was just like good exercise.

2155
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:41,980
Then I used to go to the CBS Raffer because that's where I was like really,

2156
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,860
that's where all the old white dudes were because it was like they would like not,

2157
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,660
they would be, it was like no talking.

2158
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:50,940
Just everyone would have fun.

2159
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,900
There's more like of a, I guess I was like, I want to interact with people.

2160
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,900
That's when I like hold my, like hold my sign and do my laps.

2161
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,580
And then this shit ain't fun.

2162
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:00,780
Yeah.

2163
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,660
You weren't there to party.

2164
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:01,900
Yeah.

2165
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,380
If you go to Netflix at Paramount, it was like lit.

2166
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,660
It was like a party over there.

2167
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:06,220
Yeah, yeah.

2168
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,300
It was crack killing karaoke and shit.

2169
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,300
It's crazy.

2170
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,500
Okay, what's happening?

2171
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:14,300
Which one did Imagine Dragons play in front of?

2172
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,580
That was Netflix, I think.

2173
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,820
Weezer did Paramount, right?

2174
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,820
Oh, Weezer was Paramount.

2175
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,780
Weezer was Paramount?

2176
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:21,740
I forget where.

2177
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,220
Wow.

2178
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:22,540
Wow.

2179
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:23,340
Yeah, I wasn't there.

2180
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,580
Boy, strike nostalgia, huh?

2181
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,620
Those were the days.

2182
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,340
I know.

2183
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,540
I feel like I was making some other, what point was I heading for?

2184
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,260
I don't know.

2185
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,020
It's just a very different thing that you're getting.

2186
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:40,060
Like a two to three hour really getting to explore studio grounds as opposed to the

2187
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:45,580
Universal one where it's a very crank it out kind of like theme park version of it.

2188
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,620
What do you think, Mike?

2189
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:50,460
Do you think you'd recommend the experience to listeners who might

2190
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:52,940
want to take a look around a studio?

2191
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,300
I, yeah, I think so.

2192
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:58,380
I mean, if you're in Burbank already, if you're going to be here especially,

2193
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,980
I mean, I guess if you're making a trip, there's enough stuff

2194
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,980
if you're like into that Burbank, I would recommend in general.

2195
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:08,380
You don't have to go to the Empire Center, which is a strip mall.

2196
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,660
Basically, this is what we talk about on the show.

2197
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,540
I would say absolutely do not go to Empire Center.

2198
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:12,780
Yeah, don't go to that.

2199
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:16,860
That's where we go to Target, but it's not a place you should visit as a tourist.

2200
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:18,860
But then also there's another school of thought.

2201
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:18,940
I love it.

2202
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,500
I like the airplane thing too of all the airplanes on the highway.

2203
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,860
Well, I think that's why the Green Lantern is going there because he's like a pilot.

2204
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,460
He's a pilot?

2205
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:26,940
Yeah, yeah.

2206
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,300
I don't know anything about Green Lantern.

2207
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:28,940
Yeah, yeah.

2208
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,820
It's a tribute to Burbank's legacy of aviation.

2209
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,100
Perhaps that's the thinking.

2210
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:36,780
I like the Batman in the AMC that batmastache is awesome.

2211
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,340
He's cool.

2212
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,380
That is good.

2213
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,220
Yeah, it's silly, but it's good.

2214
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,580
I mean, there's a school of thought that is like you come to Burbank

2215
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,900
and you tour podcast the rides Burbank.

2216
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,380
Oh, 100%.

2217
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,900
You see the marquee of what's the club?

2218
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,780
Laffer's, Chuckler's.

2219
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:53,340
Flapper's?

2220
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:57,020
Flapper's, yes, where Jay Leno plays every week, seemingly.

2221
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,860
You see the hallowed Burbank Sears,

2222
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:02,220
which has come up on seemingly every episode for the last few months.

2223
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:05,580
I mean, that's just a choose-your-own-adventure kind of tour.

2224
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:06,140
So that's what this show can do.

2225
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,740
You've got Raising Canes over there.

2226
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:08,700
But this is a...

2227
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,420
Yeah, how is that Raising Canes?

2228
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:17,340
I was so over-hyped initially, but then I find myself craving it constantly.

2229
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,460
Yeah, it really grew on me.

2230
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,540
Yeah, does it live up to the...

2231
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:24,620
Because I feel like it shows up in places and then giant lines, the clogged streets.

2232
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,060
Well, I was Mr...

2233
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:28,540
Because I had been Mr. Hot Chicken out here for so many years,

2234
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,700
and I was like, well, it's okay or whatever.

2235
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,300
But then I more and more would drive by and be like, maybe I'm going...

2236
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,060
No, I did eat it and I was like, this is just chicken tenders.

2237
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,060
But every time I see it, I'm like, turn in there.

2238
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,220
I think the secret of Raising Canes is sort of the same in and out secret of consistency.

2239
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,460
I think that you get a very consistently good fast food meal every time you go there,

2240
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:57,180
and because of that consistency, it makes your brain go,

2241
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,540
I know exactly what I'm getting.

2242
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:02,380
Because Taco Bell, McDonald's, you can get bad ones of those.

2243
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,220
You can get the B team working one night.

2244
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,420
Raising Canes seems like they always have the A team.

2245
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,780
Yeah, they're always on their shit.

2246
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:09,980
Yeah, limited menu.

2247
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,140
They only have one thing in different ways.

2248
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,100
Like in and out as well.

2249
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:20,300
All right, there's a chicken tender place at the crypto.com.

2250
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:20,620
Yeah.

2251
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,980
That shit is awful.

2252
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:26,300
I was like, I was going to get a hot dog, but the line was long.

2253
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:30,540
And then I look, I don't know why I didn't take the note that nobody was in line over there.

2254
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,980
But it was like a Raising Cane, but it was like, it wasn't Raising Canes,

2255
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,740
but it was just like chicken tenders.

2256
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,020
And they had, that's all they had.

2257
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:39,180
I was like, all right, chicken tenders fries.

2258
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:43,820
And they immediately gave it to me, which is like, I'm like, this ain't going to be good.

2259
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:46,380
Yeah, it was dry as hell.

2260
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,020
It was crazy.

2261
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:51,740
They've got a really good promotion going with iced tea right now at Raising Cane.

2262
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:54,620
So they have pictures of him in the drive-through.

2263
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:55,980
He's like saying hello to you.

2264
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,340
And I'm like, this is great.

2265
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,620
Wait, iced tea, the wrapper?

2266
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:58,860
Yeah.

2267
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:03,660
That was very confusing to me because I was like, oh yeah, drinking iced tea.

2268
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:08,460
I really did not think, when you said him, I was like, Cain, who is Cain?

2269
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,620
No, Cain is the dog.

2270
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:11,580
Cain's the dog?

2271
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,980
Cain is native to the owner's old dog.

2272
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:18,780
They've got like cardboard cutouts of him in the drive-through if you drive by,

2273
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,540
like going all along now.

2274
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,060
So that's extra.

2275
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,580
I'm like, oh, this is fun.

2276
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,340
I think I love Raising Cane's.

2277
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,220
If iced tea likes it, I like it.

2278
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:33,420
Can we justify Raising Cane's as a themed experience too?

2279
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,700
Is there enough there because we don't want to step in on the Doughboys area?

2280
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,620
We'd have to get an episode that's almost not about the food at all.

2281
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,180
Is there enough?

2282
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:46,860
That's really how, in terms of jurisdiction, that seems like enough.

2283
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,100
It's like a living drive-through haunt where iced tea jumpscares you.

2284
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,580
He's like, there's only one sauce, you got to get that sauce.

2285
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:59,100
Because if you don't get that sauce, there ain't no barbecue sauce, no honey mustard.

2286
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,740
The sauce is a big part of it for me.

2287
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,620
Yeah, I've been working on it.

2288
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,820
I had no idea this would be the first place I would do it.

2289
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,340
Yeah, wow, what a debut.

2290
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,860
You got to test it out before Edinburgh.

2291
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,300
I just sent this to my friend.

2292
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,660
He's like poking out at it.

2293
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:20,220
Yeah, wait, so Lamar, what's he saying there?

2294
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,860
He's like, yeah, I got a little slushy for you.

2295
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,620
If you don't move this line along, I'm going to throw it in the window.

2296
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,780
It's just the kind of life we live at Raising Cane's.

2297
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:37,340
Burbank, it wasn't always at airports out here.

2298
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,740
I just like him going into facts about Burbank.

2299
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:46,380
Yeah, so far in across the street, it's in the end of true romance.

2300
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:50,460
Iconic scene for movies and TV.

2301
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,500
I'll pay tribute to Burbank's legacy of aviation.

2302
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:59,020
If you don't move this car along, I'll kick you so hard you go flying through the air.

2303
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,620
That Sears has been hollowed out for some time.

2304
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:10,220
But yeah, man, I was going to say I totally lost my thought.

2305
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,860
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

2306
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,140
I think for sure, if you're coming out here, do it.

2307
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:19,660
Because it's also like it's a crowd pleaser with like the family.

2308
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,580
Yeah, we're talking about the tour, Raising Cane's.

2309
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:22,540
Both, both Raising Cane's.

2310
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,140
Yeah, they're in the same area.

2311
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:24,780
The tour, yeah.

2312
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:25,500
I know what I was going to say.

2313
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,100
But grandma and grandpa love the tour.

2314
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:28,700
They love the movies.

2315
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,820
It's enough big stuff.

2316
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:33,820
And then there's like the friends stuff that everybody likes.

2317
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,500
Oh wait, was that part of your experience too?

2318
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,780
The friends, this was like, it's not, you aren't in the place where

2319
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,300
the show was filmed.

2320
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:43,020
Oh, that's something you can see is the friends stage.

2321
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:43,740
Right.

2322
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:46,140
But like, yeah, it seems like they've tried to maintain

2323
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,460
that there's some central perk replication.

2324
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:53,660
Yeah, they got the real one and then they have, they recreated it.

2325
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,260
And I was part of that.

2326
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:59,340
I mean, I didn't help build it or anything, but that was like just the cameras.

2327
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,260
And you can kind of like, there's like a fake camera.

2328
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,460
I don't know if it's fake, but you can go in there and see yourself on TV or whatever.

2329
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,260
Oh, gotcha.

2330
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:05,900
Okay, okay.

2331
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,540
But yeah, that was really dope.

2332
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,820
Because I love friends.

2333
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:14,620
I mean, I love, I guess I would go on the tour because I do like a lot of Warner Brothers shit.

2334
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:14,940
Yeah.

2335
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:18,700
It's weird when you realize like you're a fan of a corporate brand.

2336
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,340
Like it's like, oh, I like what they do.

2337
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,260
Like Disney, all that shit.

2338
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:26,140
Well, they, you know, from the Warner Brothers studio store,

2339
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,220
I don't know if you grew up with any of those around,

2340
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,740
like when they had a mall store, like the Disney store,

2341
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,100
I think that did something to me of like, maybe I like the brand.

2342
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,780
Wait, Batman and Superman and Sylvester the cat.

2343
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:40,540
This all lives as one thing to me.

2344
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,100
I understand.

2345
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,060
I like Animaniacs, which kind of ties it all together.

2346
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,940
They meet those characters and parody those characters.

2347
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:52,380
So I have enough of that fondness, I'd say, for like 90s Warner Brothers vibe.

2348
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,740
And then you add Big Bang Theory on top of that

2349
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,420
and you can go in the gift store and buy a notepad that says Bazinga on it.

2350
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,140
Now we're talking.

2351
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:05,100
Sheldon, both middle aged man and young version.

2352
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,620
I was going to say, were you ever at Disney when they,

2353
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:15,180
when Danny Trejo was out there handing out water bottles and stuff?

2354
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:15,820
No.

2355
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,260
That was cool thing about Disney.

2356
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:18,220
I just remember that.

2357
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,100
Oh, yeah.

2358
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,700
Ice tea, maybe it was from ice tea.

2359
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:21,100
Oh, yeah.

2360
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,660
Trejo was around.

2361
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,540
No, Mr. Trejo.

2362
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,260
He would pull up in like a dope ass like lowrider

2363
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:31,020
and like just chill on the road and just hand out water to everybody.

2364
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,500
Wow.

2365
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:35,980
But I said, well, I did, though, see, I couldn't believe that I was at the place

2366
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:42,540
at the time to see on day one where a classic car pulls up and who should get out.

2367
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,780
But Mr. Classic Car, J. Leno.

2368
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:45,740
Oh, wow.

2369
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:50,220
Two boxes of donuts for 500 striking raiders.

2370
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,340
Get a guy out of the car left really quick.

2371
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:58,940
But then I'm like, how did I manage to be at the spot where I assumed the only J.

2372
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:01,100
Leno appearance of the strike happened?

2373
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,660
I mean, that felt very special.

2374
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,700
That's very special.

2375
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,940
Not to pit Leno against Trejo.

2376
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:11,260
Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, you have no shot.

2377
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,860
I mean, yours is way better.

2378
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,180
It depends on who you ask, I think.

2379
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,020
I know, yeah.

2380
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:17,900
I mean, it was cool.

2381
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:22,220
Not everybody's life revolves around Leno the way mine seems to.

2382
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,620
No, I was excited to see Danny.

2383
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,340
That was cool.

2384
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:25,840
Yeah, yeah.

2385
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,660
Hollywood history, it's still all around us.

2386
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:32,060
You can experience it in these places.

2387
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:37,740
Well, I am curious how much of what you set up is still around,

2388
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:41,580
or if at least that your spirit of being a little more casual,

2389
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:46,620
if the ragtag vibes that you tried to set up there, does that remain?

2390
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:51,580
I think Pixar in general probably kind of has that energy anyway,

2391
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:52,780
even if I wasn't there.

2392
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:56,460
So I can't imagine it just fully flipped over and changed.

2393
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:00,220
But it's got to be, I feel like if I went back, I feel like I would know.

2394
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,900
I wonder if I, because you probably didn't,

2395
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,540
before I told you that difference, you probably,

2396
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,260
they looked like all just Warner Brothers employees, right?

2397
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,580
You didn't, you weren't like, this feels like a different company.

2398
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,620
Yeah, I didn't know.

2399
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:14,140
Yeah, like I want to, I'm curious how seamless it is,

2400
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,540
or if it's like, if I would actually see the like,

2401
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,740
there's a, okay, there's a company shift here, right?

2402
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,180
When I walk into this building.

2403
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:25,660
But, but, you know, man, that was a, that was a beautiful time.

2404
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,980
Thank you for making me relive it.

2405
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,900
Yeah, thanks for, absolutely.

2406
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:30,380
Yeah, I know.

2407
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:35,260
Besides the stress test, it seems stressful to remember your own stress test

2408
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,940
and having to relive the stress test.

2409
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:40,220
But besides that, it's a stress test for me to talk about it.

2410
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,180
I mean, yeah.

2411
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:41,740
You did it.

2412
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,300
You made it.

2413
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,460
You survived podcast, The Ride.

2414
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,260
Lamar, what do you say?

2415
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:46,460
The Ride of this ride.

2416
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:47,580
This is my favorite ride.

2417
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,900
Okay, we're so glad.

2418
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,620
Well, your friends asked it, so we'll go the heavy again.

2419
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:59,020
Let's exit through the gift shop past the now marked down in 1999 Wonka jacket.

2420
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,340
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2421
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,260
Yeah, just check out my album, Highly Sensitive Person.

2422
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,380
It's on Spotify, Apple, all the streaming platforms.

2423
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,500
But if you want to buy it from me and support the kid,

2424
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:18,300
just go to www.lamar-wiz.com and you can buy the album directly.

2425
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,340
Either way, I'll be happy.

2426
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,540
But just listen to it, though.

2427
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,500
That's the vibe.

2428
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,300
And then follow me at Profmatic on IG.

2429
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,060
Yeah, Profmatic.

2430
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,060
And if anybody wants to get in touch with you

2431
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,860
to set up any different photo opportunity things,

2432
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:32,540
are you open to that or is that done?

2433
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:33,740
Absolutely not.

2434
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,820
Do not talk to me about any of that stuff.

2435
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,420
It's a past chapter, a past chapter.

2436
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:42,300
You relived with us.

2437
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:42,780
Thank you.

2438
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:43,660
But in the past.

2439
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,980
Yeah, I'm still excited about Wax.

2440
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,500
I think that was a bigger part of my life.

2441
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:51,820
Because that was like my first seven years in LA.

2442
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:55,180
So I'm always going to have love for a man of two souls, for sure.

2443
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:55,660
Sure.

2444
01:41:55,660 --> 01:42:00,140
And yet you didn't go with, as your musical name, The Wax Man.

2445
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:00,640
Yeah.

2446
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:07,820
I might do a tape, like a theme tape called The Wax Man.

2447
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:11,180
And yeah, it's all wax themed.

2448
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:11,980
Put it on wax.

2449
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,460
Different persona.

2450
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,340
Yeah, literally.

2451
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:13,980
Different persona.

2452
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,500
Wax on wax.

2453
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,460
Chris Gaines.

2454
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,820
Chris Gaines or Garth Brooks's alter ego, Chris Gaines.

2455
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,860
You could have an alter ego.

2456
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,380
Yeah, The Wax Man.

2457
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,740
I play the harper or something.

2458
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,780
But check that out, it's dope.

2459
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:35,260
It's about being sensitive and anxiety and stuff like that.

2460
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:39,100
Wow. I can't promise that the same topics

2461
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:42,540
will be the core of our panel about street sharks.

2462
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,380
It'll be a little bit more aggressive than that,

2463
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:46,220
what with all of the slamming and such.

2464
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:49,740
But nonetheless, come check that out again today,

2465
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:52,140
possibly Friday, July 26th, 1 p.m.

2466
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:55,740

You will find all of that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2471
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,540
That'll do it, I guess.

2472
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,060
Well, let's take a picture or something

2473
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,900
and you should give us some guidance as to how to do it well.

2474
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,020
Wipe the sweat off.

2475
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,140
Lean left, lean right.

2476
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:21,020
Yeah, I'll help you out with that.

2477
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:22,140
Thank you, appreciate it.

2478
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:22,780
Good to have a pro.

2479
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,980
