1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning, the following podcast is full of heated discussion,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
heated wheel rubber, and hearts being heated up

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
after receiving warm praise from a robot.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Basically, things get heated as Paul Scheer returns

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to talk Transformers the Ride 3D on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
where it takes a 30-foot tall robot to conquer our fear of intimacy.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As you started that sentence, I was like,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is he going to say intimacy?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because that's what I would say, fear of intimacy.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, it's one of the big areas of conversation today for a big ride,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and that was a joke mainly aimed at Mike Carlson, host number three.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, I think this is...correct me if I'm wrong, listeners,

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but the idea of intimacy on a ride started from a discussion

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
of this particular theme park attraction.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No question.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Which is something we're going to have to loop our guest.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's a lot of like mythology, tons of mythology happening.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what I was thinking about with this topic.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is a ride that has had a vice grip on this podcast

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
since the very beginning.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some of the hottest takes, some of the longest running debates.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It has just always been a presence despite not having an episode of its own

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
until now.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The name of this ride is Transformers the Ride.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is at Universal Studios Parks Worldwide, Hollywood, Orlando, and the others.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And we're here. We're here to do it.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I think that we needed not just a big guest,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but somebody who can sort of like...what's the word?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mediator?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, or arbitrary. Mediator is correct.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because there's so much here to go over.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We need an outsider to help us parse all of it,

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but of course not an outsider.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's joined us many times, but for the first time in a long time

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
from how did this get made from his Twitch channel Friend Zone,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the optimist prime of comedy podcasting, it's Paul Scheer.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hi, Paul.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I am honored to really be blessed with this episode.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is an important episode.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it is, you know, for me, a ride that I have a lot of opinions on,

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
a lot of theories about.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I can't wait.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't even want to give you an idea of what I think about this

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
until the conversation really starts,

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
because I know where some of you fall on this.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I would like to, you know, I'd like to...

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't want to sway the boat either way

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
before the conversation properly gets started.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Like, neither...we shouldn't all tip it too much.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I hope that's not what I'm doing by just by diving into this.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But there...look, I'm so excited, Paul,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
that you could join us for Transformers specifically,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because in my mind, you were the only guest who could do it,

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
because there's a bit of a history here.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I don't know if you recall the history.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I'm going to open a wound, but I'd say it's mainly a wound for me.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think this is my wound.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think I do.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I want to hear it...

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to hear it, like, maybe from a different perspective.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And that's really where I think...

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't think I could explain it to someone else.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I think that I understand it in my heart.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, let's rush him on this shit.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I'd be curious to hear it from yours, too,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and how you had to discover this.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It really goes to the roots of Podcast The Ride, the very beginning.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And actually, even before that, it goes back to the Dough Boys,

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to your first appearance on The Dough Boys, whenever this was.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The episode was Bubba Gumps, I believe.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, yeah.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So you were on Dough Boys, and in my memory...

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And let me italicize that in my notes.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And so let me italicize that out loud.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is in my memory.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What you had said, what I thought you had said about Transformers The Ride,

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is that it was your favorite ride.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is what I thought.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, let's date it of when I said it.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
2017, unless I'm wrong?

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's just say it's pre-Star Wars, it's pre-Rise, it's pre-Spiderman The Ride.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It is, and I believe, the way that I said it.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And again, maybe I didn't use it to all, you know, whatever.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not trying to step back from it.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I did believe at that point,

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it is one of the most technologically advanced best rides, hands down.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's how I always felt.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That, to me, was the evolution of the perfect ride,

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
because it had 3D elements, it was moving through on a track,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
but it also used screens, it wasn't exclusively screen-based.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I felt like there were a lot of elements.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was like, more of that.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And that is coming off of my belief before that,

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that from Islands of Adventure,

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Spider-Man The Ride was my favorite new class of ride.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Again, I'm talking about new class of ride.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Not like the best ride, my favorite ride,

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but if that's the future, I want to be on that.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to see more track rides that involve a lot of things.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, we're going to have a different conversation because of Rise.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've been to Japan to go on some rides there.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've had some different experiences.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's pretty bad.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The evolution of the ride has grown, but I have some theories.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But yes, I would say you're pretty right.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I wasn't saying it wasn't like...

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mr. Toad's might be my go-to answer for that.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Or like Haunted Mansion in the grand scheme of things.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But that's not talking about personal connection.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is more from a technological standpoint.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Great. It's what's blowing you away right then and there.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I absolutely agree from a technical standpoint, it is incredible.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It is a perfectly valid answer.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Again, the shame is on me here because what I recalled was you saying

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it is definitively your favorite ride or the best ride

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
or something definitive like that.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then we start recording our show.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And one of the first episodes, I don't remember what, maybe it was with Mitch,

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but I think this conversation came up.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I, in the episode, say, oh yeah, I remember Paul saying that.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Like, oh boy, I don't know about that.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was all shitty and snarky, dismissive about that opinion.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then I filed that away, put it in a drawer,

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
forgot that anyone would hear this ever.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because this I believe was before the show started coming out.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So I'm like, oh no, certainly no one will ever hear that, let alone Paul himself.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then I think as soon as the episode comes out, you DM me and say,

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I feel like I must have had a caveat for saying Transformers is the best ride.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So there it is. So yeah, there it is.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then I just gave you the exact same response.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes, yes, completely. It's very consistent.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I at this point go beet red because two things are happening.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
One, I'm very excited that you are listening to the show.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ideal person. We are so honored and have always been honored to have you involved in the show.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And so that's great.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So Paul's listening and he heard me being shitty about a perfectly valid opinion and getting it a little wrong.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So this is a thing that I felt bad about for five years.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You probably forgot about it entirely. I have not.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This has been right.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
100 percent. I mean, I've been on the show multiple times.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We've seen each other socially. No, I don't care.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Look, we skydive together.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's a brotherhood that you can't undo when you indoor sky together.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We fly together. I fly.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Brotherhood of fake flying. City walk. Yes.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All I'll say is this.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If anyone was going to give me shit about my theme park opinions, I welcome it from the three of you.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like here. Here. Thank you.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I take me to task. I will have a defense for it.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will. But I don't you know, I appreciate a theme park in and you know, we've we've been there.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We've been there on the opening day of Rise of the Resistance.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We have done it. We've like I'm there.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not I'm not a fair weather fan.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not a person who's like, oh, when I was a kid, I liked it or I like bringing my kids to it.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, I'm there. But I will take I will take my lumps.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And if properly given and I feel like I just wanted to make sure that you knew it didn't think less of me.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Not not remotely and especially because again, these are my lumps to get because I went and listened to the episode in question.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you do in fact say this is not best. This is not definitive.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What you are what is posed to you is to make a mount theme park more and to put different attractions on the mount theme park.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Transformers is the first thing out of your mouth.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's what's like exciting you right now. But you get you say, Mr.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Toad, you say Goliath, I believe at Six Flags.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
OK, it's a healthy and in a list of four, this is it is not what I defined it as.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And even if it was, why should that be a problem?

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Although this is interesting because that's that. Wow.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's I don't even remember that. But now that you bring it up, what did it?

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
First of all, I will say this again when it was recorded, we got to put that into context.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But secondly, where it was recorded or where our food was eaten, which was Universal City Walk.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I'm also coming off of Bubba Gump. That's where we're there.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You know, I'm thinking about things of of that nature.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will also say, you know, truth be told, I find Universal Theme Park rides to be lackluster.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And in an effort to throw a bone.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's where that's where I threw it. That's where I threw it to that ride.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And again, I still feel very strongly about that ride. I really like that ride a lot.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But if I'm trying to be equal in creating this Mount Rushmore, I don't want to just be I don't want to be one corporation.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I want to spread it around multiple corporations. That's why Goliath makes the list.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, you really did. You did your due diligence. They all they all got on there.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They all got on the mount. I should also say just for the record in listening to the conversation that continued that you and Mitch go on the record as not liking the Johnny Depp robot while Weiger defends it.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So I just want to know while we're digging through old podcast episodes.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I remember the date. Yes, this is important.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And look, and I'll say this, regardless of how I feel about Johnny Depp, I still feel the same way about the animatronic in the sense that it dates it.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Like, and the one thing that Disney has with very few rides is a timelessness to it.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And all of a sudden you're popping in, you know, a at one point a worldwide giant celebrity.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I felt it cheapens it. It cheapens it a bit like, do we need it?

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Do we do we need to know that that's a Jack Sparrow adventure? I don't think so.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No, I mean, now, meanwhile, you put the Kraken in there, you're whatever the hell that the squid face guy, I'm all in for that because that is timeless.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Good face guy is timeless to me. That feels more more universal.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's a piratey kind of a thing. Well, I'm not tied to like one guy.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think it's tricky when you get into one actor because it does rely on that actor not being like, you know, weird.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What could happen? What could happen? What could happen?

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, I would say if we're going to go on a larger scale conversation, is pirates the cursed ride?

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean, you know, we go from this idea that, you know, it's the one that's been the most revamped and changed and at a certain point wasn't even going to be in Florida.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But, you know, people like we want that pirates ride.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We were we were going to build this like kind of larger in the mountain coaster that was going to take us through more problematic areas of our history of the United States.

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But, you know, but but that there is a curse nature to the pirates, right?

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's interesting. The most. Yeah, it does keep running into and curses of like accidents and the water being toxic.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's like all kinds of level of curse.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, overloaded now and then like way too many boats.

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So like the end of the ride, you're just getting slammed by the boat behind you.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The worst. Yeah, the Black Pearl was cursed and the ride was cursed.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah. Okay.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now, let me say that because there's a little bit more that comes out of this.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm very excited that we're going to the tape. We're going deep.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah. Okay.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay. Yeah, this is to go into the archaeology of the DM's a little more here is now as we as we patch up old wounds and thank you for making me feel better about my early episode.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, never feel badly about that. I wish you would have would approach me sooner.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, geez. Okay.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Glad it's glad it's out in the open. But now I'm worried. But I think we have to.

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I'm fearful that we're going to open up a new a new wound scar.

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And when I say something that you said soon after and here we go.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Also, just re road Spidey Transformers is better that I stand by as someone who once thought that Spidey was one of the best.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes. Now I now at this point I fear for the opinions of Jason Sheridan.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, well, well, here we go.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because I have been critical of this ride in that it is.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have always thought of it as lesser than Spider-Man.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You know, Spider-Man, an opening day attraction at Islands of Adventure.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So we're clocking it at 1999 and this opens over a decade later.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And while it does have a number of upgrades, it hits a lot of the same beats almost of the ride.

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It hits a lot of very similar moments with characters that are not like my dear friend, Spider-Man characters that I don't.

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm like, what are these characters personalities?

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And it was only digging into this ride has this happens a lot on the show.

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I dig into a ride and it grows on me if I'm kind of indifferent to it or skeptical of it because a lot of the Q videos for this ride.

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm like, OK, this is what this character's deal is.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And OK, they're setting up this big set piece like this big moment in the ride.

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It makes a little more sense now.

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That said, I was racking my brain because I was a Transformers kid.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I had Transformers toys growing up and I could not remember any storylines from the show.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The only thing that stuck out in my mind was the CG one from the later 90s called Beast Wars that takes place entirely in barren landscapes because CG was very expensive.

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Right. I remember this.

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, I see. So it always had to be deserts.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah. So and they were animals. They were like prehistoric animals.

240
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So kind of makes sense like dinosaur age and then being like a 13, 14 year old too smart for my own good renting the Transformers movie and going like, hey, you know, this was Orson Welles last picture before he died.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He was Omicron, the big planet one that was Omicron.

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The name was Omicron, I think, right?

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think so. Yeah.

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Wow. Can't remember the year.

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Remember the year.

246
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, let's why don't maybe we all need to sort of address a little bit where we're coming at it from because can I ask one quick question?

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Because when was the last time you rode Spider-Man in Islands of Adventure?

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I want to put that down too because that is, you know, I was I believe when I recorded that fresh off of Islands of Adventure.

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Sorry. That's my by the way. Not to step on that. But Mike is saying it's not Omicron.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not Omicron.

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's not Omicron.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What is it called?

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Unicron.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Close.

256
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's the next Christmas while I'll be sick with them.

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah. Well, all right. That's a strain of the thing.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes. That's why I was hung up on it.

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's a letter in the out. Isn't it a letter in the letter?

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, it is a letter.

261
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who can remember all the strains now?

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
OK. Yes. Last time on Spider-Man.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We were the three of us were down there in 2019 and that was the last time I read that.

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Because here's my just and I know that we're not this is not a definitive argument between the two.

265
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I want to put a couple of not even caveats.

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Spider-Man the ride at Islands of Adventure has shown its age.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I think that that's what I was what I was feeling.

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's a certain we talk about timelessness and stuff like that.

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When I got on that ride, I had so much excitement.

270
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I love this one.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And I walked there and I had one of those fast passes, but I didn't even need it because it was empty.

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Meanwhile, the Hulk ride, which has been redone, they kind of redid the inside.

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Now we all know all the backdrop of why Marvel Islands of Adventure can only be in the Fox cartoon world of like the early 90s.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But yeah, sure. Generic.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But right. Yeah.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So, you know, I go there really looking forward like, oh, my gosh, I can't wait.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And it's empty. And I walk right on.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I was like, oh, it just it felt like it hit it showed its age.

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And there's something about that, that like maybe screen rides might be shown.

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And this is going to be curious to see, like, will screen rides start to show their age a little bit more as we move forward?

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Like, you know, will there be a moment where it's like, oh, we've gotten better definition.

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We've gotten better movement.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We've gotten, you know, because the real big thing with Spider-Man, the ride is a similar thing that you with Transformers was the drop, right?

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where Spider-Man kind of catches you with the web and then pulls you up and you feel like you're you're going up the side of a building.

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I remember that being mind blowing.

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like when I saw that, I was like, forget about Disney Islands of Adventure.

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's where it's at. This is a better theme park.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm all on board. Yeah. Anyway, that but I didn't feel that way.

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Post Transformers arrived. When was your when did you do Spider-Man last?

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I did Spider-Man last. My kid is turning.

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I remember it very specifically. My kid is turning six this week.

292
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I did it six years ago.

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I did it right after he was born.

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I happened to be down in Orlando and I had half a day and I bought that crazy pass so I could ride everything.

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everything. Yeah. Universal.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think at that point, Fast and Furious was not open as a singular ride nor was the Tonight Show.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So I've missed those two. But so it was right before the Tonight Show opening up about a week before and and before Fast and Furious.

298
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I got to do everything else. But what's the date here?

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is this before? Because do you know that Spider-Man had the like the read?

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They did do like a CGI.

301
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They made it. What is the changes? It's 4K. It's a little bit like elevated.

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah. OK. There has been but I don't remember the year on that.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Do you know, Jason? Does anybody know? I'm going to look right now.

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That might have been earlier than you think. That might have been like 2012, 2014. OK. OK.

305
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah. Jimmy Fallon Ride opened in 2017.

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
OK. So I believe. Wait. So is that? Yeah.

307
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That works out. So it was before Jimmy found.

308
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So I'm writing this before pre-Tonight Show the ride.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think it's 10 years ago that it was upgraded a little before. OK.

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This might be an issue that you're finding even beyond that or that something is like unsatisfying about the generic nature of of that.

311
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It could also be. And look, I also put a lot up to it.

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Like I've never seen Dumb and Dumber again because I enjoyed it so much that I feel like if I saw it again, I wouldn't laugh as hard.

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So like there are certain elements where you build up something so much in your your memory or your I like it so much.

314
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You know, there's never I feel like there's never like a real like first time again and sometimes on these rides like my first time on Rise of the Resistance.

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Like if I could bottle that, I'll never feel that way again on Rise.

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But the first time I wrote that, it was like stunning and mind boggling.

317
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If I never wrote it again, it would be I mean, it still is epic in every single way.

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But that memory will never be like that memory is I remember that.

319
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And that's why I felt about Spider-Man. And then when I wrote it on again, I was like, OK, I see the scene.

320
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let me throw out a theory here about Spider-Man versus Transformers.

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And I don't actually know if this is true or not.

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But I believe you get as a person, as a person who's in the ride vehicle, I believe you get your ass kicked a lot more on Transformers.

323
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes, I think you are getting just a shit kicked out of you the whole time on that ride.

324
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I feel like once you go to Transformers and you go back on Spider-Man, if you're not enjoying the spider visuals and the Sinister Six, you are going to go.

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, what's the deal? I'm used to a certain level of of handling.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well, this is what I'm talking about. It's it's not like the iPhone 8 was bad.

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But now when you have the iPhone 13, I'm used to some of the features there and I'm going to be a little bit upset.

328
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's not that the iPhone 8 was bad. It's just time has passed.

329
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I can appreciate the iPhone 8.

330
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, you know, some of us are still rocking an iPhone 8 and some of us still like Spider-Man better.

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You know, this is I have something to say about what Mike just said.

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And this might be key to where all our opinions land, because if I haven't established and why I was a shitty five years ago is because I'm not the biggest fan of this ride.

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And Mike, what you just said, you're that your ass getting kicked.

334
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't like that. I don't want that.

335
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I prefer a little smoother.

336
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And to me, the just like caustic bumping all around is not a virtue.

337
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's not a good thing. Point of clarification.

338
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
When you say you're getting your ass kicked, you're talking about real world getting jumbled around, getting bumped around, not storyline wise.

339
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, I'm talking about the Decepticons.

340
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No, you're getting you're getting the vehicle itself and the ride itself is shaking you and like vibrating you.

341
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're getting bumped around.

342
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And if you're really paying attention, you're your back is slamming into a hard piece of plastic over and over again.

343
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And it happens a lot more on Transformers.

344
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I love it.

345
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And now maybe we should just and we don't have to move on from any arguments, but we are deep into an episode or a little too deep without having said that Mike has said this part of why we need you, Paul, is that Mike has started to say,

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
a couple things.

347
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, I mean, you've always been a huge proponent of this ride.

348
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes.

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But what it has morphed into recently is the possibility that Transformers, the ride is better than Rise of the Resistance.

350
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I have this is I'm not again, I'm going to hold my tongue here.

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I want to hear some thoughts.

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not going to come out with a response to that.

353
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But that's interesting.

354
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I did not know that.

355
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Now, can I can I bring up one thing about Transformers as well?

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, please.

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Of course.

358
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
One of the things about Transformers to me that is so effective.

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I've said this and I'm sorry if I said this on your show before.

360
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It is my favorite Transformers film.

361
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Like, I don't think you're going to find a disagreement.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:28,000
OK, so I so for me to go on a ride of a franchise that the feature film in which a feature film world that I hate besides Bumblebee, which I thought was very good, where I go on it and then leave a fan of the franchise.

363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's also giving me bonus points.

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, that's also bringing me like I have to equate that in like the you know, and when I'm weighing my opinion here, like I'm not going to go on a ride.

365
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Like I'm not going in loving it.

366
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Star Wars.

367
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I love so it's going to be very you have to do very little to make me fall more in love.

368
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm going to I'm already there.

369
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm already I want to see these characters.

370
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I want to go there.

371
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Transformers.

372
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm like, and I leave.

373
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm like, wow, I completely agree.

374
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have barely seen two Transformers movies.

375
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I've been forced one time for charity to watch a Transformers.

376
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I have seen the first one and this this will date it.

377
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I mean, it's not that long after it came out, but I remember getting the DVD envelope in the mail from early days Netflix or I guess not that early because it's like late 2000s, mid 2000s.

378
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I have one it recently to not necessarily watch all of them, but watch the weirder ones later where like Anthony Hopkins.

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, Anthony Hopkins is in there talking about Transformers.

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There's some moment where like I always talk.

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I've heard about this.

382
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I've seen this clip, but like Stanley Tucci is some sort of weirdo scientist.

383
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh, it's too.

384
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Chis loose.

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He's insane.

386
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
He's insane.

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
At some point, he's drinking a bag of a Chinese bag of milk like a company from there.

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Like weird forced product placement.

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, first product placement because these movies are huge in China.

390
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But yeah, I haven't seen it.

391
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And then I heard people go in the reaction to Bumblebee being like, this is pretty good.

392
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I was surprised.

393
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's pretty good.

394
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That seemed like the vibe.

395
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
People said about Bumblebee.

396
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Bumblebee to me is one of those rare films where it's not Michael Bay directed and it's it's sort of just a coming of age story that happens to have a robot in it.

397
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like so there are some things about it that you're like, oh, I like this story.

398
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I like this actress.

399
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
John Cena is also in it.

400
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You know, so it is I just bought in.

401
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And there are elements of the first Transformers when I rewatch it a little bit with, you know, Shia LaBeouf.

402
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm like, OK, his parents are funny.

403
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There are elements.

404
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's just I never really connected to that franchise.

405
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I will say that, yeah, it is it it seems to be so easy to make it yet so hard, but yet the ride gives me the visceral thing that I want.

406
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So it's like you've delivered the thing that I want to see in movies.

407
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Why is it so hard to make what I just experienced a movie?

408
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know.

409
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Maybe the movie should only be four minutes.

410
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know.

411
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or you have to get every Transformers movie has to be experienced in one of the four D or the whatever, which I'm all for.

412
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Now, I'm not I'm here to be a moderator, a mediator.

413
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I would love to hear, you know, Mike, your opinion.

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, like, give me give me your top three reasoning, you know, your top three reasons of of the rise versus Transformers.

415
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I do want to just I want to just dig into it because I want to make sure it's not just a bombastic opinion, you know, because I know you're very much like the Tucker Carlson of this show.

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Just because of the last name.

417
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
For sure. That's a part of it.

418
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Do we need to maybe go over the context a little of you guided like this is your argument to make.

419
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think maybe one thing you don't know, Paul, is that Mike not only enjoys the ride, there is a deep well of emotion that has been discussed on the show many times that comes from the ending of the ride.

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Is this an appropriate time for you to explain?

421
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, we worry of no structure here.

422
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So, of course, what I realized when we were talking about Transformers once is that moments on rides that I really like a perfect example of is the end with Optimus Prime.

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He explains and I think I incorrectly said what it was.

424
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think I said something along the lines of like, I'm proud of you.

425
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I guess that's the feeling that you leave with.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah, you leave like he's.

427
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm very proud of you.

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And he says your bravery is like, there's a nice long, heavy beat there for a theme park ride that's usually throwing stuff at you.

429
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You sit there. He really takes his time to get down to your level and he shoves his giant robot head, what feels like two feet away from you.

430
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And he delivers this speech and it feels good to me.

431
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I really like it.

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I would compare it to something like on Star Tours when in the new version of Star Tours, when C3PO kind of looks at everybody and says like, it looks like we've just joined the Rebel Alliance.

433
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And there's like a good heavy beat there.

434
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And you get to feel like emotion, which doesn't often happen on a theme park ride, which is bombarding you with stimuli.

435
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So I have now after talking about this, I don't know what you would say, fetishized.

436
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm not sure exactly.

437
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Well, it's become this phrase of the moment of intimacy has been haunting the show for a long time.

438
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I maybe built it up in my head and not experienced it for a while.

439
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And because I think this came up during pandemic.

440
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So then pandemics over ish and I finally get to go on it.

441
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So for the first time since this all came up and I go on the ride and what I see is like big robot like leaning in weird like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

442
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And then you move it.

443
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I found it inexplicable that you would have emotion for this moment that this somehow is to you.

444
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You think of this as like a watershed, like a song, if you will, in the history of rides.

445
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It feels so long, though, compared to like the pace I'm used to on the ride.

446
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It feels long in my mind.

447
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I know it's probably seconds that it is a little stretch out more.

448
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It is a little stretch out more.

449
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And we should say this is a longer.

450
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is like over four minutes, which in theme park terminology, that's pretty long.

451
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But I'm kind of I get where my is coming from.

452
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Scott, I get where you come.

453
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You're coming from.

454
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because one of my big criticisms from with Transformers is that if you're talking about Paul, you're talking about Spider-Man aging.

455
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, I feel like Transformers started aging well as soon as they like cut like it started aging as soon as they cut the ribbon.

456
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Like maybe I just haven't written it at good times, but it feels like the footage has always been smeary and has it's like when we saw like one of the Avengers movies and like this light bulb in the projector is burning out.

457
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I can't tell what's going on in some big moments.

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You know, it doesn't help for me either.

459
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And this is entirely this is an effect of the pandemic.

460
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
One of the worst effects of the pandemic, you might say, is that going on this ride and masks do not mix because you got glasses on.

461
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's crazy.

462
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's just it's already hard to make out what's going on.

463
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That's the first time I experienced Spider-Man.

464
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The new ride, the one in California Adventure.

465
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah, I experienced it that way.

466
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I need to I need to go back on because I feel like I did not.

467
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was fine.

468
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, right.

469
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, that's where we've landed.

470
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Admittedly, I don't know.

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm not sure if you I hope you get past fine.

472
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Everybody should like everything.

473
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But sure, that's I mean, that's the hope.

474
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So our greatest wish coloring my perception a little.

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I did watch some ride throughs from opening day where like the the vlogger was clearly universal gave them media elements where it's like, here's the footage, not in 3D and full resolution.

476
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
God, and it looks much better.

477
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It looks great.

478
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean, the Transformers have always looked a little CG, but in good shots, it kind of adds to their alienness or their unrealness.

479
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And that is a compliment.

480
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I will pay them.

481
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let me ask you this, Paul.

482
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Do you when when Mike describes this moment, do you recall this moment?

483
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Does this resonate?

484
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Does the moment of intimacy land with you?

485
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
One thousand percent.

486
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Wow.

487
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
One thousand percent.

488
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And and and you know why?

489
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because as you started to describe it, it brought me back to that moment.

490
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It brought me back to that that ending moment where I do believe again, a character I don't care for a character I have no emotional attachment to.

491
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It feels like it acknowledges the journey that we just had.

492
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Right. We did just have a journey.

493
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't know if I did anything, but I do like being thanked.

494
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I do like you know, I like that the there's a nice moment there.

495
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I think maybe what I'm experiencing also in the sounds now I'm going to maybe sound equally as silly.

496
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But the majesty of seeing this face up close, a true like what would it be like to look Optimus Prime in the eyes?

497
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right. So it's like it is eye contact, which is the most hard eye contact.

498
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's yes. Long eye contact.

499
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's intimacy does.

500
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So we got that in the eyes.

501
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But then it's also like, wow, this same moment, just like soaring where it's like I am taking in something I've never really experienced on this level.

502
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Wow. Like I like it's it's majesty, it's intimacy.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And, you know, somebody said this to me the other day.

504
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We all like the gravy, which is, you know, everyone likes a compliment.

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And this is this character is saying because of us.

506
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Right. We've succeeded.

507
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So we're getting three very large things that I think all in the pyramid of things that humans need.

508
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We're just not getting food, but everything else is attended to.

509
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Perfect. I mean, a perfect way to describe it.

510
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Much better than I could have even said it.

511
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And like you think of others times, even writes, I love like Guardians of the Galaxy.

512
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Chris Prentice goes, thanks, everybody.

513
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And that's it. That's it.

514
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's like so informal.

515
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He didn't get right up on top of you and like looking in the eye.

516
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Well, Dave Bautista kind of ribs you.

517
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's funny. I like that.

518
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I love that. I think that's a funny little joke he says at the end.

519
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why are you thanking them? He goes, they didn't do anything.

520
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's funny. That is funny. Yeah.

521
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But, you know, once in a while.

522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's a fling. This is low.

523
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This is a low scene is low.

524
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, it kind of is. It kind of is.

525
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Why don't I feel what either of you are feeling?

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't get it at all. I think you're upset by the ride.

527
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think you've been beaten up and you don't like the feeling of getting beaten up.

528
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So you're sort of zoned out. Maybe you're zoned out and you're not locked in.

529
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Or maybe it's maybe lost me to where it's not going to win me back.

530
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Right. With that moment.

531
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Or your heart isn't open.

532
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
If you're I figured I was putting myself up for that.

533
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This was that the only other conclusion would be that it's an emotional blockage.

534
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Emotional blockage. I'm closed off.

535
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Jason's blocked too, though, if this is the case.

536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I am a little blocked, but in my defense, it's more like I honestly forgot the DMs.

537
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Sometimes I forget the moment of intimacy discussions.

538
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like I get so into reading about the ride and watching videos in history.

539
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I forget our own lore. Jason, you're about the research.

540
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We know this. You're about the research.

541
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Too analytical. I'm a book idiot.

542
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And so I just read so many books.

543
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I wish I could see over all the books in my house.

544
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I buy books. I'm slow at reading books, but I buy them.

545
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm right with you.

546
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
They haunt me.

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So basically what I'm saying is sometimes I'm Mr.

548
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
McGooing my way through the podcast where I'm like a Mack truck is speeding by me.

549
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And I'm just like going about my day.

550
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Nice weather we're having.

551
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Has it gotten you there? Did like the magical?

552
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I was very enamored with the descriptions that both Mike and Paul gave.

553
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Does that help? Are you now feeling the moment of intimacy?

554
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So would you say it's comparable to when Spider-Man gets on the hood of the vehicle

555
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and you're like staring this guy you love in the face?

556
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He's your best friend.

557
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's not even close to Spider-Man.

558
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's not even close to me. I don't even like Spider-Man.

559
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm saying it's close in the same.

560
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's getting closer.

561
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You're recognizing the idea I'm saying when you look at Spider-Man in the eyes.

562
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's very close to you on that ride.

563
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He's not quite as close as Optimus is though.

564
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No, Optimus gets a little in your zone.

565
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Optimus pushes. He's in your comfort zone.

566
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
He pushes past like your.

567
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well, let me throw one thing at you.

568
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I believe the Spider-Man, and it's going to be a very, I mean, I know I'm opening myself up for a lot of criticism here,

569
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but the Spider-Man in the Spider-Man ride, the old one is of the cartoon variety, right?

570
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It is of the Fox animation style.

571
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It is. And I granted Optimus Prime is also CGI, but there is an intimacy.

572
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You know, we talk about the uncanny valley.

573
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think that Optimus Prime actually is not that.

574
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And I think that maybe Spider-Man, you are maybe having that thing, right?

575
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know if I can connect to a cartoon like that, but I can connect to this.

576
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
A mask with no facial feed.

577
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The difficulties of masks is not just that it makes rides worse.

578
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's that you don't understand the emotion on Spider-Man's face.

579
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, Peter really should reveal himself to you at the end of the ride.

580
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You should say, by the way, but they can't write, pulls the thing up and then he gets in everyone's face and says, thank you.

581
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I love you.

582
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Why? Why? Two kisses.

583
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
A little kiss, an Italian style kiss.

584
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Sure. And then, yeah, moves on.

585
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That would be more.

586
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I am. As we're talking, I am.

587
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm taking a look here at the 4K ride through of of Spider-Man.

588
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's a little more time like not timeless, but a little less glued to any one thing.

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And the way that the videos in the line are kind of in the style of the Fox cartoon,

590
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
which is probably the Spider-Man iteration that made the biggest impression on me as a child.

591
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Of course. Probably still how I hear the voice in my head, even more so than the movies.

592
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So my view is colored by that fact.

593
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And look, and by the way, like, yes, but it's still a cartoon and there's something about it like and I know that again,

594
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it's the difference to me of I enjoy Monsters Inc.

595
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The ride, probably more than Men in Black, the ride, because Men in Black, the ride, they're cartooning humans.

596
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Whereas like, whereas the Monsters Inc.

597
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Ride, we're like, it's the same kind of ride that you're kind of experiencing.

598
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Like these things are popping out and they're they're going through this old town square.

599
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, I guess you're shooting at one of those things, but I don't know.

600
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's a man like I don't I don't know.

601
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I think Spider-Man is, you know, he's hanging down in front of you at the end.

602
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
He's looking at you. Sure. He's muscular.

603
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He's big, but he's there's no moment there.

604
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's a shushed off moment. You know, let me throw this out there.

605
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Spider-Man on the hood. OK, he's not as close as he should be.

606
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He's not revealing his human face to you.

607
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But also, he's like a guy you know and you're friendly with.

608
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And it's great to see him. Right. Of course.

609
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He's going to thank you. Of course.

610
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You can thank you. And he's going to be casual because he's your buddy and he's going to see you next week.

611
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
OK, Optimus Prime. It's basically like God is telling you.

612
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You did a great job. His voice. Amen.

613
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is this is as close as you can get to.

614
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I mean, I mean, yeah, God royalty.

615
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This is this is a bigger deal. Peter Cullen's voice is the greatest, deepest voice.

616
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You would imagine that the father would they call him the father. Right.

617
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's what he would sound like. He would have.

618
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes, his head would be giant and perhaps look blue and say this.

619
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This is going to seem this is going to be heresy to some people.

620
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think all these voice actors are amazing.

621
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And of course, they absolutely are. Peter Cullen's great.

622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's Frank Walker on the ride. His Megatron.

623
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And it's great. It's great voices and great performances.

624
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But here's this is one thing I realized that is holding me back from loving this ride.

625
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
There's a lot of confusion on my end about various things.

626
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I didn't grow up with this.

627
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't know the difference between Autobots and Decepticons.

628
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I do now. I like stared at it. I figured it out. Right.

629
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But the ride doesn't really help me. It's just I don't know which one's good and which one's bad.

630
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
One thing that doesn't help me is that like, OK, Optimus Prime is like, I'm Optimus Prime and Megatron is like, I'm Megatron.

631
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Like you're we're like seven degrees apart. Right.

632
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like these are not the one is good. One's the epitome of good.

633
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
One's the epitome of evil. And but they say the voices sound too similar.

634
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I think so. And then and mainly mainly just visually, I was thinking like it would help me if the characters would if they would wear like jerseys.

635
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I think they need jerseys. So you want a little patch, maybe, like a like a little like like the red patches mean that they're bad guys.

636
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Blue patches. They're good. Yes. Something like lightsabers.

637
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes. A color coordination, because there's long sections of this ride where I don't know who's good and who's bad.

638
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And maybe that's good. Maybe you would consider that like, you know, a cinematic gray area.

639
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, sure, I was going to say is not Macduff that far removed from Macbeth.

640
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Is Iago that different from Othello?

641
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You know, you and your books.

642
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I couldn't disagree more Megatron gray.

643
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Optimus blue and red.

644
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
He stands much more heroic.

645
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Megatron is kind of hunched.

646
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I get him in the cartoon more.

647
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But in the in this in the filmic depiction, it's all just like metal to me.

648
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's all just gears and metal.

649
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yes. And so I agree with you.

650
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
What I think where I I'm not looking for, you know, a hardcore story.

651
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I just need to understand where against this person there against that one.

652
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm not I agree at the root of your issue, but I'm not debating whether or not Transformers makes any sense more than do I understand what's going on in the ride and in the ride?

653
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I certainly do.

654
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Really? OK. Yes.

655
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Well, I don't why am I why am I not again?

656
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Is this is this another case where my heart is not and also do I have an ally in this in Jason?

657
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Do you understand what's happening in this?

658
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Well, I do understand what's happening, and I'm going to credit that to the original ride character, Evac, who has a little more personality than the other characters, who's a little more a little more of a human.

659
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
He's a little more human.

660
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, he's very he's competent, but he's in a little over his head and he's got to do some crazy stuff to like survive this in the way that like

661
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't I didn't really connect with Wheely until I saw the ride video and realized it was Tom Kenny doing it.

662
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You know, I didn't have to do extra research about why should I be scared of Star Scream?

663
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Well, Star Scream turns into a jet. That's kind of obvious.

664
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Well, that's yeah, he's awesome. He doesn't turn into a pickup truck.

665
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He turns into a fucking fighter pilot.

666
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
He's cool. At the end, he does. He goes shoot soft.

667
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Remember that? Yeah.

668
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
But this is another one of my things.

669
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like I was trying to do the math. OK, I was trying to get him straight.

670
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Side swipe is good, but Star Scream is bad.

671
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yes. Ratchet is good, but Ravage is bad.

672
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'll admit this. I get Megatron and Star Scream confused.

673
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
OK, yeah. I do get some of the Decepticons confused because they're all fairly gray.

674
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm hearing these names and I'm ultimately like dropping out.

675
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't know. And only because I'm like, I don't know.

676
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I have no idea. It's like I didn't.

677
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I know until I started jotting down off a Wikipedia, I had no clue what any of this was.

678
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And that to me is, again, the problem with the movie and everything like that.

679
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's just fighting robots.

680
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And then some of them are, one looks like a jet, the other one looks like a helicopter, one looks like an ambulance, one is a corvette.

681
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I don't know. All I know is that I got a job to do.

682
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I got a job to do and I'm going to be there.

683
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So you don't get caught up in the details.

684
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Maybe I'm too. I'm trying to figure it out too much and I should just go along for the ride.

685
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Well, this is I'm so glad because this is where I was going to segue to, which is we're talking about two different experiences.

686
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Right. I can say to you, I love Fast and Furious.

687
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Right. I think that that is a great film.

688
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I also love Jackie Brown.

689
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Right. Jackie Brown is a great film.

690
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
They're very different films.

691
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't watch Jackie Brown when I want to see Fast and Furious and vice versa.

692
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And I believe we got to treat these rights.

693
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm going back to Rise of the Resistance.

694
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Rise of the Resistance is not a thrill ride like Transformers.

695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I would even argue you can't even put them on the same level because, A, we don't have glasses.

696
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We're not in 3D.

697
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We're in a much more built up world.

698
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This is a three dimensional.

699
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
There's so much going on in that.

700
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I almost feel like the comparison of the two is like, you know, it's like, oh, my gosh.

701
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I mean, I'm hard.

702
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm hard pressed.

703
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Even think of an insulting comparison.

704
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I am macking me in ET.

705
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You know, it's like, let's, you know, I think so in my mind, they're two very different experiences.

706
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So I go on Transformers, not expecting to follow a plot.

707
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm just like, get me from one place to the next.

708
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm falling. I'm flying and I'm driving.

709
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm going slow and going high.

710
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm going low and rise.

711
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm like, let me let me take this in.

712
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
What am I supposed to be feeling?

713
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
What are the story points?

714
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
What are the emotions?

715
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Now where I think, you know, what Mike is saying is very valid.

716
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Transformers has a cake and eat it too, which is at the end they go.

717
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, by the way, this is actually an emotional ride.

718
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You were supposed to care about this and we're going to send you on your way and you're like, oh, I do feel love.

719
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So they're leaving you at that moment.

720
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like, hey, who cares if the rest of the movie was good at the end?

721
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We told you we gave you something and you're going to latch onto that.

722
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You're going to walk out the door happy.

723
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So I think that, you know, Transformers is very smart in trying to do that.

724
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's not like the mummy, the mummy straight up thrill ride.

725
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Mummy, it's like, you fly in and out.

726
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Is there a story I don't know?

727
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't know. I barely.

728
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So anyway, that's all I'm going to say is I think it's I think that they're very true.

729
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
They're two different rides.

730
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So I almost find Mike's idea insulting to compare.

731
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, that's fair.

732
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I mean, I would say that the great Roger Ebert would say about films that you have to judge a film based on what the people are saying.

733
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Based on what the people were trying to do and what they achieved, what the goal was.

734
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And when I talk about Transformers versus Rise of the Resistance, I'm thinking about did they accomplish what they are trying to do, what they're showing me.

735
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And also, did they provide me the feeling I would get that I would want from seeing the movie?

736
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Is it the ultimate version of it?

737
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And I would say like an Indiana Jones is the almost like ultimate version of Indiana Jones.

738
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Sure. I buy that's pretty.

739
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I agree with everything that you said.

740
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Transformers is the ultimate.

741
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I mean, look, we're talking about it now.

742
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So I may as well just get I have some slides I've prepared as well.

743
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So, Brett, if you would put up the slide one, please.

744
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So so yeah.

745
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So so when I'm talking about that, obviously, I know they're two different ride systems.

746
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That one is actually obviously like almost a decade newer.

747
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Let's describe some things for the just listeners.

748
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But go to the forever.

749
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
YouTube, if you want to see it is Transformers better than Rise of the Resistance.

750
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And you there's the statue, the thinker, the thinker is on the in the first line, pondering the great questions of man.

751
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Exactly. So so yeah.

752
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So so if we're just judging, oh, yeah, technological advancement or whatever, that that's not that's out the window.

753
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm really assessing as a person who's seen some Transformers and has seen a lot of Star Wars did these two things.

754
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Which one accomplishes the mission more than again?

755
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I haven't said definitively what I believe.

756
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
This is why the focus up here.

757
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So you're just asking questions.

758
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm just asking. I got Tucker Carlson type.

759
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm just asking questions.

760
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Just yeah.

761
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Just putting it out there.

762
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Some people have said some people are saying you should try to do the face throughout this.

763
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The flustered like.

764
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So is it better?

765
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Is it?

766
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Is it?

767
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
By the way, I think that what you're saying, I just want before we even go forward, I want to say that I'm excited for this.

768
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to look at this with a very open mind.

769
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
OK, great.

770
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
We've been in the trenches too much.

771
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
That's why we needed Paul.

772
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
OK, we're all sick.

773
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We're annoyed with each other.

774
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
We're all worth sweating in the garage hour after hour.

775
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Paul can help clarify.

776
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Right. So so yeah.

777
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So basically my mission statement, I've kind of already said.

778
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But yeah, I'm judging these two.

779
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Do they accomplish what they have set out to accomplish?

780
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And do I feel satisfied by what they do?

781
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I feel satisfied in my experience of experiencing the movie, the franchise, the IP.

782
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
All right. So let's go to slide two, please.

783
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
OK, first of all, let's talk characters here.

784
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Now, Rise of the Resistance is a long, much longer ride.

785
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Much more detailed, much much more varied experience because you obviously there's multiple pre shows.

786
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The queue is very long.

787
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But I would say that when you look at the number of characters that appear on Rise of the Resistance, there are a lot less than on Transformers.

788
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Now, Michael, please read some of these slides for our folks.

789
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

790
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Some of the great characters I didn't say great.

791
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I didn't say great.

792
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Never did I say words in his mouth.

793
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
All right.

794
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm listening to someone who at this point does not seem insane at this point.

795
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Right now, even though the thought to me is an insane comparison.

796
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And but no, I'm the insane one for putting great thinking that great might never say great.

797
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Never say great.

798
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Again, we know at this point that you have a hard time parsing out what people are saying, what they mean.

799
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I got it.

800
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I got it back off.

801
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I got it back off.

802
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Media Matters is going to put up Scott Gardner page up and go to go to task if he says if he has a word to some sentence I'm trying to say.

803
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Well, also, I mean, there's going to be a Mike Carlson part of that, too, because you have clearly not ranked important like General Moore Showers very low on your list compared to EVAC and Optimus Prime.

804
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Obviously, they're going to be first.

805
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But I feel like General Moore Showers should get a little more credit.

806
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
This is not a ranked list.

807
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And I'll read it real quick.

808
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Transformers.

809
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:33,000
We have EVAC, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Side Swipe, Megatron, Bone Cruncher, Ironhide, Wheelie, Ratchet, Ravage, Starscream, Grindr, Sideways, General Moore Showers, and Theodore Stallworth, who, of course, is in the pre-show and explains what's going on.

810
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah.

811
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Now, Grindr, of course, he's only in the first ride for a second because he looks at his big robot phone and he goes, oh, I'm sorry, I got to go.

812
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Actually, someone messaged me.

813
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
He is the app Grindr come to life is what you're saying.

814
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yeah.

815
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
He is the hookup app Grindr.

816
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And on Rise, we have Finn, Rey, Poe, BB-8, Hux, General Hux, Kylo Ren, Lieutenant Beck, Nine Numb, and some Stormtroopers.

817
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And it's like a good number of Stormtroopers.

818
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
A good number of Stormtroopers that are all mannequins.

819
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They're all static.

820
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
A couple of them wake up in the room.

821
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
A couple of them wake up.

822
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So, OK, there's a lot more characters already with Transformers.

823
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Also, I'm trying to take my bias out about this being the newer three and not anything even against the newer three.

824
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I obviously would like all nine movies to be represented, but that's not even what I'm talking about.

825
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I feel these characters, once you even get out of the queue, once you get out of Beck's ship, you don't see them a lot.

826
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You see some Kylo you see a lot of, but they're not as prevalent in the experience as Transformers, which constantly has a giant robot in your face.

827
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You're constantly interacting with them.

828
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Did you count the character that is on your car?

829
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Talk about intimacy.

830
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh, you're right.

831
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm sorry.

832
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
There we go.

833
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm sorry.

834
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm talking.

835
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm saying it.

836
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
There is a character in your car and that's intimacy.

837
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
That's true.

838
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
He's like Eve.

839
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I mean, look, is it a rip off of Evac?

840
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
A little bit.

841
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Just a little bit.

842
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Take media.

843
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Straight to media matters with you.

844
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
All right.

845
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Continue this charade.

846
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Let's go to slide three.

847
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think it's slide three.

848
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So what happens on Rise?

849
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
OK, you walk through the dirty line.

850
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You chat with Ray and BB8.

851
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You walk outside into the elements.

852
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Lieutenant Beck ship part.

853
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You see his smiling face.

854
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You see all the stormtroopers.

855
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
They're all mannequins.

856
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They're all standing there.

857
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's kind of cool.

858
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You see so many.

859
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There's sheer volume.

860
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
OK.

861
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
There's 20 mannequins.

862
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
What I would like to offer up, Mike, I believe that if you are presenting this argument,

863
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
you cannot be presenting bias.

864
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You are the great thinker.

865
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
All right.

866
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You're right.

867
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You're right.

868
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You're not walking into a room of mannequins.

869
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You're walking into an impressive loading dock.

870
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Many stormtroopers and one of the biggest screens you've ever seen.

871
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We don't make tend to think screens are a virtue.

872
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That vista into space is so grand.

873
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's a jaw dropper.

874
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I saw your jaw.

875
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
We were all four of us were there.

876
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We saw the jaw.

877
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I will say this.

878
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Lieutenant Beck part is my favorite part of the whole ride.

879
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Seeing Lieutenant Beck getting up close, getting up in his face is what I like.

880
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And you saw me probably do it at the time.

881
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You mean to a real figure that you're in a room with?

882
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, I said that's my favorite part.

883
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I agree that he is in there, but that's not even the part of the main part of the ride.

884
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
OK.

885
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
OK.

886
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So then you wait in the line a while.

887
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's more line.

888
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You crane your neck to some bucks and carlo.

889
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I didn't see you row real long.

890
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
This is a very, you know, if I'm here, I watch a lot of court TV.

891
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I would say objection, your honor.

892
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
This is this is, you know, I would say something more legal, but I would say at this point, you're you're you're you're creating a false narrative.

893
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
OK, I will.

894
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You're clear. You're purposefully presenting negative versions of this.

895
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:54,000
This is if you want to present the facts, present the facts, but you cannot be painting it with any sort of, you know, any sort of brush because you're losing me on this.

896
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Which part got you?

897
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because I'm sorry, I stopped to point out that you wrote evac ripoff in the text.

898
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What was it? Oh, what were you red flagging specifically?

899
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Training your neck to see like there's no issue.

900
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
They're like, you got to go.

901
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's like like the high screens on the transformer ride, which are sometimes your vision is blocked by the severe side of the vehicle that you are often pressed up right against.

902
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But you I always go front row, so I've never actually experienced that.

903
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, Mike, I'm going to say I the ride, the evac style vehicle that doesn't bump me bump for me.

904
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
That doesn't rub me the wrong way.

905
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But I'm seeing I'm not seeing you mention that Rises Resistance involves an elevator segment.

906
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Transformers also involves a secret elevator segment.

907
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And the the one of the guys overseeing the Star Wars stuff, Scott Trowbridge, yes, was involved in the amazing adventures with Spider-Man.

908
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So an elevator man.

909
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah, he's an elevator man.

910
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That's a well, I'll say I have thoughts about the elevator.

911
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah, I'll finish reading this and I will take any bias.

912
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I will I will rephrase everything to make it sound.

913
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I think you need to come in with your plan.

914
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I think you can flag it when he feels the.

915
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
All right.

916
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
All right.

917
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Give us your dad.

918
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah.

919
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Pretend you're at the belly room.

920
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
All right.

921
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Five at midnight.

922
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You know.

923
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
OK.

924
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah.

925
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So OK.

926
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The right the evac ripoff vehicle and on the debt dirty floor that has all the lines on it from the other.

927
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
There's a hole in the wall and it opens.

928
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yes.

929
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That is technically what happens.

930
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I am not going to stop it at every point.

931
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
OK.

932
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'll stop it when I feel like it's egregious.

933
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
OK.

934
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
At that point, you know, two stormtroopers see you and you hear them shoot at you for a little while, which is.

935
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
What do you mean?

936
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
There's a hole in the wall.

937
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
There's a lighter to shoot at you.

938
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's things walls that you don't know are screens that become screens.

939
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Is it that point?

940
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I think that's later.

941
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's more than meets the eye.

942
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Such I mean, you are losing your audience.

943
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You're losing your audience.

944
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Like, here's what I would say.

945
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Right.

946
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
OK.

947
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Go ahead.

948
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You can.

949
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I mean, like, I'm just trying.

950
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I'm trying to help you present your because you can't you can't look at us and say one of the most impressive new rides of all time from a technological storytelling perspective is this.

951
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, like you're treating it like, well, I mean, they got this gunky junky thing.

952
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Now, if you're talking about smugglers run, I may have I could say, OK, yeah, maybe it's a little bit more.

953
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You know, the actual ride doesn't really have that much, but there's got a lot of you can't you cannot shit on the literally the world building and the and the the ride itself is top notch.

954
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It is top notch.

955
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But you are really ripping this ride as if you're open.

956
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Like, it's like you remember when you get like those Sonic pops like from from an ice cream truck and the image of the Sonic pop is so amazing.

957
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Oh, I can't wait to eat the Sonic pop and you open it up.

958
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's like a melted Sonic or a melted Donatello.

959
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Like, yes, that's you know, that's how you're describing this ride.

960
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Like, it's like it's always the milk that it's it's never achieved.

961
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Then you can't do that.

962
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
OK.

963
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
All right.

964
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Well, OK.

965
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Then you go by squint and you can see Finn Robot and he's like 25 feet away because he's really hard.

966
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You got to poke the guy next to you.

967
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
He is kind of wedged in there and you really only.

968
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
He's hidden. It's a fun little.

969
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
All right.

970
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'll stay. OK. OK.

971
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
We're almost done. We're almost done.

972
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
We're almost done.

973
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It's supposed to be wedged.

974
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's a hiding.

975
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
He's hiding.

976
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
He's not in the open.

977
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
He gets shot.

978
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You get blasted to pieces.

979
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It is a cost cutting statue.

980
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We're almost done.

981
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It is a statue.

982
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
OK.

983
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So then you.

984
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
How many animatronics are in Transformers?

985
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Go.

986
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't say the amount.

987
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Well, it did cost 100 million versus the half a billion dollars it took to build.

988
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Jason's still wedging the facts.

989
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Right.

990
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
There is a.

991
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
There's panic setting over you.

992
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
If I don't get the facts.

993
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Look, we all have our little things we like.

994
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
He gets shot.

995
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
OK.

996
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You get shot up by the AT&T if you're lucky.

997
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
If not, like there's another.

998
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You get shot kind of again.

999
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
But you want to get shot by that ATT.

1000
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
ATAT.

1001
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Excuse me.

1002
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Then Kylo.

1003
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I misspelled it as Kyle.

1004
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Kyle kind of chases you.

1005
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And that's cool.

1006
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I mean, you see the bridge, you see the robot.

1007
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
There is a robot of Hux and Kyle there.

1008
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And that's Kyle.

1009
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Everyone looks at me like Kyle.

1010
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And then you get to the big gun room.

1011
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And I will say this.

1012
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I love the big gun room.

1013
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Big gun room is huge fan of the big gun room.

1014
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
My second favorite part of the ride other than the Lieutenant Beck stuff.

1015
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The big gun part.

1016
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Awesome.

1017
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
This is the moment where you can shit on Rise.

1018
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And you go, gun room, while impressive, seemingly is the part of the ride that never works and

1019
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
then you go, oh, I'm going to go to the big gun room.

1020
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And you go, oh, I'm going to go to the big gun room.

1021
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And you go, oh, I'm going to go to the big gun room.

1022
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And that's the moment where you can shit on Rise.

1023
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And you go, gun room, while impressive, seemingly is the part of the ride that never works and

1024
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
always breaks down and breaks the entire thing.

1025
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
That gun room is...

1026
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Is that it?

1027
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Is that why it closes so often?

1028
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I don't think I knew that.

1029
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,240
Yeah, that gun room is the source of all issues in Rise from what I understand.

1030
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,520
I believe there's a story about when they were first testing that room, one of the guns

1031
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,520
was a little off and hit the wall and shook the building.

1032
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,520
That's how strong those guns are.

1033
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,520
I will say this in your defense, to your point.

1034
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,520
You're talking about fulfilling the intention of the people who made the ride.

1035
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,520
The intention was for Rise of the Resistance to be open a lot.

1036
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,520
They have not necessarily made good on that intention.

1037
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,520
That's true.

1038
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
So, yeah, the big gun part is awesome.

1039
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,520
At that point, you really got battle damage on the wall, which I do like.

1040
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,520
Then you see Kyle again, the Kyle robot, and he gets blown up.

1041
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
That's cool.

1042
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
Hopefully that's working.

1043
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,520
Also, that's another issue, I think.

1044
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,520
Luckily, they have the fix, which is the screens, which is a good, smart thing to do.

1045
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:52,520
That scene shares a little with the Transformers ride in that it's kind of hard to tell what

1046
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
the fuck is going on.

1047
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,520
It's kind of a nod.

1048
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,520
It's a ripoff.

1049
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,520
It's kind of a nod.

1050
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
It's kind of a nod.

1051
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
A mode or B mode.

1052
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,520
It's smeary.

1053
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,520
Yeah, that's true.

1054
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,520
So then you go and you get in the little pod, and it's the screen part where you're flying

1055
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:11,520
down, and then you go outside, which is cool, and you see Beck again, who's my guy.

1056
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
It's impressive that you're outside.

1057
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,520
We talked about this before.

1058
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,520
It's impressive that you're outside and the thing goes in.

1059
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,520
You're delivered right to the ... Pinpoint accuracy to your gate, where you step off

1060
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,520
in awe, all four people in this discussion, in awe of what they just experienced.

1061
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,520
100%.

1062
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,520
Now, I will say this.

1063
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
I'm going to go out.

1064
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
I've heard your argument.

1065
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
I'm not going to jump in right yet.

1066
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,520
We have more to say, but I'm going to say this.

1067
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:41,520
If we are just talking about what ride works the best, I will say hands down, Transformers,

1068
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,520
day and night, there is no comparison.

1069
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,520
Transformers is a better functioning ride.

1070
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:59,520
As I have been on Rise of the Resistance probably five or six times, and easily three

1071
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,520
or four of those times, it has shut down in the middle of the ride.

1072
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,520
I'll say this too.

1073
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,520
I've been to Disneyland a lot of times since the ride opened, and there are a lot of days,

1074
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,520
most days, I would say, where I don't feel like doing the hassle of getting on that ride,

1075
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,520
of maybe losing a bunch of time, to waiting in a line where then it gets shut down.

1076
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,520
There are downsides to deciding today is a Rise of the Resistance.

1077
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,520
I went to Florida and I had the same issue.

1078
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:37,520
We got on, we got in there, we did the whole thing, and it died midway through.

1079
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,520
I was down in Florida last fall with my family, tried multiple times.

1080
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,520
They had just stopped the, like the week before we were there, they just stopped the virtual

1081
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:51,520
queue, so we got there at early park opening, went to get in line, ride shut down.

1082
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Another day, tried, and that day, tried to buy the $15 whatever Genie Plus add-on.

1083
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Too many people doing it at 7 a.m.

1084
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,520
Freaking out.

1085
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,520
Put it in the cart, went to check out, gone from the cart.

1086
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
Error messages.

1087
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,520
So my girlfriend and I have ridden it.

1088
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:19,520
My dad and brother who do not live next to Disney Park, have not, didn't get to it.

1089
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,520
That's rough.

1090
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,520
That's rough.

1091
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Look, if I, okay, I'll drop 50% of the, I'll drop 50% of the K-Fab real quick here.

1092
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,520
If we're also talking about, okay, this is the ultimate Star Wars ride.

1093
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,520
This is how it was always presented, and that's no bullshit.

1094
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,520
That's how it was like, this is the ultimate number one thing, Star Wars ride.

1095
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
You're going to get to experience Star Wars.

1096
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,520
And it's like, the queue I feel like builds you up perfectly.

1097
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,520
You get exactly sort of that experience that you would want.

1098
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,520
But I do, and I've said this before on the ride, on podcasts, the ride.

1099
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,520
I've said that I don't, I feel like the big trick.

1100
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
And what's the name of that show?

1101
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,520
It's around, it's on things.

1102
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Wherever you get your podcasts.

1103
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,520
The Forever Dog now?

1104
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Forever Dog.

1105
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,520
Is that the big trick of the ride is scope, and that's kind of it.

1106
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,520
As far as like, if you're actually under siege, you're getting shot up by stormtroopers.

1107
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,520
You're not getting sort of the visceral thrills that you're getting on Indiana Jones because of the ride vehicle.

1108
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
The ride vehicle is very smooth.

1109
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:26,520
So I kind of feel like if you were going to do a thing where you explore a big Star Destroyer, I do want more character stuff.

1110
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,520
If I'm not going to get jostled by blasts, if I'm not going to get attacked by probe droids,

1111
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,520
or if like stuff is not going to happen to me like on Indiana Jones where you're constantly, like your body is in terror.

1112
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520
I, first of all, I disagree with that.

1113
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,520
I've talked to so many people about Indiana Jones.

1114
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,520
Now I, I don't know about you guys, I've never stared into the eye on the Indiana Jones.

1115
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,520
Really? Wow.

1116
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
I've had a normal ride.

1117
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
I've had a very normal ride through caves.

1118
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
Oh, it's just regular.

1119
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,520
People are talking about a much more intense experience.

1120
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,520
We've always gone through the right door.

1121
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,520
You guys know, you guys have not had that experience?

1122
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,520
It's a totally, yeah, I know.

1123
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,520
The lights are off and it's, there's lasers.

1124
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
Very smooth.

1125
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
Yeah, very smooth ride.

1126
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
You've done the Jurassic.

1127
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,520
You're always boring anyway.

1128
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,520
Yeah.

1129
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
You've done the Jurassic Park.

1130
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,520
Like you guys, yeah.

1131
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,520
Wow, that's crazy.

1132
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,520
Here's what I'll say about the Star Wars experience, right?

1133
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,520
If we're going to, without getting into a larger Star Wars conversation, feel free to dispute this,

1134
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,520
but I'm just saying like I don't need to break down the prequels and all that bullshit.

1135
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:34,520
But the idea of Star Wars ultimately on some level is you get sucked up, you get trapped, you got to get out.

1136
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Right?

1137
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,520
Like that's like that is Star Wars one.

1138
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Like that is Star Wars number one in the prequels.

1139
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,520
That is Star Wars number one in the in the sequels.

1140
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Like right.

1141
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
And that's what it gives you.

1142
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,520
It gives you the generic.

1143
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Yes, Kyle is there, but it gives you a pretty generic idea.

1144
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,520
Like if you want it to be the Death Star, it's the Death Star.

1145
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,520
You know, you get, you get brought in.

1146
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,520
We see familiar characters from a bunch of different worlds,

1147
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,520
but it doesn't set itself in like a time frame.

1148
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,520
It's not like, OK, this is post rise.

1149
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:17,520
This, you know, I think it can be enjoyed ultimately as an evergreen experience for the most part.

1150
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,520
Yes, Ray is there. Yes, Kylo Ren is there.

1151
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:26,520
But the experience, the ride that you're getting is the most Star Wars type of experience,

1152
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,520
which is we all want to go to the Death Star.

1153
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,520
We want to be captured by stormtroopers.

1154
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,520
We're getting all that.

1155
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,520
We don't have Darth Vader.

1156
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,520
Would it be better at Darth Vader?

1157
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Yeah, sure.

1158
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,520
Sure. But, you know, but at the same time, what Darth Vader and Kylo Ren are giving me,

1159
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,520
if you change the mask, it would be the same ride.

1160
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,520
Ultimately, it is missing a central component of Star Wars,

1161
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:52,520
which is British character actors from the ages of very young to very, very old.

1162
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Yes, that is could use some very old.

1163
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,520
I mean, I'd love an old CG Grand Moff Tark, deep faked Grand Moff Tark.

1164
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,520
I'd love that. I mean, yeah, we can do it. We can build it.

1165
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,520
We want to do it. But yeah, so like, I guess really what if I was plussing that ride up

1166
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,520
after I've been on it a couple of times, it's like, then I would go, OK, you go into like a room,

1167
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:19,520
a little room and like raise there and she summons an old Jedi master and it's like Yoda or it's Luke.

1168
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Like, I feel like it's missing some of this warmth that I want to feel.

1169
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,520
It's missing some of the intimacy. I know it's about scope.

1170
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,520
So if we're not, if it's just because there's a limitation on the vehicle

1171
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:35,520
and we're not going to get a crazy sort of like a fight or flight response that our bodies give you on Transformers,

1172
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,520
I do want a couple scenes where I feel the different feelings of Star Wars,

1173
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,520
not just sort of the scope of being on a Star Destroyer.

1174
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,520
And it can be with Rey. It can be with the other ones, Finn and Poe.

1175
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
It could be any of those characters. It doesn't need to be with my guys.

1176
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:56,520
It doesn't need to be with Dexter Jettster, even though, of course, I would like that the best.

1177
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,520
Do you want you want Han to say I know to you?

1178
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,520
Do I want to kiss Han and have him say I'll say I love you?

1179
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
And he says, I know. Yes, I do want that.

1180
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:10,520
But yes, so that's I guess that's really what I feel.

1181
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,520
It's only kind of giving you one slice of Star Wars on the actual ride.

1182
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,520
I'm not getting emotional. I swear my voice just cracked.

1183
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Just giving you one slice of Star Wars on the actual ride.

1184
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,520
And you're missing a lot of the other stuff that I like from Star Wars that you could have put in there

1185
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,520
because the ride is such not a direct thrill ride.

1186
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,520
I feel like you could have put in more moments of warmth and intimacy.

1187
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,520
The things that I like from Star Wars, the train training or or calling upon the history of the Jedi.

1188
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,520
That's what I'm trying to say.

1189
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,520
I'm going to say this now, too.

1190
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,520
I think I'm sorry that I'm saying I should I'll shut up.

1191
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,520
No, no, no, no.

1192
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:52,520
I believe that the idea of Galaxy's Edge, right?

1193
01:08:52,520 --> 01:09:02,520
This outpost is that every experience when put together would give you the whole of the Star Wars experience.

1194
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,520
So Smuggler's Run is very specific. It's very different than Rise.

1195
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,520
I believe that there are other out. You can build a droid.

1196
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
You can build a lightsaber.

1197
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:18,520
So all in all, this is not a world in which we're getting three pirates.

1198
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Well, like we've been the past. We've had one ride, right?

1199
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:27,520
One ride and that ride kind of has to encompass everything here.

1200
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,520
Like Transformers, one ride has to encompass everything.

1201
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:36,520
This has the ability to be like this is just yet one flavor because part of your job in the Star Wars universe might just be being captured.

1202
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,520
One might be building a lightsaber. One might be building a droid.

1203
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,520
One might be running a you know, getting some mining equipment back, whatever it is.

1204
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,520
You know, so I think there is that element to it that I think you can't fault.

1205
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,520
I think that's by design. Yeah, I mean, I think I agree.

1206
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:58,520
I hear I agree with what you're saying. It is, though, like I mean, maybe it's just because like I heard they're canceling maybe the Galaxy's Edge in Paris.

1207
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:06,520
There's a rumor of that happening. So part of me feels like this was the shot at the half a billion dollar Star Wars.

1208
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Right. And don't get me wrong. It is obviously really great.

1209
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,520
I still haven't decided if I think it's better or worse than Transformers, but obviously it's really great.

1210
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
It's really impressive. I like a lot of it.

1211
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,520
Mr. Carlson, Mr. Carlson, I'd like to hear some of your arguments in favor.

1212
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Well, we're going to get there right one second after I finish.

1213
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,520
But now I feel like once I feel like maybe this was it.

1214
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:35,520
This was the shot we had. And I feel like and I feel like only 99 percent of the audience likes it.

1215
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,520
Well, that's a they really blew it with that one.

1216
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,520
I'm just saying I think I make some valid points.

1217
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,520
And obviously it's a great ride.

1218
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:48,520
But if it's the be all end all Star Wars ride, I feel like there's something I would approve.

1219
01:10:48,520 --> 01:11:00,520
Take away Star Wars. Just say, I wish one of them is it because I do believe this to be true.

1220
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:07,520
I believe it is one of the best rides like just technological.

1221
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,520
I didn't say I didn't say it was it. I didn't say it wasn't.

1222
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,520
What these little things you pull. I never I don't know.

1223
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,520
I wash my hands. Follow the tape. Oh my. Look at the tape.

1224
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,520
Look at the tape. Whatever this is, it's so annoying to me.

1225
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,520
I know. Read the transcripts. That's part of the show.

1226
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,520
I do this on the show to get a rise. You can't rise or resist.

1227
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:34,520
Your your issue is, while it is one of the best rides ever.

1228
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,520
Yes, it is not fulfilling the promise of Star Wars.

1229
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:44,520
So hence Transformers might be because it's fulfilling the promise of Transformers.

1230
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,520
Yes, yes, because the bar is so low it's on the floor.

1231
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,520
You could just step over it. Maybe you've never seen the bar.

1232
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,520
Maybe you didn't know the bar existed or doesn't ever had interest in looking at the bar.

1233
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Right. Yes, exactly. And to get and to give you like one, I'll give you like a piece of my like where I fall on the other side.

1234
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,520
The mistake was, I think.

1235
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Not of being so hard and fast with no Darth Vader, no Chewbacca, no, you know, these these rules that they made for Galaxy's Edge.

1236
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,520
I thought was actually a very dumb move, and they've now retconned that a little bit.

1237
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:32,520
I think some of these rides suffer from living in this world of post Vader, post Han.

1238
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,520
Like that's probably the biggest error of Star Wars land.

1239
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
Like in my in my mind, it did.

1240
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,520
And it did no favors to the right.

1241
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:50,520
I think when we saw leaked footage or footage, excuse me, art of the original crazy ticket they were going to build in tomorrow land of Star Wars, which had like a day go by swamp scene.

1242
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,520
And then there was a death star scene like it felt like, OK, that's like the greatest hits Star Wars ride.

1243
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,520
And then you start to go.

1244
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,520
But is that just the Avatar boat ride?

1245
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:09,520
Could be. That's something you saw as an adult that was never close to getting built.

1246
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Right. Right. 40 years ago.

1247
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,520
But the vibe was, oh, that is the ultimate ride. That is the ultimate Star Wars ride.

1248
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,520
I guess so. That's that's what I'm saying.

1249
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
For you there. That's interesting.

1250
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
Yes, sure.

1251
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,520
There was also the hypothetical plans before Disney bought Star Wars where it's like, OK, there's going to be a desert section.

1252
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
There's going to be a hoth section.

1253
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:41,520
And like when they were going to try to cram it into tomorrow land at Disneyland, it's like, all right, we're going to plant a bunch of trees here and have a high speed speeder bike chase as if you're on Endor.

1254
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,520
Right. And they'll put the Falcon above the land and you can walk through it.

1255
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,520
Right. Let me say this before we get to and we'll get to the next slide.

1256
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:56,520
But since I suspect that it is it is it's possible to me that it could be full of nonsense.

1257
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,520
So let me say a real argument in this dry delineation of Rise of the Resistance.

1258
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,520
And I'm going to go back to what Paul said and take Star Wars out of it.

1259
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,520
It is a ride where there's a lot there's a ride in the line.

1260
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:15,520
There's like tons of steps to it and like role playing with the cast members and all this stuff.

1261
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:26,520
And then what you say as screen ride part is where your trackless vehicle drives itself into a simulator, which performs a drop.

1262
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,520
Now, here's a real argument that I wanted to make to you because I did Transformers the other day.

1263
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:41,520
And I hear your point about like you get maybe more visceral movements and thrills and stuff out of Transformers and maybe can't argue with that.

1264
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:48,520
But in terms of I think you're underrating the rise up to the level of the ad ads and then the drop at the end.

1265
01:14:48,520 --> 01:15:01,520
I genuinely don't think and I think if you were somehow able to do them one after the other, I genuinely don't think that there's a single thrill in Transformers as much as big as the drop towards the end.

1266
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,520
I really do believe that for me, because I know there's elevator and you go up in that.

1267
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
But it's not as good as Spider-Man.

1268
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,520
I don't think in terms of a big drop at the end for me.

1269
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,520
That's that's my I think you can't discount.

1270
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,520
I think you're underrating.

1271
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,520
There's not a lot of thrills, but you're underrating a little bit of thrills on that.

1272
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,520
Here's how I feel about it, too.

1273
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,520
Like I and look, it's very easy to kind of figure out how all these things are done.

1274
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,520
If you want, I treat rise like a magic trick that I don't want revealed.

1275
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,520
I don't want to know.

1276
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,520
I'm sure I could really overly think about it and discover it.

1277
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:53,520
But I truly feel and even when it's broken down, a sense of awe, like there is a there are there are all moments, all inspiring moments in that ride that Transformers simply does not have that no ride before rise has had.

1278
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,520
Ultimately, in my opinion, the scope.

1279
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
Yeah, that's what I was saying before.

1280
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,520
The scope of rise.

1281
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Yes, is probably there's no other comparison.

1282
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Anything that has sort of that while environment.

1283
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
Yeah, right.

1284
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,520
I mean, I guess any when you come in in the temple.

1285
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:15,520
Yeah, there's a that's a it's like, like, India is an upgrade of haunted mansion on some level.

1286
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,520
Right.

1287
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,520
Like I'm just saying, like in a very bare bones scenario that you switch it out.

1288
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,520
India's dinosaur, which was already at Animal Kingdom.

1289
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,520
Or I guess the opposite.

1290
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,520
That's the other way.

1291
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,520
Yeah.

1292
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,520
But yeah.

1293
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
But whatever.

1294
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,520
It's like it is just a track ride that you're going through.

1295
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,520
It's cool.

1296
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,520
It's big.

1297
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
It's indie.

1298
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,520
But I don't get anything from Indiana Jones on that ride.

1299
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,520
I don't feel like the all the fun of Indiana Jones.

1300
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
It's fun.

1301
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,520
I don't get a person.

1302
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,520
Obviously, there's no personality because not Harrison Ford.

1303
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,520
And the guy does his voice is like, Get out of here.

1304
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,520
Well, you know, it's like it's just say it's a huff and a gruff.

1305
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,520
And you know, you get from from what's his face from Sala, you know, but yes.

1306
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,520
Yeah, for sure.

1307
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,520
That's pre show.

1308
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,520
That's pre show.

1309
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,520
Right.

1310
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,520
I would say, though, Indy is not a warm guy, so I'm not looking for the same warmth from

1311
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,520
India.

1312
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:13,520
But well, if Mutt, if the Transformers version of Pirates Johnny Depp, if Mutt was hanging

1313
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,520
from the ball in front of the ball now because they installed it during Crystal Skull.

1314
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1315
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,520
Oh, and they were playing like rock around the clock and he's combing his hair.

1316
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,520
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

1317
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
So get to this.

1318
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Get to this.

1319
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
We'll just go to the next slide.

1320
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah, that's fine.

1321
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
That's all we can go through it.

1322
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
I look it's fine.

1323
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
We don't have to believe this point.

1324
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
No, no, no.

1325
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,520
Oh, no, no, you will go beef beef this one quickly.

1326
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
I'll go quickly.

1327
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
I'll go.

1328
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
What happened on Transformers?

1329
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,520
You can learn from the great Theodore Stallworth and then Bumblebee fights Megatron.

1330
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,520
He grabs the all spark.

1331
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
It's so very exciting.

1332
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,520
You head into the city at a frenetic pace and then Optimus like roll out and it's awesome.

1333
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
You're rolling.

1334
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
You feel like you're rolling.

1335
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,520
That's hang on.

1336
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
Get that word out of there.

1337
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,520
You didn't put words like that in the first description.

1338
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
You can't.

1339
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
You're not allowed to say.

1340
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,520
OK, OK, OK.

1341
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,520
Roll out.

1342
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,520
Roll out is one of the few Transformers things that I do know.

1343
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,520
Yeah, that is one of the things that I have no problem with that.

1344
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,520
It's the word awesome.

1345
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,520
You are putting your opinions into this.

1346
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,520
OK, fair enough.

1347
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,520
So you fight Megatron going through the city.

1348
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,520
Now, this is a good question.

1349
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,520
I will say Megatron is the one with the blades or is that Starscream?

1350
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
I think it's Megatron, right?

1351
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,520
He's got the blades.

1352
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
You're asking the wrong people.

1353
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,520
You don't even know the right thing you're saying is better.

1354
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,520
You know, you can't.

1355
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,520
Well, whoever has the blades, it's thrilling going that close to the blades.

1356
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,520
You sort of slow down.

1357
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,520
I also I don't want to get too far off topic here, but and get out of your flow here.

1358
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,520
But like, OK, we just breeze past all spark.

1359
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,520
This is one of the biggest.

1360
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,520
What the fuck is the all spark?

1361
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,520
Who fucking cares about the all spark?

1362
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
Are you invested in the old?

1363
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,520
It's like a McGuff that I love the all spark.

1364
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
I do.

1365
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
I do legitimately.

1366
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,520
OK, Fabe, whatever.

1367
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,520
I'd love the all spark.

1368
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,520
Why?

1369
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Why?

1370
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,520
I've been on the ride so many times.

1371
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,520
But why did you love it the first time?

1372
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,520
I didn't say I loved it the first time.

1373
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,520
I mean, Evac and theater.

1374
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,520
So we're at the end of the podcast.

1375
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,520
Paul.

1376
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,520
Paul, what do you think of the all?

1377
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,520
What do you think of the fucking all spark?

1378
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,520
You like the all spark.

1379
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,520
McGuffin, who's the fucking all spark?

1380
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,520
I mean, I love the all spark.

1381
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
I love the all spark.

1382
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
I love the all spark.

1383
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,520
What do you think of the fucking all spark?

1384
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
You like the all spark.

1385
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
McGuffin, who cares what the all spark is?

1386
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
I got to grab the thing.

1387
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
It's fun to say.

1388
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,520
Yeah, he might as well say you must protect the Maltese Falcon.

1389
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,520
You must protect the Infinity Gauntlet.

1390
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,520
Yeah.

1391
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,520
But you said you love what's one thing.

1392
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,520
Give me one specific about the all spark.

1393
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
The name of it.

1394
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,520
I like saying the name of it because I've been on the ride so many times.

1395
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,520
All spark.

1396
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
And he says all spark.

1397
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,520
It's all couched in the amount of time.

1398
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,520
He said you must protect my toilet.

1399
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,520
I would say toilets great.

1400
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,520
It's completely in the context of the ride that I like this phrase.

1401
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
Okay.

1402
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,520
Like who?

1403
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,520
I understand what you're saying.

1404
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,520
It has a cool name.

1405
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
It doesn't mean it.

1406
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,520
But it's like you can't say I like the all spark.

1407
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,520
It's like that's a thing like.

1408
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,520
Well, you could say you love it.

1409
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,520
But you could say you like the Maltese Falcon and who gives a shit about that?

1410
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,520
But doesn't this is a thing genuinely that pulls me out of the ride.

1411
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,520
I think I do need to care about the goal.

1412
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,520
If I don't understand what the goal is and what the all spark does,

1413
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,520
and I have to watch like a bunch of pre show videos to get it.

1414
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,520
That's all it is.

1415
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:16,520
It's like a little nuclear like a nuclear battery that could be in the wrong hands could be devastating to the world.

1416
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:22,520
And in the right hands, my monkey brain is sort of like I'm just like, okay, it's a battery.

1417
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,520
And these robots need batteries.

1418
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,520
I like this argument.

1419
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520
This makes sense to me.

1420
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:36,520
But if you're asking me to care and for stakes to matter, I think I do need to understand and care about the all spark.

1421
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,520
OK, and I have not.

1422
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,520
No one has made me do it.

1423
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,520
It's a little battery.

1424
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,520
Well, I mean, it is protected in a nest facility, which, by the way, stands for non biological extraterrestrial species treaty.

1425
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,520
That's true.

1426
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:57,520
Yeah, well, now I mean, yeah, this is another thing that I want to bring up because now I'm like now I'm getting into a few things that I feel like I always thought.

1427
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,520
The promise of the premise of these screen rights was that they would be rebooted every five years.

1428
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,520
Right.

1429
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:11,520
Like, and that's what they've done to a certain extent with Star Wars, the ride stars, star tours and to great success, in my opinion.

1430
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,520
But why aren't we doing this?

1431
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,520
Why aren't we?

1432
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,520
Why aren't we upgrading these rides?

1433
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,520
Why aren't we changing some features?

1434
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,520
Why aren't we having a rotating screen?

1435
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
Why is it so hard?

1436
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,520
You know, on these rides, they're primarily screen based that we can't just, you know, every five years, swap them out.

1437
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,520
And so to me, Rise is an art piece and it's a locked in art piece.

1438
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,520
You can't change it.

1439
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,520
There's no screen.

1440
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,520
There are screens, but they're used to the effect of like you're not wearing 3D glasses.

1441
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,520
You're in an environment.

1442
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,520
You have transported yourself to a world.

1443
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,520
This I am at a cool 3D movie.

1444
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,520
I'm at a 4DX show.

1445
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,520
And this is me talking about as a fan of this ride.

1446
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,520
It's the best 4DX ride I've ever been on.

1447
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,520
I didn't like Jurassic Park, the new one, the reboot.

1448
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,520
But I saw the first one in 4DX and it made that experience 10 times better.

1449
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:06,520
I said to people like when they said I hated that first movie, I was like, well, see it in 4DX because at least you're feeling a girl on a ride.

1450
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
And that's and that's sometimes what you need.

1451
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,520
Yeah, that makes sense.

1452
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,520
Yeah, they should be able to like put new robots in here and there.

1453
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,520
At least in the background.

1454
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,520
Something.

1455
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,520
It's like, how hard is it to do that?

1456
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,520
Like you've already built the infrastructure.

1457
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,520
Like I can't imagine that film in the programming is that intense.

1458
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,520
Yeah, like that is like cost prohibitive.

1459
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,520
I think, yeah, like with Star Tour, they have to I will give Star Tour credit because they have changed.

1460
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,520
They've put new stuff in.

1461
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,520
It took a long time.

1462
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,520
Yeah, they now do it.

1463
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,520
But that was the promise of the premise back then, too.

1464
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,520
It was like, OK, we're going to keep on.

1465
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
We're always going to add new things.

1466
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
You'll never know what you're going to get.

1467
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,520
Like that's what we want.

1468
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,520
I mean, that's that's the re the rewatch ability.

1469
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,520
That's like, you know, it's like I love going on these rides.

1470
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:55,520
But like but if you're doing a screen thing, that's should be part of it is like, oh, we can change it up.

1471
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,520
We can we can make these elements feel different.

1472
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:05,520
It would be fun if they could do like a full cartoon style Transformers overlay where you go on and it looks just like the old cartoon or something like that.

1473
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
I think that would do.

1474
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
I think I would all it's all it would take for me.

1475
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Is that true?

1476
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
I think so.

1477
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
I genuinely don't like it aesthetically.

1478
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,520
That's a big, big thing.

1479
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,520
Maybe I haven't vocalized that holds me back because I don't like the movies aesthetically.

1480
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,520
Yeah, I just see a bunch of gears.

1481
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,520
I read I recognize that.

1482
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,520
I'm sure you'll say some good stuff about when you go into the mouth of Grindr.

1483
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,520
Oh, that's a Devastator.

1484
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,520
Devastator.

1485
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,520
All right.

1486
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,520
Yeah, Devastator is trying to get you in his mouth.

1487
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:36,520
I wrote he's specifically a Constructicon, which is a subdivision of the other types of Transformers.

1488
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,520
Constructicon.

1489
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Yeah, I think it looks silly when you're looking at all the gears.

1490
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:47,520
That looks like you're in a like the video that plays before the movie starts in like a Lowe's theater in 2003.

1491
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,520
Maria Menudo should be welcome to the portal.

1492
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,520
I both agree with what you're saying, but I also love it.

1493
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,520
And I love it when you're in like vibrating and they're rocking your spine.

1494
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,520
See that this is what I hate about this because I like Transformers around.

1495
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
You're making me argue against it.

1496
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,520
And I think the more I think about it, the more I'm like, well, this is dumb.

1497
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,520
It is dumb.

1498
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,520
But it is a fun ride.

1499
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,520
It's like a water.

1500
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,520
It's like it's like me overanalyzing a water slide.

1501
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,520
Right. I'm like, oh, that was a fun water side.

1502
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,520
But if I'm starting to think about it, well, is it that great?

1503
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,520
This is that and this is this.

1504
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:26,520
But like where Star Wars is going to hold up to any sort of it's going to it's going to hold water.

1505
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,520
Let me bring you back. OK.

1506
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
I think you'll agree with me on this.

1507
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:36,520
All right. So when there's a fistfight in this ride between the robots, you feel every punch and I'm not no bullshit.

1508
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:47,520
Like as a kid, when you're playing with toys or as an adult in his 30s, you're playing with toys and you're making the sound effects and you're going like you like kind of desire to feel the impact.

1509
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:53,520
And this is like on one of the only rides where you're watching fights and it feels like you can feel the reverberations of the robots.

1510
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,520
And it's a gun vehicle based.

1511
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,520
It's my body slamming.

1512
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,520
But like every impact is so like, well, sound affected.

1513
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,520
And I feel like you feel every fight.

1514
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,520
It's like raging bull.

1515
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,520
You feel the impact of the of the punches.

1516
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,520
I will grant you that.

1517
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:18,520
And I'll grant that that some of the big moments in this ride, I do like despite not knowing a lot about the characters being that attached to them.

1518
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,520
Like I do like going through Devastator because it's like a gag I recognize from Cartoon.

1519
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,520
Yes.

1520
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,520
Character gets eaten by a lion or character gets eaten comes out the other side like Ace Ventura.

1521
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
You know, or a classic.

1522
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,520
I don't quite understand.

1523
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,520
I think the AllSpark is very powerful.

1524
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
Is it unlimited power?

1525
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,520
I think that might be the guffin element.

1526
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:44,520
So like when Evac says no more running and you know, you kill Megatron, it's the old trick of like you want it so much.

1527
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,520
Have it.

1528
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,520
And like the character like shoves the crystal in the other character's brain or something.

1529
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,520
And he pushes through his chest and you feel the impact of it.

1530
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,520
And it's like it's all if you're a kid who played with this, although I, by the way, not a Transformers kid.

1531
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,520
Wow.

1532
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,520
All this never owned a never owned a Transformers in my life.

1533
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:10,520
Scott, do you know that Transformers was one of the things where it's like this was a toy line first and they re-engineered that.

1534
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,520
Not only that, I was wondering that.

1535
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:23,520
Yeah, it was a character from like two Japanese toy lines that they kind of repackaged for American audiences and then kind of gradually came up between the cartoon and the comic books.

1536
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,520
Came up with characters and names and expanded and stuff.

1537
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:33,520
Very similar to, you know, the G.I. Joe cartoon toys of the 80s and 90s were very given to.

1538
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:46,520
Not to plug my own thing, but when I did my Marvel 616 doc, I spoke to the gentleman they brought in to kind of I did it all about brute force, which was the idea to do a toy line into a comic book.

1539
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:52,520
And to it was basically a toy line reverse engineered into a bigger IP.

1540
01:26:52,520 --> 01:27:00,520
And I talked to the definitive Transformers writer and then we had like a giant section about that that I would love to have gotten out there, but it was totally off topic.

1541
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,520
But yeah, it's amazing.

1542
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:12,520
Like this guy named the majority of trans like everything that we know about Transformers is because this guy was assigned this is a British Marvel writer who just is like, you got to take on this thing.

1543
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,520
And he really has created most of it just because of it was the only work you could get.

1544
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,520
Wow. Yeah, it's so it's so fun.

1545
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,520
Like there's that Masters of the Universe documentary that's on there for was on Netflix, at least probably still is.

1546
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:29,520
And it's just a bunch of people sitting around office going as a skeleton bad guy, Skeletor.

1547
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,520
OK, his name is Skeletor.

1548
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,520
Meanwhile, cut to now and it's just like he's hyper analyzing every bit of it.

1549
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,520
I think like this thing of wanting to get punched.

1550
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,520
I don't want it.

1551
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,520
That doesn't.

1552
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,520
That's not fun to me.

1553
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,520
And I think this is just one of those.

1554
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,520
This is just opinion because you so many times bring up like I want my douchey Vegas pool party.

1555
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,520
Oh, I love it.

1556
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,520
Yeah.

1557
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,520
And I don't understand that one either.

1558
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,520
I think those are very similar.

1559
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:05,520
I just I can speak Mike on this because I agree with I there are there are things that I like, but you can't compare the two.

1560
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,520
Like, I mean, it's like you can't compare like a private island and a Vegas pool party.

1561
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,520
It's like one is they're very different experiences.

1562
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,520
And so I know that like I got in trouble with this with Weiger when I was on Doughboys.

1563
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:32,520
I feel like that's maybe I haven't been on Doughboys because I made a mention about like can't even really talk about pizza that's coming out of the oven because when you have real pizza that we know what it tastes like, everything is we got to judge it in a different degree.

1564
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,520
But but I feel like this is a part of the thing, too.

1565
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:47,520
It's like you can say like I could say to you, I would write I prefer to ride Transformers after a night of Halloween Horror Nights over rise because it like it captures a moment, a mood and excitement.

1566
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,520
You know, and rise.

1567
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,520
And it may not be like a ride that I want to do like three times in a day.

1568
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
Splash Mountain.

1569
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,520
I may want to do like three times like that, you know, but that's a different thing.

1570
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:02,520
All I would say to that is like is that as a kid playing Star Wars, a big part of it was X-wing TIE fighter.

1571
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:06,520
You're in the thing and like something would get, you know, you pretend stormtroopers were shooting, you get blown away.

1572
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:16,520
Like I feel like it would go a long way if they had just had a part where you get shot by a big laser cannon and the vehicle like spins out, hits into the wall or something and then keeps going.

1573
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:24,520
There's like some sort of just base level kid desires that I don't feel are necessarily fulfilled on Rise of the Resistance.

1574
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,520
Like you get you're getting shot at by lasers.

1575
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,520
You're never feeling the impact of it.

1576
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,520
You're never having that moment of when you're a kid and you're doing it.

1577
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,520
You should get in like Star Tours and even on the Millennium Falcon.

1578
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,520
You got the magic.

1579
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,520
You got the magic of how did I walk from the outside and now I'm inside the star thing.

1580
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,520
That's great, too.

1581
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,520
Turn around.

1582
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
I see all the coming out of the same door.

1583
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,520
You got the I'm flying up.

1584
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,520
You're you're in you're going back out into space.

1585
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,520
You're coming out like there's all that whole thing is magic tricks.

1586
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,520
Yeah, for sure.

1587
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,520
I'm just saying again, ultimate experience.

1588
01:29:53,520 --> 01:30:02,520
I think if I'm analyzing what I'm looking for, it's something like that, that you're getting more on Transformers where you're getting that kid, the thing when you're smashing your action figures together.

1589
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:09,520
And I feel like, yeah, if it's like that's the thing, I think that it felt like it was a little bit missing for me on the first ride or when I still ride.

1590
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,520
Let's let you finish.

1591
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
Let's finish out the list here.

1592
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,520
Let's let's do the argument and then let's all make a fighting robots.

1593
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,520
I talked about that Starscream turns into a jet.

1594
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,520
It's awesome.

1595
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,520
Oh, the office building when you swing in the office building.

1596
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,520
Love it.

1597
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,520
The first time I ever swung in the office building, I thought that ruled.

1598
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,520
Let me say that was something I learned about this.

1599
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,520
You know, who thought of this, you know, his idea.

1600
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,520
This was I don't.

1601
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,520
Steven Spielberg.

1602
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,520
That was his contribution.

1603
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,520
And it's pretty great.

1604
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,520
It's pretty it's awesome.

1605
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,520
The first time I did it every time I go in.

1606
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,520
Still, I know the trick.

1607
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,520
Obviously, that's not really doing that, but it still is so effective and such a fun

1608
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,520
difference from Spider-Man that takes Spider-Man stuff to next level.

1609
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,520
And then, yeah, Evac is a great little underdog character.

1610
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,520
He says, no more running.

1611
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,520
And it's so you really feel for him.

1612
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,520
I'm not sure why he's so I guess I know why he's so strained when he's speaking, but

1613
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:00,520
because he's under attack and original theme park character to great.

1614
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,520
And then we live that for that.

1615
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,520
And then again, this big punch, it's so satisfying in the way that you play with

1616
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,520
toys.

1617
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,520
You punch them all spark into Megatron.

1618
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,520
It's amazing.

1619
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,520
It's not awesome.

1620
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,520
It's amazing.

1621
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,520
And then you fall.

1622
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,520
Bumblebee catches you, which is a great effect.

1623
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,520
But yes, we've seen that Star Wars Spider-Man.

1624
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,520
So and then Optimus tells you that your bravery saved the planet.

1625
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,520
You cry.

1626
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,520
You see Megatron's corpse and you cry again.

1627
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:30,520
Either however you land on this issue, you have to applaud Mike for putting this together.

1628
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,520
I agree.

1629
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,520
But that that said, Paul, I think you need to like it.

1630
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,520
Do you have any sort of final judgments to make now that this has been laid out?

1631
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:49,520
When I first heard the opinion that Mike had, I thought it was outlandish.

1632
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:57,520
I thought it was completely baseless in hearing his very skewed judgment of both rides.

1633
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,520
And I think he should open himself to a more proper presentation.

1634
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,520
How come you didn't say a thing to him about I didn't say you should?

1635
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,520
By the way, I did say it quietly to the mic.

1636
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,520
Say it loud and annoying.

1637
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,520
I didn't say it was I didn't say that you're still calm.

1638
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,520
Say it.

1639
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,520
Spike your voice at Paul.

1640
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,520
Go.

1641
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,520
Oh, I didn't say I said Transformers is better there.

1642
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,520
OK.

1643
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,520
What did you say?

1644
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,520
What are we arguing?

1645
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,520
What did you say?

1646
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,520
I'm saying we're just exploring the idea that it is.

1647
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,520
Oh, OK.

1648
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
And just asking questions.

1649
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,520
Tucker, I mean, Mike Carlson to quote the Terminator to ride.

1650
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,520
And so the battle continues.

1651
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,520
Yeah.

1652
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:55,520
So what I would say is this in hearing the overview, I think it really crystallized for me in the last few minutes, which is what you are looking for in the ride, which is so I think if we're looking for a technological ride, build idea.

1653
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,520
We we I'm going to say there's no there's no there's no equal to rise.

1654
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:07,520
But if we're looking for like a thrill ride, a true thrill ride, I agree.

1655
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,520
I like getting put into that giant pencil sharpener.

1656
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,520
I like shoving that all spark into that head.

1657
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,520
You know, I think there are some really fun, visceral moments there.

1658
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:23,520
And I go back to my original theory, which is like I love Fast and Furious, but I also love Jackie Brown.

1659
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,520
They're very different movies.

1660
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,520
They both give me certain things that I'm looking for.

1661
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,520
I think for Mike, what you're saying is.

1662
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:41,520
The kid in you is more activated from Transformers, and then it ends with this emotional wallop and not saying that you like Transformers, just saying that, like the idea of like a kid playing with giant robots.

1663
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,520
And that's at the end of the day, I feel that same way.

1664
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,520
Like I walk off that ride ago.

1665
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,520
This is the best Transformers thing.

1666
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,520
Why can't they make the movies like that?

1667
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,520
There's an emotional wallop.

1668
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,520
There's a thrill.

1669
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,520
There's an adventure to it.

1670
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,520
Undisputed, unequivocal.

1671
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:53,520
That is true.

1672
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,520
And I think Rise is different.

1673
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,520
I think Rise is incomparable to any other ride.

1674
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,520
But I don't think it.

1675
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,520
I don't think it packs the thrill ride punch, but I don't think that that's wrong.

1676
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,520
I think it.

1677
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,520
I think it is.

1678
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,520
An awe inspiring.

1679
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,520
I'm not awe inspired by Transformers.

1680
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
I had fun on Transformers.

1681
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
I want to write it again.

1682
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,520
It's Splash Mountain.

1683
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,520
Star Wars.

1684
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,520
I'll talk about it.

1685
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,520
I'll talk about it.

1686
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,520
Star Wars.

1687
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,520
I'll talk about and say that's the best ride I've ever been on.

1688
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:29,520
And that like maybe I'm not adding that much clarity to it, but I think there are rooms.

1689
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,520
There is room to have that opinion, but I think it needs to be couched in a very specific

1690
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,520
way to what he's saying.

1691
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,520
Does that make sense?

1692
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,520
It does make sense.

1693
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,520
I think that's I think you're right.

1694
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,520
Yeah.

1695
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,520
Mike, what's your opinion after all that?

1696
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,520
What's your opinion on this issue?

1697
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,520
Let's see here.

1698
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:55,520
So after all of this is said and done, Brett, could you put up the next slide up, but then

1699
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,520
quickly put the next slide up?

1700
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Oh boy.

1701
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,520
Oh.

1702
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,520
Could you like Brett, could you actually go to the next, reverse it, go to the one before?

1703
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,520
And now to the last one.

1704
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,520
Okay.

1705
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,520
What's happening?

1706
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,520
By the way, that's Finn in the distance there.

1707
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,520
You can see him.

1708
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,520
What's happened?

1709
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,520
What's happened?

1710
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:19,520
Are you saying that Mike, in a way you agree with me that that both rides win?

1711
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:28,520
I think that both rides win if you take the IP out of of Star Wars.

1712
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,520
I think that was a good.

1713
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:36,520
I think that was a very good argument for Star Wars because I'm connected to Star Wars.

1714
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,520
I have a lot of emotions.

1715
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,520
And if I'm looking for a very specific thing, I'm either looking for character moments,

1716
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,520
I'm looking for moments on Star Wars, I'm looking for certain things.

1717
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,520
Yes, you're right.

1718
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,520
I'm putting too much of myself in it and not looking at it just as a big scope ride.

1719
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,520
Would you say the real winners were the friends we made along the way?

1720
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,520
Brett, could you quickly type up a slide that says both rides are equally good?

1721
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,520
Now, I want to say one thing.

1722
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,520
I because now my children are downstairs.

1723
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,520
I can hear them.

1724
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,520
Sorry.

1725
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,520
All means.

1726
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,520
Yeah, I will say this.

1727
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:16,520
I brought my youngest who is five years old at that point, five turning six on this ride.

1728
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,520
Rise of the Resistance.

1729
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,520
And it broke down, of course.

1730
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,520
And he was very scared, frightened out of his mind at every given point.

1731
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,520
Now, this is a kid who's written has written soaring.

1732
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,520
He has written pirates.

1733
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,520
He's written Haunted Mansion, frightened out of his mind.

1734
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:43,520
When the ride breaks down, he turns to me, bursts out in tears and says, Kylo Ren is going to kill us.

1735
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:58,520
And to me, you may not be getting some of that thrill, but I believe the ride is giving you a much darker, darker thing because he thought Kylo Ren had effectively like that.

1736
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,520
The ride and broken down.

1737
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,520
Kylo rented one.

1738
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,520
He had stopped our car and now he was here to kill us.

1739
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:14,520
So much so that when the ride attendants took us out, he was not trusting them at all, thinking they were part of the show, which I totally understand in many respects.

1740
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:21,520
So I do think on a certain level, and we're talking about IP and all that sort of stuff, I think it is giving people a thrill.

1741
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,520
My kid that youngest had never even seen Star Wars.

1742
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,520
So he's coming into it the same way I'm coming into Transformers.

1743
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,520
You know, so there's that there is a thrill.

1744
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,520
There is definitely a thrill, a thrill of death, which is a thrill.

1745
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:40,520
And then he turned to you and went, Papa, what is his mismanagement of the House of Gucci mean for the company for high fashion?

1746
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,520
Only Tom Ford can save them.

1747
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,520
You know, I think we're talking emotional wallops.

1748
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,520
I think this episode has been full of them.

1749
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:58,520
I think this has been a fascinating conversation like like giant robots all grappling for the AllSpark.

1750
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,520
And Paul, thank you for joining us and having it with us.

1751
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:07,520
I think it's settled other than we'll probably get into this debate about seven more times.

1752
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,520
But for now, Paul Scheer, you survived podcast the ride.

1753
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,520
Thank you so much for giving us appreciate.

1754
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,520
I appreciate it.

1755
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,520
Can I say one more thing?

1756
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:26,520
Just as we cap it off and I know I'm doing my own leave, you can stay at the win or you can stay at the Hard Rock Casino, right?

1757
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
It's all a matter of what you want.

1758
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:35,520
They might be now my I might be dated because I don't know if any of that is good.

1759
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:41,520
What I remember, Vegas Hard Rocks coming back, taking over the Mirage and Virgin Hotels is running their own property.

1760
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,520
They're all proper.

1761
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,520
OK, so all I'll say is this.

1762
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:51,520
I think that we're talking about two icons, two of the best people to do it.

1763
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:58,520
Both of these rides in many respects and it does simply make them fight each other for supremacy.

1764
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,520
It may not be the best thing.

1765
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:06,520
We may just have to we may have to live on the Mount theme park more or whatever that was.

1766
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,520
I just appreciate that all these presidents have done something good.

1767
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:16,520
So so what you're saying is that the problem really is pitting them against each other and comparison and comparing them.

1768
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,520
An idea that was thought up by Mike Carlson and therefore Mike is wrong.

1769
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:21,520
Put it my side, Brett.

1770
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,520
Mike is wrong.

1771
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,520
Oh, you don't have it.

1772
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,520
OK, sorry.

1773
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,520
Well, it is wrong.

1774
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,520
We can put it in a post is wrong.

1775
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,520
Actually, Brett, I do have something to bring up.

1776
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,520
Can you pull up the thing that just says sign because we're not exiting through the gift shop today.

1777
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
We're doing it.

1778
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,520
Transformers, the ride style, because at the end you see a scary stencil that says Ropp and Ropp.

1779
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,520
Is retail opportunity all spark level for section two.

1780
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,520
So Paul Scheer, let's exit through the Ropp.

1781
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,520
Is there anything you would like to plug?

1782
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,520
No, just listen to how this get made and unspooled.

1783
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,520
We have some fun episodes coming up with some very big guest stars.

1784
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,520
So I'd be blessed.

1785
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,520
Well, a thrill to have you.

1786
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,520
Thank you so much.

1787
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,520
Pleasure.

1788
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,520
So I do want to say my one favorite discovery about this ride.

1789
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,520
Real quick.

1790
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,520
All right.

1791
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,520
It's very quick.

1792
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:12,520
I alluded to it before we started recording the actor so upset about the general.

1793
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:17,520
The actor, Glenn Moore, shower, who plays General Moore shower.

1794
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,520
Very weird.

1795
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,520
They used his real last name.

1796
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,520
He's the Secret Service agent in the TV show 24.

1797
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,520
I he's very good in this ride.

1798
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,520
How little I think a know of these movies.

1799
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,520
I thought it was an original ride character.

1800
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,520
He's in most of the movies.

1801
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:44,520
There is a moment where the Transformer Wheely interrupts and maybe some of the finest theme park delivery delivery of a line that's very silly, but said very seriously.

1802
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,520
He says to him, this better be critical, Wheely.

1803
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,520
And I just was delighted by that.

1804
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,520
That kind of made my day when I saw that.

1805
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,520
Well, you've heard it.

1806
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,520
You heard it here.

1807
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,520
Does anyone have June's number?

1808
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
Let's call June and get Paul back on.

1809
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:07,520
Tell those kids to hold their fucking horses for a minute and let's get that mixture.

1810
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,520
Here's the critical wheelie.

1811
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,520
It helps that wheelie is Tom Kenny doing like a Brooklyn guy accent.

1812
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,520
That's what he should say.

1813
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,520
That's what he should have said to his kids.

1814
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,520
Whatever he had to Lee.

1815
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,520
I hope this is critical, Wheely.

1816
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,520
Well, I hope this episode was critical for the listeners.

1817
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,520
Really?

1818
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,520
I really.

1819
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:29,520
I really.

1820
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:39,520
All our little wheelie and for all our little wheelies out there in the audience, you can find us on the socials at podcast the ride where I think we have to do the polls.

1821
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,520
Transformers or Spider-Man and Transformers or rise of the.

1822
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,520
Yes, we do.

1823
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,520
I'm so curious.

1824
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,520
I'm very curious.

1825
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:56,520
I won't try to lead it any further because it's possible that people will try to vote the other way to fuck me.

1826
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
Hey, I'm not telling them what to do.

1827
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
They should listen to this episode before.

1828
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,520
I mean, obviously they will.

1829
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,520
Maybe they will or maybe they won't.

1830
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,520
But they they should listen.

1831
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,520
We should.

1832
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:12,520
OK, so what we should do is do a poll first before we post the episode and a poll after and see who's been swayed.

1833
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:17,520
I to be honest, not me, but maybe some of the audience.

1834
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,520
Maybe we don't know.

1835
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,520
People who weren't being specifically scolded and finger wagged at in the room during it.

1836
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,520
We don't know.

1837
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,520
We'll see.

1838
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,520
The battle continues.

1839
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,520
The battle continues.

1840
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,520
The battle continues.

1841
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,520
Merch is available in our R.O.P. on T. Public and for three bonus episodes every month.

1842
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:39,520
Check out podcast the ride, the second gate or our new tier club three, where we end every episode with a moment of intimacy.

1843
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:44,520
Allah Optimus Prime, the most heart wrenching moment in all of theme park fiction.

1844
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,520
You'll find all of that at Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride.

1845
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,520
Mike, I feel like you got to you got to end it.

1846
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,520
This has been your time to shine.

1847
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,520
What do you want the listener to leave with?

1848
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,520
I want them to leave with an open heart and an open mind.

1849
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,520
And I want them to assess things they thought they knew.

1850
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:12,520
And I want them to re re-examine every aspect of their life when it comes to ranking IP base rides.

1851
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:19,520
I want I want to leave and get open heart surgery rather than discuss any of this again.

1852
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,520
OK, fair enough.

1853
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,520
OK, we're agreed.

1854
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,520
Bye.
