2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,280
Warning, today's podcast may include stuntmen falling into boxes, an encourageable rapscallion

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,600
named Kebab, and heart-stopping discussion of theme park stunt shows.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,740
Strap yourselves in.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:41,480
It's Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three childless men in their 30s.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
We're part of Feral Audio.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm Jason Sheridan.

9
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:45,480
We're part of Feral Audio.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,520
Heading to Orlando, one at Universal, one at Disney.

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,440
The Walt Disney World is getting the Tron roller coaster from Shanghai Disney.

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Which if you don't know that, yeah, there's a Disneyland in Shanghai now and their most

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,940
popular well-rated ride is a Tron-themed roller coaster, which I don't think any of us have

14
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
been to Shanghai.

15
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
No, not yet.

16
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,680
Don't withhold it if you have gone.

17
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,640
Please sort of let me know that.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,840
But no, we haven't been, but we've probably all watched the ride-throughs of it.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
It looks incredible just architecturally.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,460
It's this cool future pod thing.

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,160
It looks like an Olympic stadium.

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,600
It's just such a neat-looking roller coaster.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,160
You're on a light cycle, so it's a neon motorcycle essentially.

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
You go inside and outside.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
It's incredible.

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,420
And you're actually hunched over it like a motorcycle, which is similar to the Avatar

27
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,280
experience, which is just open where you're straddling it like a banshee.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,600
So it's a straddle ride.

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,720
That is an innovation I feel like in the last so many years is like straddling the ride

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
vehicle.

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,840
I feel like that's a newer thing.

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Am I wrong?

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,640
It's a fantasy that's been recently unlocked.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Well, it is new since the ET adventure, certainly, which we already talked about.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
That's basically just a chair you're sitting in.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,480
You're not really on a bike seat, but now you get the thrill of riding a fake bike in

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,700
the theme parks.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,680
This is also a common theme park trip that I see, which is that people love an attraction

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,080
or a ride that is based on a movie they could not care less about.

40
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,320
The Waterworld, we're talking about stunt shows today, the Waterworld stunt show, people

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,600
love that.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,640
People did not see that movie.

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,360
People could not give a shit about Waterworld, the movie.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,760
People really didn't care about that last Tron movie.

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,800
It seemed like they liked the design and the movie was cool.

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,280
I feel like the soundtrack was the thing that people liked most from that movie.

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,560
It provoked a bunch of new Daft Punk music, which is good news for the world.

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
So people were excited.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,560
But yeah, I don't know if anybody loved the film necessarily.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,400
The amount of time I've spent talking about and thinking about Tron versus my actual,

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,920
where I would grade those movies, they're both kind of the same movie.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,600
1982 Tron and 2010 Tron are kind of the same movie where there is a bike sequence that

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,320
is unbelievable and there is a disc sequence that is unbelievable and the rest is a little

54
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,760
dull and a little turgid and confusing, I think.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,880
The first Tron, the first 15 minutes, I remember watching it like six months ago and going,

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
whoa, what?

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,040
This doesn't even track the logic of this.

58
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,600
I also forget that I think I was watching the new one forgetting that Tron was a character

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,680
and when the character Tron showed up and people are like, Tron.

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,800
I think in my head Tron is always that's where they are.

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,760
They're in the Tron or they're after the Tron.

62
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,240
I can never, again, I love these movies.

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
There was a clip of Tron that played at a wedding mix that I made.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,120
The Tron was represented at my wedding and I still forgot that Tron was a guy.

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,040
We're talking about doing another Tron as well.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,220
They want a Jared Leto Tron movie.

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
That's the rumor at least right now.

68
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,480
The Joker himself, Jared Leto.

69
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,680
Hot topic Joker, Jared Leto will be the newest, is he going to be Tron?

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,800
Is he going to be Tron?

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,240
Is there any rumor about him playing, well, Jeff Bridges is not Tron.

72
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
What's his character's name?

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Can we remember this?

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,200
People are dying listening to this right now.

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,700
There's probably the few people who've found this podcast already or like big Tron heads

76
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,120
and what are they doing?

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
They're stumbling around the guy's name.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Butchering the lore of Tron.

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
But I don't remember actually.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Oh well.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Sorry guys.

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,440
No, Jared Leto is going to play the evil piece of code 001101.

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,920
Evil binary code.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,680
Boy, he's the nastiest code you ever saw.

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,320
He's a real living virus.

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880
Is that real or is that a joke?

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,440
Because I'm realizing I've never seen either of these movies all the way through.

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
It's dry enough that it could be a joke.

89
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Yeah, it could be.

90
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
That it could not be a joke.

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
No, I have no idea.

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,360
Look, we are in a movie news podcast.

93
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
We don't care about movies or see them.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,000
We go on the rides and look, the ride is almost the perfect Tron mechanism to have out there

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
because it's the colors and the lights and the music and nothing else.

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
No story.

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
The aesthetic.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,040
I feel like the aesthetic of both movies had an effect on pop culture and pop culture design.

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Incredible aesthetic.

100
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
When they came out.

101
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,560
And yeah, so there's one of those that exists already in Shanghai and it's coming to Disney

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
World which is exciting.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,800
There's been a lot of talk about where does it go because there's not a ton of space in

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom and we thought, does it maybe take over the Speedway or the,

105
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,200
which is the equivalent of the Autopia, the little cars you drive around, but it is not

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
taking over that space.

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,120
They reclaimed some Swampland off to the side of the Magic Kingdom and it's going to go

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
there.

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
So all the rides stay intact.

110
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Everything's staying put and we get Tron next to Space Mountain, two coasters in Tomorrowland.

111
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
It's insane.

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,080
Two giant e-ticket coasters right next to each other.

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,600
The people mover is intact.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,780
I was concerned about that, but no, it's just going to be further back next to it.

115
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:18,240
This might be where they were saving room to build the Persian resort.

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Really?

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,720
There was going to be like a Persian themed resort.

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
In the recent past or is this like a 70s?

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
This was a while ago.

120
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah, when there was going to be like resorts themed to different regions or areas of the

121
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,520
world around the seven seas lagoon.

122
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,960
So because there's the Polynesian and the Grand Floridian, but I feel like there was

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,920
supposed to be like a Venetian themed one and a Persian themed one.

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,760
And that I think they were working with the government of Iran at the time that was eventually

125
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,720
deposed in the Islamic revolution.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
So that got scrapped.

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Yeah, that's not happening.

128
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,440
They're not going to bring that back from the saddest fallout of these political events.

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,080
I think it was supposed to be back past the contemporary, like in the area where this

130
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
could stretch out to.

131
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh, gotcha.

132
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,120
So in the ride, there will be a single Persian rug as a nod to the possible hotel.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,400
Keep your eagle eyes out for it.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,960
I'm excited about this news because it maybe opens up the possibility of the Tron coaster

135
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,800
coming to Disneyland proper, the closest park to us.

136
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,380
And I think Tomorrowland is really starting to struggle in terms of having great attractions

137
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
in it.

138
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,840
There's this intervention space, which I think is the most frustrating, best real estate

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
probably in all of the Disney parks that nothing is happening to.

140
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,420
I'm really hoping that Tron ends up there or maybe taking over the utopia or submarine

141
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,080
space in Disneyland.

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,820
But I guess a lot of purists would not want the utopia to go because it's an original

143
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,120
Waltz attraction.

144
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,200
So is the submarines, I guess, a Waltz attraction, one that he oversaw and loved.

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,980
So you don't want to see those go.

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,480
But I don't know, I'd rather have the Tron thing.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
What do you guys think?

148
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah, sure.

149
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Yeah, I'll take a Tron thing.

150
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Yeah.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Terrible for the environment.

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Utopia and the Tomorrowland speed, which just constantly smells awful and just constantly

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,400
pumping out gas.

154
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,520
The submarines too use up so much water.

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,200
They ran those during the multi-year California drought.

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,680
So if you don't know what the utopia is, it's basically where a little kid can drive.

157
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,560
It's on a track and your kid can actually move it left and right a little bit, but it

158
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,840
never can get off or you can never crash one car into another little kid or anything.

159
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
It used to.

160
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
It used to not be on a track.

161
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,280
People used to be able to ram each other.

162
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,100
Which honestly, that sounds more fun than the current ride there, but I get it.

163
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,240
They call it a transformative ride.

164
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
This is the first time a kid gets behind the wheel.

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
Which by the way, does a kid really need to get behind the wheel?

166
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Can't they wait?

167
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,080
Why does an eight-year-old have to do that?

168
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,200
This is what the big thing in the theme park community is always like, well, this utopia

169
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,400
ride, a child will always remember his first time getting behind the wheel.

170
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
It's like, well, why doesn't he just wait until he's 15?

171
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,120
Then he'll remember his real first time when he actually had control of a real car.

172
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,360
If you're going to be on a track driving a car where you're not really driving it anyway,

173
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,360
I'd rather be on the one where you help Mr. Toad get to court and then get sentenced to

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
hell.

175
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
To hell.

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah, that's a more interesting drive to me.

177
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I agree.

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
It's more exciting.

179
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
It's more fun.

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,200
I don't know, but maybe our kids, would kids be disappointed to not have that utopia around

181
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
anymore?

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I don't know.

183
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I feel like if I was a kid, I'd be like, do I want that shitty gas guzzling little car

184
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,000
where I can't go anywhere cool or do I want to go into the computer and race with blue

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,480
and orange neon?

186
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
I think it's the second one.

187
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,720
Kids chanting, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron.

188
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
We know it's a character.

189
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,680
We know Tron is a character and not a concept.

190
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Tron, Tron, Tron.

191
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I didn't know it was a character.

192
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah, well, learn something every day.

193
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
So do you at home.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, probably.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,760
We're cutting them off, right?

196
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,320
Apologies.

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,400
The other roller coaster that's coming to Florida, which I don't know much about, but

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,840
if you guys want to talk about it, but there's a new Harry Potter coaster coming to Florida,

199
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,960
the original Harry Potter land.

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,160
Coming to Islands of Adventure next to the village of Hogsmeade.

201
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
They are going to destroy the, what used to be called the Dueling Dragons roller coaster

202
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
is now called Dragon Challenge.

203
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Is that right?

204
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah, so yeah, basically there was another land where the Harry Potter land now sits

205
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,960
and there was already these two coasters that would duel and they would have two different

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,000
cars that would go at the same time and it felt like, oh my God, they're going to crash

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
into each other.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They never did.

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
That was just a fun little thing, fun little gimmick, but then they rethemed them just

210
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
and called them dragon and barely added any sort of, like they added a little line, a

211
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,960
little cue things, but like there was never much like theming on the actual ride itself.

212
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
They no longer duel.

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Did the dueling go away?

214
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,000
The dueling went away.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
That went away for like a safety reason.

216
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
Like stuff would fly out of people's pockets in one coaster and hit the people in the other

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
coaster.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,040
Which is nickels flipping out in people's eyes.

219
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Okay.

220
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,960
So a wallet hits you smack in the face.

221
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,240
I think that is what happened.

222
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Did someone die?

223
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Oh God, I don't think so.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,760
I don't think so, but I feel like someone did get injured and may have been in a lawsuit.

225
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't think it was as bad though as like the Fabio bird incident on the roller coaster.

226
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Oh no.

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
If anyone remembers this, Fabio was on a roller coaster.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,920
I don't remember which one it was, but he got hit in the face with a bird and it busted

229
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,280
him open and he was like, he got off the ride and he was like bleeding profusely from his

230
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
head.

231
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
But I don't think anything that bad happened.

232
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,840
I think it was just some minor like safety issues.

233
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
But he's got like, it was bound to happen.

234
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,160
He's got kind of a big head.

235
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Of course.

236
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Of course.

237
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
How could it not?

238
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,120
There were plenty of other, it's a glass half full scenario.

239
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,760
We should count the people on the coaster who didn't get hit in the head rather than

240
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,560
the one Lunkhead who did.

241
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,760
That is, I mean you would think you get hit in the head with a bird very often on a roller

242
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
coaster.

243
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Because they're, you know, birds hang out on some of those things.

244
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,840
I guess they're moving pretty quickly so the birds maybe don't linger.

245
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,440
But like they're flying, they fly everywhere.

246
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,920
They don't know what they are.

247
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,640
Are there ever cases you think of, you know, roller coasters go flying by, whizzing by,

248
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,280
some of them are themed after birds or have wings.

249
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,600
Do birds ever think that a roller coaster car is a fellow bird that they can meet with?

250
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Is there a friend?

251
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Is there dear friends?

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm not going to go straight to the sexual implications.

253
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,560
That's very sweet that striking up a friendship with a roller coaster car.

254
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
That's beautiful.

255
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,960
Maybe that's one to try to get Pixar on board with.

256
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,200
I was going to say that does sound like a Pixar movie where like a little bird's friend

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,160
is a roller coaster and then the evil heads of the roller coaster company come and re-theme

258
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
it.

259
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,520
Take the bird, the bird theming off of the cars and change it to like a rocket or, no,

260
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,780
something like, something bad.

261
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,840
Like a, what's bad?

262
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Like a, like a gun?

263
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
An oil drilling machine.

264
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,280
An oil drilling machine or a gun.

265
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,020
A big gun that you sit in and you ride around.

266
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
You are a bullet.

267
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
You are, yeah, you are a bullet.

268
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
That's good, that's good.

269
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,880
The station fires, this station is shaped like a giant gun and you fire out of it.

270
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,380
That's actually really great.

271
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,380
That's a great Mario.

272
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,600
That should be a cannon and you should be in the bomb-omb.

273
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh yeah.

274
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,960
You should be the giant bomb.

275
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
You should shoot around.

276
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,840
It's kind of a shame that the Mario land is only the, there's only so much, like you could

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,320
do an entire Mario park.

278
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,440
I think probably every element of just Mario, forget the rest of Nintendo, could be an entire

279
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
ride in and of itself.

280
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah, because he's had so many different games and Mario Sunshine and Mario Galaxy, like

281
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
there's a lot of worlds this little man has explored.

282
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,240
I want them to build every single iteration of Mario Kart.

283
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm not happy with just the one.

284
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Let's get, let's get Sunshine.

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,320
Let's get a double dash.

286
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,160
I think every single one of them could be its own attraction.

287
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
Well, the plans also leaked.

288
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,080
See, this is getting off topic, but the plans leaked or at least a picture of what the ride

289
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,200
would look like, the Mario Kart ride, which is coming to both coasts and Japan.

290
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,000
It looks like they've crammed like seven different levels in one ride.

291
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's pretty insane.

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Cool.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
It's got like, yeah, like it's got the castle level.

294
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,640
It's got, I think it says Moo Moo Farm.

295
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,320
I think it has whatever the normal one is, Mushroom Kingdom.

296
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,640
So I do think they're cramming as much as they can into one ride.

297
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,920
If this thing is accurate, if this piece of leaked art is accurate, think hopefully the

298
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,680
leaker doesn't get arrested.

299
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,600
Hopefully Trump parties this leaker.

300
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Trump doesn't like leakers and that includes the themed entertainment industry message

301
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
board.

302
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,280
I like to be surprised.

303
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
What's happened to surprises?

304
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,880
We got no surprises anymore.

305
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,120
I have to go to Universal and I want to, I want to be on Wario's, what is it called?

306
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Damn it.

307
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
That joke was going to be good.

308
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Wario Stadium.

309
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
That's it.

310
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,240
I want to go to Wario Stadium and I know what's happening.

311
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
I don't want to know where the ramps are.

312
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,280
I don't want to, I don't want to see the ramps.

313
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Tell me about the ramps.

314
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Waluigi.

315
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,840
I want to see my friend Waluigi.

316
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,680
He's a high quality person.

317
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,080
I recently had a meeting with him and then an undisclosed second meeting with him.

318
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,520
So that I love more than going out with Waluigi, disclosing one meeting and not the other.

319
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,120
There's probably Trump Waluigi memes already that we haven't seen.

320
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Yeah.

321
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,880
There's got to be like, cause Waluigi is a bad guy.

322
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,680
Wario is a bad guy.

323
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
Trump bad guy.

324
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
Well, if he were here, maybe he'd make the argument.

325
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm not such a bad guy.

326
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
Why do you think I'm a bad guy?

327
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,240
Maybe there should be another, maybe there should be Wa Trump.

328
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,520
Maybe I am the good guy.

329
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,920
I'm super Trump and then we need Wa Trump.

330
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Yeah.

331
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,800
Or would Pence be Waluigi?

332
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,920
Cause he's slimmer.

333
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
He cuts a slimmer silhouette.

334
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,880
If you're just going for looks, sure Pence is Waluigi.

335
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,720
But I don't know, personality wise, I think they're two, the world's apart.

336
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Yeah, I guess that's true.

337
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,280
Anyway, Harry Potter.

338
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
Harry Potter roller coaster.

339
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,760
They haven't really announced much about this roller coaster.

340
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,680
Presumably it will be a smaller scale because families are going to want to ride it.

341
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:27,200
The dragon coaster that's there now is a pretty intense looping roller coaster.

342
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,760
So this one's probably going to be smaller.

343
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,460
Hopefully not as small as the unicorn challenge.

344
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
This could be inside.

345
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,340
Sure.

346
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,840
The old one was just one of the ones where your legs dangle, which I hate.

347
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,520
Legs dangling, that scares me.

348
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
I feel like somebody's going to pull me.

349
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm going to slip right through and fall or I'm going to slide out and hit a man in the

350
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
face going the other way.

351
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,760
So yeah, I would hope it was...

352
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,320
All I want, look, I want it highly themed.

353
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,000
I want a lot of robots.

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,960
This is basically what I want for every ride.

355
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,400
Highly themed, a lot of robots and a little bit of excitement.

356
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,480
Doesn't need a ton, just a little.

357
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,760
What I hope does not occur as this coaster is built is I hope they don't take out a coaster

358
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,760
very nearby, which has some history for me.

359
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,000
I think now this coaster is called Flight of the Hippogriff, which is what they put

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,400
in at Harry Potter Land here in California and it existed already in Florida.

361
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,760
It used to be called something else like the unicorn.

362
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
I think it was just called the Flying Unicorn.

363
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
The Flying Unicorn.

364
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,240
It's part of the Lost Continent section of the park that got cannibalized for...

365
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Taken over for the Harry Potter.

366
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,320
Taken over for the wizarding world got annexed, but they kept this little kitty coaster.

367
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:50,120
I went on this ride probably right after the park opened in like 99 or 2000.

368
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,040
I went with my family.

369
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,920
We're ascending the first hill.

370
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm in one row and then behind me is my mom and my sister.

371
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,240
When we start going down the first drop, huge screams from my sister, just terrified, as

372
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,680
terrified as could be.

373
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,080
It's a pretty tame coaster in the spectrum of things, but she is screaming and screaming.

374
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
It just hit her really bad.

375
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,240
My mom starts screaming as well.

376
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm spending all the time thinking, why is this?

377
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,320
This seems fairly heightened to me.

378
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
I wonder what's up.

379
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,760
Then we got off the thing.

380
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,740
My sister Kelly is really just calming down, coming down from it.

381
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,040
My mom is just glaring angry and I asked what happened.

382
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,720
Apparently on that first drop, my sister got too scared and she clutched my mom really

383
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,840
hard and just grabbed wherever, not really looking.

384
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,480
It turned out that my sister was clutching onto my mom's boob really hard.

385
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,680
The entire coaster ride just clamped down on it.

386
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,840
It's made me laugh ever since that for that full 60 to 90 seconds, my sister, ah, while

387
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
squeezing a boob.

388
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,800
A very disturbing, incestual moment in the Gairdner family history, but it's history

389
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
on the list.

390
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't tear it down.

391
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Yeah.

392
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:27,560
If I may, I have an upsetting anecdote about the Dragon coaster and my family.

393
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,000
When they reopened it for Harry Potter, they kind of changed where you entered and the

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,520
line and everything.

395
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:39,840
Where you used to enter, there was a series of concrete steps and I think some big fake

396
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
dragons.

397
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,880
It was clearly designed to be a photo spot.

398
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,320
You could get a photo in front of this elaborate stonework and you could get the coaster in

399
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
the background.

400
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,040
I think I was too scared of it the first time, so I did not ride.

401
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
My dad was going to go over.

402
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,240
He's like, oh, it's only like a 10 minute wait, I'd like to go ride it.

403
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,920
He went to ride it himself and me and my mom and my brother are outside waiting.

404
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
She's like, oh, go stand over there.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,840
I'll take your guys' picture with the coaster in the background.

406
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,440
There's two other kids around our age, like 11 or 12 or so, and they're standing out there

407
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
too.

408
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,840
We just kind of, hey, hi.

409
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,680
We kind of stand like, well, we'll give some distance so we're not in their shot.

410
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,080
Our mother, who I can only describe as an unhinged southern woman, was apparently not

411
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,280
taking a still photo, was taking video and just started screaming at the three of us.

412
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,080
Like, you all, you get out of there.

413
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
You get out.

414
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Hey, we were here first.

415
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
We're taking that.

416
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
My mom's like, okay, okay.

417
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,520
Well, sorry, we were just taking a picture.

418
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
We didn't know.

419
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
She's like, don't you talk.

420
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
You watch yourself.

421
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:57,280
And started yelling at us and we're like, what is happening?

422
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,680
My mom's like, okay, just calm down.

423
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,200
We're at a, we're families at a theme park.

424
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,480
And like, eventually the woman went with like, fine, have a nice day, asshole.

425
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,000
Like or like something.

426
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,960
And it was like very upsetting to all.

427
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,040
And they walked away, but we're just like, what happened?

428
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Like we were just so upset by this.

429
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,520
And we were just like despondent at like this woman who just screamed at us.

430
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,440
And my dad comes off and goes like, hey, that was pretty fun.

431
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
What's wrong?

432
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
What's wrong with you?

433
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,640
I was like, well, I, this woman, this strange woman just called mom an asshole or a, she

434
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,360
may have called her a bitch.

435
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,560
And there was a lot of kids around and like her kids were there.

436
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:48,120
And we were also, and we were like little dorky children, like little, and I was just,

437
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,520
it was like a terrifying, a very terrifying experience of watching like a stranger yell

438
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,800
at another stranger.

439
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,480
And you're sure it was not a street-mosphere character?

440
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,160
No, it was not a street-mosphere character, like the sassy fountain who will roast you.

441
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Oh, that's right.

442
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,640
We talked about that sassy fountain in what, a couple episodes ago?

443
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
I think so.

444
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Yeah.

445
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
That's why you can't have that sassy fountain around.

446
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,160
It starts giving people license to be sassy in their own real lives.

447
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,880
She probably just was inspired and you know what?

448
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Emboldened.

449
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,680
Next person who gets in my way, I'm calling a bitch.

450
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I do.

451
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,720
It was like later in the day, it was like in, it was probably around like five or six

452
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
or so.

453
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,560
So when like people are starting, like the humidity is getting to you and it's like,

454
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,840
you either need to go back to the hotel and just sit in the air conditioning for a while,

455
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,000
or you just need to like have a sit and have a drink.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,480
So cause like if you don't rest at those Florida parks, you really start to go a little mad

457
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
from the heat.

458
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,680
I think it's a fun thing about all of us as adults getting to go to Disneyland and getting

459
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,640
to do it sort of unencumbered and without the extreme threat of pure raw mental breakdown,

460
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,280
which is something that you know is happening all around you at every theme park you go

461
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,240
to, but we're the calm ones with a glass of wine, love and life.

462
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,800
It's a great virtue to not be dragging seven screaming kids around.

463
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,880
We're really living the dream as well.

464
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah, we're really.

465
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Yep.

466
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Okay.

467
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,760
So, look, we came here for a very important reason today to talk about stunt shows at

468
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,960
theme parks.

469
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
That's correct.

470
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,440
And we all, we were all talking about this, like how should we approach this?

471
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
Cause there are many, many different stunt shows.

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,920
And I think we've all picked stunt shows that we are, each of us have seen, but the others

473
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
have not.

474
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Yes.

475
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
That's correct?

476
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,520
Roughly so, yes.

477
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,440
We're all majoring in a particular stunt show on this day on this recording.

478
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,000
And I think it's safe to say the ones we all picked are kind of weird.

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Sure.

480
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They're all a little insane.

481
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah.

482
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,040
For various reasons, from what I know about yours, but correct me if I'm wrong.

484
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,920
These are not, I don't think the iconic great stunt show, they're like, they're the best

485
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,720
stunt shows in the theme park world.

486
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,720
For that, you'd have to turn to potentially that Waterworld show, which is actually fantastic

487
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,360
a stunt show here at Universal Studios Hollywood.

488
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Yeah.

489
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
The Indiana Jones is a solid one.

490
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,560
But yeah, these are all a little odd.

491
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Yeah.

492
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,520
And we've talked about doing the bigger stunt shows in the future.

493
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Yeah.

494
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Oh, that's the plan.

495
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
This is like, this is a themed episode.

496
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
This is part one.

497
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
We're each tackling a particular stunt show, but it's part one.

498
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Yeah.

499
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
We'll do more.

500
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,280
We'll leave you in suspense.

501
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
So yeah.

502
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,080
I mean, anything to say about, we haven't talked about stunt shows in general.

503
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,400
They are not at every theme park.

504
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,080
They are not at Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom or at Epcot, but they're at a ton of theme

505
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,160
parks, especially Universal Studios.

506
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,320
Six Flags, I feel like a big player in the stunt show game as well.

507
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,240
I was thinking about the genre in general and how you could like vaguely divide it into

508
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
two.

509
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,560
There is the type of stunt show that's a little more like hand to hand combat based, that's

510
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:23,320
more about fight choreography, and then there's the varietal that's more like motors and gear

511
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,960
and cars and trucks and jet skis and boats, if you're really lucky, which are probably

512
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,240
done on like a bigger scale.

513
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,440
It's probably a motor, a river of some kind separating you from the stunt performers and

514
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,380
the possibility of a splash zone, which is always an exciting possibility.

515
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,120
They all do borrow, they all have a bag of tricks though, and I feel like we're going

516
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,160
to find like 85% overlap in all of these stunt shows.

517
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,560
Because I was rewatching the one I'm picking and I was like, oh yeah, these are all the

518
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,380
tricks they use in every single show.

519
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,960
Every show seems to have a very similar format and the same flames that come up at the end

520
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,680
and it's like the same like, oh, it's hot in here, but it's in the Jaws ride and it's

521
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,400
in like any studio tour, whether it's the old MGM studio tour or whether it's the Hollywood

522
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,580
Universal tour out here.

523
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,280
There's just like 10 tricks, I feel like.

524
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Yeah.

525
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,680
And these all need to be performed.

526
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,000
Like the thing about these stunt shows is you were seeing like live stunt performers

527
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,880
performing like movie quality stunts.

528
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,920
But like when you actually film a stunt in a movie, it's an insanely labor intensive

529
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,280
of like, well, we're doing that one thing today, right?

530
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,320
Or we're doing like two things today and you have to have like a lot of medical staff there.

531
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,440
You have to have a lot of safety people there, sometimes fire departments and like.

532
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Ideally.

533
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Ideally, yeah.

534
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Yeah, not always.

535
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
You have to have a lot of speeches.

536
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,360
A guy has to like gather everybody up and okay, ladies and gentlemen, today we have

537
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:08,320
open ammo live on the set and it always is done in a way such as to freak you out.

538
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,960
But also the guy loves giving his stunt speech more than anything in the world.

539
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,000
He's so happy to give the scary speech and to show off the barrel of the gun and this

540
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,240
cannot hurt you.

541
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,560
However, we need you to maintain a safe distance from the.

542
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
I get excited.

543
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,920
I've been on some things with some stunts.

544
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,240
It is an exciting moment when the guy gathers the up and gives the mean speech.

545
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
It's exciting.

546
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,560
It's exciting unless you're doing it like I had to do once when I had to be on a hang

547
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
glider on a mountain.

548
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
I mean, I wasn't doing it.

549
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,960
I wasn't jumping off the mountain, but I had to wear a giant hang glider and like about

550
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,800
three PM the mean guy gathered everyone up and he's like, the winds are too strong to

551
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,040
open up a hang glider.

552
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,600
The winds will take you.

553
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
They will take you and pull you off the mountain if we were to do it right now.

554
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,960
So we're not going to be able to actually open the hang glider.

555
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,120
We will see how it is later.

556
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,680
And I'm like, Jesus Christ, like I don't want to die on a mountain when we're shooting something

557
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,160
where the wind is catches me and takes me away like a feather.

558
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,680
I just drift away, which God knows maybe that's just the best way to go.

559
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,600
But I didn't want to.

560
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,680
So at five o'clock, the winds, in my opinion, had not died down.

561
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,160
But when you're on a commercial set, time is money.

562
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
We got to make the shot, baby.

563
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,080
And the wind, we've okay, the wind is all right.

564
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,960
What we're going to do now is just have a couple PAs hold on to the side of the hang

565
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
glider.

566
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,880
And I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ, seriously?

567
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,360
And like, you're not doing a jump, but you're on the side of a mountain in a precarious

568
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,720
place where you could get lifted away like a forest gump feather.

569
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,120
We're up very, very like at the top of the mountains and like Glendale or something,

570
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,480
wherever that is, like way up there.

571
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,560
So, and then they also were like, we're not going to lock you in either.

572
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
We're not going to lock you into the hang glider.

573
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,120
So if the wind does take you, it'll just fly.

574
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,400
So I'm like, okay, remember to release your grip on it.

575
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,920
Because if you don't, you'll be taken away.

576
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
It'll just fly.

577
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
That sounds fine.

578
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Yeah.

579
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
So I did it.

580
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,080
I just have to run like, the problem was then I was like feeling a little better and then

581
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,920
I would have to run like 50 feet with it.

582
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,320
The problem is it's heavy as shit.

583
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,640
So I did it about 10 to 15 times and just my back was killing me for two or three days.

584
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
It was horrible.

585
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,240
Then I took a muscle relaxer and it was better.

586
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
But yeah, no, that's-

587
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
It's dangerous stuff.

588
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Stunts are dangerous.

589
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
You didn't get hurt.

590
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,480
You can't, they didn't have to like, I'm imagining this area where you did fly away and got banged

591
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,560
up like Homer in the gorge.

592
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,880
And then they had to like spend weeks painting out all of your cuts and wounds and abrasions

593
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
to make you look like a-

594
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,480
Whoever cleans up the movie stars in like post on computers would have had to really

595
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,240
work overtime on my battered face.

596
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,120
We got to, oh God, this is a big thing.

597
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,200
We got to kick it to the guy who's making Jeff Bridges younger.

598
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,080
The guy who's taking out Henry Cavill's mustache in that Justice League movie.

599
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,840
Wait, he had a mustache he wasn't willing to part with?

600
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,000
This is new, this is breaking news as we hear this.

601
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They're doing reshoots on the Justice League movie, but Henry Cavill had already started

602
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,280
shooting the new Mission Impossible movie where his character, I guess he grew a mustache

603
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,120
for the character and Paramount said, you cannot shave.

604
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
You cannot shave.

605
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,000
So there are pictures on set of like Henry Cavill at a Superman outfit and he's got a

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
mustache and it's unnerve-

607
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Oh cool.

608
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,840
It is weird to see like Superman with a mustache.

609
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Sounds good to me.

610
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,640
And they're going to digitally remove it.

611
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Okay, okay.

612
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Wow, wow.

613
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,280
There'll be like a $50,000 budget on taking out his mustache at every shot.

614
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Yeah.

615
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,360
Because who knows how much.

616
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,640
So if you're a barely paid intern setting up the tracking markers on Henry Cavill's

617
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,960
face, maybe listening to this to pass the time.

618
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,720
I hope you're having fun and well hang in there buddy.

619
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,920
Godspeed champ.

620
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,720
So the point you were making is that-

621
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Oh stunt shows.

622
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Yeah.

623
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
That could hurt you.

624
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
That's what they're saying.

625
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,640
Yeah, they're very dangerous, but in the parks, these stunt shows, you need a bunch of big

626
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,840
like set pieces in a row.

627
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:23,960
So like acrobatic fighting stunts, water stunts, falls from great height stunts, fire pyrotechnics.

628
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,360
A lot of these have explosions.

629
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,600
You got to figure out little bits you can do in between so that it's not just one guy

630
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,920
out there for 20 minutes hoofing it and moving from jet ski to a ladder to an explosion to

631
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,800
getting lit on fire.

632
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
You got to figure out little diversions.

633
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,560
I feel like a lot of stunt shows have some like kooky comic relief that is not necessarily

634
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,200
a stunt just to like give the stunt folks a break.

635
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Or if it's the type of stunt show that is the making of stunts and they can break the

636
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,840
fourth wall, then maybe they send the director out there to say, and cut.

637
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,280
And then he tells you a little bit about how stunts are done and he kills the time.

638
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Yeah.

639
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,680
There is, oh, the other thing is that this has to be repeated.

640
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,200
Whatever you set up, the show has to be repeated like three to six times a day depending on

641
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,080
how many times they're running it.

642
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,820
They're very impressive endeavors.

643
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,980
Last week I was slagging on shows in general, not the effort that anyone puts into shows,

644
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,180
but just I find a lot of the theme park shows kind of like generic and bleh.

645
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,960
Stunt stunt shows though, these are impressive.

646
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,560
And I've always had a little fascination with them.

647
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,440
I should mention real fast, I did this animated show, Moonbeam City, and I did an episode

648
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,280
that went into a theme park stunt show.

649
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,760
So I got to make up what one of those would be and it was the movie of cities about police

650
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
officers.

651
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,280
So I made up a police themed stunt show.

652
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,240
I called it the police brew totally rev and roll stunt stravaganza.

653
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
It's so much fun.

654
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,040
I worked on making up this plot so much more than I did the full half hour actual plot

655
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,920
of the episode.

656
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,560
And I had to make up like the hero and the villain and the good cop was named Officer

657
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:19,680
Speed Damon and the bad one was kind of a Dick Tracy villain named Don Fatsoley.

658
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,680
So it was very fun to get to like delve into that and the various tropes.

659
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,080
Also like this had the thing, it's in a lot of stuff where like the villain is undercut

660
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:36,400
by somebody pulling his pants down, he's wearing heart boxers, boxers with hearts on him.

661
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,980
And then the thing where the guy gets like shoved into a little pit and then a bunch

662
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,800
of confetti comes up.

663
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
There's a lot of fun tropes too.

664
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,920
Is Moonbeam, we may as well plug it.

665
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,200
Is it streaming somewhere?

666
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Where I forget.

667
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,720
You can buy it on iTunes or you can torrent it on weird Russian websites.

668
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,040
That's it?

669
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,480
That's pretty much, oh boy, it's a whole thing.

670
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Sorry.

671
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,320
Or actually it recently ended up being streaming on Comedy Central Australia's website.

672
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
For free.

673
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
So check it out there for free, yes.

674
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,200
You can sit through an ad or two, but it's all up there.

675
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Check it out.

676
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,000
There's various ways to, or just like ask me and I'll just like send you pirated copies

677
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
myself.

678
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Tweet it Scott.

679
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Check your email.

680
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Tweet it Scott.

681
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,720
Please send me the full episode series.

682
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,240
Full res.

683
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,920
If you give me some disk space on which to post the show, I will send you the highest

684
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,240
res straight from the computer version.

685
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Why not?

686
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,080
Somebody stop me.

687
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,840
That's a podcast to ride promise, folks.

688
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,240
I'll send you a lot of gigs worth of cartoon.

689
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,560
So anyways, yeah, we're all fascinated with these things and let's talk about them a little

690
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
bit.

691
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,760
So we each picked one and I wanted to propose just a ranking system at the end.

692
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,640
If you want to classify your stunt show as either a perfect aerial flip or a mis-aimed

693
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,840
kick in the dick, which admittedly is maybe something you would want to see in a stunt

694
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
show.

695
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Is there anything in between?

696
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Yeah, that's a real black and white system there.

697
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Yeah, that's true.

698
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
That's sort of a good or bad.

699
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:19,160
I, well, I couldn't think of a very good like middle point, like what would be an okay stunt.

700
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,440
What if the middle would just be a shoehorned in topical joke?

701
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,520
I've got some of those in mind and I know they're present in some other ones.

702
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Oh boy, that's right.

703
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,480
As opposed to a ride which cannot change day to day, the live theme park performer is free

704
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,200
to bring up events of the day.

705
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,960
Although I wonder if in today's highly charged political atmosphere, if maybe you aren't

706
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,920
supposed to talk about our president or things related to him.

707
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,840
Well, we've already done that today.

708
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
No, we can't.

709
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,720
So if you're on stage, if you're the deacon in the Waterworld show, are you allowed to

710
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,320
a good or bad address Donald Trump in any way?

711
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,200
Well, they got into trouble for that a few years ago at, I guess, is this kind of a stunt?

712
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:16,440
The Bill and Ted show in Orlando at Halloween Horror Nights had like Obama and Mitt Romney.

713
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,920
I think that's when they stopped doing it.

714
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,360
They had like a dance off.

715
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,680
They had a dance off.

716
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,600
I think they officially stopped doing it when they had like a bunch of offensive stuff.

717
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,560
There was definitely a gay Superman and everyone's like, oh, this is not good.

718
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,000
I was going to say, did Obama and Romney make out?

719
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,920
Was that their fun joke?

720
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,320
I think they had a break dance off, which I can't figure out the logic of that.

721
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,640
I like a break dance off between the candidates.

722
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
We'll do a whole.

723
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,680
I mean, if you had to guess who was going to win that break dance war.

724
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,360
Well, sure.

725
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Not to be a-

726
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,920
Not to stereotype, but-

727
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,680
That's a good stereotype to land on though.

728
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Oh, yeah.

729
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,960
Literally, the real man Barack Obama, I think, could probably pull off some great break dances.

730
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,840
Also, that seems like a lifetime ago, 2012.

731
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,240
The 2012 election seems like such a simpler time than the horror show we live in now.

732
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
I think about it all the time.

733
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,440
You saw it a little bit in the lead up to this election how a couple of Pizza Hut or

734
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,640
that kind of thing tried to do the typical ad campaign that's like, vote for that, making

735
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,360
fun of the election or like, tensions are high.

736
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,320
Why not chill out with a slice of pizza?

737
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,760
You feel like even the tamest or any... If you ever saw any art where like a donkey and

738
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,800
an elephant are in boxing gloves and, hey, put them up.

739
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
That is upsetting.

740
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,680
There's no such thing as friendly election comedy anymore.

741
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,680
It's gone.

742
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
No.

743
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
It's completely humorless.

744
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,920
Okay, let's talk about stunt shows.

745
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,040
Who wants to go... Who thinks theirs is the least ridiculous?

746
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I feel like we should build.

747
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
It might be mine.

748
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I feel like mine might be.

749
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Do you think it's yours?

750
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
I don't know.

751
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
All right.

752
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,800
These all have to be probably pretty inoffensive, but mine is pretty standard.

753
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,240
I don't know.

754
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,200
Is a better example of the typical theme park stunt show.

755
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
All right.

756
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Well, I'll go for it.

757
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
We'll never know.

758
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
Scott, I think you should go last, knowing what I know about yours.

759
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
It's weird.

760
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Lottery, yeah.

761
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,240
I picked the Batman stunt show from Six Flags Great America, which is from where I'm from,

762
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,160
the Parkers and Gurney, Illinois.

763
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,040
I saw it when it opened in 1993, and it lasted for a couple years.

764
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I'm watching this.

765
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,960
I'll give you a quick overview.

766
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,600
We'll post all these links online, so you get to watch grainy home movie quality footage

767
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,880
of all of these different stunts.

768
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Oh, yeah.

769
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,480
We're not going to play any clips, because all these stunts are barely recorded.

770
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,440
If they are, I noticed in looking on YouTube, a lot of them are posted by the literal stunt

771
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:07,440
performers who were in the show, which I think is a nice level of straight from the person.

772
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,240
They're usually done in large theaters or outdoor amphitheaters, so kind of hard for

773
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,440
a consumer camera in the audience to pick up the audio that well.

774
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,040
It's meant to be experienced live.

775
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Yeah.

776
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,360
So this video, so really my memory is, I have a little memory of it in this video.

777
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,360
So there's an MC, and he's doing a lot of warmup stuff.

778
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,420
And he's like, put your trash in the bat garbage cans and stuff, and funny, really funny jokes

779
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,760
like that.

780
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,840
And then he says stuff like, who likes to party?

781
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,960
Which I was like, I don't know.

782
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
That doesn't really- Wait, Batman says that?

783
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
No, no.

784
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
This is the MC.

785
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Oh, the MC.

786
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Yeah, Batman's not out yet.

787
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Who's dressed as what?

788
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
What does he eat?

789
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
He just has a polo on.

790
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
He's an employee of Six Flags.

791
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,320
He's the liveliest employee they have, probably.

792
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,680
He's a local theater performer, maybe.

793
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,120
And then they're like- That ended up being Stephen Colbert, current

794
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,600
Second City student.

795
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,680
Oh, that's true.

796
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,440
And he does weird stuff where he's like, who has the best Tarzan yell?

797
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,240
And you hear the camera isn't on the people, so you just hear like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

798
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,680
which is very funny.

799
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,160
I feel like if you ask that question to an audience today, people would be like, what

800
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,560
the fuck are you talking about?

801
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,640
Who is Tarzan and what does he sound like?

802
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
I have no clue.

803
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,840
But 93 was a different time.

804
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,560
Tarzan was still fresh in our minds.

805
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,640
So yeah, so the setting of this whole thing is like, there's a big warehouse and it's

806
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,760
Ace Chemicals, which is the famous place where the Joker falls into a vat of acid and becomes

807
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,900
the Joker.

808
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,600
And then there's like a garage.

809
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,440
So while we're playing this too, like Party Man by Prince is Playing, because it's kind

810
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,640
of based on the first Batman movie, which Prince did the soundtrack for.

811
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,360
And the audio cuts out.

812
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:01,080
I don't know if Prince's estate leveled a complaint against this particular video, but

813
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,720
all of a sudden there's a snippet of Prince and the audio cuts out for like a straight

814
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
minute.

815
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,400
So I don't know, maybe at a certain point when Prince really had his lawyers going after

816
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,400
people on YouTube, which there was a time when you couldn't find anything by Prince,

817
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,760
they came after this poor person's home movie with like a real green, like a shitty sounding

818
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Party Man played in an arena.

819
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,440
It's like, I want that going for the internet.

820
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,040
I always imagine Prince himself filling out the copyright compliance forms on YouTube.

821
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
There's something about it.

822
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:38,040
It just always seems like something he might get up to at 4 a.m. while the 400th night

823
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
in a row not sleeping.

824
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,960
Dear YouTube, there's a video from Six Flags Great America where 45 seconds of Party Man

825
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
plays.

826
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,560
I would appreciate you taking it down.

827
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,640
This is a displeasure to me.

828
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,320
Yeah, maybe it's probably more mean.

829
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,480
It's probably more mean.

830
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,080
So the thing starts with like kind of Batman-y music.

831
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,240
It sounds all off to me.

832
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,520
It sounds like maybe they didn't get the full Batman score, but it sounds Batman-ish.

833
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
It's kind of Danny Elfman-y.

834
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Yeah, it is Danny Elfman.

835
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,720
I feel like there's like a couple notes changed, but maybe that's just the way that the audio

836
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,640
was aged on the tape, the VHS tape.

837
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,800
So the whole thing starts on Bruce and Vicky Vale are going to a party, and there's like

838
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,520
one table with food on it, and then there's a giant large turkey, like a turkey that must

839
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,200
be like eight by eight, and it's roasting like it's outside or something.

840
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
And it doesn't make any sense.

841
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,880
It'll be at a fancy dinner party.

842
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,440
But they were like, well, this reads like fancy people eating, I guess.

843
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,480
If it's feeding 300 people, then sure.

844
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,120
Yeah, so I guess it's like a weird themed party, but really it's all just Bruce and

845
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,040
Vicky like dancing for 10 seconds.

846
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,040
And then here come the motorbikes.

847
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,840
Two or three guys on motorcycles like fly out and fly over.

848
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,400
And then this song, which I couldn't quite make out, which I could hear like a line is

849
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,600
like, born to ride.

850
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,040
We were born to ride.

851
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Hell yes.

852
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,680
It wasn't a song I recognized, but it sounded familiar.

853
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
It's not I Love LA.

854
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
It is.

855
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Born to ride.

856
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,680
I love Gotham City.

857
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,760
No, it was not I Love LA.

858
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,440
It sounded like Highway to the Danger Zone, but it had the words born to ride in it.

859
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Maybe this is a song that I'm just not familiar with.

860
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,000
It's Gotham City's biggest music artist.

861
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,200
Right.

862
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,560
And then like, you know, you got your standard stuff, people shooting an atomic gun, and

863
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:35,960
it's like flash bangs that are happening against walls and people are like scurrying up posts

864
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,080
and then like other like the punches that you can clearly even see from 100 feet away

865
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,520
miss wildly, but like, like you hear the noise and the guy goes like flips and flips four

866
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,320
feet onto a pad that's clearly a pad.

867
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,240
And then they do the thing where they cut.

868
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,080
So it's a stunt show.

869
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
But they don't.

870
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,640
The reality is, is that we're just watching some people perform.

871
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
And I should have actually said this at first.

872
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,500
The MC explains to us that he's he's not only just the MC and the host.

873
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,000
He's the second unit director for this.

874
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,040
That late in the game.

875
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Yeah.

876
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,680
He explains he explains that yeah, he is he is in charge of shooting the action for this,

877
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,000
which like doesn't really make sense.

878
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,240
Because like, what are we shooting?

879
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,240
We're not shooting anything.

880
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,880
And nothing else in Six Flags is movie themed.

881
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,640
So yeah, what's Yeah, there's like some Looney Tunes stuff.

882
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,240
I think there was a Six Flags and maybe it was here too.

883
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,120
They had like movie world.

884
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,160
But it was a lot of loose.

885
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
But it's weird.

886
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,120
They just weren't like here's a show with Batman.

887
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,080
I don't know why they had to act like we're showing you how the movies are made.

888
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,600
I feel like the one at a great adventure in New Jersey did at some point switch the Batman

889
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,840
show to just like that the bad guys are here and Batman's gonna fight him.

890
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
That's great.

891
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,840
I mean, that's so much better.

892
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Yeah.

893
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
And then I also wrote the guy's name down.

894
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,520
The host.

895
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
This is the best I can hear.

896
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,920
This is he goes, Hi, I'm Roderick Dean Wells, host and second unit director.

897
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,360
That's a second unit director is a film crew that films the dangerous action sequences.

898
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,880
And then they do like a whole bit with it.

899
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,680
And I remember this, this is my memory as a child, that they do a bit where they ask

900
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,320
for an audience participate, like an audience member to come up.

901
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,040
And a guy like fly, this is not in the video, but this is my recollection, a guy like jumps

902
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,480
from the audience into the pit.

903
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,560
As a kid, I thought it was real.

904
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,320
I thought there was some maniac who had thrown himself in the pit.

905
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,880
Obviously, this is a plant.

906
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,320
And then they proceed to like, knock this guy around the whole show, which is you're

907
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,480
you nodding because yours has something like this?

908
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,680
No, it's just happens.

909
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
It's a trope.

910
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
It's a trope.

911
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,560
It's a stunt show trope where there's a fake audience plant and everyone laughs at him

912
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,920
getting like hurt.

913
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,500
Usually has a normal guy is an idiot and he got hurt.

914
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,280
Like usually really isn't in like a cartoonish touristy like Hawaiian shirt baseball cap.

915
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,240
Disney a goofy hat that.

916
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,240
Yeah.

917
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,240
Yeah.

918
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,800
So then yeah, so like then there's just like different scenes.

919
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,760
Then then like they'll they'll preface it by like Batman is headed to ace photographer

920
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,360
or his hate to excuse me, Jesus Christ, I wrote it down wrong.

921
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,080
Batman is headed to ace chemicals and photographer Vicki Vale thinks this is our chance to take

922
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,840
a picture of Batman.

923
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,520
But it's a trick by the Joker.

924
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,400
And then like joke like Vicki Vale beats up a bunch of goons and then the Joker falls

925
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
into chemicals.

926
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,560
But Joker already has his Joker makeup on.

927
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,600
And also the Joker looks like shit.

928
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,800
This is a problem I have is that Joker really doesn't look like the Jack Nicholson Joker.

929
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
He doesn't look like the Cesar Romero Joker.

930
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,700
He looks like he has a generic Halloween mask and his clothes look like crap.

931
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,400
And I was looking at other videos from different Batman stunt shows and there's one with the

932
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,280
Penguin is the main antagonist.

933
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,920
It's almost the same show except the penguins in it.

934
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
And it's so much better.

935
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,600
Penguin is dressed like Burgess Meredith.

936
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,440
He has his own Penguin song about running for mayor.

937
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,840
They like wrote an original song and I was like, God damn, this is so much better than

938
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,040
this joke, this crappy Joker.

939
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,320
Also, this means the Joker fell in the vat twice.

940
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
He fell in the vat twice.

941
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,160
Also ace chemicals despite an insane occupational incidents where a man fell into a chemical

942
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
vat.

943
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,000
And while we filed all the appropriate reports with the government, time to reopen the old

944
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
chemical plant.

945
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,840
Now look, there's a lot of problems in Gotham City.

946
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,400
So yes, obviously there's probably some lobbying going on at Ace Chemicals that would continue

947
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,080
and make the operation of it continue.

948
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,120
They did have to put a B up on the outside of the...

949
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
Oh, sure.

950
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,160
...to put a B in the window.

951
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,180
So yeah, Batman's ziplines in from the audience, which is kind of cool.

952
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,640
It's pretty slow though.

953
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,360
It's just like a slow man coming down from the audience section into a little elevated

954
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,440
area, punching it.

955
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,960
My favorite part of it, I think, is that the Batmobile is there and it is the Batmobile

956
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,580
from the first movie.

957
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,440
It's cool looking, like it's a full thing.

958
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,920
Batmobile gets a big pop, the audience loves it.

959
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,140
And then they do this whole bit where Batman controls the Batmobile with his voice.

960
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:08,520
So he pops out to go investigate into the chemical warehouse and he goes, Batmobile,

961
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,520
meet for me at Wayne Manor, which makes no sense.

962
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,880
I don't know why you would send a car home.

963
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,560
Park Batmobile, go park where we live.

964
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
Right, yeah.

965
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,560
And I don't know...

966
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,260
You've done a good job so far, go ahead and crack off for the day.

967
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,560
So there's clearly like a guy in there driving it.

968
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,920
It's not the guy playing Batman.

969
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,800
And then they do a whole bit where Joker finds it and then they keep saying...

970
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,120
The Joker starts to try to take control of it and he's like, Batmobile, come, come Batmobile,

971
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
come.

972
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,360
So they're talking like a dog.

973
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,760
They both...

974
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,080
And then he can't get it to work and then Batman comes out and goes, Batmobile, come.

975
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,600
And they keep saying that, which I'm not trying to be dirty.

976
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,420
They just keep saying Batmobile, come.

977
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,480
And then finally Joker gets in there and Batman realizes that they have a fight while the

978
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,760
whole thing's going on.

979
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,160
And I'm thinking also, this is probably like a scene that was maybe added after 1992's

980
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,840
Batman Returns where the Penguin takes control of the Batmobile.

981
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Do you remember this scene?

982
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Yeah.

983
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,800
And then Batman controls it, which is also, by the way, if you haven't seen it in a while,

984
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,120
one of the dirtiest scenes, they shoot it like the Penguin's having sex while he's like

985
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,840
kind of riding around on the tiny Batmobile.

986
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Oh, okay.

987
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,680
Sort of like humping a joystick a little bit.

988
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
Yeah.

989
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,940
They shoot him from under and he's like, whatever.

990
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,880
And it's like, that is the horniest movie.

991
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Yeah.

992
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,520
It's a very corny movie, Batman Returns.

993
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,080
And also like upset it.

994
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:36,720
I remember as a kid seeing Danny DeVito eating the fish, eating raw fish, and he's got like

995
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,520
fish slurry running down his jaw and it's gross.

996
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
It's weird.

997
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah.

998
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
It's really gross, real weird.

999
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,120
So I think, feel like they maybe got influenced a little bit with that sequence.

1000
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,440
But again, then there's some Doom buggies come out and they chase the Batmobile around

1001
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,320
and some guys flip off slightly higher places.

1002
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,200
The audience plant falls and everyone I guess thinks that's great.

1003
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,520
Because as a kid, I also was worried.

1004
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,480
I remember not only was I a scared kid who was like, I think this is real, even though

1005
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,840
they're telling me, I didn't know what a movie, I didn't know how movies work, but I was like,

1006
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
this is kind of real.

1007
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,200
I thought maybe there's a chance Batman or the Joker would come in and steal me or abduct

1008
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
me.

1009
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,440
Because the first time I ever saw a play, it was Peter Pan.

1010
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,840
And during intermission, the actors playing the pirates poked their head out of the dressing

1011
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,500
room to be dicks.

1012
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,240
And I was getting like water in a water fountain.

1013
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,600
I looked behind me and they were like peering out.

1014
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,920
And I was scared shitless.

1015
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,360
We had to go out.

1016
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,200
My mom had to take me out of the whole place because I was so scared.

1017
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
So I was scared.

1018
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Up until I was 15, I thought most of these rides had a chance of being real.

1019
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,760
And that they might follow you home.

1020
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,840
The characters might haunt your reality.

1021
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,840
Right.

1022
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Or kidnap you.

1023
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
They could have taken you.

1024
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
That's what I said.

1025
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,840
Yeah.

1026
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,960
I thought Joker could possibly, if he ever got too close to me in the arena, which I'm

1027
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,260
sure he didn't, that he would certainly like want to take me home back to Ace Chemicals

1028
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,080
and make me a little Joker.

1029
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,080
But maybe push me in.

1030
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,080
Push you in.

1031
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,440
So then, so when I saw an audience member who I thought was a legitimate audience member

1032
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,640
participating and then falling from a great height, I was scared.

1033
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,280
I was worried that that man was dead.

1034
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,880
The fourth wall was punctured for you and now you still don't know how many walls there

1035
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,880
are.

1036
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,880
Yeah.

1037
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,880
Where do they end?

1038
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,520
I recall it being stressful for me as much as I liked Batman.

1039
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,160
I probably only at that point had seen the 60s Batman, which is a lot friendlier than

1040
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,080
the Burton Batmans for, what was I, seven?

1041
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
No, six.

1042
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,520
No, I was nine.

1043
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,400
So that's the Batman stunt show.

1044
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,360
As I said, there's many, we should do a whole episode on Batman and the theme parks because

1045
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,880
there's so many different stunt shows.

1046
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,600
There's one where there's water and jet skis.

1047
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,120
There's one where the Riddler is the bad guy and it's Batman forever.

1048
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,000
I think I saw that one.

1049
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,880
I think I would have seen that at Six Flags.

1050
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
Yeah.

1051
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,600
There's also a ton of unbuilt Batman stuff, which is very interesting to read about and

1052
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,160
see the concept art about.

1053
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Right.

1054
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
So mine is pretty normal, pretty standard.

1055
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,240
I wasn't shocked by anything, but your standard stunt show bullshit, like all that.

1056
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
What do you think?

1057
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Am I the lowest?

1058
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
Do you think yours is weirder?

1059
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
I think mine's a little weirder.

1060
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Okay, well hit us.

1061
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Okay.

1062
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,240
Oh wait, you want to rank it?

1063
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,680
Oh yeah, what were the two choices or three?

1064
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,160
Stereo flip, miss aimed kick in the dick or in the middle, topical reference.

1065
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
I mean-

1066
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,040
A flat topical reference.

1067
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,360
Honestly, when I was watching the one with the penguin, which I think was Great Adventure,

1068
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,920
which was I think in Milwaukee, is that right?

1069
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,200
Six Flags Great Adventure, is that in Milwaukee?

1070
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
That's in Jersey.

1071
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,360
Oh, it's Jersey, that's right.

1072
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,960
The penguin one I thought was great.

1073
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,400
I was mentioning it before, there was an original song, like he was in a better costume.

1074
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Some of the stunts looked better.

1075
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,360
Vince had not gotten his grubby paws on it.

1076
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,800
The audio was you could hear all the audio.

1077
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,800
So I guess I'm going to say middle because it's still like you got to see the original

1078
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,720
Batmobile and that was cool.

1079
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,960
But I feel like I've seen better stunts shows.

1080
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,360
But I also might be because I was traumatized by it and I'm thinking of it negatively.

1081
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,480
Did it scare you a little bit today?

1082
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,520
Were you watching the TV and a little worried you might hear a rap at the door and it'd

1083
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,320
be a pirate or two?

1084
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:21,080
Or someone, oh yeah, and I had a giant roast, rice roast behind me, like the one at the

1085
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,480
party Bruce and Vicky had.

1086
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,800
Which I also forgot to mention that the bad guys kicked the roast over during the first

1087
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,800
fight scene.

1088
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,800
Oh no.

1089
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,800
Party ruined.

1090
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,640
But at least they didn't dump it into the chemical pit and create some kind of giant

1091
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,640
turkey monster.

1092
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,440
Joker roast, Joker turkey.

1093
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,160
Which is a good idea also.

1094
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,840
That'd be a pretty big step for a stunt show to take in terms of the overall Batman narrative.

1095
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Sure.

1096
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,440
Created a new villain is big turkey.

1097
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Yeah.

1098
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,440
All right.

1099
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,680
Well, so my show is also a superhero show.

1100
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,680
I did not see the show in person.

1101
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,520
I think yours is the weirdest.

1102
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,520
Uh huh.

1103
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,520
Okay, okay.

1104
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I think possibly.

1105
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,760
I was thinking about talking about some of the other Universal stunt shows that I actually

1106
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,720
did see in person, the Miami Vice show.

1107
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,160
I watched the Miami Vice show and I'm like, there was a stunt show briefly based on Miami

1108
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,640
Vice and before that, the A-Team.

1109
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,960
There's a very little video that exists of the A-Team and then Miami Vice I watched and

1110
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,320
just it's pretty cool.

1111
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,320
It's just dope.

1112
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,280
There wasn't a lot to, that's my review, done.

1113
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,840
It was a cool ass show.

1114
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,360
So there's nothing else to talk about.

1115
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,200
Then I was digging into the Universal archives and realized there was something called Spider-Man

1116
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Rocks.

1117
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,600
Spider-Man Rocks ran from 2002 to 2004.

1118
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,600
And it's a little bit of a cheat because it's a half stunt show, half musical, but there

1119
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:48,600
are definitely stunts in it and increasingly once Peter Parker gets transformed into Spider-Man.

1120
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:55,240
It's so, it's in the, it was done in the Castle Theater, which if you've ever been to Universal

1121
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,680
Studios, kind of on the upper lot, there's this thing shaped like a castle, which is

1122
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,760
I think sort of an odd cursed location at Universal Studios.

1123
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,760
I think today there's just a thing called the special effects stages there, which is

1124
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,520
sort of a remnant of the tour.

1125
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,480
It's a thing, it's probably fine, but I feel like a lot of people skip it when they go

1126
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
there.

1127
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,160
There's been a myriad of strange things.

1128
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,880
Beetlejuice's Graveyard review was in there, which if you don't know it is this live show

1129
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,840
where Beetlejuice leads all of the now dark universe characters, Frankenstein and Dracula

1130
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:34,560
in a rollicking, frightening armada of songs.

1131
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:42,960
I remember seeing the original musical, Creature from the Black Lagoon musical there, which

1132
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,160
was not good.

1133
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,160
It was bad.

1134
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,160
No.

1135
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,760
It was upsetting and is probably, when was that, like 10 years ago?

1136
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,720
2007, something like that.

1137
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah.

1138
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,960
And I was like, well, look, they wrote an original short musical based on, and then

1139
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,600
they had a full boat on stage.

1140
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,600
I was like, wow, they really spent a lot of money on this.

1141
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,340
And then once they started doing the show, I was like, oh no, this is bad.

1142
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:16,120
And there's so much early seasons of Friends level gay panic in that show.

1143
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,960
Wouldn't be Universal Studios with that screaming gay characters.

1144
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,560
A rich tradition at Universal Studios shows, they have horrible stereotype characters.

1145
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,880
Forcing wrist flipping gay characters.

1146
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,880
Yeah.

1147
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,440
And it was, I just remember being very, being like right in the middle of the theater and

1148
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,080
it's like, oh, I can't leave.

1149
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,480
And it's, I was just like, oh, I don't want to be here.

1150
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't want to watch this anymore.

1151
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,560
That might require talking about a little bit, at some point, Creature from the Black

1152
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Lagoon, the musical.

1153
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,120
It might be the worst thing I've seen in a theme park.

1154
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
I remember that.

1155
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,280
That was when I worked there at Universal Studios and they had a night where we all

1156
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,720
previewed the show and like we were all like, there aren't people around who were part of

1157
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,720
this.

1158
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,520
Were there, do we have to like make pleasantries with anyone involved in this show?

1159
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,320
Dear God.

1160
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,360
So it's sort of this odd cursed location, I think, in the park and a lot of like things

1161
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,640
that are just there for a few years have slid in and out.

1162
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,320
And so Spider-Man Rex, I guess, not the worst one, what with Creature from the Black Lagoon,

1163
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,800
but still not anything that anyone particularly fell in love with.

1164
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,320
It seemed to be a way to just like jam Marvel and Spider-Man into the parks as quickly as

1165
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:37,040
possible with the success of the Tobey Maguire, the original of the 25 Spider-Man films.

1166
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,640
It was a, so it's kind of this Cliff Notes version of the Spider-Man story.

1167
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,880
Within the first minute they get out a narration that's like, you know, they say with great

1168
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,320
power comes great responsibility.

1169
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,120
I guess I learned that the hard way.

1170
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,120
Oh boy.

1171
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,720
That's me, Peter Parker.

1172
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,560
But I wouldn't always be.

1173
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,680
It just has that annoying sort of for 12 year olds tone from the get go.

1174
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,880
Like a kid in the 90s on a commercial selling soda.

1175
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,560
When I love Mithers quenched.

1176
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,960
I'm not big, but one day it will be.

1177
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,160
The power of milk.

1178
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
Sometimes I'm called Spider-Man.

1179
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,840
I became Spider-Man after my fucking uncle ate shit.

1180
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,280
Surf's up, dudes.

1181
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,760
Still a post youth talk the way Michelangelo does.

1182
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,040
Still this is the voice.

1183
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,160
Two decades later.

1184
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,840
It also, the whole thing is kind of steeped in a vibe that Jason, I know you've talked

1185
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:48,240
about before the Marvel cinematic universe began, kind of all of the media involving

1186
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:55,280
Marvel all had the same veneer, which is kind of this like extremely generic rock.

1187
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,560
Just like rock for kids.

1188
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,360
That kind of rock that doesn't sound like any particular artist in the world.

1189
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,840
It's a little like the Power Rangers theme a little bit too.

1190
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
Yeah.

1191
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:17,000
And in California Adventure right now, the promotion is the Summer of Heroes and it's

1192
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
back.

1193
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,920
So the heroes, when the Avengers come out, they're riding ATVs and stuff and there's

1194
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,280
like generic rock.

1195
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,000
And you see it other places today too.

1196
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:35,880
Like that Wonder Woman in Batman vs Superman and the new Wonder Woman movie.

1197
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,120
Her theme song is like this rock and roll guitar.

1198
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,240
That's just what you used to do for like super...

1199
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
That's just...

1200
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Yeah, it's a superhero.

1201
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,240
Like royalty free rock and roll music.

1202
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,320
Stock brand.

1203
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,000
It's music that sounds like what Toto makes today.

1204
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,240
It sounds like a 2007 Toto album.

1205
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,040
Shreddin', Marvel equals shreddin'.

1206
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:08,000
So there's a lot of that kind of stuff, but also this is a kind of a jukebox musical.

1207
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,080
I think there's like five performers all told and they weave a lot of songs in and out of

1208
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,120
the show.

1209
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,520
Some of the biggest hits of 2002 appear in this show.

1210
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,480
There's a Let's Get Loud by J. Lo.

1211
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,320
I'm sure a song people are still very fond of.

1212
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,320
There was...

1213
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:33,800
Oh, the Foo Fighters, My Hero appears in it at some point.

1214
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,160
And then...

1215
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,000
And also the Bonnie Tyler song We Need a Hero, which is an older one.

1216
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,440
That one comes back a few times.

1217
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,520
And then one that like...there's just a straight up performance of like a kind of a clubby,

1218
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,080
pop-locky song that was so distant to me, I had to look it up.

1219
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,220
This song is called AM to PM and it's by Christina Milly on.

1220
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,120
Is that a TRL hit?

1221
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,360
Anyone recalls?

1222
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,760
I do not know.

1223
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,720
That does not sound familiar to me.

1224
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,480
Well, in the heights of 2002, you couldn't not include...

1225
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,200
Kids would storm out of the theater if they didn't hear their beloved AM to PM by Christina

1226
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Milly on.

1227
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,160
Can I ask...this is a few years after the Marvel Mania restaurant was up at Universal.

1228
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,160
Oh, yeah.

1229
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Right?

1230
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,840
That opened for like a year and a half maybe.

1231
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:30,200
It was sort of...the gimmick was like it's Planet Hollywood, but in the Marvel Universe.

1232
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:36,200
So there's Iron Man suit armor and there's Thor's hammer and there's Professor X's hover

1233
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
chair.

1234
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,120
And here's expensive mac and cheese named after Wolverine somehow.

1235
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:50,040
It did not last because the characters...it looked not great and apparently the food was

1236
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:55,120
very bad and they...in promotional materials, they're like, this is going to open in Universal

1237
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,120
Orlando too.

1238
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,800
And as like a little Marvel nerd, I was just like, I can't wait to eat at this goddamn

1239
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,520
Marvel restaurant.

1240
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,440
And it was just so bad, they're like, well, we're not making any more of those.

1241
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
Wow, wow.

1242
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:13,520
The sad story of chain restaurants or novelty restaurants that don't come to pass.

1243
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,320
I remember at Disney World, there was a...they even put out artwork for it, a David Copperfield

1244
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
magic themed restaurant.

1245
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
Oh, yeah.

1246
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,000
It never ended up getting built.

1247
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,880
Still haven't used the space for it that they set aside for it.

1248
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,880
God, really?

1249
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,880
Wow.

1250
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,720
And dream...kids still have space in their dreams reserved for this restaurant that nothing

1251
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,720
is filled.

1252
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,320
And one day it might just appear there.

1253
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,200
It's a decent chance.

1254
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,680
It's been the long con by old cops.

1255
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,120
Or it's a Chris Angel restaurant or something.

1256
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
Fingers crossed.

1257
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,120
Anyway, yeah.

1258
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,960
So it's...I mean, it's all the Spider-Man stuff, super condensed.

1259
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,480
He then...scene one, he gets bit by the spider, he becomes a spider.

1260
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,720
Then it cuts to Mary Jane, who is an actress who seems to be cast entirely based on upper

1261
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,880
body strength because her acting and her singing leave a little something to be desired.

1262
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,640
But then when she has to grab onto a wire at the end, perfect, nailed it.

1263
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:19,040
Anyway, you see her out on the street and she is being ganged up on by two street toughs.

1264
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,040
And they're sort of...they got eyes on her.

1265
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,040
What's this girl all about?

1266
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:30,120
And they convey it by singing the song, She Bangs by Ricky Martin, which my wife said

1267
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:37,240
is probably trying to capitalize on the William Hung American Idol popularity of the time.

1268
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,360
So wait, the story of this goes from Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider,

1269
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,480
Uncle Ben dies off stage.

1270
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
You got no Uncle Ben.

1271
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,680
No Uncle Ben representation.

1272
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,080
We cut to Mary Jane being menaced by street toughs.

1273
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,600
By two random people.

1274
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,600
To She Bangs.

1275
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:59,880
Singing She Bangs, which I think is a little unfair to Ricky Martin to recast his words

1276
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,680
of lust as being kind of rapey.

1277
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,720
You put him, you know, talk to me, tell me your name.

1278
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,840
Those aren't explicitly rapey and I don't think it's fair to Mr. Martin.

1279
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:18,400
He's singing a consensual song and then they were repurposing it for a non-consensual situation.

1280
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1281
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,240
I think a pretty unfair thing to level on that song.

1282
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
I agree.

1283
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,240
No, I think it's horrible.

1284
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,720
And we all know Ricky Martin would never sexually abuse a woman.

1285
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
That's true.

1286
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,760
That's the last thing you'd want to do.

1287
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:36,840
So anyways, Mary Jane like fends off two thugs with her purse.

1288
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,000
The ultimate weapon that any woman gets is a purse.

1289
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,200
I feel like we should say women don't fare well in these stud shows.

1290
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Almost never.

1291
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Yeah.

1292
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,480
They're always, yeah, and they're always needing to be rescued or if they do take matters into

1293
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,520
their own hands and do it themselves, they always make a big deal of it.

1294
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,360
It's always that, hey, I'm strong too.

1295
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,160
Whereas now I think if you started a new show, just happen.

1296
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,160
The female protagonist would just be doing the stunts and you wouldn't have to give a

1297
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,080
sly nod.

1298
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,160
Girls can do it too.

1299
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,240
Vicki Vale gets a couple, she beats up a couple goons, but then she loses and Batman has to

1300
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,240
save her.

1301
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:21,280
So I feel like they get a couple pity punches in the old days.

1302
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,600
And then yeah, then the man hero must come out.

1303
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,840
There was a show, sorry, we're getting tangent heavy this time.

1304
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:34,320
There was a show called like Spy Girl that replaced the Batman show, like some generic

1305
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,920
thing and it was just an all female protagonist.

1306
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,360
It seemed like Tomb Raider.

1307
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,760
So times did change.

1308
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,880
Was there a Pamela Anderson show on television that was kind of a-

1309
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,880
VIP are you speaking?

1310
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,880
VIP.

1311
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Oh, okay, okay.

1312
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,880
Vicki Irons protections.

1313
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,120
Jason was a big VIP.

1314
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,320
I was more of a Tia Carrera's relic hunter fan.

1315
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,320
Sure, yeah.

1316
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,320
They both came on.

1317
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,960
As far as the syndicated shows with attractive ladies.

1318
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,600
Right after Saturday morning cartoons.

1319
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,560
Do these not even air in Los Angeles?

1320
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,560
I don't know.

1321
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,560
How about Cleopatra 2020?

1322
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,480
Does that ring a bell for you?

1323
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,560
No, but maybe I just, maybe I hadn't been sexually awakened yet.

1324
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,840
So I wasn't eyeing these on Saturday afternoons.

1325
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,960
They were all syndicated so they aired on different channels at different times all

1326
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
over the country.

1327
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Okay, so Mary-

1328
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,960
Check your local listings.

1329
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,680
Mary Jade is being menaced-

1330
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,360
She's being menaced by two thugs.

1331
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,600
She swats off two thugs.

1332
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,860
A third is immediately too much for her to handle.

1333
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,680
She sees the third thug.

1334
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,200
Too much, runs up into the scaffolding.

1335
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,520
Once she gets up there, I need a hero.

1336
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,040
Some overflowed at three.

1337
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,040
Spider-Man comes down and saves her.

1338
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,920
Then unrelated songs, Christina Milian song.

1339
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:00,120
Then the Green Goblin floats down and says, can Spider-Man come out to play?

1340
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,920
And you don't get a sense really of why he became aware of Spider-Man.

1341
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,000
Spider-Man only vaguely helped thwart the three street thugs and I don't think they

1342
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,760
were in league with the Green Goblin so it's unclear how Spider-Man ended up on his radar.

1343
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,480
Anyway, he shows up and he's on the surfboard and that's one thing you gotta give to it.

1344
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,000
Spider-Man is floating around.

1345
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You get to see Spidey stunts.

1346
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,320
The Green Goblin is really close to the audience.

1347
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:31,200
He's hovering carefully, legally carefully over the audience on that hoverboard he's

1348
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,200
on.

1349
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:37,480
So you get that at least, which is if you're a young kid in a Spider-Man, they give you

1350
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,240
something you want.

1351
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,140
But then, so it's like picking up speed a little bit and then there's a decent little

1352
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:49,240
fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin which is literally interrupted by Mary Jane

1353
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:56,360
who stops the fight, pushes the Green Goblin away and starts singing Hey Baby by No Doubt,

1354
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:02,920
which I guess is a tactic to start getting him a little horny and getting his eyes off

1355
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,360
the fight prize, which does distract him for a second.

1356
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,360
And it works.

1357
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,360
He gets horny.

1358
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,560
Yeah, he's kind of leering at Mary Jane.

1359
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,640
Once again, Mary Jane, pure sex object in this.

1360
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,080
It's not farewell, no.

1361
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,280
No, not really.

1362
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,920
It becomes a medley with the Moulin Rouge-era Lady Marmalade.

1363
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,920
Whoa.

1364
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:27,720
Then, sort of without provoking, it becomes a fight again.

1365
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,800
All the other extra dancers who were part of the show started singing a really listless

1366
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,040
version of Another One Bites the Dust.

1367
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:39,040
It also wore What Is It Good For?

1368
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,640
the laziest, saddest versions.

1369
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,480
And this is the climax of the show.

1370
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:51,000
And the Green Goblin is fighting Spider-Man at this point using what seemed to me like

1371
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,600
Nerf balls, just like real soft, vaguely tinted little balls that he's throwing in Spider-Man's

1372
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
direction.

1373
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:04,520
You see them sort of soft bounce off the stage, maybe bounce back on and roll back the other

1374
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
way.

1375
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,120
But they still, they provoke explosions.

1376
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,800
I guess they're meant to be bombs.

1377
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,120
And he has them just like in a little burlap sack he's carrying, like a literal ball sack.

1378
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,200
Green Goblin's carrying a ball sack around.

1379
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,400
Those are supposed to be for a Marvel, they're his pumpkin bombs, Scott.

1380
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,400
We're both Marvel boys.

1381
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,400
All right.

1382
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,960
They're supposed to be little tiny pumpkins that blow up.

1383
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,920
We're assuming, unless they change the lore to just being like exploding Nerf balls.

1384
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,520
But no, they have to be pumpkin bombs.

1385
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
I think so.

1386
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,880
That's never said.

1387
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,040
Why Goblins and pumpkins?

1388
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,040
I guess they're sort of- Spooky.

1389
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
Okay, okay.

1390
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,040
Because they're both spooky.

1391
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,320
Halloween stuff could have been skulls, could have been neck bones.

1392
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Sure.

1393
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,680
Mike and I will also be hosting another show coming up called Marvel Boys.

1394
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,680
Little Marvel Boys, yeah.

1395
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:50,880
Jason doesn't want to put Lil in front of it and I want to.

1396
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
Right.

1397
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,880
We're still figuring that out.

1398
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,440
That's going to be on NPR's podcast network.

1399
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,120
That's a very high brow one, the Marvel Boys.

1400
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
It is today.

1401
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,560
Well, just you make the logo without Lil and then Mike, you just like scroll it right on

1402
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,560
there, like a little troublemaker.

1403
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,360
Little stinkin'.

1404
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,480
Oh boy.

1405
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,960
I think Scott may have sold me a little Marvel Boys.

1406
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,960
Hey, all right.

1407
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,680
I'm a guy on the same page.

1408
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,680
I'm a peacemaker.

1409
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,880
Anyway, oh I forgot, we're towards the beginning of it.

1410
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,720
Spider-Man, the first guy you see Spider-Man kill, he snaps his neck.

1411
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,720
What?

1412
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,720
Hold on.

1413
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1414
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,720
What?

1415
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Like a spider.

1416
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,160
Whoa, he kills early?

1417
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,040
Yeah, like the first guy.

1418
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,600
One of those thugs I was talking about.

1419
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
He just snaps his neck.

1420
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,440
I totally forgot that in my notes.

1421
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,560
Maybe the most exciting part of the show and I just glossed past it.

1422
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,200
God, he takes a life.

1423
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,720
Spider-Man takes a life.

1424
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:49,200
Just sort of silently towards the beginning and then it only diminishes from there.

1425
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,360
I don't know.

1426
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,160
So like three Kush bombs or like.

1427
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Kush bombs?

1428
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,960
I mean like Kush balls is sort of what I was.

1429
01:11:58,960 --> 01:11:59,960
Kush.

1430
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,960
I always called it Kush.

1431
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,960
Kush is probably Kush.

1432
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,960
Yeah.

1433
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Kush sounds like marijuana.

1434
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,960
It's weed, yeah.

1435
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,960
I don't know.

1436
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,320
He throws a couple foam balls and then one of them misfires and then he blows up and

1437
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,560
then it just sort of ends.

1438
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,920
It's I don't know.

1439
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,080
It's real lazy every step of it.

1440
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,360
You could tell probably there was a lot of buildup to the premiere and then the actors

1441
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,160
are giving up already by night five and they know this is a seasonal thing.

1442
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,440
They're not going to be there forever.

1443
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:36,440
It's yeah, I can only quantify this one as a miss aimed kick in the dick.

1444
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:41,600
This yeah, this is also not too long after Marvel's bankruptcy issues.

1445
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Oh.

1446
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:48,480
That so they were not as a carefully guarded brand at the time as they are now that they're

1447
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,000
part of the Walt Disney Company.

1448
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,560
Because yeah, they were selling off movie rights, which is why X-Men is at Fox still

1449
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,760
to this day and Spider-Man is still like technically owned by Sony as far as movies.

1450
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,120
So like at this point they were like four issues and Fox as well.

1451
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
Okay.

1452
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,400
This so that yeah, that's why they were like literally like you'll give us money for some

1453
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
of our bullshit.

1454
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,400
Here you go.

1455
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,400
Here's our bullshit.

1456
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,400
Do whatever you want with it.

1457
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,400
We don't give a shit.

1458
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,400
Yeah, we want the money.

1459
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,440
We need money and they were bailed out by Avi Arad and Ike Perlmutter who used to own

1460
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,320
the toy business toy business.

1461
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,600
And now we're in the toy business.

1462
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
Yeah, literally.

1463
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600
Yeah.

1464
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,620
Now like Perlmutter rules with an iron fist.

1465
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,680
You know, I got to say I have this stereotype of the Marvel movies as being you know, I

1466
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,120
fall on the negative side of these things.

1467
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,640
I think I say what people say that it's like they're all like TV shows and they're all

1468
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,640
sort of the same.

1469
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,480
And but thinking about this way that Marvel used to be, I think I'm appreciating the cleanliness

1470
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:47,800
that Marvel has these days because that yeah, this generic rock and Spider-Man's singing

1471
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,800
Lou Baga and this kind of thing.

1472
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,600
It's this is a big sloppy mess and I'm glad they steered out of it.

1473
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,520
However, that being said, I remember thinking about Spider-Man rocks a lot during the premiere

1474
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:06,280
of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, the Broadway musical, because they're aesthetically virtually

1475
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,280
the same.

1476
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,280
Right.

1477
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:13,400
And even though one is a cookie cutter stunt show being farted out in front of 900 people

1478
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:21,520
every day at Universal Studios and one is a $75 million, a $65 million circus tragedy

1479
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,160
as the Green Goblin says in the show.

1480
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,600
Despite the cost disparities, they're almost the same thing to me.

1481
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,920
And I think Spider-Man rocks deserves some credit and I think you too and I think Bono

1482
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:43,120
and the Edge maybe should kick some royalties over to the people who made the generic off

1483
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,360
brand rock that inspired the entire endeavor because they were the originators.

1484
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,560
I would also argue that Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark has a lot of theme park elements,

1485
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,800
like topical jokes.

1486
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
Really?

1487
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,920
Because when I saw it, stuff would break down when I saw it.

1488
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,000
It was a year into the run and then Green Goblin would have to vamp.

1489
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,360
He would have to do something and then he'd be like, it's like a Shake Way.

1490
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,280
He would pull something up and he'd be like, it's like a Shake Way and the audience would

1491
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
laugh.

1492
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,080
And I'd be like, this is not any different than the Genie at the Aladdin show at California

1493
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,000
Adventure where he's making topical jokes.

1494
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,040
It's like I don't think most Broadway shows, I mean there's got to be a few.

1495
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:23,360
But most Broadway shows don't sub in the latest headlines, send up the latest headlines.

1496
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,320
So the Green Goblin's picking up a newspaper and like, so what's going on?

1497
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,800
What's in the news today?

1498
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,520
They let him rip.

1499
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,400
He also made a joke about the stoppage too because this show would just stop.

1500
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,400
It would be like resetting and everyone would be like.

1501
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,440
They just say that on the PA for the whole.

1502
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,160
You would hear the stage manager or whoever just say like, stop.

1503
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,960
Is it still in previews when you saw it?

1504
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,480
No, I saw it a year into it.

1505
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,480
Oh, that's right.

1506
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,480
Yeah.

1507
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,760
Yeah, it was way into the run.

1508
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,640
It was after the changes made to the original Julie Taymor version.

1509
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,600
They took out that mysterious arachne woman who was like a spider goddess.

1510
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,220
Oh yeah, Spider-Man who has dozens of villains and they're like, well we got to invent some.

1511
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,160
We got to invent the knife themed villain, Swiss Miss.

1512
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,880
One of the fans really not want to see.

1513
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,960
Yeah, so no, I saw it and they still had problems.

1514
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,720
With all the money spent on Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, this and Spider-Man Rocks still

1515
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:27,240
ended up at the same type of thug who is wearing like a bright yellow shirt and then kind of

1516
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:33,000
like a bowling shirt over it and like camo shorts.

1517
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,440
The armies of thugs in both of these shows are both basically like the Dell guy, but

1518
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,880
one of them cost like 50 times what the other one did.

1519
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
Oh no, the drummer.

1520
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,280
The yellow shirts.

1521
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,400
Spider-Man save me.

1522
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:52,240
The drummer and bassist from Smash Mouth are coming after me.

1523
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:58,160
Julie Taymor personally inspected every frosted tip of every thug dancer.

1524
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,720
Anyway, yeah, it's a kick in the dick.

1525
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,720
Too bad.

1526
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1527
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,760
But hey, watch the video of it anyway.

1528
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,760
It's pretty funny.

1529
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,160
Yeah, we'll post, again, we'll post all these videos in our what, metadata and the social

1530
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160
media.

1531
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,160
Jason does that stuff.

1532
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,160
I don't know how it works.

1533
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,160
On our LinkedIn.

1534
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,640
And the show notes.

1535
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,640
Jason.

1536
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,640
All right.

1537
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:25,040
Yeah, so my show is the eighth voyage of Sinbad at Universal's Islands of Adventure in Orlando,

1538
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Florida.

1539
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,040
Sinbad.

1540
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,040
Sinbad.

1541
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Is what I recall.

1542
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,040
Say that D.

1543
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,040
There's a D in it?

1544
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,400
I'm pretty sure.

1545
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,640
Or I've seen it both ways, but I saw it with my wife like 10 years ago and I'm pretty sure

1546
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,160
because we were talking about it ever since.

1547
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,160
Sinbad.

1548
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,720
Is this some like getting them off of a copyright?

1549
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,000
What is this D about?

1550
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,640
No, I think that's because that's one of the things about this show is there is no copyright.

1551
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:59,720
So this is Sinbad the Sailor from the many centuries old Middle Eastern story cycle,

1552
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,600
the seven voyages of Sinbad.

1553
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,040
Now this is the eighth voyage of Sinbad.

1554
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,640
This is a brand new voyage for the viewing public.

1555
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,640
Why don't we?

1556
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,960
Episode seven of Star Wars.

1557
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,960
Hold on here.

1558
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,440
Scott is correct.

1559
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,440
It is Sinbad.

1560
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
S-I-N-D-B-A-D.

1561
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
I was Googling it.

1562
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:22,760
There were results without the D. I don't think a lot of people don't know that, but

1563
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,720
it was so odd we made a note of it.

1564
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,320
We were talking about Sinbad all day.

1565
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,640
This is also like doing a little research of it.

1566
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:35,400
It seems to be, I always thought of it as part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories and

1567
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,560
it seems like there's some debate of like, well, older versions of those stories don't

1568
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:46,120
have these in it, but then like there's, you know, manuscripts, more recent manuscripts

1569
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,760
where they are featured.

1570
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,560
So, but the big thing here is that Sinbad is copyright free, baby.

1571
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,560
He's in the public domain.

1572
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,680
Sinbad is especially copyright free.

1573
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,040
And Sinbad is even less copyright free.

1574
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,720
Even more than his fewer lettered brother.

1575
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:09,240
This is in the lost continent section of the park, which again, you may as well call it

1576
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,880
the public domain land because it's got a ride based on Atlantis.

1577
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,160
It's got some Greek myths in there.

1578
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,160
Poseidon and stuff.

1579
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:24,360
It's got like, yeah, an Arabian marketplace and mythos.

1580
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,880
Often voted one of the best theme park restaurants in the world, but this is the part of Islands

1581
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,440
of Adventure where they're like, we got to put some stuff.

1582
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,840
We're running out of money to license stuff.

1583
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,400
What can we make that we don't have to pay another company money and-

1584
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,800
They got like Jack and Jill in there.

1585
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,640
They got Mary had a little lamb.

1586
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,640
Merlin.

1587
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,300
Hansel and Gretel town.

1588
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:53,000
There was a part of the park called Merlinwood and that got absorbed into the wizarding world

1589
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
of Harry Potter.

1590
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,840
We talked about earlier, the Dueling Dragons got absorbed and rethemed into Harry Potter,

1591
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:08,720
but Sinbad is still going strong since the opening of the park in 1998, I believe I said.

1592
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,840
Sinbad is still running pretty much from what I could tell unchanged.

1593
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:21,340
I mean, I've seen it a lot and the setup of the show is that Sinbad has to rescue the

1594
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:26,600
Princess Amora from the evil witch Mizaria, but Sinbad's not alone.

1595
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,600
No.

1596
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,680
He needs help from his bumbling old friend, Kabob.

1597
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,680
That's right.

1598
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:39,920
They named the comic relief Kabob and he's a great, he's a jolly husky man who's like

1599
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:45,200
the most like ham fisted comic relief.

1600
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,600
Here are some of the things Kabob does.

1601
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,920
He picks up a giant golden chain necklace and says, I pity the fool, like Mr. T. There

1602
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:02,100
is a thing where a bad guy runs at him and he picks up a red cape, like a bullfighter

1603
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:08,520
and yells, Ole, and they play like bullfighting music.

1604
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,920
He does a Robert De Niro, you talking to me.

1605
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,920
Wow.

1606
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,600
There, there's a, okay.

1607
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:22,740
So they, so the show starts with like Sinbad's ziplines in to this giant cave that's full

1608
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:30,040
of treasure and it's got a waterfall and like a part of a ship and then Kabob like stumbles

1609
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,080
in and he's like, he's very horny for treasure.

1610
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:39,520
Like he really wants that treasure and they see a giant jewel at the top of the cave and

1611
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,960
that jewel is called the Sultan's Heart and they're talking about this cave and like they

1612
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,920
fight off a guy and then from beneath the stage a beautiful woman appears and that's

1613
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:55,040
the princess that they, it's like you have to rescue me, I'm being kept here and he tries

1614
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:01,440
to go get her but there's a moat of water in front of the princess and it like 10 foot

1615
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:07,340
tall flames shoot out from the water and Sinbad goes and gets the jewel and then there's

1616
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:12,540
an explosion and the jewel disappears and a bunch of steam shoots out and the princess

1617
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:18,640
disappears and she's replaced by an evil witch, the evil witch Mizaria.

1618
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:25,400
And this is the point when Kabob says the line, give a girl a big rock and she turns

1619
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,200
into a witch, typical.

1620
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,560
Is this line still in the show?

1621
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,200
It's still in the show, the video I watch is from 2014.

1622
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,640
So this line has been in there for a long time.

1623
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,720
Since 1998, it's still going strong.

1624
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,800
Is this comedy of like, boy wives, huh?

1625
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,800
Yeah.

1626
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,800
That's baffling to me.

1627
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,800
That's for the dads in the audience.

1628
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Yeah.

1629
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,800
The dads love those jokes.

1630
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,800
Yeah.

1631
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,600
I mean, these stunt shows are very broad and they have to appeal eight to 80.

1632
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,680
So like the comedy is very on the nose.

1633
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,320
So like, oh, this is happening.

1634
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:04,800
A couple of like zombie looking guys come out and they sword fight with Sinbad.

1635
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,800
I've been confused because you have been saying Sinbad when you should be saying Sinbad.

1636
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,360
Sinbad sounds so weird to me.

1637
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,560
My fair lady, this situation, keep on his grammar.

1638
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Yeah.

1639
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,560
I know.

1640
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,600
I've been very upset every time you say Sinbad.

1641
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,600
I say the right reference.

1642
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,600
Is that what I was...

1643
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,600
Sorry.

1644
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
Continue.

1645
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
Okay.

1646
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,040
So throughout all of these hijinks, there's also like, here's a zombie guy and he's got

1647
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,720
a bowstaff and he's really good at spinning that bowstaff.

1648
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,480
And they like, you know, push him out.

1649
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,880
They defeat him.

1650
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,640
And then here's another guy and he's got a big ax and he's really good with the ax.

1651
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,720
So like every guy's got a different thing he does.

1652
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,400
And this is a big set.

1653
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,560
Like this is on a big set.

1654
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,240
So like characters are like coming in and out.

1655
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,960
They're swinging on ropes.

1656
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,000
There's fist fights.

1657
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,640
There's sword fights.

1658
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,560
Here's some more kebab stuff.

1659
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,400
Kebab does a lot of very silly dances.

1660
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,320
He says, hello, governor, like unprovoked at least once or twice.

1661
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:12,560
What does his normal voice sound like if you wouldn't mind giving us a little bit of it?

1662
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,840
Or could you compare it to a different character?

1663
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,120
Like a real ham...

1664
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,800
It's like a Kevin James kind of like, hey, what up, Sinbad?

1665
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
We gotta get this treasure.

1666
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,800
So he's like a New Yorker, a street tough New Yorker kind of guy.

1667
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
Yeah.

1668
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
He's kind of like a...

1669
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,800
Yeah.

1670
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,280
I guess that's what you'd say.

1671
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,920
Like, oh yeah, look at all this treasure.

1672
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:37,680
He definitely does go, oh no, you didn't at least twice in the show.

1673
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,120
I feel like if kebab was being played on Broadway, it would be by a Mr. Josh Gad.

1674
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,480
Am I wrong?

1675
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Yeah.

1676
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,280
This could be a Gad or a Dan Fogler type.

1677
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,280
That's his name, right?

1678
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,280
Yeah, that's him.

1679
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,280
From Balls of Fury.

1680
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,280
Yeah.

1681
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,280
Right?

1682
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,280
That was the big movie.

1683
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,280
That's the movie, sure.

1684
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,680
We can't be sure that one of them was not once...

1685
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Josh Gad is possibly the original kebab.

1686
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,120
Possibly be the originated kebab.

1687
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,800
Josh Gad as kebab.

1688
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,480
Somebody check the logs at Islands of Adventure.

1689
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,760
He says, say hello to my little friend once.

1690
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,760
He gets...

1691
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,320
After you talking to me, both of them?

1692
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,640
And then we're going, we don't need Rhodes and I'll have what she's having.

1693
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,640
Yeah.

1694
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,080
Well, he gets hit in the nuts.

1695
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,080
Yeah.

1696
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,080
Hell yeah.

1697
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:34,480
And then he falls off stage at one point and yells, I'm okay.

1698
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,520
Which happens again.

1699
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,360
There's a call back to that right at the end of the show.

1700
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,760
He falls in a hole and yells, I'm okay.

1701
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,040
And he does the entire Austin Powers, Mustafa, Will Ferrell.

1702
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,640
Oh yeah.

1703
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,280
I'm very badly burned.

1704
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,280
They just steal it wholesale.

1705
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,280
Yeah.

1706
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,000
Now kebab, there is a very cool sequence with kebab where they're like, when they're first

1707
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:04,000
looking around the cave, he's hooked up to a wire and he says, well, what could go wrong

1708
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,440
or something like that?

1709
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,960
And they pull him.

1710
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:13,720
He flies 20 feet in the air backwards and disappears for a few minutes.

1711
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,400
So that's kind of cool.

1712
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,400
That was neat.

1713
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,440
Honestly, other than a couple of the things that sound very outdated as far as gender

1714
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,080
politics or something, this one sounds the best of all of them to me.

1715
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,280
It's got a lot of the stuff that you want in a stunt show.

1716
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,360
Yeah, there's a lot of fighting.

1717
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,440
There's a ton of explosions.

1718
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,040
And I'm really compelled by this kebab character to be very frank with you.

1719
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,520
Once you get over the fact that it's like, oh, I can't believe they're doing a, you know,

1720
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,160
Sinbad and they're called the sidekick kebab.

1721
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,040
I certainly would maybe rename him.

1722
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:51,080
Almost entirely for when kebabs really talking a lot at the beginning so that Sinbad can

1723
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,920
go shh kebab.

1724
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,680
How about that?

1725
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,720
How about that little piece of business?

1726
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,680
After 18 minutes of waiting, they give you that payoff.

1727
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,480
That sweet kebab meat that you've been after.

1728
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,480
Can I ask a question?

1729
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,680
How many more pages of notes on kebab do you have in there?

1730
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,680
I think-

1731
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,680
Scrolling and scrolling.

1732
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:17,000
So that's most of the kebab stuff except for kebab gets to do the interchangeable topical

1733
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
jokes.

1734
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Okay.

1735
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,200
Well, that brings it all home.

1736
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,640
So let's hear it.

1737
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,480
Okay.

1738
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,440
When the witch first shows up, again, I watched a 2014 video.

1739
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,480
What is this?

1740
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,120
Lorena Bobbitt?

1741
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,800
He goes, Lady Gaga.

1742
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,800
I'm sure-

1743
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,800
Wait, why?

1744
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,920
Is she dressed like in an unorthodox manner?

1745
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:47,900
She's kind of dressed like the witch from, what's the witch in Sleeping Beauty that Angelina

1746
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,900
Jolie was in?

1747
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
Maleficent.

1748
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,320
Yeah, she's kind of got like a Maleficent vibe.

1749
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,320
Okay.

1750
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,520
So she's wearing a very crazy costume.

1751
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
Lady Gaga.

1752
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:05,160
And he goes, Lady Gaga, something like explodes unexpectedly or someone appears unexpectedly.

1753
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:10,080
And he goes, that was more shocking than the ice bucket challenge.

1754
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,080
Oof.

1755
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,080
Yeah.

1756
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,800
So real thing of its time.

1757
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,640
These are all just kind of taking the wind out of me.

1758
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,880
I feel like I'm getting sucked in the stomach with each joke.

1759
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,480
These are like very, and we will do a full episode on the Disney California Adventure

1760
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,280
Aladdin show that ran for many years.

1761
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:32,080
And the genie did a rapid fire succession of these topical jokes.

1762
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,220
And every time I would take someone there, they would have Scott's reaction where they

1763
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,120
hated it with a fury.

1764
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,700
And I think maybe even the first time I saw it, I did.

1765
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,500
But then the second time I saw it, I loved it.

1766
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,400
And then I would try to go back every time I could to see.

1767
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:52,920
So you're telling me is something that I do hate, but now perversely love.

1768
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,760
On the Universal Tour, there was a thing where the cars from the Fast and the Furious dance

1769
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,960
around on these robotic arms that might still be there, I'm not totally sure.

1770
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,160
But in the script, they gave you a topical joke to say, which often you were free to

1771
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,160
think of your own.

1772
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:13,040
But in this one, they had, here's a zinger and please mandatorily use it.

1773
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,720
And it was the cars kind of dance a little bit and then finishes and you say, take that

1774
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,920
dancing with the stars.

1775
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,920
Take that.

1776
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,920
Uh huh.

1777
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,920
They also danced to Gasolina, which was very popular.

1778
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,680
Daddy Yankee's Gasolina.

1779
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:34,840
I got so sick of Gasolina during that, like so many days of me just like staring out the

1780
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,920
window wonder what I'm going to have for dinner.

1781
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:41,040
Just like joylessly listening to this song and then having to spring back up.

1782
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Hey, all right.

1783
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,520
Take that dancing with the stars.

1784
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,040
Suck up the hate for until you play the next clip.

1785
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,160
So yeah, I think that's most of the gags.

1786
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,400
And then, yeah, there's a lot of fighting.

1787
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:00,240
Oh, there's some funny gimmicks in the show where like they clearly have a lot, there's

1788
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:09,360
a lot of stunt performers working this because like there's a couple of big pots and like

1789
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:15,400
Kebab sticks his hand in one and the hand comes out the other.

1790
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,800
So there's clearly two people doing that.

1791
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,520
Like they use that in a few different ways where like someone tosses in a bag of treasure

1792
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,680
or tosses in a sword in one and it pops out of the other and someone grabs it from the

1793
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,680
air.

1794
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,760
So that's kind of neat.

1795
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,800
And then the, but the big notable thing for this is that it.

1796
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,840
Represents how he thinks it's more than kind of neat.

1797
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,840
I think it's neat.

1798
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,840
It's really neat.

1799
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,840
I think it's neat.

1800
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,960
So yeah, the fight, the fights are pretty good, but the big notable thing for this is that

1801
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:50,040
it shares the stunt from the end of the Waterworld show where someone like shoots, like in this

1802
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:55,320
case they shoot a bunch of sparks out of a staff that the Sultan's heart is on.

1803
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:01,940
They shoot it at the witch and there's an explosion up where she is standing.

1804
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:08,360
She disappears for like one second is clearly replaced by someone in a Nomex fireproof suit.

1805
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:12,960
They burst into flames and do like a 20 foot fall into a pool of water.

1806
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,880
And then there's a ton of explosions and everyone claps.

1807
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,880
Okay.

1808
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,880
Yeah.

1809
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,880
Yeah.

1810
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,140
Which I've watched a lot of videos of this moment from this particular show searching

1811
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,600
for an element that is almost always missing.

1812
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,280
Except for the particular day that I went to, that thing is really cool.

1813
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,200
The on fire falls into a lake, a bunch of explosions go off.

1814
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:40,680
But the day I went, the guy, as that happened, the guy playing Sinbad held up his sword and

1815
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,680
went, yeah.

1816
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,960
Which is the dumbest funniest thing.

1817
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,480
Man, sorry if I blow out the mic.

1818
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,840
It's a boy watching a guy really stupidly yell, yeah.

1819
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,840
Oh man.

1820
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,240
I also, I'd like to point out something about my Sinbad experience, which is, I don't know

1821
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,640
if this is always the case either, but my recollection is that he said the word crap

1822
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,000
a lot and damn.

1823
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,600
It was like, I'm sick of this damn crap.

1824
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,800
Like they were doing a lot of like PG-13 swearing.

1825
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:18,080
I think you saw someone who was, it was their last day and they were having some fun because

1826
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,080
it's pretty PG.

1827
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,080
I don't even care, man.

1828
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,080
What are they going to do, fire me?

1829
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,560
Fire my crap damn ass?

1830
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,560
I don't care.

1831
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,560
I'm saying it.

1832
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,560
Yeah.

1833
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,800
It made me, like also to mention my show, Moonbeam City, we said crap in it a lot and

1834
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:41,400
it was all sort of a nod to the Sinbad show because I really liked, like being edgy by

1835
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,680
saying crap, I really enjoyed.

1836
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,480
That's some like 13 year old attitude that's really fun.

1837
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,480
Get enough of your crap, dad.

1838
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,880
I think crap is an underrated profanity for that reason.

1839
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,800
It's a stepping stone profanity.

1840
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,800
Yeah.

1841
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,240
Man, I wish I saw that version of Sinbad.

1842
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,720
It's just like, oh crap.

1843
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,280
I think I saw the best performance ever, which made crap and yeah.

1844
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,960
I think you did.

1845
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,240
But yeah, I mean, I have to say, like this is a solid, I've seen this a lot over the

1846
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,240
years.

1847
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:17,960
My family has gone to Universal Orlando a lot and this is a nice way to get out of the

1848
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,280
sun, take a break, see a little stunt show.

1849
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,280
Hey, that's a good-

1850
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Still going.

1851
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:27,920
The best element any stunt show can have is air conditioning or shade.

1852
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,040
Many of these complaints will be forgiven with the proper amount of shade.

1853
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,980
So are you saying on the scale of, and I've already forgotten the two choices or three

1854
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,980
choices again-

1855
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,240
Perfect aerial flip or miss aimed kick in the dick.

1856
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,760
I feel like we're going perfect aerial flip.

1857
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,520
I think we're going perfect aerial flip.

1858
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,520
Yeah.

1859
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,520
So-

1860
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,340
But it's fair to say that you are so tired on a vacation that if there was just an empty

1861
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:53,320
room with a half open bottle of water and some air conditioner, you would give it the

1862
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,320
exact same score.

1863
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,320
Oh, for sure.

1864
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,320
Yeah, I absolutely would.

1865
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,560
Well, look, also too, if it was in a, I love Islands of Adventure, like I have a lot of

1866
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,040
affection for that park.

1867
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,040
So I am probably biased-

1868
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,720
And all the public domain that lies within.

1869
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,120
That's what they should have called the park.

1870
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,400
The public, the universals, public domain.

1871
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:14,240
Real quick, I do want to say, this is the picture they have of Sinbad on the Universal

1872
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,480
website and I know this is a visual thing.

1873
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,440
I'll put it on Twitter.

1874
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,440
Does this Sinbad look a little like the actor Michael Stolberg?

1875
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,320
Well, from Serious Man?

1876
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,320
Yeah.

1877
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,320
What?

1878
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,320
Like with a mustache?

1879
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,920
Hold on, I'm looking at him.

1880
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,440
This Sinbad looks kind of gruff.

1881
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,720
I'll give you my first reaction.

1882
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
No.

1883
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,720
Oh, okay.

1884
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,040
I don't think he looks, I think he looks more like Michael Showalter.

1885
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,040
Maybe.

1886
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,480
It's a weird looking Sinbad though, right?

1887
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,720
Like this Sinbad-

1888
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,520
My first reaction is who is Michael Stolberg?

1889
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,680
He's the lead actor Serious Man.

1890
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,680
He is the Serious Man.

1891
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,680
Yeah, he is the Serious Man.

1892
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,680
I've seen a couple, what do you know?

1893
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,840
The original cast, Michael Stolberg and Josh Gad, a high pedigree of Sinbad, the eighth

1894
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,960
voyage of Sinbad live at Islands of Public Domain.

1895
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,960
Yeah.

1896
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,280
I got all the official names, right?

1897
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,280
Didn't I?

1898
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,280
Okay, great.

1899
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,280
You did it.

1900
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,920
Well, what are we, I mean on that note, should we-

1901
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,920
Let's just be right back.

1902
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:13,920
Sure.

1903
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:23,440
All right, well on that note, you have survived Podcast The Ride, stunt show edition number

1904
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,440
one.

1905
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,440
Yes, there's so many stunts.

1906
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,760
You've been pummeled with stunt shows and tropes and characters today.

1907
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,920
So if you have a favorite stunt show at any park, regional park, like the weirder the

1908
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,920
better.

1909
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,880
Especially, or if you've participated in one, that's something.

1910
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,840
Knowing that a lot of former stunt show participants are posting videos of their excellent performances,

1911
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,160
please make us aware.

1912
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:49,480
Tweet at us, gram at us, link in at us.

1913
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,560
And that's professional stunt performers and just the people they pull from the audience

1914
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,160
to sometimes react to stuff.

1915
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,160
If you've done that-

1916
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,160
Oh, that's a good point.

1917
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,400
Yeah, tweet at us and tell us what you did.

1918
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:04,720
And if you're a Batman stunt show host, Roderick Dean Wells, please contact the Podcast The

1919
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,960
Ride Twitter or Instagram, because we would like to interview you.

1920
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:12,560
And we'd like to know why your career didn't go the way of Josh Gad's.

1921
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,360
Original kebab, Josh Gad.

1922
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,360
Original kebab.

1923
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,360
Confirmed fact.

1924
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,360
Josh Gad.

1925
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,360
Learning that-

1926
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,840
We took a little break that we cut out, but we looked it up and Josh Gad was the original

1927
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,840
kebab.

1928
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,840
Sure, yeah.

1929
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,840
That's true.

1930
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

1931
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:30,280
And I would describe learning that fact as more shocking than the ice bucket challenge.

1932
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,280
Thanks for listening.

1933
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,320
Thank you to Feral Audio.

1934
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,320
And we'll see you next time.

1935
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:35,320
See you next time.

1936
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,320
Good night.

1937
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,320
At Podcast The Ride on some social medias.

1938
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,320
Goodbye.

1939
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,320
Do it.

1940
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:43,760
Feral Audio.
