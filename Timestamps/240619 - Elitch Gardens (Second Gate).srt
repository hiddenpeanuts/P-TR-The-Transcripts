00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, where today we're doing what I consider a

2
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:36,240
spiritual heir to the 1995 film Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead. This version is called

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,320
Things to Do in Denver That Make You Wish You Were Dead. I'm Scott Gardner, there's Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,400
I thought it was gonna be a spiritual sequel to Wild Waves, as in a theme park that causes

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,680
people to have a lot of complaints. I mean, yeah, definitely, and it's a bit, I would say

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,560
there's a connection in a way to Great America, which I went to up north, and have a similar

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:11,560
syndrome where it's a dead park walking, which might kind of impact the level to which it's

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,800
being kept up. There's Mike Carlson. I'm here, yeah, this is interesting. I'm very,

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,160
I bet it's a spiritual successor to a lot of episodes we've done. Yeah, possibly owned by

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:34,200
many parks. I sort of lost the ownership at some point. Yeah, well, it also, I mean, really

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,360
specifically, it's sort of a sequel to the episode that just came out about Casa Bonita,

12
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,080
and that this is kind of part two of my experiences in Denver, my travels to Denver. And really quick,

13
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,280
I don't wanna derail it, but if we're talking about things that came up in the Casa Bonita

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
episode, I'm curious to throw something your way, Mike. What in your mind was the proof

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,600
or evidence that you had particularly high T? Because in this episode, you accidentally ended

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,040
up with a T test, and your disappointment was that it ended up normal. But in your mind,

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,280
you are just bursting at the seams with testosterone. You're coming out of your skin

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,480
pores. Well, I don't know. You know what? I don't know that it was something that there was evidence

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,760
that I had it, but I wanted it. I almost wanted it in a way. I think it was aspirational. It was

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,040
aspirational T wishes. Unless that in your mind, you were shocked by the number, that the number

21
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,360
was not in line with what you felt about yourself all these years. You were just really hoping that

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
that number would be high. It was like finding out I didn't have a mutant power or something

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,040
from X-Men or Hey, what's the Harry Potter? I didn't get called into the magic wizard school

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,760
or whatever. It's like your T is normal, sir. Maybe there was... Oh, sorry, go ahead. No,

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't know. That's really all I had. Professor X, I know you won't be coming to my school for

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,680
gifted youngsters. Oh, this was being denied that you're not gonna be one of the T men.

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,000
I wasn't going to be one of Professor T's. Professor, what is it? T-Xavier? Tech Xavier?

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,800
This is a rare... This is a porn parody where weirdly X is taken out of it. You just tip

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,680
the X to turn it into a T and you think, no, X, doesn't that make it less pornographic? Well,

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,840
no, because it's about all of them doing feats of T, all proving how... Right, how much T they have.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
And especially more impressive as you get older yet to still have a lot of your T without,

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,960
in a natural way, because I'm not taking any of the Joe Rogan T supplements that I so desperately

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,720
want to take. Not yet. Not yet. Yeah. Well, you're waiting for us to start getting those kinds of

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,120
sponsorships, which requires a slow turn of our politics, which is what we're kind of working on.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,160
Right. We'll workshop some of that stuff on the second game. Or turn the other way, get the goop.

36
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,200
Well, that's what I was about to say. We could go the other way because a lot of the goop,

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,000
Gwyneth Paltrow, it's probably politically on the other... Toward the other way. I don't know

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,200
exactly what it is because she's a big Rick Caruso politics fan. But I think that there's

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,360
definitely other versions of the T supplements we could be advertising. There should be a nerd T

40
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,040
supplement, quite honestly. There should be sort of a theme park dork supplement. Well, don't we

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,320
need it the most to get out of this awful normal territory that you're stuck in, Mike?

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Right. Because you would do the ad and you would say, well, are you ever tired by 8 p.m. when

43
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,960
you've been doing a big long Disney day? You feel like your T is dropping. Well, here we go.

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Well, the problem is, Jason would hear that ad and go, no, I'm tired at the end of any other day.

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,600
But if I'm at Islands of Adventure, I could stay up for 48 hours past that. But he has...

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm fucking juiced. I don't need no pills. He's got a mutant power, though. He would have been

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,320
taken. And I suspect his T is higher than mine. Do you know what a number... I don't know what a

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
sample number of T count is. Do you want me to find it? I'll open it up. Are we going to find

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,040
your actual number? I'll give you the number. Let's just say I don't even know what scale we're

50
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,840
dealing with here. But I think on a typical... Let's say that average is 500. Maybe on an average day,

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,280
let's say Jason gets 500. I think you do that measurement at the end of an Islands of Adventure

52
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:27,920
and it's 4000. It breaks the scale. It's like gamma radiation for Professor Bruce Banner.

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,120
That would be great. Yeah, if they could put a quest diagnostics at CityWalk or just at the

54
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,640
exit of Islands of Adventure so I can test my T. They put it on top of the Faroes lighthouse,

55
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,200
and then you get to it by climbing to the top, which is also a test of T that... Wow. He just

56
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,400
with his bare hands crawled his legs and never even touched the tower. It was all upper body.

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,240
Climbed all the way to the top to be greeted with, we're actually not taking walk-ins. We're booked

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,080
up solid. So please schedule an appointment online. No, you can't talk to anyone on the phone.

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,800
No, it's all automated. I'm pulling it up here. I get the number. We'll get the number. Yeah.

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Does it have a lot of... Which they probably shouldn't, but my chart and everything have

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,760
red, yellow, green. It explains what the levels are that would be normal, the range that would

62
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,720
be normal. So testosterone normal range would be 240 to 871. And then, excuse me, I don't know what

63
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
NGDL means. I don't know what that is. I just know there's a number. I know they tell me what's in

64
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:44,320
the normal range. I have a four... Not gonna damn lie. Your T is through the effing roof.

65
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,560
I have 465. Okay. Wait a minute. Say the range again. You're kind of right. I mean,

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,480
it's right in the middle. It's a little lower than the average, but it is average. Oh, it's certainly

67
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,800
in the... But it's a little lower than an average between those two things. Now, I don't know what

68
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,440
the average person has. I don't know that, so I don't know if I'm lower. You think what the average

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,760
person has is different than what they're showing you there? I don't know. I don't know the answer

70
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,200
to it. An average amount of T is... I guess it would have to be the average. But let's be honest.

71
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,160
Most people are down in the basement of 50. Well, I also don't know. I don't know if the scale

72
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,040
changes depending on your age either or depending. So here's the thing. I am not happy with it.

73
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah. I'm unhappy with it, but I haven't been exercising very much in the last few months.

74
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,000
I will vow to everyone that I will get my T retaken in a year's time and that I think I can break

75
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,120
550. I think I can do it. Wow. And I won't take any of the Rogan stuff. I won't take any of the

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,320
supplements. No red light? I don't know how the red light affects the T. I don't think the red light

77
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,240
has anything to do with your T, but I think the red light should be in play if I can get a hold of a

78
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,720
red light machine. But I will vow a year from now, I will ask the doctor to retake my T

79
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
and I believe I can break 550. That is my goal. Wow. I don't know if that's even possible.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Also, is insurance going to cover this? You're going to have to go out of pocket for a T test

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,560
that you don't need? I will if I have to. Okay. Or I'll have to tack another Patreon tier here

82
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,760
for some of the listeners to pay for my testosterone test. Yeah, yeah. But if listeners

83
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,040
could start covering medical expenses, that would be ideal. Quest Diagnostics is now,

84
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,880
I had to unsubscribe from the emails. You think about Quest Diagnostics so much at this point

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,000
that it has to spill out into the show. Sorry listeners, you're hearing about Quest Diagnostics

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,320
now. Well, because I haven't explored LabCorp enough, I guess. But there are a lot of out of

87
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,760
pocket tests that you can get nowadays. That's true, yeah. But I don't want, I'll see if the

88
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,640
doctor will just order it for me. Okay, sure. Sure. Yeah. I just think, I think a funny thing

89
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,240
about this is how, for a long time, the Doughboys have made fun of how they probably have very low

90
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
T. Right. And then it feels like that's, well, that's the joke you make if you're a podcaster

91
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,400
and you're in this kind of pale guy sit around field that you probably have low T. And Mike,

92
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,720
you're like, ha, ha, ha, very funny. Seriously though, I think I have high T. I'd like to have

93
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,760
high T and I think it can get higher. Mike, up your ground beef intake for more than a pound today.

94
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,480
I'm definitely going to go paleo for the next year. Oh boy. And mostly just ground beef. Just handfuls

95
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,400
of raw meat. I'm going to go paleo. I'm going to start reading a lot of Jordan Peterson books

96
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,160
and we're going to see what happens to my testosterone. If you want to improve your balls,

97
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,280
have all of your food in ball form. Just ball up a bunch of meat. Just take a big bite out of it.

98
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Eat a lot of balls. Eat a lot of balls. And then yeah, your T will grow. And then maybe I'll get

99
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,120
taken to professor to Xavier and his special school for gifted older men with high T.

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Well, God, I hope God speed on your journey. It's an old boy. It's an old man's school. If you didn't

101
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,320
notice gifted older men with high T, that's where I want to live. And the older you get,

102
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
like professor X himself, the higher that what you want is that it climbs as your age climbs.

103
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
Yes. Maybe that may be the issue here. Yes, I think that's right. Well, something that I

104
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,080
did not get to do on my Denver excursion that might've helped you. Maybe you need to get to

105
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:25,520
Denver ASAP. I did not have any Rocky Mountain oysters, which are what, bull testicles. I did

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,640
not go anywhere to have though, but that, if you go on an all Rocky Mountain oyster diet for a

107
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,320
little bit, you'd have to think that would have some impact eating testosterone. Were they on the

108
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,480
menu at Casa Bonita? No, because the Casa Bonita menu is very pretty simple. That's like, yeah,

109
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
that's like eight things because they're still, I actually didn't really, I was in one of the only

110
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,440
cliffside dining is where you actually order from a menu. I think everywhere else you still go to a

111
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,920
counter and it's sort of the Chipotle style kind of do it right in front of you on a tray. So it's

112
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,280
all such that it's like, you know, whatever, a couple dozen things that were rearranged.

113
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,880
I wanted to shout out at the top, some other stuff that I did in Denver because Casa Bonita

114
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,800
was the primary reason to go. But, you know, we found a lot of fun things to do on the food

115
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,120
front. The one I wanted to call out, there's a place called Cherry Cricket and that is a burger

116
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,360
chain. Again, don't know if there's Rocky Mountain oyster burgers there. I did a bison burger as a

117
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,320
thousand things you could do there. I'm sort of off burgers in general. This place blew me away.

118
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,520
This made me want to stay back on. If the burger quality typically at places was as high as at

119
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,040
Cherry Cricket and just like Charmin, great place and cool old sign. I wanted to shout that out if

120
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:53,280
you end up in the area. The Denver Zoo is fantastic. One of the best zoos I've been in a long time.

121
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,760
They had a train. Trains are important, as I've said, for my son's particular interests,

122
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,600
which are trains. To that end, the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, which is a little

123
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,240
bit west of Denver, was really wonderful. Maybe fun even if you don't have a train crazy kid. You

124
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,200
get to take a cool old real Disneyland style train around in a couple loops and Golden is really

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
beautiful in general. I didn't think I knocked it out of the park in terms of where we stayed. We

126
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,880
were in office park. I don't know. It wasn't particularly charming or anything. I kind of

127
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,360
wished I'd stayed in Golden because that's where it's beautiful hills getting closer to Rockies

128
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,440
and it's where the Coors Factory is. We did not take the tour. I wanted to just pop into the

129
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,520
gift shop, but you had to get on a shuttle to even be in the gift shop. We didn't want to deal with

130
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:57,600
any of that. If anybody's going and taking a trip specifically for Casa Bonita, which I recommend,

131
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:06,320
I had a good feeling about the Golden area and I bet the Coors Factory is fun too. The other thing

132
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,520
to shout out, again, a little sequel episode. I got to say, one of my favorite things I did while

133
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,680
I was there, Bass Pro Shops. We did Bass Pro Shops pretty soon after the airport because we

134
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,400
wanted to do a stop and have some lunch between airport and hotel. Have you guys ever been to a

135
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:35,040
Torchy's Tacos? No, I've heard about them. This is a good chain. I really like Torchy's Tacos. It's

136
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,960
not a Colorado chain. I think Austin it started and we'd had it before in Dallas and it left a

137
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,680
good impression. When we saw it there on the map, like, oh, Torchy's, let's do Torchy's, really good

138
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,720
queso, good weird kinds of tacos. We stopped at a Torchy's and then like, wait a minute, very,

139
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,160
very close to this Bass Pro Shops. It's a big one. It's a good one. It has one of the amenities that

140
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:08,000
not all of them have, which is a shooting gallery, an upstairs shooting gallery. This was so fun.

141
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,520
I realized that I've never really done, maybe I've never done a shooting. That's what you said on the

142
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,800
Casa Benito. Oh, yes, because it came up there. Yes. Oh, right. Yes. That was the second one I

143
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,240
had ever done. The first one being a few days prior in Bass Pro Shops. I've never done the

144
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
Disneyland ones. Those aren't episodes that we've done. Are those good? Do we like what the Disney

145
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,320
World one is? Frontierland one I just saw is getting pulled out for a vacation club. Oh, yeah,

146
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,680
it's going to be a lounge. Boy, isn't that the current company? I think the Disneyland one was also

147
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,360
closing. Is that right? Is it? I don't know. I thought I saw something. Maybe not. Maybe I'm

148
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,440
confusing the Disney World one. I've done a lot of shooting. I was a big shooting gallery kid.

149
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay. We had one on the Ocean City boardwalk. Both parks had one. And of course, the Playland one

150
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,320
burned down during that fire a few years ago. It was populated with monsters. They used to have a

151
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,520
haunted house. Oh, that's cool. Okay. So they converted a lot of the monsters where you would

152
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,880
shoot a target and a casket would open up or a Frankenstein would move or something. Oh, that's

153
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,480
a different one. Yeah. They don't all have to be old west and you're looking at old shit and shooting

154
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,800
cans and stuff. Although I'm also, I like the classic too. Now I want to know what the Frontierland

155
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,040
one is like, because I did really like this. It's funny because I was just in Disneyland and I

156
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,920
don't remember if the shooting gallery is open. I think it's open. I think so. Yeah. I never heard

157
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,280
anything about that. If you're here otherwise, Jason, let us know. I think I've only done it.

158
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,080
Let's do an episode. I've only done it once. I did it with, I was there with Aaron Whitehead

159
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,880
and Marissa Strickland and we did it I think like six or seven years ago. Who's the best shot?

160
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,240
I don't remember. I feel like we have like photos of that though. If it's not you giving this tea

161
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
conversation, man, I would hate to be. Maybe you know it's not you and you just don't want

162
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,200
to bring it up after all that. I wouldn't want to bring it. No, you know what? I am so honest on this

163
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,320
show. I would absolutely explain that I was the worst shot if it was true, which I don't think

164
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,680
it is. We just don't know. We just don't know. We just don't know. We'll figure out who's the

165
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,640
best among the three of us. Very possibly Jason given his shooting gallery history. And his high

166
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,200
T. His assumed high T. My assumed high T, yeah. Well, we have to, I don't know if, there's not a

167
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,280
shooting gallery in Alliance of Adventure, is there? Because that, again, you would, you would just

168
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,320
blast a hole through the actual. We should do a live show where somebody extracts our blood and

169
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,640
does the T test right in front of the live audience and sees the three of us. How quickly

170
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,040
do you think it comes? That's the, are we going to have to keep that audience there for six hours

171
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,520
overnight? If it has to be that, it has to be that. It's going to be a lock-in. It's going to be a

172
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,520
post-prom party. You'll see the blood transform live. Yeah, you'll see the machine wheel in.

173
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:08,560
We will have to pay for the licensed phlebotomist. Is that the term? Oh, maybe. For someone who draws

174
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,040
blood, I believe, phlebotomist. And then we'll go, we must have a phlebotomist in the audience.

175
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,080
Either, either. This is one of those situations. Either Jason is dead on or it is not even close

176
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,960
to phlebotomist. Or that's somebody that like studies rhinoceros. This is like, what was the

177
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,400
one that, oh, we're phalatists? Phalatists. And we're saying, we were getting our heads around

178
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,720
that word for five straight minutes and then it was philatelist. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Stamps,

179
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,080
stamps is phalatelist. Stamps. We will see. So anyways, really good shooting gallery and

180
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,560
best pro shops. You know, you make like a duck fly around or a big like mountain lion move back

181
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:50,160
and forth. Do you get points? It's points, yeah. There's no particular reward there,

182
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
unfortunately. You know, there's no prizes available. And it was not as generous as the

183
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,560
Cospadina one. Yeah. As a kid, I just didn't like it when there wouldn't be points. I think I got so

184
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,920
video game-pilled as a child. Wow, okay. That like for some reason, it wasn't enough if like a can

185
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,480
fell. Oh yeah. Even though now I would appreciate the can more than the points. I'm not a points

186
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
guy anymore. No. But. You're a credit card points guy. Well, amen to that. I am that. But

187
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,120
not as far as as far as like a shooting gallery. I'm much more wanting the theming and I won't want

188
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,000
the antics to happen once you shoot. Well, what you've described then is going to be a mark

189
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,080
for you against one experience that I had in Elitch Gardens, the main topic here. Anyways,

190
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,560
main thing best pressure, like just the basics, even beyond the general thing, you know, like

191
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,960
it's all the same stuff. Waterfalls, so many animals around and my son's going nuts climbing

192
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,920
on ATVs and pontoons. Yeah, he just he really loves it there. This is a particularly great one

193
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,280
and this one did not let us down. We bought matching hats. I don't think we've ever bought

194
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,560
anything matching as a family. We're so excited. Those those hats there are priced to move.

195
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:07,040
Those are much like six bucks. Wow. Wow. Like trucker hats. Jason's tea just surged

196
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,000
50 points when he heard six dollar hats. Well, you want to I forget if I tagged you on this

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,800
when it was happening. But if we really want the tea to surge giant like truck, like flatbed truck

198
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,960
filled with dollar moon pies. Oh, well, yeah, that's a great price. It's broken the scale.

199
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,320
It's like I need I need to leave for a second. Please don't look in my crotch area while I get

200
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,200
up. But anyways, so yeah, a lot of fun stuff in Denver, really high on that Bass Pro Shops.

201
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,680
And then that leads us to Elitch Gardens, for which I will do a little bit of history before

202
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:51,200
I get into my specific experience. It's one of those like well, I mean, Jason, I'm glad you

203
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,320
you know, you've been a little sick and we almost had to do this one without you. I'm glad you're

204
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,040
here because this is one of those like I think this park is in the tradition of the kind of thing

205
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,080
that you like, which is like it's that Kenny Wood model of it's a theme park today, but it grew out

206
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,320
of a it's been there since 1890. Yes, it's moved locations. It moved location. There was a hard

207
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,080
reset in like 95, I believe. But yeah, like now just clearly like, you know, in the mold of Six

208
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,880
Flags kind of theme park. But it started as like, you know, charming place for, you know, for events

209
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,840
and fairs and just grounds and gardens. And then they slowly add carousel and ferris wheel and a

210
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,560
little kiddy land and a wooden coaster called Mr. Twister. And it had like a music hall. It's the

211
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,680
Trocadero. It's that, you know, where it was like the kind of place where there'd be like a there's

212
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:55,040
the bandleader named like Cap Flappy, that kind of guy, Cap Flappy's Orchestra. So like, you know,

213
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,120
very much I feel like what you like on the East Coast, I think is the lineage of this place. But

214
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,840
then reset in 94, original location closes, moves to new location, which is really close to downtown,

215
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
maybe like the closest theme park to a downtown I've ever seen. It's a little unusual. Yeah,

216
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,000
it's bizarre to see video footage. Like I saw one vlogger who's like, there's the football stadium

217
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,080
and there's the basketball arena, you know? Yeah. And here's the Lich right between. It's next it's

218
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,600
right next to whichever was the stadium where Obama did that particularly gigantic produced

219
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,960
acceptance of the nomination. Okay. Remember that? Yeah. A lot of columns. And then that was the.

220
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,040
Yes. That was the Republican hit. Like, geez, who is this guy with the columns? Does he think he's

221
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Zeus or something? They got him. Yeah. Yeah, nailed him down. Anyways, we've I think mentioned it

222
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,960
before on the show due to it being the filming location of three ninjas high noon at Mega Mountain

223
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,320
for fine feature film Hulk Hogan. Yes. Jim Varney, a good Jim Varney performed one of those that

224
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,720
reminds you like, is it a good movie? No. But is he if somebody given him the dramatic chip because

225
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,760
he they were not in the earnest ballpark at all. Right. He had range. Lonnie Anderson. Oh, yeah,

226
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,600
Lonnie Anderson, too. Good and silly in it. Anyway, in this time, it was bought by Six Flags.

227
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,440
It was then unbought by Six Flags and it goes one of the ones that they shook loose in like the Dan

228
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,640
Snyder era, which is a tumultuous time. So like 2006, it's not. So anyway, the like, I think we

229
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,000
my guess is that if there was a lot of charm to this place ever that some of the charm shook out

230
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,120
in that when it literally moved locations. Yeah. Usually the when you see moved locations,

231
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:04,880
it's like and in 1930, it moved locations. It's rare to see. I feel like 1994 on the big we've

232
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,720
taken all of the attractions and moved it down the road. Yeah. Yeah. It feels like ancient history.

233
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,920
Yeah. Usually. And I think that opening it in the 90s and that it had a vibe that worked for

234
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,280
something called High Noon at Mega Mountain and that it had a vibe that made sense to Six Flags

235
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,920
in the 90s. I just I think like something happened there. I bet like the architecture

236
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,800
was more charming before the grounds were more charming before. I don't know. Maybe if you're

237
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,040
local there, you grew up there, you could say that, no, this place was pretty like charming and good

238
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:42,880
in 95, 96 or so. But today, perhaps a little questionable. And I was maybe a little bit aware

239
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,000
of this going in. Now, it's it's very much as I was saying, like in the same neck of the woods as

240
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Great America, which I did up in Santa Clara. It's actually the same format of my San Jose trip

241
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,800
where I did. There was one episode about an extremely charming place that I got to go to,

242
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,560
like shockingly charming, which in the San Jose case was Gilroy Gardens. And then there's that

243
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,960
now there is a park that is on death's door that is being redeveloped to be condos or something

244
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,720
that I, you know, I'm not even sure what it is exactly. But like this strange situation

245
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
where they've called it, it's going away, but we're still going to run the place.

246
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah, it's going away. There's no listed closing date, I think still.

247
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,960
Yeah, even the other one, Great America has like, you know, whatever, five years. This,

248
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,560
we don't I don't think we know. We don't. It seems like a redevelopment project, which

249
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,160
always fall apart a million times before something inevitably gets built. Yeah. Maybe.

250
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,960
Yeah, well, like three passes of it gets like crappier and more boring.

251
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,480
Yeah. So but this is the one of the parks. I think this might be the one we've been

252
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,840
warned about the most or like, you got to look into this one, you know?

253
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah, yeah. Well, and that'll factor in the way I tried to remind myself the warnings was

254
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
that was in a particular funny point. But anyway, I'm now like,

255
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,240
you shouldn't do this. You should. You should close the park or not.

256
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,960
Yeah, don't let it just like run itself into the grass. It's like it's like letting a car

257
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,640
run up to I think I can get this up to 200,000 miles and like it's all like every part is just

258
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
wearing down and wearing down. And if you like didn't replace any of it. Yeah, it's fine. I

259
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,160
don't I don't need a window. No, that rattle is part of the charm of the engine. It's all good.

260
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,320
The overheating is how I know it's working. I saw at least one or two videos where someone's

261
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,440
like, well, I want to try to hit all the coasters. But a number of them are closed.

262
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,040
And I was told it was because of staffing issues. It is the day after Fourth of July.

263
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,920
So that's a little confusing. Yeah, that's that's exactly the situation

264
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,360
I found. And in my head, I was like, well, this must be like a post covid thing. Like we're,

265
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
you know, we just aren't running as much. We'd rather it be open than not. But we just don't have

266
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,520
the staff. And then I watched one of those videos and it was exactly what I encountered.

267
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,240
And that was in 2018. Yes. Yeah, I think that same video. Also, they're like, well,

268
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,320
I know a little bit of sway is common with coasters, tracks, especially older wooden ones.

269
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,640
But this seems like a lot. And they just show footage of like a roller coaster, like the whole

270
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,240
thing, like swaying in the breeze. Yeah, really swaying. And I'm like, oh, my God.

271
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:59,360
Well, yeah, it sways when a, you know, just when a coaster car goes on top of that part of the track,

272
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,560
it just the entire all of the support sway. And I know that because I was in that line and I saw

273
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,440
that happen before I saw that video. But I'm going to do that. I'll get to that in the narrative of

274
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,400
how this this played out. Anything else about that you noticed that you found about like it's

275
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,880
interesting about the place before I get into how my day went? Well, I you might have be prepared

276
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,240
to do this. But are you going to explain this insignia like the logo? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's

277
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,440
right at the top. That's great. That's a good sort of a place to start. Well, let me just let me just

278
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,000
say this also that like so what what did get communicated to me by people who know the Denver

279
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,640
area well is that it would not be a good idea to go to Denver with a young child and not have Casa

280
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Bonita as the like to where it would not be smart to go. We'll go to Denver for a little bit. And

281
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,080
the big centerpiece will be Elitch Gardens. This much I clocked from what people got back to me.

282
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
So I was really teetering on canceling this trip. But thank God Casa Bonita worked out and you heard

283
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,400
how that went and how lit up I was about that. So it was great. Then what happened was I was so

284
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,320
wired from that experience. And that was the last night of the trip. Truly, I felt like I had just

285
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,480
done like five espresso shots. I was I was purely for I mean, a little bit of alcohol, but also just

286
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,160
like it the raw enthusiasm about being there. So I slept terribly. We were all sleeping bad,

287
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,080
just hotel room. We weren't used to it and it wasn't the most comfortable. So like awful,

288
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,240
awful night of sleep. And then but we got a day to kill. Like the flights not till 4 p.m.

289
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
But like boy, it was really like I don't know if I feel like being in a theme park and especially

290
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,040
one that we've like been warned about essentially. But we got to kill time somehow. It's like on the

291
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,720
way to the airport and we land at. Well, what if we just go for three hours? Let's see if we can

292
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,400
keep it to three hours and just do like kind of kind of the quick version. And I'm sure there'll

293
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,120
be something, you know, cute for my son and it'll be good. But this is this is, I think, important

294
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,120
that we were like on the fence coming from a really exemplary themed experience. And then we

295
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,400
arrive at this place. We pull up and notice a couple of things. One is what you mentioned,

296
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,200
Jason, that there is a sign that is a very like, you know, fifties beer sign feel like

297
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,840
there's a few of these on the way in that's very traditional looking. And here's a picture of me

298
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:45,920
with it and what it if I were to read how they intended, it would be not to see Elitch's is not

299
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:54,800
to see Denver. But it's like it's presented with a circle within a circle. And the way that

300
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,200
naturally you want to read this and what you pointed out, Jason, was that like the human eye

301
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,840
like reads the middle and then reads the outside. So you go you start with the middle and it says

302
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:16,240
Elitch's is not to see. Yeah. And then another not to sit like they're warning not to see. And

303
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,400
that one's and it's white text over black. That feels more not to see Denver. It looks like it

304
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,760
was on a list called not to see Denver. Yeah. And they had to display it like you have to display

305
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,440
a health code violation. I did see footage of someone reading it yesterday and I was like,

306
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,040
OK, not to see Elitch's is not to see that. So it's like the spirit of Denver. Like you have to

307
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,440
if you come to Denver, you have to see Elitch. That is what they are trying to convey. But yes,

308
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,000
given that you read what's on the brighter color before the outlay, like what we all naturally have

309
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,400
chosen, how we choose to read things presented like that leaves us at Elitch's is not to see.

310
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:08,240
Yeah, you also shouldn't have not to see so close to your whether it's even if you're saying like

311
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,400
don't miss it. Yeah. Like it's also a sign that's like comma part splintering. Like the photo I'm

312
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,120
looking at has like multiple like, OK, this needs paint. This needs to be cleaned up. That gutter

313
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,720
doesn't look too cleaned out. I'm like, no, there's like notice five flaws just in this photo of the

314
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,800
sign. And that sign is in the dead center of the giant Ferris wheel, too. Oh, that's right.

315
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:42,080
So you're not to see Elitch's is not to see. Skip it. Yeah. And the fact that that's outside.

316
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,640
There were there were three things that were tells to leave before we even got in. One was

317
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,440
this sign. One was the parking, which was thirty dollars. Really? Even for this place? Yes. We are

318
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,080
at Disney Universal. It's exactly what I paid on Hollywood Boulevard the other night when there

319
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,840
was like there were multiple shows going on. Yeah. Pretty cocky. Right. And then the other thing is

320
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,360
that we pull in and it's we weren't too concerned because it was right at opening. We were rope

321
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,200
dropping it. But there was a big line out the door and we were like, well, maybe that'll clear

322
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,680
because it literally is opening. But then we realized there was a commonality between almost

323
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:27,440
everybody in the line. And that is that they were all 12 to 13 years old. Everyone, everyone

324
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,440
outside like what is going on? I mean, we were anticipating teens for sure. But then we're putting

325
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,440
it together and like, OK, wait, it's like 12 to 13 year olds. And then like one one per hundred

326
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:48,000
middle schoolers has like a stressed out person with a clipboard. Oh, this is this is a chaperone.

327
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,120
This is that this is like the middle school trip day. We have chosen the middle school trip day

328
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,040
to go to this place that we were already on the fence about. Oh, my goodness.

329
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:08,560
It's better than a grad night, I would think. Yeah, because it's not. It's not. Yeah. I mean,

330
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,080
it isn't only teenage. Like, it's not exclusive. Right. Because these teens aren't as like fully

331
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,080
comfortable being teens yet. You know, they're not they're not giving off that scarier teen

332
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,480
energy, not necessarily. Some of them are more mature. Mm hmm. But I'm just saying I could see

333
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,640
if they were 17 year olds, I'd be extra scared as an older man. Sure, sure. You know, well,

334
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,320
in your current in your like 400 range T world. Well, if I get up to 500 and you're clocking teens

335
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,920
left and right, you're picking them up and throwing them at each other. Certainly. Yes, that gives me

336
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,760
more fear when my T is lower. I can feel it. Work on this and then you can go to then you can finally

337
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,520
go to grad night at Six Flags Magic Mountain and they'll let you in because you'll pass as a teen.

338
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,080
Exactly. Not that you don't now. So youthful and so aggressive. They won't know the difference.

339
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,680
Youthful you have, aggression you're missing. Yes. Looking for aggression. Well, you're right that

340
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,040
they aren't all of that like intimidating. Yeah. Ilk. But there are what we figured out is that

341
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,880
there's a there's a range, right? There are alphas and the alphas have to prove themselves. And

342
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,760
you know, we we get past this pretty irritating line where it is nothing but 12 year olds and then

343
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,200
and just like the stressed out the chaperones going like guys, guys, guys, that kind of so it's

344
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,440
this is a frazzled energy. And I think my son is the only like little kid in sight.

345
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Oh, that would be scary if I was a little kid. Yeah. And it's all older kids. I don't think he

346
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,680
could. I mean, he's it's all older. Yeah, that's true. Well, like I'm the same. I'm 12 too.

347
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:48,000
You may as well be. Yeah. Yeah. But anyways, we get to the stroller check in. We go to rent

348
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,640
a stroller for the day. That is right next to another check in, which is like animals that you

349
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,840
can ride around. You know, this kind of thing. Yes. In the Burbank Mall. Oh, my God. Yeah. You

350
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,160
get like tigers. Oh, no. Wheels or whatever. Oh, you could just ride one of those through a theme

351
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,040
park theme park. Yes, I've never seen that before. It's really controlled in a mall, right? It's like

352
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,680
doing this little loop, do it in a pen. But here, yeah, 12 year olds are renting tigers to ride for

353
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:25,360
the day to ride into each other on the presumably broken as well. I would imagine that's not a good

354
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,560
idea. But that to me is awesome. Sure. Yeah, I would love to do that. If you could, if you had

355
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,520
control of the area and then, yeah, we could. All right. It's tiger versus zebra versus mountain

356
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,240
lion. If you could ride like on a panda through Disneyland. Holy shit with that rule. That's

357
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,240
pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, look, they're they're looking for upcharge experience. Right.

358
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,320
The modern Disney company is just going to loop around to Six Flags. All right. What is some dumb

359
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,680
crap that we can get 20 extra bucks to pop for? They're jealous of Six Flags in a lot of ways.

360
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,480
They might be looking at Six Flags. Right. How do we this is the idea? How do we get there?

361
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Johnny Rockets is so expensive. How do we how do we get our audience to pay this much?

362
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,160
There's a whiteboard and it just says cigarettes question mark vapes question mark.

363
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,000
That's next on the agenda. Once the once the Disney sports betting mechanism is fully up

364
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,760
and then the the Main Street Cinema is replaced by just like they're just playing boxing matches

365
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,000
and you're putting money down. They were gambling is coming. I think it's coming.

366
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,440
It's already with ESPN. It's kind of like find any piece of footage or any media where Walt

367
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,960
says the word gambling, just show that this is what he wanted. And if not, make it up,

368
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,040
plant it. Just go age it. Just go like we'll Photoshop a picture of him. Yeah. You know,

369
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,880
just like like doing craps and then just go like bury that in the dirt for six months and we'll

370
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,280
pull it. Look what we found. Walt did want gambling to be part of this. I read a thing

371
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,560
a while back. I don't remember the exact specifics, but like I think some of the

372
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:15,840
like the Seminole tribe maybe and that the tribe that owns the hard rock, they were trying to get

373
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:22,240
gambling off the ground in Florida. And I think their lobbyists kept getting blocked

374
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:30,160
by Disney's more powerful lobbyists. Like Disney has tried to keep Florida out of at least the

375
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:38,720
range of central Florida, like gambling, gambling, free bubble because of just the family friendly

376
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,880
image. Yeah. And I guess they'll be glad they did that when they finally introduced it. Right.

377
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,120
They're going to do well. But also you can't. Now, if you watch sports sports games now,

378
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,880
you get the fanatics bets, ESPN bets. So that is slowly creeping in. Yeah. Well,

379
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:07,440
you got to admit and unless I'm wrong, you tell me, Jason, is it does it betray the Mark Twain

380
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,400
that you love if you can do riverboat gambling? I think it's in the spirit. I mean, if I would

381
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,840
love to get in on a craps get like, you know, ride the river. But there are some kind of,

382
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,400
you know, segments of the river with not a lot going on. So I'd love to just pop into a craps

383
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,120
game or get taken for a ride on a three card Monte. This is a table and smoke a cigarette while

384
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,080
you're doing it. Oh, yeah. It's not going to be casino games. It's going to be three card Monte

385
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,240
tables, which have been retired from New York and turned into weed tables. As you've told us,

386
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,800
it's going to be dirty tables just sitting on the outside of the deck. It's going to be

387
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,440
con men. Yeah. It will be Disney sponsored con men, but there's going to be shady characters.

388
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,960
All right. Where's the follow the coin for the coin? And then if the boat stops suddenly, like,

389
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,360
I saw what's cup. I saw the cup. And they're like, no, it doesn't count.

390
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,440
I've got a billion dollar idea for someone, probably not universal because they have Nintendo.

391
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,920
Let's do Sonic casino night zones where you can actually gamble because that's one of my favorite

392
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,240
level in Sonic and just let it be real gambling. What's the ownership there? Sega owns it. Okay.

393
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,560
But who owns it? Do they have any theme parks? That's a very good question. And it's a lot of

394
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,840
Sega. I feel like in theme parks. Yeah. And there's no interventions had Sega and Sonic stuff.

395
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,360
Paramount. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's kind of a fucked one. I wonder if there's not like a

396
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,480
big licensing deal yet for a theme park with Sonic. Yeah. It feels like a big character not

397
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,720
to have represented somewhere, but he sort of feels that this feels like maybe the move that

398
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,920
like puts six flags officially on top if they put casino night zone. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It not

399
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,760
only is it just full on gambling, but it's with the Sonic property. Yeah. Which I think matches

400
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,240
the vibe of six flags in general. I think that's right. I think imagine just seeing like Robotnik

401
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,880
and Mr. Six hand in hand. Cause they're both similar. They're like brothers. It's never

402
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:21,040
occurred. Or is his dad. That's a great idea. They get along great. Yeah. Is Mr. Six maybe

403
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,560
that they could tie it together. The reveal that Mr. Six is Dr. Robotnik's grandfather. Yeah.

404
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:34,160
And he's in a little egg too. I feel like we're starting to see like early 2000s nostalgia. It's

405
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,000
been 20 years. Let's get Mr. Six back. Isn't it starting to, wasn't there just something?

406
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,040
There was a little bit of Mr. Six, wasn't there? They're teasing something,

407
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,240
but I don't know. A while ago already. I don't know. We're like a granddaughter of Mr. Six.

408
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,680
I don't know, but I want him, I want him back. Look, we got Shaq and the general are fully back.

409
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,240
They were gone and now they're back. Yeah. They're, I think they were gone for a little while. I

410
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,320
don't know anything about them being gone. I do know they are around. I saw them the other day.

411
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,440
My daughter seemed to like the general Shaq commercial where they were like dancing in a

412
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,680
club together. Okay. So they're at least around. I just don't know if they went away. Yeah. Right,

413
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,160
right. Did Six Flags merge with Cedar Fair? What happened with that?

414
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,400
I think it's still in the works. That's still trying to figure that out? Yeah.

415
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:24,880
Anyways, back to the animal writers who basically, as Aaron is trying to get a stroller,

416
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,520
there's both things involve a form. Like, okay, well we need your info here for what she's doing

417
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,160
with the stroller and then right next to her, the teens are doing it to take their tiger out

418
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,040
or whatever. Yeah. And if you can imagine that the teens are not as patient with forms as a mother

419
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,920
and they just kind of like, they just start going and the woman behind the counter like,

420
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,280
wait, wait, wait, guys, guys, guys. And they're just off. They do not, they are not registered,

421
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,520
whatever had to be done, deposit, I don't know. They are just off and writing. And I don't know,

422
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,880
I never saw anything, I'm not building any big story here that I saw anything bad happen,

423
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,040
but it was just one of those unnerving elements through the day where you'd be walking around

424
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,600
and then like, oh, it's them. And you could feel an energy from the other teens as well,

425
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,880
where it's kind of like, they're like the apes who are riding the horses and have control of

426
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,520
the Falcons as well. There's like, how do you elevate yourself in this society, in tween society?

427
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,880
Well, riding on tiger back definitely helps. There was a fear and an awe around the tiger

428
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,280
riders all day. So the other thing that was happening, this is a syndrome I realized I

429
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,000
don't think we've ever talked about on the show, even though this is a very common theme parky

430
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,480
thing. And this sort of, you know, the coaster style parks, we saw this one little booth,

431
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,880
like a little tent with a couple of things on top of a folding table. And I went, oh,

432
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,280
this takes me back. This is the physics table. This is the physics justification of why the

433
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,680
middle school is just fucking off and going to a theme park today. Like, see, we did it. Physics.

434
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,320
Look, there's like, I don't know, there's a couple of balls on, those are molecules. See?

435
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,240
Molecule, without molecules, we wouldn't have roller coasters. Is that close enough? Great.

436
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,520
This is a physics day. That is what we're doing physics. Did you guys ever do one of those?

437
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,560
I was, we may have, and that I maybe sat out because I was too coaster afraid.

438
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,880
I don't think we actually did. That would have been great, but we didn't.

439
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,280
It was a big LA high school thing. Like, just like get through these months because we will

440
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,320
find a really thin justification to just go to Magic Mountain.

441
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:51,760
Yeah. I went to Hershey Park a few times, two or three times, as part of Song Fest. Like,

442
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,720
the band and the chorus would go sing and compete. And then they would unleash you on the park for

443
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,720
not enough hours, for my taste. Song Fest didn't give you enough hours?

444
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,680
Are we roped up to close? Is this a roped up to close today?

445
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:15,200
The one time me and my dad came up and picked up me and my friend early so we could go to the

446
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,240
freshman formal that night, which sucked that that was on the same night. And looking back, I'm like,

447
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,160
why did I leave a theme park to wear an ill-fitting suit and go to a dance? Yeah.

448
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,880
Were you participating in Song Fest? Yeah.

449
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,200
So you sang at Song Fest? Yes.

450
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,320
What, do you remember what you sang? You know, probably, I have had this,

451
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,160
it talked with a few people about this experience. The main song I remember singing, the two main

452
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:57,120
songs were a choral arrangement of Blackbird, the Beatles song Blackbird, and then Ease On Down the

453
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,360
Road from The Wiz. Oh, you said this from The Wiz, yeah.

454
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:07,280
And I have had multiple people go, like, I had a very white chorus too. I had a very

455
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:15,200
lily white chorus too. And we also sang songs from The Wiz. We sang Ease On Down the Road as well.

456
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,520
And you did this at Song Fest. I think we probably would have. Like,

457
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,480
that's what I can remember. And now with a Sly and the Family Stone medley.

458
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,040
Jason. Jason Solo.

459
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,720
Singing the spiritual classic Wade in the Water. We shouldn't have been singing that.

460
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,040
I like this song. It's about fishing for pond deals.

461
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,400
Yeah. Fishin' for Jersey pond deals.

462
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,640
So then now I am making my way, you know, while being cautious of the Tiger Riders,

463
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:57,200
I'm making my way up their main street. And this is, like, the most committed to attempt

464
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,720
at, like, a little charming turn of the century area. There's an old carousel as you enter.

465
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,600
There is a, you know, like, you know, little shops and avenues attempting a main street vibe.

466
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,840
And then, like, little signs, just like Main Street, where, like, oh, it's implying businesses,

467
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,280
the barbershop or whatever. But even these have kind of an unnerving air. Like, this very old

468
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,320
sign that's falling apart that says Mekeska Insurance, the widow's friend.

469
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,400
What? What?

470
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Weird. So that stuff is a miss.

471
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,160
I guess it's funny, though.

472
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,560
Yeah, it kind of is. It's a dark funny joke, so I can appreciate it.

473
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,360
Yeah, yeah. But then the other thing that's weird is that there's, like, you're on the,

474
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,160
there's, like, lampposts with, you know, signs on either side saying, like, stuff that's coming up,

475
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,720
but, you know, all right, upgrade to a season pass. And then there's, like,

476
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,920
events that are coming up, like fireworks on Labor Day weekend. And then over here,

477
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,160
Friday, July 19th, Wonka. And I'm like, Wonka? Is there going to be, like, a Wonka experience?

478
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,440
Did they buy the Glasgow Wonka experience? Is it officially taking up residence at

479
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,120
Delich Gardens with no change? No, what this is is seems to be the movie Wonka.

480
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,440
That's their big event for the summer. Friday nights. Elitch Fridays. We got Wonka.

481
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,960
We bought a DVD.

482
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,960
All our employees are sharing a max password. And then, like, Friday, July 26th, Monsters Inc.

483
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,720
So they're just, this is a big summer. They're just showing old Disney movies.

484
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,680
They printed out a sign, too, with their logo on it and with Mike and Sully, which is interesting.

485
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,080
Isn't it weird seeing Mike and Sully at a different theme park? And it's just because

486
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,800
they're going to play the, and then we were going, like, given the jankiness of this park,

487
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,720
do they even have a screen or are they just going to play it on the Ferris wheel?

488
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,240
Like, this is the biggest surface we have. Granted, it's moving and there's lights and stuff,

489
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,480
but, like, come on, it's bigger than any screen's going to be. We're going to play Monsters Inc.

490
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,080
On top of a Ferris wheel. You did not get that question answered, I assume.

491
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't. I'll try to, you know, I'll try to stay on it. It could be on the side of a building,

492
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,360
I guess. Yeah, maybe so. Well, yeah, it'll be on one of these with, like, awnings and railings

493
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,200
and stuff. Worthy to wait for a real cloudy night projected on the clouds.

494
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,480
Onto the sky? Yeah.

495
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,960
All right. Eyes on the sky, everybody. What movie is it? Toy Story? No, it's Sully. Look,

496
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,400
it's Sully. So, you know, weird stuff still abounds. And then now where do I land? Oh,

497
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,760
well, I head straight to one of the big reasons we've talked about this place before,

498
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,640
the Meow Wolf ride. Meow Wolf did got the opportunity to take over a dark ride

499
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,360
at this park. It is called Kaleidoscape. Yes. Not Kaleidoscope, but Kaleidoscape. Okay, great.

500
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:04,320
It used to be a Ghost Blasters. It used to be a Sully Dark Rides. A kind of, like, generic,

501
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,240
like that's something they've put in a couple of parks, you know, shooting gallery type ride.

502
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,240
And they got to, like, you know, take it over and, like, build custom installations and, like,

503
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,640
you know, specific artists got specific rooms and kind of the stuff they do. So I want to see that.

504
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:30,800
That sounds great. I split off from family to go check that out. And I get out and the pre-show

505
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,000
is running. And I'm like, this is a little neat. This is almost like a little Epcot-y. This is,

506
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,480
like, a little bit like, you know, like, you know, inventions, I might say. Like, there's a robot

507
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,880
kind of without, like, where you can see all the mechanisms inside, which is very interventions.

508
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,120
And then it's like cool synthy music and this kind of, like, a vapor wavy thing going on. Like,

509
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,800
okay, well, now we're talking. You know, that doesn't seem all great here, but this seems a

510
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,600
little bit cool. There's an employee up by the cars by the loading, but I can't quite get to her.

511
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,560
And then I'm like, oh, wait, I can't. Like, all right, it's blocked off. I can't. So I yell to

512
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:12,400
her over the music, you guys aren't open? No. When will you be open? We don't know.

513
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,000
Oh. You don't? You don't know? Implying that, like,

514
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,880
this is coming from somebody up top is going to pull the trigger on this thing. This is the

515
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,280
opening of the day, the, you know. Sure. So, all right, maybe I will not get to do the

516
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,080
Meow Wolf ride. And then this sets in motion something was alluded to in one of the videos

517
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,640
that you should, like, on the outside of the park, it says this ride closed, that ride closed.

518
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,800
I start poking around. It is so much more than those rides closed. There are a lot of rides

519
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,360
closed. And I don't know if that's just going to come throughout the day. They will start expanding.

520
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,960
That happens even in Universal or something. This ride opens an hour late, but I'm like,

521
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,960
I'm a little bit suspicious of how this is actually going to work. And then I learn about

522
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,320
a new policy because I quicker than I expected returned to my family where I left them in kind

523
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:13,600
of the kiddie zone. And Aaron informs me that there are five rides in this area and they are

524
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:22,640
all operated by one employee who is just waiting for lines to form. And whichever one has the

525
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:29,040
longest, you will then have to say, excuse me, go run the bus that goes around. All right. Now

526
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,240
there's a lot of people at the train. Sorry. I'll be at the train. That's a new one, right?

527
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,680
That's a joke we've made. I'm sure about six flags or something before. And that's reality here.

528
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:50,560
Even at smaller Jersey Shore parks, unless it was a really small family

529
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,720
fun center with a couple of rides and a mini golf course, that's the only time I've seen

530
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,480
something like that. And it's usually really empty when that's going on.

531
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:10,400
You should not pay $30 for parking and then get into a place where one employee is running five

532
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,440
rides, all of which look of questionable quality. My son's in a pretty like not trying stuff,

533
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,720
easily scared kind of era. So he didn't want to do any of it. And in this case, we're like,

534
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,120
that's fine. That's, you know, probably better, probably for the best. And also just given this

535
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,880
policy, like, geez, poor guy. At least he's getting his steps in for the day.

536
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,600
Yeah. Could you have offered to help? Could you have said, hey, do you need any help for an hour?

537
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,800
Because I like I've kind of always wanted to do some of these park ops thing. Like,

538
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,120
do you think that person would have been like, yeah, I think he would have cut me off before

539
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,320
that second sentence you said. OK, because I kind of like, yeah, go. Yeah. Red button, go.

540
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,240
He wouldn't be in such a haze that he doesn't even occur to him that I don't work there.

541
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,360
He would see that I was wearing a collared shirt and that I'm twice his age and go,

542
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,680
probably works here. Or at least knows what he's doing in some regard. He would have thought you

543
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,640
own the park. That must be James. You must be a multimillionaire, sir, with that collar on.

544
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:23,360
Man, you can afford a collar. Must be nice. That's extra fabric and those buttons it takes to

545
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,120
attach your shirt together. Those buttons ain't cheap. Are you a Coors?

546
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:37,840
All right, you got me. I'm Scotty Coors. This will all be mine one day. But yeah, so really,

547
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,960
Shay. So we're like, what else can we do? And we find an arcade and my son's in arcades right now

548
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,600
and we go to an arcade that is the most caked on dust I've ever seen. It is a view outside to a

549
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:58,000
log flume ride with the brownest water I've ever seen. It is truly vile. It is also not running,

550
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,640
if you can imagine. And I'm like, well, I got to do something. I think I owe one ride, at least,

551
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,440
if I'm going to come here. And I know that when I was in what I realized was a pretty equivalent

552
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,520
place, which is great America, I was pretty down on it in that experience. And I think I even

553
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,960
noticed people saying, well, it's kind of a coaster place, and you can't just go there and

554
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,960
not do coasters. And so I got to do a coaster. I sort of chickened out of something called

555
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:34,080
Mind Eraser, which might be maybe the main thing to do, a Vekoma suspended looping coaster,

556
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,440
which means, I don't know, I can't actually tell how it's like, I don't know, you're hanging and

557
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:46,560
then it's like lots of loops. But I can't tell how that's different than whatever the knots one,

558
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,360
what's the silver bullet? I can't quite tell. If you haven't noticed before, I zone out pretty

559
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,760
easily on these coaster differences. That is not what the podcast is.

560
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,960
The mechanical difference. Yeah, yeah. But it seemed like a good one,

561
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,280
certainly, although then I watched some video that was like, oh, well, for a Vekoma SLC,

562
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,960
this was kind of a weak, not well-kept Vekoma. All right, sure. Jason, there's something at

563
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,680
Maury's Piers called the Great Nor'easter. You ever done that?

564
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,960
I have seen it. I don't think I ever wrote it.

565
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,760
Okay. Same breed of coaster if you are there. So I didn't do that. Not to mention, I do not want

566
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:33,520
to be in like super teen dense lines, but I do brave something that's like, I'm like, I can do

567
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,200
an old wooden coaster. There was one I wanted to do at Great America. I didn't get to do. So I'm

568
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,160
going to go for this old wooden coaster. This is called Twister Three Storm Chaser.

569
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,600
Are they on to three? I thought it was two. Oh, you saw a two. No, it's three. We're up to

570
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,360
three. This is kind of a, I mentioned way early in the episode, I think the first coaster this

571
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:01,040
place ever had in the old school form was called Mr. Twister. So it's all like a spiritual heir

572
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,000
to that. Again, I even like type, I don't, I guess it's like, I don't know. It's a wooden coaster

573
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,120
that's especially twisty. I don't know. I'm terrible at this. This is not part of the theme

574
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,920
podcaster job that I like. And someone from BNM is going to, it's coming for your ass.

575
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,120
That's okay. Cause I don't know what that stands for. Sam Pearl. Oh, Bollinger and Maliburn.

576
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,440
Oh no, they're mad at you now too. I've heard that name. I don't think that's how you say it.

577
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:36,880
Maliburn. I don't know. They're coming for your ass too now. Whoever's mad now had to wade through

578
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,680
20 minutes of testosterone discussion at the top of this to get to the point where we talk about

579
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,320
the technical aspects of different roller coasters. And now they're let down so thoroughly. They're

580
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:51,040
shut this podcast off. The person who wants that podcast and it keeps trying, like I feel like

581
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,880
it's going to be that if I will it hard enough, I just want them to say that it goes up to 39 miles

582
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,960
an hour. Why don't they say it? Why don't they read a Wikipedia? The heavies from Zamperla are

583
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:13,760
going to send their goons. So anyways, yeah, it's twister three and I went on a Reddit to see what

584
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,600
the deal with that was. And like a lot of people on paying attention to this kind of thing are like,

585
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't know, this seems like an overextension to even call this a sequel. I don't know. Cause

586
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,840
they didn't like, maybe they, they didn't replace the track. They maybe just took out the parts of

587
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:34,400
the track that were like going to break entirely. But they also did add a, there is a kind of a theme

588
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
to this and I'll give them a little bit in terms, this is not a park where theming seems like the

589
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:46,640
main deal, but this twister three storm chaser, the title implies that this is about storm chasers

590
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:53,440
like in twister or the upcoming twisters. It's like storm tracker guys. And so you're walking

591
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,280
through a roller coaster and it looks like it's the remnants of like that a tornado has just

592
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,880
happened. So they like took a boat or a bike and they wedged it upside down into the wooden slats.

593
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,840
That's good. It's kind of good. It was a little bit good. And there were storm tracker vehicles,

594
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,240
that kind of thing. And then like kind of a, you know, like a little fake facts about, maybe not

595
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,760
fake facts, but facts about like what storm chasing is all about and a soundtrack of like, okay, go on

596
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,360
whatever. Like, okay, we kind of got something here. So there is a little bit of theming.

597
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,240
Then I get up to the top of the stairs and I get stuck for a lot longer than I think. Like I thought

598
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,920
this thing was moving and it's not. And then I finally get up to where I say how many in my party,

599
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:41,280
which is one and the team just goes like, and then just kind of like half-hearted sort of moves her

600
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,800
arm in the direction of just kind of like a general pen where then I'm not directed into a row or

601
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:53,600
anything. It's just a disorganized like, you figure it out. So then I'm there and I'm watching

602
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,920
cars go by. And it's then that I notice, Jason, what you brought up from that video,

603
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,280
there are supports that are just fully shaking every time one of the cars goes by.

604
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,040
Yeah, I think it's, I looked up my YouTube history. I believe the video is called worst

605
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,840
park in America, question mark. And that's by the channel airtime thrills. And they had a very

606
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:24,720
similar experience to what you were experiencing. And they seem very enthusiastic about coasters.

607
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,680
And most of the ones they wanted to go on were closed. I felt so bad.

608
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,600
Yep. Yep. Yeah, I think that's the deal there. And again, that was from 2018. This is not a new

609
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:42,800
thing. Yeah. So I'm watching this thing shake and like, Jesus, I don't know. And then that's when

610
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,880
I start going on the Reddit and like, I'm just looking for any info that will tell me like,

611
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,520
will this ride kill me? Has anything happened here, you know, in the last 20 years even? I mean,

612
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,120
it did somebody get a splinter. I just, I, anything would be nice to know.

613
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,760
Has the roller coaster fallen over ever? Yeah.

614
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,160
They put it back up like six months ago, the whole thing fell over and they had to put it back up.

615
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,960
Yeah. Did it tip all like almost fall around somebody Buster Keaton style.

616
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,400
And then he had to tip it back up himself. And nothing was that crazy. But it's then that I

617
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,960
start going like, what the hell did the audience try to tell us? And I start, and I'm like,

618
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,520
I know people told us something, but I don't remember if it was Twitter DMs or emails. So

619
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:30,320
I'm like searching all of our various media. And then I find an email. I find an email from

620
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:39,520
listener Dylan. Dylan, and this was after I had mentioned my Cosmonita situation. He wrote a nice

621
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,880
email and gave a heads up, but I clearly should have like absorbed the email better before I was

622
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,680
stuck in this line. Okay. So Dylan said, as a fan, I have to warn that Elitch Gardens is awful and

623
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,600
not worth your time and money. Let's see. I mean, a lot of details, but then ride maintenance is

624
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,600
shrugged off to the point that it feels like half the park is closed. It's absolutely filthy.

625
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,840
And the indifference by the teens working there is palpable. Honestly, it's insulting. They are

626
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:12,720
still charging $65 a ticket. No, I think I thank God didn't pay that much. Was there like a Groupon

627
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,920
or something, or you had a Coke can? I don't know. Whatever. I did something. I think they might be

628
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,000
like cutting those prices to get anyone in for any reason. I think there's a discount if you buy

629
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,080
online. There was that. There's often that. That's a good tip for listeners. Do that and look for

630
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,840
those triple A discounts if they exist. I don't think they did for this. So thank you for attempting

631
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:41,040
to warn me, Dylan. Although honestly, wouldn't you rather have an episode about it with crazy

632
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,800
stories than not? That felt to me like he probably would like the episode, but then he was trying to

633
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:54,640
save me the personal struggles. And I wish I had listened more carefully for that reason. Also,

634
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:00,320
he said, and other people who know the area might be thinking this too. However, when it comes to

635
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:07,040
theme parks, I cannot recommend a spot enough just outside Denver called Lakeside Amusement Park.

636
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,480
I didn't get to do this. I think the timing didn't. I was there kind of right as like summer

637
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,240
seasons were opening up. So I didn't get to do Lakeside, but that seems like a charming good.

638
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:26,800
It's like what you think this might be. I think you cannot be one of these parks that's like post

639
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:34,480
corporate ownership because you know Six Flags ran it into the ground and then now it's just

640
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,880
going further and further. It's just spinning on bald tires.

641
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:46,880
Yeah. Sometimes when you see the owned by one company operated by another, it's like,

642
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:56,880
uh-oh. Sure. I'm sure there's exceptions to that rule, but it's like not a good sign necessarily.

643
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,240
What is the vibe like sitting on a bench? Oh, that's a good question. In this place?

644
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:11,760
What is trees? Is foliage? What is going on? What is the Six Flags ask in ways? Definitely Six Flags

645
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:18,880
ask. I think that you could find corners that feel like a park. If you were part of a Three

646
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,840
Ninjas type production and you needed to shoot it from angles where it seems like a charming theme

647
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,960
park, I think that could be done, but you'd have to do a lot of cheating and a lot of we're only

648
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,920
looking this way and not this way or this way and definitely not this way. Yeah. Do they have

649
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:44,160
dipping dots here? I think so. Okay. Good. Yeah. And food. Look, we didn't want to find out the

650
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:50,240
answer to food, quite honestly. Okay. And long story short, we didn't, but I'll start explaining

651
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,040
that. But the vibe is like no vibe. And it's just, you know, it's like it's just playing,

652
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:04,320
you know, the pop hits of 2004. If you want to hear Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend or whatever.

653
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,120
I wouldn't be opposed to hearing it. Did they play any songs by The Fray? Did they?

654
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,560
The Fray's too obscure. That's a deep cut. Yeah. Well, they had a couple of hits. We're talking

655
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:21,680
Black Eyed Peas. We're talking, they might just put on the album. Actually, you don't want to play

656
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:27,600
the album cuts of at least one of those songs, but they put on the collection of radio edits.

657
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, that's exactly. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe there's maybe there's a Mr. Brightside,

658
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,960
maybe. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Book the trip now. I mean, I get we are. Look,

659
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,720
this is me versus you. We're talking about Mike. If you want to be in a place where food is

660
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,360
questionable and Mr. Brightside is playing, which I think you do. I do. Yeah. Village Gardens may be

661
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,880
your ticket. That sounds right. Yeah. Yeah. So anyways, I've now like reading this email

662
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,480
and I'm already in the line and I've put the time in and like, boy, I wish I'd like taken this into

663
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,240
my heart better before. And I'm looking at a track that's shaking. What am I? I don't know. Look,

664
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,800
I don't think it's going to topple over. I really don't. I'm going to give it a go. And hey,

665
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,600
what a way to go out, huh? Yeah. Wow. And then you guys are doing the posthumous episode like,

666
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,960
well, he died doing what he loved, I guess. I don't know. Did he love this? I actually don't

667
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:26,160
think he did like roller coasters and then one killed him. So actually, that's kind of,

668
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,560
and I writes just further proof he shouldn't have ever done roller coasters. So it's kind of,

669
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:37,680
I mean, we're going to do an episode on the haunting of Hill House 99 anyway, because it's

670
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,880
filmed a couple scenes at Islands of Adventure and a roller coaster flies off the track.

671
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,680
And then ironically, Scott was in a roller coaster that flew off the track.

672
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,960
Really excited about to talk about this movie. But first, a few quick words about one of the

673
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,680
hosts death. And now introducing Mr. Morrow to replace Scott as the permanent third host

674
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:09,280
on podcast, the riot. Gee, guys. Sorry to hear about that, guys. Hey, thanks for keeping me in

675
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,200
the loop and, you know, checking in once a month or so if I still wanted to replace Scott. Just,

676
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,640
you know, you gave me a big heads up and I'm glad you did. Sorry about the roller coaster thing,

677
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:27,760
but. So anyways, I get on. I'm just going to do it. I'm going to do it. And then it pulls up

678
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,480
and it stinks. The ride stinks. I mean, like smell wise. It's like, no, it's like burning

679
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,720
rubber. It's not really foul. Like much worse than Autopia. It's right in the Autopia. Yeah.

680
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,240
Yeah, I'd say. But then that's like many cars as opposed to one of two coaster vehicles,

681
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:53,040
the smelliest coaster in America. Yeah. Yeah. At least look, you want like laurels in your theme

682
01:06:53,040 --> 01:07:00,240
park. You know, you want to be able to tout something and they can tout that. So get on it.

683
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,960
What I like is that you got nice views of Denver. I like that you can see mountains this way. You

684
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,000
can see the city this way. And then it's just a very like clackety, you know, it's just, again,

685
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,880
Mike, you might like it. It fucks you up a little bit. Yeah. I like that aspect of it. I don't like

686
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,320
the smell. I don't like the sound of the smell. Not good. Not a good smell. I like to be physically

687
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:29,120
fucked up and not olfactory. Yeah. Fucked up. You don't like to huff. Yeah. Yeah. The theming,

688
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:33,920
I think they kind of lost the theming a little bit in the ride itself in that there was no theming

689
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,920
at all in the ride itself. They truly bailed on that. And I saw the people on this Reddit going

690
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,520
like what they're going to they're going to call it Twister three. What this they replaced a little

691
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,920
bit of track and then like put some theming in that tunnel and that's it. And you call it a sequel.

692
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,400
And I would say to them, no, they didn't do that either. If there was ever like if there were like

693
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,040
loose nails, I think those are gone. Yeah. Still not totally sure. That is a good for parks looking

694
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:08,880
to a little bit of theming. Broken vehicles and just garbage is any ease if you just make it

695
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:15,360
disaster themed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A good call. Although you might confuse it just for

696
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:21,200
being the rest of the park. Yeah. Lots of loose garbage. But if you if your park is overrun with

697
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:27,040
garbage, then take it and work with it. I say I mean, I think so many of these parks could be

698
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:33,440
elevated with just a fresh coat of paint on the main street and a little bit of landscaping.

699
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:41,200
You could really like trick people and justify that like sixty five dollar price tag.

700
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,160
You say that Jason, but I went and this place needs nothing short of an exorcism.

701
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:54,400
I mean, it does help to have your rides open. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That would have added to my

702
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:01,120
guest satisfaction. But now after I do that ride, which was also like, OK, look, I don't know. I

703
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:06,480
went on a roller coaster and it was a fine boy. Was it OK? Well, what was it comparable to ridewise?

704
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,880
Uh, you know, it's like a ghost rider. I don't know. Ghost riders pretty, you know,

705
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,040
ghost rider kind of fucks you up. It fucks you up a lot. Yeah. So probably. Yeah. I don't think

706
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,880
it's like markedly worse than Ghost Rider, even though parts of the tracks ride away.

707
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,560
No, Ghost Rider is like. I don't do that really ever. So it's kind of out of character that I did

708
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,880
this at all and that I got on something that was swaying. Did I tell did I tell the story in the

709
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:32,320
show where my friend who had a pretty decent headache before going on it, I accidentally

710
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,800
allowed us to all go on Ghost Rider. Oh. Her headache was much worse because it rattles like

711
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:44,640
crazy. It's an old wooden coaster. Ghost Rider, I think, has actually been retracted. I believe

712
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,960
it has. And it's pretty good. Like it's intense, but in like the way they want it to be.

713
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:58,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So but it still rattles the hell out of you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not my

714
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,280
favorite genre. I like them for the charm. I like I like just like looking at it. Yeah, of course.

715
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:09,120
But I don't always like going on them. But I was OK. Right. Ghost Rider is the only like usually

716
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,880
if I ride a wooden coaster, I keep my glasses on. Ghost Rider was the first one I ever had to like

717
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,160
hold them on to my head because I was like the glass was going to break in the frames.

718
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,480
Yeah. Well, I mean, I was just worried they were going to fly off as if you were a dad whose son

719
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,120
is playing too loud of rock and roll music. Oh, yeah. The fray turned down.

720
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:39,280
I'm afraid. Anyway, this this does this takes me into what I would call my favorite part of the day

721
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,040
where I'm like strolling back to go find my family again and see what they've gotten up to. And I'm

722
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,440
like, well, let me cover this corner of the park while I'm here. And I start walking up to a ride

723
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,040
where this coaster looks a little fun. It seems like something that's tame enough for me to do.

724
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,960
Don't think it's running. Actually seems eerily quiet around here. And I walk up to Disaster

725
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:07,440
Canyon and it says Ride will open in May 2024. And I say, but that is now is currently. Why are

726
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:13,040
you not open? And nothing else around there is open. There was just a guy like reading on a bench.

727
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,400
I don't wish that to your point, Mike. It's charming enough that I can read a book on a bench.

728
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,600
Well, all this place needs is a coat of paint on that bench. And I think they can charge 65 bucks.

729
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,800
I like this reading on a bench ride. That sounds great.

730
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,800
What's he wearing? Was he was he was he reading like a mystery novel or?

731
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,960
I don't know. Could have been a physics book. OK, might have been some might have been the one

732
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,960
student who was taking the race seriously. Well, that's good. I like to hear that.

733
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,920
So anyways, then I like like I walk into this area and I'm like, am I backstage in the park?

734
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,520
Why didn't they block this off in any way? Then I turn one more corner and realize,

735
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,160
no, this is just now I'm still in the park. It's just oddly industrial. It's just like

736
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:58,320
corrugated metal. And then I go through this weird tunnel. And this I know I'm not supposed

737
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,240
to go into. But I'm like, I got to see because I don't think anybody's going to stop me.

738
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,240
And I keep walking and walking. And by the end of the tunnel, I am in the middle of their stunt

739
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,280
arena and no one has stopped me from being in their stunt arena. It does not seem like there's

740
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:18,800
been a show here in many years. And it's just like a bunch of pigeons. And I, you know, I really,

741
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,880
I think I could have hung out there for a couple of hours if I didn't have a family to get back to.

742
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,840
Well, if you had a good mystery novel with you, you really could have posted up.

743
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,400
Again, it's, you know, actually, in a way, I didn't realize how we,

744
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,320
Lich Gardens were getting back to this kind of like what Walt want. It's like a place,

745
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,640
you know, sure, there's roller coasters, but, you know, sure, we could either run our roller

746
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:46,000
coasters or we could have, you know, just a nice, simple 2000 seat stunt arena that just you can

747
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,400
sit in and read, you know, seven to 10 chapters. Yeah. Hercule Poirot. It's almost like Hercule

748
01:12:52,400 --> 01:13:00,080
Poirot is in the park. He's there with you. Who is that? It's the character that it's an Agatha

749
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,840
Christie's like Belgian detective character that Kenneth Branagh keeps making the movies.

750
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,080
That's that character's name? Yeah. What's the character? Say it again. Hercule Poirot.

751
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:18,480
Hercule Poirot? Poirot. Poirot. Sorry, sorry. Hercule? Hercule? Yeah, it's strange. It's like

752
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,960
Hercules, but you stop before the end. It's shortening if you're really familiar with

753
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,640
Hercules. I think Peter Ustinov played him at some point. Albert Finney played him, I think.

754
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,320
So he's like a Joker character. He's very much a Joker character. Yeah. I'm just saying it's

755
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,040
a famous role that a lot of different famous actors have played. Yeah. Presumably the source

756
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,000
material for whatever stunt show was in there before. I would think, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We got

757
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,960
Hercule. We got the Hercule live. Actually, what was in the stunt arena was, get ready, Mike,

758
01:13:50,960 --> 01:14:02,080
a Batman Forever stunt show. This Batman Forever stunt show ran from 1999. Many years after the

759
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:08,560
film. That is two years after Batman and Robin. Right. We have turned it over entirely

760
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:15,840
and then it ran until 2006 when they lost the Six Flags and therefore the Warner license in general.

761
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,800
So this thing, it didn't even start. I've watched this video before. Of the. Of the

762
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,280
Batman Forever stunt show. It was at a number of Six Flags. Yeah, there was a water one too,

763
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:31,920
which was not this. Yes. Yeah. I think they got it after a different Six Flags closed it. They're

764
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,920
like, well, this is out of date now because it is Batman and Robin and we need something with Mr.

765
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,840
Freeze. Right. What do we do with the joke with the Riddler in Two-Face costumes? I don't know,

766
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,800
ship it down to Denver piece of crap. We got all these, you know, tanks of propane and like

767
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:54,000
fire starting effects. Yeah, send it to Denver. Either they'll use it in the show or the teens can,

768
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,160
you know, I don't know, go buck wild with them. Or use it to just cook some hot dogs.

769
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,480
It probably is how they do the thing around here. Also that it ran until 2006, which means we are

770
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:13,520
now with the full crossover has occurred into the Nolan era straddles the by the time it starts,

771
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:19,920
the Schumacher iteration is canceled. Right. And then this runs all the way through a sea change,

772
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,800
not only in the Batman franchise, but in comic book movies in general. Yeah. And we're still just like,

773
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,840
riddle me this. The dark, it went into the dark ages is what I call it.

774
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:37,680
The realism era, the dark ages. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, the meridian Lissera. Right. So

775
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,880
I finally end up back with the family. My son has been held over by ice cream,

776
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,240
but even that is an ordeal. If you can believe it, like I will take a single scoop in a cup. Nah.

777
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,760
You know what? Well, we only do two or three and it's cones. We can only do cones.

778
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,680
So you don't have any situation where I can like scoop the ice cream being that I'm with a child.

779
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:05,280
I can't, there's no, you don't have a cup. No. And then some, and then another guy's like, yo,

780
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,880
we got bowls bowl. That sounds good. All right. Great. I will, then I will take two scoops in a

781
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,200
bowl. Nah. Huh? What do you mean? No, no, it was just Sunday's only the bowls are for Sunday.

782
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:23,040
The bowls are for Sunday's only we lit. Well, wouldn't okay. The main purpose of a bowl in a

783
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:29,600
Sunday is to hold ice cream, right? So transitive properties imply that a different kind of ice

784
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,480
actually it's doing less bowl work. There is, it's less likely that the bowl will fall. I

785
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,320
don't know if we're talking about, you know, uh, edible bowl or not. Right. But like in terms of

786
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,120
structural soundness, not having to deal with fudge and cherry, the, this bowl is probably more

787
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,840
primes to be used for two regular scoops of ice cream. So therefore can I please. Nah.

788
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,120
Well, I don't know. So they got a cone and I ended up eating most of it and nine dollars.

789
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,320
And this again, this is where this occurred to me definitely when I, when I actually went to

790
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,680
magic mountain to try to do that justice league ride and then not do it where I met

791
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:12,240
bug main buzz buzz. And we parked in the, uh, next to a five below it so that we could carpool.

792
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:17,680
And I was like, the five blow parking lot is a better environment than what I am paying an

793
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:23,680
up chart. Like if I'm paying for a gate that implies that's like a country club situation.

794
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:30,080
Is it not? I, but the main expense is that I am behind this gate behind which things will be

795
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:38,560
ornate and landscaped and higher quality. But no, I have paid for an incredible downgrade

796
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:45,840
from a, what a Baskin Robbins a mile away could offer me. It's so crazy. Why does every part of

797
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:53,280
these places have to be insane? Um, so then like, okay, it is clear, like we're there.

798
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,640
Everybody's itching to get out of here. And I'm like, I got to try this Meow Wolf thing out.

799
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,680
I must bring this back to, I must bring it back. A robust collide escape trip report to our

800
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:09,760
audience. Uh, and my wife says, okay, fine. We will, we will do the carousel that seems comfortable

801
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,200
with carousels. We can do it. All right. So great tip over. Uh, no, sure. Well, everything that

802
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:20,160
we've taught us so far has taught us that everything on the carousel will be fine. So

803
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:26,400
here we go. Uh, I go off and do the Meow Wolf ride. It is now open. I get on it and I do it.

804
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,880
I don't know that I have two minutes of material. Whoa, really? It's fine. It's fine. But it's like,

805
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,280
I don't, if anything, because we've talked about how it's cool that like, you know,

806
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,800
artists get to put their stamp on it and this wasn't just like cranked out in a corporate way,

807
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,720
like people physically made these robots that lean towards you and these cool like intersecting

808
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,920
invite, whatever. And all it does is make me feel bad. Like one of them might hear this

809
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,560
and I don't want to say that none of them did a bad job. It's just like, ultimately I think the

810
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,280
idea is fault. You could, you still just feel like it's this, it's a janky ghost blasters thing

811
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,880
and they painted cool colors on it. I like that it's like outrun. I like that it's those like

812
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:15,360
80s retro future grid hills. But even I don't, I made the show Moonbeam City and I'm still over.

813
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:22,720
That's not enough for me to, that's not going to win me over. All right. Yeah. I like Purple Grid,

814
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,480
but it's still like, I don't know, man. It's an interesting psychedelic, like

815
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:35,680
surreal, kind of not quite clear what it, I watched a few ride throughs and it's like,

816
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,080
yeah, no plot. It's more about vibes. I don't know. It's kind of a shooter ride,

817
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,800
but you're not really shooting. This is what you were saying. You shoot, but there's no score.

818
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,160
And I looked it up in the literature. They justify it as like, well, those are the cosmic

819
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:57,040
thrombulators and it's not about a weapon. It's like, okay, well you didn't convey any of that

820
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,960
in the experience itself. It just felt like the ride vehicles have guns. You want to keep the

821
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,640
guns or not? Let's keep the guns. And then there was nothing. I don't, I mean, it's better than,

822
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,480
I'm sure it's better than what was there before. I think you're going to get the Meow Wolf experience

823
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,520
much more so if you go to the actual things. I did not make it to Convergence Station,

824
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,400
so I don't know. It's probably, I don't know. I wish I was, again, I'm a little beaten down though.

825
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,600
Sure. You wouldn't pay $9 for ice cream. Yeah, yes. The vibes are not good, so I'm just not,

826
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,240
and it didn't do anything wrong, didn't do anything wrong, but I would say no one listening should

827
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:43,440
make a trip just to see the Meow Wolf, unless you are a just Meow Wolf absolute complete super fan.

828
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:51,280
Well, what you would pay to get in this park will get you into the Denver Meow Wolf installation,

829
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,320
and that's going to be much more. I texted you the first night you were there, and I was like,

830
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:01,360
did you know there's a full Meow Wolf there? I did, and I ultimately, I think I would have had to

831
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,120
split off from the fam to do it. I think dark spaces are going to freak my son out. So,

832
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:16,080
in that way that closer to your daughter's age, Mike, maybe more oblivious to things. Maybe not

833
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:21,200
scared because you don't know to be scared. He's a little bit north of four now, so he's sensitive

834
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,040
to things, and I'm saying all this because this factors into where this story is going next.

835
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:30,400
So, I complete this ride, and it's fine, but I've done it, and I'm like, I don't know, well,

836
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:36,240
I don't know if it's a lot to talk about for the show, really, but all right, I'll go through the

837
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,600
carousel, and we'll see what's up with them, and we'll start making our way out of here. Then I get

838
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,760
a phone call, and I'm like, well, this means that the heat is on. You're close to done,

839
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:50,000
we probably want to go. Instead, the phone call immediately has a tense error, a very tense error,

840
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,040
and the call is like, hi, we're fine, but you need to get to the gate right now. Something happened.

841
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:02,480
There is an air of urgency. This is not what I expected to be getting. Luckily, I'm not too far.

842
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:09,120
Okay, okay, I'll be right there. I get to the stroller return, and the stroller is being

843
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,400
returned as fast as possible. I can't get a story out of either of them because Aaron is shaken,

844
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,720
and my son is screaming, bloody murder. It is so bad that I'm like, I'm going to have to wait a

845
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:27,040
little bit to find out what even happened here, and Aaron says, really quick, if you want to know,

846
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,640
go look. You'll see the aftermath of it, and I saw the aftermath of it, and now what I'm going to do

847
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:38,800
is, I don't know, I can't recall this happening on the show. I think I have to issue a content

848
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:47,120
sensitivity warning. Oh, no. Oh, my God. It's not so crazy, but if you don't want to hear about

849
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:54,160
harm occurring to somebody, then maybe stop listening here for a little bit.

850
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,120
But you guys don't get to go anywhere. No, we're stuck in this room with you.

851
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:05,600
You're stuck. Now, I will get into, all right, content warning has been issued.

852
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:14,240
Um, so they are on the carousel, and things are going fine. It is a normal carousel ride

853
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:21,040
that is proceeding, and Aaron is just kind of looking off, and because she's looking in the

854
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:28,720
distance, she does not know what has caused the two jarringly loud thumps, like really, really loud,

855
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,320
to where, like, just from that sound, there's a problem. And her first thought is, like,

856
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,400
did this thing run over an animal? Did something get under the thing? She doesn't know,

857
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:51,600
and she starts putting the pieces together. And what it was, was that a woman fainted,

858
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:59,760
fell off the horse next to the one that my son was, yeah, she is on a carousel horse.

859
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:08,480
She fainted, fell off the horse that was right next to my son's horse. The second thump was her

860
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:17,200
hitting the ground. Oh, my God. The first thump was her hitting her head on my son's horse. Oh,

861
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:27,840
God. On the way down. She is now lying motionless under my son's horse. Oh, God. Gives me no

862
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,760
pleasure to tell this story, but I tell it because, boy, has the air been bad this whole time.

863
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:39,360
Imagine that you are not having a good time at a park in general, and then this happens,

864
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:48,160
the craziest thing I have ever witnessed. Aaron has to yell, stop the ride, call 911. She starts

865
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:54,240
that. He just doesn't even know what he's looking at. Nobody knows what they're looking at, and I

866
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:00,640
still don't know. I don't know where this situation was left. I don't know what. I know that

867
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:06,400
paramedics had arrived pretty quickly after this happened. This is the scene that I encounter.

868
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,880
Once I put all this together, it's like, go, go, go as fast as we can possibly get out of here,

869
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:20,000
and everybody is rattled. It's really crazy. I will not, I don't think this was the park's fault.

870
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,360
I can't really count this against the park. I can't put it on the list of Eulich Garden sucks

871
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:31,680
because of this, except maybe that then we were putting it all together after,

872
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:40,720
and my son said to Aaron, Mommy, buckle me in, and she went to do it, and there was no strap.

873
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:47,840
There's no straps on these horses. Again, Aaron brought up that you will sometimes go on carousels

874
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:53,440
that don't have straps. This is not so unheard of. Yeah, adults generally don't have to strap in.

875
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,840
Oh, that's the deal. And kids, there will be a strap for kids generally, I believe.

876
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:05,280
Okay. Yes, we were once on the carousel at California Adventure. I started to strap in,

877
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:13,360
and I feel like Mike went, you don't have to do that. That's cute. That is, yes, that is,

878
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,440
I do remember that now. It's part of it. I actually like it. It's like a good leather strap,

879
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,960
that's like putting on a nice old belt. Yeah, you put a little diaper on, whatever.

880
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,360
A little thong-ish diaper for your... Sure. It's absolutely the same as that. Putting a strap on

881
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:33,600
on a carousel is the same as putting on a diaper just for the hell of it. Yeah, I think so. Sometimes

882
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,920
you got it. You're a lie. We all remember. We have diaper memories. Why not put one on now?

883
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,640
Anyways, that is where we... So it's like, it doesn't need to have the buckles, and maybe they

884
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:49,280
aren't meant for adults. Might have done something. I don't know. I can't really blame the park for

885
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:57,040
this, but holy shit. Oh my God. That happened. And I really, I do not know where this situation

886
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:07,440
was left, but just a minute. So basically now, what started as three hours... Let's see if we

887
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,320
can fit our experience into three hours. We are at the 90-minute mark, and we are getting the fuck

888
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,760
out of here as fast as we can. Wow, this is all 90 minutes. That all happened in 90 minutes.

889
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,680
That's a lot of 90 minutes. Wow. Yeah, yeah. Even with a lion where I got stuck for a little while,

890
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,560
but there was no desire to stay longer, even before this happened. I don't want to go into...

891
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,960
I know that's just in a disturbing detail, and I take no pleasure in telling you, but what are the

892
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,280
odds? If that happened to you on the ride, you'd be freaked out. Let alone, it is his horse of all

893
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:41,280
the places. If we had... You know what? If they'd given Aaron the fucking bowl, if there hadn't been

894
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,720
a butcher to run around with the bowl, she would have arrived there later or at a different time,

895
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:53,360
and then maybe not been at the exact spot for a woman to hit the horse. This is so crazy. So

896
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,640
anyways, we are driving out and truly rattled, and now it's like, do we just go to the airport

897
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:06,320
insanely early? What else do we do? We just sit around the airport, and then on the way to the

898
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:11,440
airport, we realize, wait a minute, what did we do on the way from the airport previously?

899
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,440
Oh, wow. Again, he's upset, and she's back in the back seat with him holding his hand,

900
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,720
talking him through everything, and then it's been silent for five minutes, and then I'm like,

901
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:29,760
hey buddy, you want to go climb on the boats and the ATVs at Bass Pro Shops? Yeah! We pull up,

902
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:36,400
we go back, they run around on boats, we're romping on boats, we're having a wonderful time.

903
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:41,440
Smart. He's playing through the scenario that happened. We are acting it out. Oh no,

904
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,560
something happened to the lady. Oh good, the doctor is here, and the doctor is going to save

905
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:53,040
everything, and we're like, oh sure, probably, fingers crossed, hope so. But the point is,

906
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:59,360
after a really janky experience, Bass Pro Shops, which is brand new to me,

907
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:04,400
this is new this year, I've been newly high on this, we've just done the episode,

908
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:10,960
Bass Pro Shops, not only do I enjoy it in general, it was there for us during a true crisis,

909
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,800
it saved the day. I went back, did a little bit more shooting, felt newly confident from a great

910
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:24,640
shooting experience at Casa Bonita. Now I'm like, bless this organization, bless them and everything

911
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:30,000
they spend money on and that their founder spends money on. Another round of hats for everyone.

912
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,000
Everybody in the store, all the animals too, put them on top of the books,

913
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,640
put them on top of the squirrels, it'll be great. Whoa. So that's that, Bass Pro Shops saved the day,

914
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:51,120
unquestionably a vastly better themed experience to the city of Denver than Elitch Gardens,

915
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:57,120
which now faces the question of where do we relocate the park, what do we do with Elitch

916
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:03,040
Gardens, where does it move, and can I suggest, I don't know, maybe in hell? Maybe Elitch Gardens

917
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:09,680
can be rebuilt in the seventh circle of hell. You know, I just searched the name under news,

918
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:18,320
Google News, and the first story, Elitch Gardens won't move from downtown Denver this year,

919
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:26,160
so it's hiring 1,500 workers. Doesn't seem like they're all hired yet or they're not properly

920
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:33,120
allocated. Yes, yeah, yeah. Well, I hope that one of the things they're looking for is over 16

921
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:40,480
in that way. Just might be not to say that an under 16 person is not capable. I just know I saw

922
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:47,360
a park that was all 16 year olds assisting 12 year olds, and it sure seemed like bedlam to me.

923
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:54,160
So let's try to up the age there, and let's get through these last summers, and then you know what,

924
01:30:54,160 --> 01:31:00,720
if Elitch Gardens, maybe it's not meant to be. Maybe it's a lot of trouble to rebuild a theme park,

925
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:07,040
you know? That's going to take a while. Couldn't that money go to anything else? How about put

926
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:13,440
that money into Casa Bonita? Expand it. Just let it take over the dentist next door. Let's double

927
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:19,440
the size of Casa Bonita, and maybe we let Elitch Gardens live in our memories. I know it'll live

928
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,960
in mine forever. Oh my God. I don't even know what to say. Yeah. Yeah, how about that? I'm sorry.

929
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,480
How bummed out is everybody? I'm pretty bummed out. That's a crazy one. I can feel my tea lowering

930
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,920
even as we talk about it. Well, that's because you're a sensitive person, and you heard about

931
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:45,520
a bad thing that happened, and you're empathetic, and you're not a raging tea holic of the past. You

932
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,160
can't turn it off. You can dial that tea down when you know that there's people in need.

933
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:55,680
That's true. Yeah, very true. I didn't think about how I can control my own tea. That might

934
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:01,280
be a good Tony Robbins style thing. You could go on a speaking tour where you teach young men,

935
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:07,120
Jordan Peterson style, to control your tea. You actually have power over your own tea. You don't

936
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:15,680
know that. I don't know if I want to out the person who went to see Jordan Peterson at the Forum.

937
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:23,120
Seems like a barn burner of a show. Seems like, boy, a hell of a time. Forum really came back when

938
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:28,160
Prince did a bunch of nights, and that really lit it up. It sounds like Jordan Peterson took it to

939
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:36,640
the next level. Yeah, you will believe a man can cry when he's just going through the Disney Plus

940
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:42,720
app and just every new- Cursing out different characters by name. National Geographic,

941
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:50,240
it's now partially owned by Disney. I know that was one of his gripes, but okay. Could be.

942
01:32:51,760 --> 01:33:01,760
Fine publication ruined by the owners of the Acolyte. Yeah, well, anyways, that's that.

943
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:08,800
Dylan, I should have listened harder. Yeah, he warned you. He really tried, not even knowing.

944
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,520
The fact that multiple people tried to warn me, not even knowing. It's almost like they didn't.

945
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,400
Maybe somebody didn't. And they were like, it'll creep them out if I said that I saw a vision

946
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:25,760
of an event happening. That's too creepy for me, a listener, to say that I foretold this. Like

947
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:32,960
I'm Adam Webb, a carousel crisis, but I'm not going to leave that out of the email. I'm just

948
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,440
going to say, like, I think the price is a little high. But anyway, thanks for trying to help.

949
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:44,320
And thanks to you guys for hearing out these multiple trip reports. Ultimately, I had fun.

950
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,000
Ultimately, we all survived podcasts, The Ride, The Second Gate. If you want to dig even deeper,

951
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,560
join us on our VIP Patreon tier club three, where you get one more bonus episode every month and our

952
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,080
regular episodes ad free. And you vote on those episodes and what we're supposed to do in them.

953
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:08,080
We are banning voting us into going back to Elitch Gardens. This will never be put in a poll.

954
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,360
That's yeah, we can vote on that, remember, because we can amend different club three rules.

955
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:20,320
So yeah, we'll vote on that off, Mike. Yeah, yeah, but don't waste your time. Don't throw it in there.
