00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Hey, this is a little Patreon bonus.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,840
We're finalizing the brackets for the fake smell final four.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,360
And I wanted to pose a question that I thought might be funny enough for the episode, but

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,920
and we'll see, maybe this is nothing.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
Genuine question.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,080
Are we sure there was a fart smell in Shrek 4D?

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,560
I'm not sure that there is one because I don't remember, but it feels like...

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
We have a category at this point that is fart versus fart.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,640
And I'm not totally sure that there was a fart.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,680
He definitely farts in the movie.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes. But I'm Googling it and I'm not finding a lot.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,160
But Jason, I think this is your suggestion, so you might know better.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah, I could have Mandela affected myself.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,680
I think maybe if anything, there was like a spray.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,480
You mean, wait a minute, maybe they spray air jet instead of a smell.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember a fart smell on it.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,280
It feels right.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,080
It does. And I really like our category of fart versus fart.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,960
But there's maybe a logistical error here.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,280
And also, if you think about I believe now currently the suggestion

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,840
and I hate to pick this apart because I really like that we have fart versus fart.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,280
Right. But I also believe that fart in Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem,

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,520
is a fart gun that once fired is actually the smell of banana.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,360
I believe you're correct. Yeah.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,280
So it might be incorrect to say I think there may be a fallacy in both farts.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Well, but you could call it a banana fart, I guess.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,880
But it doesn't. You're right. A pure fart maybe doesn't exist.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,560
The closest thing is honestly like skunk, I think, if we're talking pure smell

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,120
from figment. Yeah. Which is I think is in there.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
I think maybe what I may be thinking is that

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,400
what is currently listed in the pre list as Despicable Me

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,840
fart should maybe become

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,560
classified as banana and go up against King Kong's banana breath.

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
Oh, that's good. Yeah, let's do that.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
Let's start with that. Yeah. OK.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
That might be it.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,320
Maybe this is this is just a little like five minute fragment.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
Is there anything else we want to hash out before we get to the list?

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,600
We can recap some of this on the episode, but yeah.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Should we just a little peek behind the curtain?

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,560
Hmm. Good question.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
I hate that we it makes me upset that there potentially was not an actual fart.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,760
Yeah. On any. And if we're wrong, tell us.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh, my God. For wrong. It's over.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,760
And if there is a part that we're unaware of.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah. Yeah. Huh.

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,760
So I think should we dock points from Jason already for this for

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,840
we're competing now, we're competing within the there's ways we can win.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,880
Well, fake smell final four. I guess you're right.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
That's true. We're not really.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
I mean, I don't mind it.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
I just now we have a really more complicated.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,240
Jason's vote counts 75 percent and ours counts 100.

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Well, this is some this is gerrymandering.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,960
This is some Iowa cockatoo.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,760
I don't want to do that. Yeah.

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Oh, you were at that birthday party, Mike,

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
which birthday party of the app developers.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,320
Oh, yeah. I know you were there with the other scumbag.

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,640
Shadow. But that's just but he might knew Tommy Vitor.

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,080
You know, you got to.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
I am on the website.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,520
Your friends. I am listed on the website.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,560
I sit on a couple boards. OK.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
So don't fucking get mad at me.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Sit on some boards. I'm on like seven boards.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,520
It doesn't take up much time. I understand.

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
It's fun to be on the board. It's fun.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,360
I get 50 grand a month from each board.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,480
Just for having my name be on it.

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Does the know, guys, is the fake smell

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,200
final for voting app working for everybody is is shade working for everyone?

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Yeah. Let us know.

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
I would be shocked if it's not.

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,520
I sit on the board of that, too.

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,200
And we tested it once.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,160
So I think it'll be fine.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm you see, I'm on the I'm on the board of of glint,

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,360
which is really the opposite.

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm on the board.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,000
A is like a shadow on glint is like if there's too much sun.

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Yeah, we want to be fully exposed.

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,080
We want everyone to know we don't want any shadow type problems.

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
We want everyone to be in the glint.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,840
I'm on the board of glare,

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
hmm, which is one where it's sort of like over.

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,640
You want like a big blast of it, whatever we're making.

88
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,920
You want a blast of it in your face.

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm not concerned that glint and glare can't exist in the same marketplace.

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,600
And you got you guys are prelaunch, right?

91
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Because we're like we're in Blanche prep.

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Yeah, we're prelaunch right now.

93
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
Honestly, I don't know what's happening because I just sit on the board.

94
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm not one of the developers.

95
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,080
No, I don't. I'm not making the app.

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
God, no, I don't know anything about making apps.

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,120
Yeah. So I do that.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,600
And we're working on a couple of things.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,560
We're working on an app where you there's different birds

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,480
and then they fly up and down and then they get little like peanuts and stuff.

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,920
And then you get points suspiciously like Flappy Bird.

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,360
Hmm. Does it? OK.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,320
No, it's it's Flapp Flapping Bird.

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,440
It's totally Flapping Bird. Yeah. Yeah.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
All right. Well, we can start out the rest of this off, Mike.

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,720
I just wanted to loop you guys in on the on the decision

107
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,960
and let us know if you have a problem with it. Yeah.

108
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,200
All right. Thanks. Bye.
