1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,820
Warning, the following podcasts may contain live notes, large steel orders, an inside reference

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,740
made canon, and just the right amount of bananas to be funny.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,620
All this plus Evan Susser and Van Robichaud return to talk about their work developing

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:29,060
Universal Studios' new ride, Illumination's VillainCon Minion Blast.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:52,600
On today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,860
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks where today we finally interrogate

9
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,500
the bastards who dared replace Shrek 4D.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,180
I'm Scott Gardner, barely keeping it together in front of these fools, but at least we're

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,660
here, we're here with a purpose for them.

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,820
Mike Carlson, what do you think?

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,620
I'm here, I'm clenching my fists, just I want to hit somebody.

14
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,660
We trapped them, we've been all nice leading up to this, but now we get to let it all out.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,660
Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,660
I can't even look at them.

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,260
Even though I very much enjoyed this new attraction.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,260
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,340
An American classic went away for it.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,980
I guess I'll give an actual introduction.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,020
We can go backwards and make you guys villains again if you want.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,780
But genuinely, been looking forward to this episode for a long time.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,780
You know what?

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,180
I feel like a lot of guests on this show, people we have on the show are funny friends,

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,820
people from the world of comedy, but I think there's a kind of guest we'd like to have

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,060
more which is the people who actually work on the attractions who put these things together.

27
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,740
And today, these guest categories have finally merged and we're so excited to have you guys

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,740
together.

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,980
They wrote for Brooklyn Nine-Nine, they wrote the feature film Fist Fight, and most importantly

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,660
today, writers of Illumination's villain con minion blast, Evan Susser and Van Roba show.

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,660
Hello, folks.

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Hey, how's it going?

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,660
Good to be here.

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,660
It's all smooth since you became a quiet storm show.

35
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,260
We're in a theme park celebrities these days.

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,700
You gotta regulate the energy.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,180
I was a little nervous you guys would be honest about the Shrek 4D of it all, but I do want

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,180
to say I consider this all delayed revenge against Shrek 4D for taking out Alfred Hitchcock.

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,180
Amen, bro.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,420
So you as a child, or I don't know when it happened, a teen, I forget when the change

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
occurred.

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,940
You were like waiting, somebody needs to take a shot and that's gotta be me.

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
But anyway, go on.

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Okay, sure.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,540
I know we didn't just talk about it.

46
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,020
That was a last year thing, right?

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,660
So I don't know the timeline.

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,540
Well congratulations, you slayed the beast.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,860
The Alfred Hitchcock experience had a great rear window section where they had little

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
screens.

51
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Yes.

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,540
You could look through binoculars.

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,860
From across the way, the optimal place to do it was raised up on the second level.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm a big fan of that, very formative in my mind.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,700
Like a perv simulation where you could be a pervert like Alfred was.

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,720
I was a very excited seven or eight year old trying to find the murderer and I'm like that's

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,780
just a lady undressing, where is the crime?

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,500
I've gotta keep sweeping.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,780
You were upset.

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,700
No interest in that.

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,140
I was just gonna say it's exciting to be here in all the time that we were working on the

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,740
ride, thinking about how is it going to be enjoyed by the podcast The Ride Crew?

63
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,420
All of the things that you guys discuss each week.

64
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,140
I was imagining waking up at night saying, oh no, what are they gonna say?

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,140
How are they gonna say, how are they gonna bless it up?

66
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,700
Are we blessing it up how they wanted it to be blessed up?

67
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,540
Do they want to burn it to the ground for insurance money, a premise they haven't said

68
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,540
in many years?

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,420
No seriously, I think that it was a true thrill and it's exciting to be talking about it with

70
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
you guys.

71
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Yeah, jeez.

72
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,740
I've really been looking forward to it for a long time, to finally triangulate all this

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,700
and to get down there and experience it.

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,700
We weren't immediately on the ball, but this hasn't been open for too long.

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
This opened in August.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,380
We did a soft opening in August and then it's been open now for a few months.

77
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,540
It's great, you guys are pretty good, pretty on the ball as far as getting down there,

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,660
organizing a whole Orlando trip just to do it.

79
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,980
I myself have not been since it's open.

80
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,140
I was there pre-open when it was up and running, but not open to the public yet.

81
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,780
But I've never ridden it with a live audience or anything like that.

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,060
So you guys are ahead of me.

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,620
I think they're loving it.

84
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,140
I sensed good vibes.

85
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,220
No one was revolting or putting their guns down and looking at their phone.

86
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,860
I felt a lot of engagement.

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,460
Yeah, I mean there's so much to ask you guys about.

88
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,700
I don't like, should we just go back to the beginning, which I guess in this case is that

89
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,500
you've been, you've done stuff with illumination for a long time now.

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,100
So you've been in their world and in Minion World specifically.

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Was that the beginning?

92
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,300
I know there's been shorts, there's been ads, I forget your entire Union filmography.

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,100
Our illumination experience has started with working on a Minions short called Minions

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Scouts.

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,300
It's available on Netflix under the Minions and More Volume 1 compilation.

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,500
Which weirdly has Shrek 4D on it too, just to pad it out.

97
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,060
It's one of the and mores, sure.

98
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,420
And then we did some commercials for them featuring the Minions.

99
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:18,300
We worked on an aborted Super Bowl halftime commercial for Minions 2, The Rise of Gru,

100
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,220
that did not come to fruition.

101
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,860
No fault of ours, I hope.

102
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,540
And then we got an email about, it was kind of not specific, and said, oh they have people

103
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,660
at illumination have another thing, would you be interested in talking?

104
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,420
And assuming, oh maybe it's another short, maybe it's a commercial, didn't know.

105
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,300
And then we heard Theme Park Ride and our eyes lit up because it seemed exciting.

106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,700
And initially, Van, maybe you will, my kind of understanding was that we were being brought

107
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,860
on specifically just to do kind of the pre-show video that you would watch.

108
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,180
And through kind of elbowing our way in, we managed to ride this thing all the way through

109
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:14,100
and become a part of both the entire ride and also the Minion Cafe and the whole thing.

110
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,460
Which was a really fun experience as far as people who grew up going to Theme Parks.

111
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,340
Yeah, both big fans, not even just people we've had on the show because we know you.

112
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,900
You're both a big theme park people and Van like an old Epcot head, I feel.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,420
And universal, clearly.

114
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,460
No, yeah, I jumped at the opportunity.

115
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,780
Look, I'm going to back up a little bit just to give the real behind the scenes and tell

116
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,660
just the shortest version of the real story, so to speak.

117
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Oh wow.

118
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Evan's lies.

119
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,980
Evan and I, we've been a long time writing team, but a few years ago, we started to have

120
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,360
interests that diverged a little bit and we actually decided that we were going to go

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,100
our separate ways and start working on projects separately.

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,060
And we sent out an email to a lot of our contacts and people we'd been working with on projects

123
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,060
to explain this all to them, explain it was very amicable and that there were a few things

124
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,300
we're going to still work on together.

125
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,900
But moving forward, you kind of got to pick one or the other sort of a situation.

126
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,060
And the next day, one of the people we sent that email to was a person from Illumination

127
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,100
who emailed back about this project and very clearly had not read the emails from us saying

128
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
we were no longer working together.

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Just a slight correction.

130
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,460
I don't think it was an email back, but it was an email basically sent the next day to

131
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,020
us, seemingly maybe inspired by the email, but clearly not read.

132
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,980
Inspired by seeing your names in an inbox.

133
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,780
And so we looked at each other and at the time it was, I think, proposed as like an

134
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
eight week job.

135
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,140
So then even before having the initial phone call, we had a discussion of like, well.

136
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,420
They were being very mysterious about what it even was.

137
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,900
And we were, and in the past we'd had good experiences.

138
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,180
And we said, ah, you know what, why not?

139
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,900
And also just to kind of, I think, prove to ourselves that it was amicable and that we

140
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
could get along.

141
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,260
We were like, why don't we just, you know, why not?

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,660
I believe the phrasing was one last heist.

143
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Right.

144
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Exactly.

145
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,540
And then we said, sure, let's let's have the initial thing.

146
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,500
And then when it was a theme park route and then so, yes, it extended in a very funny.

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,180
And so now we've been working together on theme park rides and illumination projects

148
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,540
for three and a half years.

149
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,580
Oh my God.

150
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
So your day.

151
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,020
So your breakup lasted for less than a day.

152
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Yeah, pretty much.

153
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
Wow.

154
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Wow.

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,620
We are, we are a hybrid team now and we do do solo work as well, which is actually a

156
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,700
difficult situation to get yourself into.

157
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,860
You really can only do it by accident.

158
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Yes.

159
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,940
So any themed entertainment, it's, it's come to your duo.

160
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,100
I think we're pretty locked in for real.

161
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
You know what?

162
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I don't know.

163
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I don't even want to commit to that.

164
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
You know, I think that's that.

165
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I think that's really just how it comes.

166
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,620
I think Van really impressed some of the people at Universal.

167
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:07,700
No, but I, it was a very funny way to, to come into the project.

168
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I'll say that.

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah.

170
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Wow.

171
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Okay.

172
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,420
You immediately and then, and then enter a mysterious foggy world.

173
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
You don't know what you're dealing with.

174
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,220
You don't know what your deal is on the project.

175
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Yeah.

176
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
Yeah.

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,700
And then, okay, so it's eight weeks initially and you think you're doing pre-show and what

178
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,380
do you know at that point?

179
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,980
Is Ride Premise established?

180
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,340
So at that point, I think that they had come in and from like the highest level, there

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,820
had been some agreement as far as what the attraction would be.

182
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,500
I think the, Van, maybe you remember some of these details better.

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,740
The idea, I think it was already that it was going to be VillainCon, that it was going

184
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,060
to be a convention and that you would be competing to join the Vicious Six, which all remained.

185
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,460
But beyond that, there was a lot of stuff that was not locked in.

186
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,140
Like the number of physical rooms that would be able to be spaces in the ride had been

187
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,140
locked down.

188
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,140
Basically the track layout.

189
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Okay.

190
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Okay.

191
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Okay.

192
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,180
So it was still a bit of a mess, but then exactly what was happening in the specific

193
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,340
rooms that you would move through, that was still up in the air.

194
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,100
Which sort of characters were the character who was the primary character within that

195
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,060
space was somewhat locked in, but still flexible.

196
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,740
Like the idea of like it's roughly this amount, because you're dealing with the Vicious Six,

197
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,300
which is like a villain super group that comes from, that's from Minions 2, correct?

198
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Yes.

199
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,620
And maybe there's the vague notion of like each one of them has a space, but you don't

200
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,020
know that breakdown or order.

201
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,940
Which also at the time, Minions 2 Rise of Gru had not come out yet.

202
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,860
So we saw the movie in advance, which also sometimes made this a little tricky because

203
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,700
understandably, you know, Illumination, these movies are very valuable.

204
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,780
And so they would occasionally give us like two hour windows where we could watch the

205
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,640
movie and then we would have to like frantically write notes because the idea is that you want

206
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,000
to be referencing things that these characters are doing.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Understand the characters, be able to write in their voice, but like had only been given

208
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,560
access to the movie one time for two hours and couldn't go back and reference anything.

209
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
And how rough of a state also.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
No, it was pretty.

211
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,440
It was a delayed because of the pandemic movie.

212
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,800
So I think it was, I think every time we saw it had been finished, but it was being.

213
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,480
Oh, but you couldn't scrub back and forth.

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
No, right.

215
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Exactly.

216
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
But was it remote?

217
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
You were watching it remotely?

218
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,920
But with the sort of like thrown together during the pandemic to remotely screen things,

219
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,680
barely functional systems, everyone in Hollywood ran off.

220
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh, we did a similar thing.

221
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,000
We did a similar thing when we watched Jay and Silent Bob's reboot during the pandemic.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Equally.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Similar box office.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,480
We, you mean I kind of avoided that particular zoom in.

226
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Scott popped in for a second maybe.

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,360
And I was dismayed to find that I had not cleared the movie entirely.

228
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Right.

229
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,680
There were still 10 minutes to go when I showed up.

230
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,640
Can I ask when you guys came on board, were they already set on the moving walkway element

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,480
and the shooter element?

232
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,640
Yes, there was, I believe, Finn.

233
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Yeah.

234
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah, it was.

235
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
You were always going to be on a walkway.

236
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,840
The walkway was locked in.

237
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
And the blaster.

238
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
And the blaster element.

239
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,720
The like functionality of the blaster and the design of the blaster was not locked in.

240
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,480
And there were lots of discussions about that, that we were involved in.

241
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,040
Something that happened, which I think is what resulted in us being so involved was

242
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,800
early on there were just these all hands meetings every week with every department for the ride.

243
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
And we were at those meetings.

244
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Yes.

245
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,440
And it would be interesting sometimes these meetings, because I think, you know, it's

246
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,920
a big project and you kind of don't know what's going to be most urgent.

247
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,680
So sometimes we would be on this meeting and it'd be like, okay, today we're talking all

248
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
about the pre-show video.

249
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,600
And it would, Van and I would be talking, you know, listening, you know, be very engaged.

250
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,240
And other times it would be like, okay, we need to talk about how much steel is being

251
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
ordered.

252
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,480
And we were just on these calls.

253
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,520
And through that process, we started to learn and get ideas.

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
About the steel.

255
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
About the steel.

256
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,760
But also there would be, there would be meetings about, you know, the blasters and how they

257
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,980
would be designed.

258
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,180
There was a whole discussion of that, you know, you want people to be holding onto the

259
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,280
blaster and not, you know, swinging them wildly.

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,820
So that was where it came from to have it designed to have two buttons on the blaster

261
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,500
so that there would be a reason to hold it with both hands.

262
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,180
And all of that kind of stuff, we started to kind of be exposed to every element of

263
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,100
theme park ride design, which was a very cool, you know, experience.

264
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,060
But also sometimes I found myself, you know, shaking my head, I do not know what is being

265
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
discussed.

266
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,180
I have no idea.

267
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,540
When you're also watching probably the triangulation of like, that there's illumination involved

268
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,780
and then universal functional people.

269
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,240
And that's something I always wonder about these things is like, is it just everybody

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,980
kind of like stepping forward and checking with each other about what's feasible constantly

271
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,940
and everybody like slowly moves towards the finish line because it's like, hey, yeah,

272
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,340
how do you write for spaces that aren't fully figured out?

273
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah, I mean, that was a complicated part of the project was it was a constantly moving

274
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,980
target, but you had to, no pun intended, about constantly moving.

275
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,860
But we did have to keep like revising it in sort of in all directions, like moving closer

276
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,540
and closer to what is the actual premise of these things going to be.

277
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,260
But then there would be like, you know, curveballs thrown where it's like there's actually another

278
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,300
section of the line now.

279
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,060
Or you know, this last room is good.

280
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,380
This room's gonna have two walls instead of one wall that are gonna have stuff on it.

281
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,940
And so suddenly you got to fill up.

282
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,260
So suddenly you've got to like, like redefine what would move around.

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,540
Maybe the space would be better for this character if it's gonna have two walls and things like

284
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
that.

285
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Huh.

286
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,100
Because that was the thing that happened was so there were these spaces that were kind

287
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,140
of defined, but there was a sort of like a horse trading of what character would go in

288
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,220
what space to best suit the concept elements for that character.

289
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
Wow.

290
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,420
Like how long did it take where you were comfortable just like, I'm gonna take a big swing here.

291
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,100
Like how many meetings before you were like, it was, I wish I could find, I should have

292
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,820
looked up the email because there was, I think a few months in we took a big swing.

293
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
All right, Gru dies.

294
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
That's how it's.

295
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Kevin kills Gru, okay.

296
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Who's Kevin?

297
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
One of them.

298
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Kevin the minion.

299
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Oh, I gotta cut that one.

300
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Kevin might have to cut that one.

301
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Oh my goodness.

302
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,740
I think we just lost our job.

303
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,780
Just go straight to Van.

304
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:02,500
But there were, there was a point where I think we got comfortable with the level of

305
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,460
that was being both expected and allowed from us.

306
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,860
And we kind of started reshaping some big parts of the ride.

307
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,900
The entire part of the premise that Villain Con is being held in Orlando at Universal

308
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,420
Studios came from us.

309
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Oh wow.

310
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,740
Oh wait, because okay, so Villain Con, I'm no expert in these movies at all, but Villain

311
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,460
Con came from the first minions, correct?

312
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,340
But that is also a period piece.

313
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
That's a period piece.

314
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
So that is in the 60s.

315
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,180
And it's being held, I believe it actually may be in Orlando or Florida.

316
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Yeah, it's in Florida.

317
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Okay.

318
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,620
I think it's in Florida, maybe not specifically Orlando.

319
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,780
It's set in the 60s.

320
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,460
And so that's 1960s Villain Con you see then.

321
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,580
Because that's pre-Gru.

322
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
That's pre the rise of Gru's rise.

323
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,660
So is Villain Con a place that the minions are going to like hunt out possible villains?

324
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
They're looking for a new boss.

325
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,980
Yes, and so they go there and that's where they meet Scarlet Overkill who becomes their

326
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,020
boss in the film for.

327
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
But Sandra Bullock?

328
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Sandra Bullock.

329
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
Yes, okay, yeah, yeah.

330
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,460
So Villain Con exists, but now you have still more logic to work out and that you have to

331
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,740
get it up to 2023.

332
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:24,340
So I thought that the idea of, you know, people will hold conventions at the hotels, at the

333
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,740
theme parks and things like that.

334
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,940
And so I thought the idea that maybe the convention itself is being held at the theme park secretly

335
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,820
would add an extra element of fun for the young riders of the ride to feel like they're

336
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,780
really immersed in the experience and like double immersed.

337
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Not only is it like there's a whole make believe inside, but you're like already in it when

338
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,180
you're at the park deciding to go.

339
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Sure, sure.

340
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,700
And then, yes, so it is, I guess that's an important thing to note that Universal Studios

341
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,340
exists in the world of the ride.

342
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,420
You are transporting to a fully other world because there's jokes right away in the pre-show

343
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:08,580
about that and a funny thing, if I name check things, if everyone take credit, please, if

344
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,060
I bring something up, but they're pretty like good hit at Universal, a joke about how, wait,

345
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,740
oh, God, what is it?

346
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,340
It's about the parking.

347
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,740
It's a universal Orlando just got a lot more evil, which considering how much they pay

348
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,540
for parking is really saying something.

349
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:33,060
Yes, that was a joke that we wrote and which was funny, though, we wrote the joke and I'm

350
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,820
here looking at, you know, living in Hollywood and how much they charge for city walk parking.

351
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,780
And I looked up how much they charge for it in Orlando.

353
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
It's actually much cheaper.

354
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
I was curious.

355
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,740
A number I bought a bottle of water like at the cafe and I'm like, wow, very reasonable

356
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
down here in the park.

357
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
The joke was still worked.

358
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
Yeah.

359
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Yes.

360
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Yeah.

361
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,620
Because paying for parking when you're going to a theme park, I know they all do it, but

362
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,660
it feels ridiculous to have to do.

363
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Yeah.

364
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,660
Yeah.

365
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Hotels even now.

366
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,300
If the joke doesn't apply now, it will certainly apply in seven years.

367
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,220
But yeah, that we were like unsure how they would feel about that, but they actually they

368
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,020
like that at Universal and they were in for it.

369
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,100
And look, I am cool at Universal.

370
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm all in favor for taking credit for a lot of things and I think we should continue to

371
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,220
keep doing that throughout this whole thing.

372
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,260
But I should say that it was a very collaborative process and a lot of people on all sides.

373
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,660
Universal Illumination had a lot of great ideas and people, it's not even like, it's

374
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,620
not like every funny thing that's in the thing came from us.

375
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,940
Everyone contributed all sorts of ideas.

376
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,100
I can't clarify anything you don't like about the ride.

377
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,540
Didn't come from me, may have come from everyone.

378
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Right.

379
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,260
And they were also very open to like Van was saying, like, well, if you guys have any,

380
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,820
you know, ideas about how like, you know, the mechanical engineering should be done,

381
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
you know, feel free to chime in.

382
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
And I did.

383
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Yeah.

384
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Yes.

385
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,020
Yeah, I'm very involved in the app design.

386
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Uh huh.

387
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,340
Yeah, the app is very detailed.

388
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,380
Like for one thing, I'll pay a compliment, it works.

389
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,740
Not always guarantee with theme park theme park based apps.

390
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:22,860
But I was reading like some theme park blog coverage of like, well, here's different things

391
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,820
you can get and here's different settings you can do and customize.

392
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,900
And I'm like, wow, I didn't even barely scratch the surface with the app integration.

393
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,300
Yeah, there was a lot of that a lot of time was spent kind of trying to figure out exactly

394
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:43,260
what the amount of depth of customization would be in the app and balancing that with

395
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,300
the ability to just go on the ride and play it without even really having the app.

396
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,920
Oh, sure.

397
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,820
And that was a tough balance to hit.

398
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,740
But I feel like there is a there's a deepness in the app if you get in there and try and

399
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
change the settings.

400
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,700
And Evan, I also wrote all of the copy in the app as well.

401
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Oh, wow.

402
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Wow.

403
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Geez.

404
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,260
I have a question and not to be presumptuous until you had to do your podcast.

405
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,340
Should we explain what the ride is?

406
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Yeah.

407
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Yes, possibly.

408
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Probably.

409
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,220
We've hinted at it to some extent.

410
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,140
But OK, so this is now and now it's like a quiz to make sure I understood.

411
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
If you would like.

412
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Sure, absolutely.

413
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Sure.

414
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,260
So the ride is that you are attending VillanCon to join the Vicious Six and VillanCon is kind

415
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,300
of like a Comic Con like event.

416
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:36,520
You wait in line, but except instead of comic book fans and vendors, it's all villains.

417
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,460
And so the Vicious Six, which is an editorial supergroup, is looking for their next member

418
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,280
and you get in line like you would if you were going to Comic Con, a convention.

419
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,920
very funny videos where it's kind of VNC, which is a villain news channel.

420
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
They're doing.

421
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm going to step in because Evan is really just butchering.

422
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
He's flailing.

423
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
He said very funny.

424
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,800
He should have said extremely funny.

425
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,520
First of all, incredibly rewatchably perfectly funny.

426
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,240
But so, yes, so the the in the ride itself that you get on is a moving walkway blaster

427
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,360
attraction.

428
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,480
But there's a lot of fun leading up to that, which is based on the premise, you are at

429
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,320
VillanCon and you are in line for a specific experience that is being held at VillanCon.

430
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,200
And if you've ever been to Comic Con or any of these big conventions, it's all about lines,

431
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,800
which made it a great way to theme theme park because most of your ride, because most of

432
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,900
your time in a theme park ride is spent in a line.

433
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,880
And so you're really on the ride as soon as you're in the line, because part of the experience

434
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,320
of being at any convention and being at VillanCon is standing in those darn long lines.

435
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Sure.

436
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Yes.

437
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,760
But to make that experience a little more bearable, there are televisions throughout

438
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,360
that are playing a special VillanCon edition of the VNC, which is the Villain Network Channel,

439
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,680
which is sort of like CNN for villains.

440
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,040
It's from the Despicable Me universe.

441
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Sure, sure.

442
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:11,520
And we were able to get the announcer voice actor who was the VillanCon network, like

443
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,920
newsman in the 1960s in the Minions film back.

444
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Oh yes.

445
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Who's very 60s style.

446
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,160
I mean, will we style him up to 70s-ish?

447
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Yes, yes.

448
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,040
And he kind of sets the premise for you.

449
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Oh wait, does he?

450
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Oh, so the look changed.

451
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
You like, you used the...

452
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,680
Well no, in the 60s he is in the first Minions movie, he's in the 60s.

453
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,560
In the second movie you see him again, he's in a 70s look and we went with the 70s look.

454
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Oh I see, okay.

455
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,320
Move him forward a little bit.

456
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,040
But he does also set off in the premise, he sets up that villains have come from around

457
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,960
the world and throughout time and they show some villains traveling through a time machine,

458
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,760
which does help address, we talked about this a little bit off air, that this is designed

459
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,400
to function canonically so that it can have taken place within the world of the films

460
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,080
and there is a time machine added so that villains who perhaps didn't contemporaneously

461
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,680
exist within the films can be featured within the villain con attraction.

462
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,360
Gosh, yes, because Minions, the first Minions is a prequel that goes way, way back, we're

463
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
dealing with dinosaurs and all that.

464
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
It goes back to the beginning of time essentially.

465
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Yes, yeah.

466
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,720
So we have a long timeline to deal with.

467
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,080
So you figured out, because we were talking about how timeline is an issue in many, especially

468
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,120
recent theme park additions in areas, so you thought this through, what is the way to justify...

469
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,800
I'll be honest with you, the folks at Illumination were very concerned about making sure the

470
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,400
timeline was able to, at least if you squinted, match up and work.

471
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Sure, sure.

472
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,760
Do you feel like you've now planted seeds for future Minions projects by adding to the

473
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,840
sort of canon in a way?

474
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,760
I can't really get into any detail on that, but actually the answer is yes.

475
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Okay, great.

476
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,960
I did have the thought having just a few months ago watched Minions Rise of Gru and then doing

477
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,720
this ride going like, wow, the Vicious 6 looks great.

478
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,600
They've aged really nicely.

479
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes, yes.

480
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,640
Probably villain technology.

481
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
They may have traveled by time machine.

482
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
So anyway, to continue with the ride description, you make your way through several versions

483
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,960
of the line.

484
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
We call it the queue, that's the internal...

485
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
That's what you say.

486
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Yes.

487
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,560
Terminologies.

488
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,200
And you make it to, I believe, is it Q5?

489
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
I believe that's right.

490
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,000
Which is when you are able to walk out onto the VillainCon show floor.

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,720
But this implies, not to get into weeds, I guess, but you know the area.

492
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Those are all coded in some way.

493
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
So we're like...

494
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,120
You're right in Q1, Q2.

495
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,180
And so in Q5, you get a little bit of free roaming ability.

496
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,340
You're walking around inside of a space that is built out to kind of look like you're seeing

497
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,040
booths at a convention.

498
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,880
So there are various vendors of villainous goods and services.

499
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,900
There's a malicious motors, which is sort of where villains get their getaway vehicles

500
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,520
and evil cars and whatnot from.

501
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,320
There's the Diabolique Boutique, which is sort of a fashion house for villains where

502
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,160
you might get your supervillainous costume made.

503
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,640
There is...

504
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
What is the pet store?

505
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
What is that?

506
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
That's called the...

507
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Do I have...

508
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Corrupt Companions, I believe.

509
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Oh, that's good.

510
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Yeah.

511
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I remember that.

512
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,240
And that's your evil pet foods and whatnot.

513
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Right, right.

514
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah, great.

515
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Giant gator.

516
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Yes, giant alligator.

517
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah, really good feature there.

518
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,080
And so just to pause on the explanation and just get into some more Evan and I, the most

519
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
important part.

520
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,720
I think that was my favorite part of the ride was...

521
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,120
We did work on a lot of the placemaking line stuff.

522
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,800
And so those booths, both concepting what some of them were, but then also the physical

523
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
objects that are in them.

524
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Malicious Motors has a bunch of license plates up on the wall that say, like, too evil for

525
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,640
you kind of type things.

526
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,560
And we wrote all of the license plates and things like that.

527
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,800
And again, there were other people pitched on these things as well.

528
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm flipping through a couple of things I grabbed pictures of.

529
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,840
And there's in the pet area, cans of corrupt delights, fiendishly flavorful.

530
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,640
And then it's different at bat food, scorpion food, vulture food.

531
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Yeah.

532
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
So the process with a lot of that is we would get sent...

533
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,000
Our department at Universal would mock up a label.

534
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,040
And then that would get sent to us to revise the copy on, sometimes pitch a new, maybe

535
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,000
instead of bat food, it's this type of thing.

536
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,680
And so there was a ton of collaboration between us and the different departments at Universal

537
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
working on this stuff.

538
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:08,000
And Malicious Motors has a car console, a steering wheel, and buttons and gauges.

539
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,200
And that got sent back to us with somewhat generic what the gauges said.

540
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
And we changed them to be things like oil slick and more specific things.

541
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,800
So there's a lot of interesting places where there's quote unquote writing that you might

542
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,560
not expect on a ride.

543
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,760
What a dream to get to just fill out specifics.

544
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,160
And really specific assignments.

545
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,080
I think one of the biggest things like that is, and this is a...

546
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,160
You could not go on the attraction three times and not see it, but there is a map of the

547
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,000
VillainCon floor.

548
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,440
They have every...

549
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,760
Which is all these booths that you don't see, because the premise is that you are going

550
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,640
through this queue, you're going through a small portion of the show floor.

551
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,280
And you see a map that shows a much bigger portion of...

552
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,840
And it's all of the booths that you don't even get to see.

553
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
And there's little small things.

554
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
I think some of these, I'm saying, didn't necessarily make it, but it's like torture

555
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,760
chamber and just little things labeled like things that you might imagine would be at

556
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
a convention.

557
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,160
One I really like, false sense of security room.

558
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,720
That one was tough to get through.

559
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,320
There were some people who could not understand that joke, I think very fairly.

560
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Yes.

561
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,280
I guess it's a good one to look at later.

562
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,720
When you're doing all this and you're writing all these jokes, do you literally...

563
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,840
Was there anything that you were surprised when you actually saw it?

564
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,440
Or was it literally everything like, yes, no, would you get emails that would list yes,

565
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
no on all your ideas?

566
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,640
Sometimes yes, but then other times you would get there when we got there like, oh wow,

567
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,080
yeah, some of the stuff did...

568
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,240
You never hear back about it, then it's just there.

569
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,640
So you're leaving this queue, you head in to go and get your blaster.

570
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,880
And there's a little area where there's these blasters that are on a conveyor belt.

571
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,400
To simplify it for people who may not be familiar, blaster is a word we use in the theme park

572
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,400
business because we don't want to say gun.

573
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Things have changed.

574
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Changed since they proposed a Dick Tracy ride where you have a Tommy gun.

575
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Where you have a gun, yeah.

576
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,160
So a blaster which is not a gun.

577
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Not remotely similar.

578
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Not remotely similar.

579
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
No.

580
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,440
Everyone gets to pick one up and one of the things that's unique about this ride is that

581
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,240
unlike some similar attractions, the blaster is not attached to a ride vehicle.

582
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,320
There's no cord coming out of it, it's not mounted on anything.

583
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,160
You freely hold it, you pick it up and then you drop it back off.

584
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:44,920
So when you're on the ride, you can move around 360 degrees up and down and blast any direction.

585
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,920
So how is that calibrated so quickly?

586
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I hadn't actually thought about how that worked until you mentioned it.

587
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:03,240
While they're on the conveyor belt, charging belt, that is when they get recalibrated and

588
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,720
re-centered to know what direction they're facing with the system.

589
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,360
There are sensors up in the ceiling.

590
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,240
I believe it uses ultra wideband radio, the same thing on iPhones where you can find your

591
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
keys now and it'll tell you where you are.

592
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,760
I also believe it's ultra wideband.

593
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,440
And then inside the blaster itself there are accelerometers and things that can get its

594
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,640
own orientation.

595
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,840
And so there are multiple systems getting the orientation of it and they all communicate

596
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,120
back and forth.

597
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,600
And that gives an orientation and position and angle of the blaster to the computers

598
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,280
that are controlling the screens.

599
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,800
For you, Van, was there ever any onboarding of wrapping your head around what all of this

600
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,840
is or is in the first conversation about this, are you like, yes, got it, I understand.

601
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,160
This is all just like, no one told me any of this, I had to figure all of it out.

602
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,320
I was given access to an internal wiki that explained all of this and I just on my own

603
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,440
read all of it.

604
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,040
There were these, to me, incredible diagrams explaining how all of the signals and messages

605
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,520
were sent to each other and where they were queued up within the system.

606
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,800
So it's possible that the typical writer on a thing like this may not dive into, may not

607
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,800
go on stealth missions to see documents that they were not specifically.

608
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,600
It came in handy as we were getting to the last phases of the ride and I myself, being

609
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,320
familiar with the technology, I had a sense of like, what could be changed at this point

610
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,080
and what's completely off the table.

611
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,960
And so we were pitching things like different sounds a blaster could make and things that

612
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,040
I, you know, the color that it showed when you were blasting a certain thing and things

613
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,440
that I knew were tweakable at this point in the process.

614
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Wow.

615
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,320
Evan definitely had a technical knowledge and understanding that I think they were shocked

616
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,480
to discover in a writer.

617
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,720
I had the ride running in my office because I had enough of the existing technology they

618
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,100
were using for the ride already that I was able to run a version of the ride in my office

619
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,680
for Evan and I to like.

620
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
What does that mean?

621
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
What does that look like?

622
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:22,960
I brought both the energy and spirit and mind of a child to the process and was able to

623
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,800
just say, oh, wouldn't it be fun if you could blast really big?

624
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Very helpful.

625
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
And you know what?

626
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,680
Sometimes that was valuable too.

627
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,880
And sometimes Van would say no, not possible at this point in the process.

628
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,040
You also picked up burgers once.

629
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,880
So you get your blaster and you walk onto a moving conveyor belt.

630
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,400
Sort of like the conveyor belts in an airport except this one can move around corners and

631
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
curve.

632
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,360
That's where I suddenly was because I think everybody was probably, you guys especially,

633
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,680
I would imagine, are wrapping your head around how is that going to work?

634
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,720
And once I saw the first corner bend, I'm like, oh, here we go.

635
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,120
All right, I get it.

636
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
That works really smoothly.

637
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,400
Can you all stand on spots too?

638
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,600
Can you explain to me how that works?

639
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,880
It's segmented.

640
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,200
It's in like a semi-circ, like crescent shaped segments that overlap.

641
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,440
And so that's how it's able to move.

642
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
But it is the same piece?

643
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,200
Like are we getting moved onto a different piece?

644
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,120
No, you're standing on the same piece that they just sort of are able to corner because

645
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,800
they're overlapping and there's a little more underneath and you don't really notice it.

646
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,880
But the floor underneath you slightly changes what piece of floor you're on.

647
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,200
You're illustrating things with your arms, which actually is very helpful.

648
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,720
But I'm going to ask you to do one more, which is what I'm on with the dot,

649
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,560
what do you know the shape of it if you were to take it out of the belt?

650
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:55,320
Yeah, it's like a half circle but a little bit of a crescent carve out on the straight end of it.

651
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
So slice a circle in half, you've got two halves.

652
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,440
But then carve out a little crescent on the inside.

653
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Almost like a macaroni?

654
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,600
Yeah, it was like a macaroni piece.

655
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,920
Those are stacked on each other.

656
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,160
And so you're on that and then you're moving through different themed rooms,

657
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,360
themed to the Vicious Six.

658
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,880
The overall, when you get to that point, what is that within the premise of the convention?

659
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,520
Great, sure. So you're entering the Vicious Six challenge,

660
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
which is like a side event they're holding at Comic-Con that they've designed and put on.

661
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,760
See, the Vicious Six in Minions Rise of Gru kick out wild knuckles,

662
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,600
and so now they're down to the Vicious Five, so they need a new member.

663
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,600
In Minions Rise of Gru, you think that Young Gru might be the new member, it doesn't.

664
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
It doesn't work out.

665
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,600
So they're still in search of a new member, and so this could be you, the attendee of VillainCon.

666
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,320
And so it's sort of like if you go to Comic-Con and there's an activation for the new Godzilla movie,

667
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,000
and you go into a room and it seems like Godzilla's there or something.

668
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,640
It's that sort of experience being held at VillainCon where there's a sort of a separate

669
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,600
activation being put on by the Vicious Six.

670
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,080
And for them, it's because they're trying to recruit a new member.

671
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,440
They figure, where better than VillainCon, all the most villainous people are gathered.

672
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,800
And so you're being scored on your blaster, you're getting a score,

673
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,000
and that's all for them to judge whether or not you can become the next member of the Vicious Six.

674
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,480
Right. And you guys have worked on a Comic-Con activation as well.

675
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,280
Yes, the Brooklyn Nine-Nine Comic-Con activation.

676
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,240
And also the Detective Pikachu.

677
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,560
Unveiling of Detective Pikachu at Comic-Con New York.

678
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,320
I don't know if I know that. I don't think I knew that.

679
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,600
I believe that Ryan Reynolds was voicing Detective Pikachu.

680
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,920
You planned how to unveil Ryan Reynolds?

681
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,240
Dave Foley.

682
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,800
It was an insane one-day writers' room.

683
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,320
Legends of comedy. And I don't know if they used anyone's ideas.

684
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,600
I think they may not.

685
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,480
They may not.

686
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:01,980
Okay.

687
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,320
Well, and if we're, I'm sorry, you know, not to step too far off the moving walkway.

688
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,400
But if we're talking convention experience, Van, you've also, you've put together entire

689
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,320
conventions. You're one of the main architects of this ongoing convention called BugCon,

690
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,680
which is devoted to Bug Main, who is a hip hop artist slash cult leader.

691
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,480
And I feel like genuinely, it must, there must have been a lot of crossover between,

692
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,560
because BugCon is a pretty advanced technologically event.

693
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,440
There was a moment.

694
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,520
You essentially are almost doing solo.

695
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,280
That is where I don't think if you,

696
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,320
probably some people listening have been to BugCon.

697
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,400
If you haven't, and I hope there's a future BugCon,

698
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,320
it really is a technological, that you might think more people are involved in putting it

699
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,960
together than you very frazzled with a number of minions, you might say.

700
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,160
Yeah, but it is, I would say 80% me, 20% like a dozen other people.

701
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,680
And there was a moment where I was simultaneously working on VillainCon and BugCon 2022.

702
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,180
Wow.

703
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,640
I did, those projects did overlap.

704
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,360
But yeah, I have kind of become, I think,

705
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,200
entertainment's foremost expert on fake conventions, but that you can also attend.

706
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

707
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,760
That are actual experiences.

708
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,200
Real fake conventions.

709
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,840
That are very, that I've like, both very rewarding, both the universal one and BugCon.

710
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,080
Not only that, you've also put rides together as part of these.

711
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,320
At the last BugCon, you specifically-

712
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,920
Yes, we did have Spacey Mountain.

713
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,720
Spacey Mountain.

714
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,360
Which is a terrifying trip through the career of Kevin Spacey.

715
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,760
Which was a, like, it was like a headset based experience.

716
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,480
Yes, it was a roller coaster simulator experience.

717
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,160
With a fully fleshed out track that actually, that moved along, that was perfectly set up.

718
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,440
Yes, you sat in a chair that moved around and encountered big Kevin Spaceys.

719
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,480
Air that blew at you and they were-

720
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,440
More advanced than this minions ride in a lot of ways.

721
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,400
In some ways, in other ways, less advanced.

722
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,400
I mean, I just think-

723
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,120
Well attended.

724
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,240
I just think universal, like, lucky that you would deign to participate and give them any of your knowledge.

725
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,920
Well, thank you, that's a high compliment.

726
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,720
I appreciate it.

727
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,360
Yeah, no, there was a surprising amount of overlap there.

728
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,240
Yeah, and between everything, because, I mean, listeners are picking this up,

729
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,680
but if you don't know Van or haven't heard Van on other podcasts, like,

730
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,520
yeah, your technological experiences, I don't know, how do you, what do you even call it exactly?

731
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,840
Because beyond, like, your app awareness and programming awareness.

732
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,880
I'm a bit of a polymath.

733
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,680
I think is what you mean.

734
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay, yeah, I wouldn't have had that term at the ready, no.

735
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,360
So, all right, so you're a polymath.

736
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,760
But yeah, you know, so I went to college to be an engineer

737
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,600
and I quit engineering school the first week and switched to screenwriting.

738
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,840
But I've always had that engineering bug still.

739
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,080
And so it kind of became my hobby.

740
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,120
I kind of describe it as like, you'll hear that there's like an engineer

741
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,880
who dreams of one day writing a book.

742
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,200
I'm like a writer who dreams of one day engineering a complex system.

743
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,880
Which to some extent, you have to feel like this is one of the biggest accomplishments,

744
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,920
I would think.

745
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,640
Yeah, no, it was really thrilling to work on it.

746
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,520
It really ticked all the boxes a thing could tick for me.

747
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
When you're, sorry.

748
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,560
Go, no, please.

749
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,480
When you're on now another shooter ride,

750
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,000
are you trying to break down technologically what's happening?

751
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,800
Oh, excuse me, blasting?

752
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,920
A ride where you blast.

753
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,720
You don't hear about mass blasting.

754
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,680
I mean, for better or worse, I think the reason I was well suited for this

755
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,480
is that has not changed for me at all because that was already happening.

756
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,680
You were already breaking that down.

757
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,800
Yeah, I was already like, okay, so on Buzz Lightyear Blaster,

758
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
the reason it's attached is it's getting the coordinates of

759
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,680
where it's pointed at by how it's moving and things like that.

760
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,240
Okay, feel free to not answer this or generically answer it,

761
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,200
but I imagine that with you guys and other people in the process at Universal,

762
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,640
there must have been some, let's say, judgment or comparison

763
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,200
to other recent rides of the blasting variety.

764
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,880
You must have been kind of like comparing yourselves against maybe,

765
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,400
let's say, lesser versions of the genre.

766
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,800
There was a very exhausting ride that's somewhat similar,

767
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,560
and we were keen on not having our ride be quite so tiring on your arms

768
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,480
while also feeling like you aren't actually interacting with it,

769
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,600
but I won't go further.

770
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,160
And you want to feel like there's cause and effect,

771
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,880
like there's actual that you weren't just flailing around with no specific,

772
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,560
you didn't understand, which is a big challenge when you are not seated,

773
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,240
when you're holding a weapon.

774
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,080
Is that allowed?

775
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,120
Can I say weapons?

776
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,520
Weapons last.

777
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,480
Okay, just start it.

778
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,680
I'll say weapon.

779
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,400
But like, was there ever anyone trying to back up and say,

780
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:33,080
let's not do a weapon blaster that says weighty?

781
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,960
There were comparisons to other rides made as like,

782
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,920
we don't want to be like this or that, both because that is a problem,

783
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,120
but also I think out of like not wanting to be compared unfavorably.

784
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,440
Yeah, you want to distinguish yourself and do your own thing.

785
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,960
You don't want what's different about an attraction just to be the IP or characters.

786
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,280
You want it to feel like a different experience.

787
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,920
Sure.

788
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,280
One of the leads on the project had previously worked at Disney

789
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,520
and had worked on Toy Story Midway Mania.

790
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,020
Okay.

791
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,240
So we were all very positive about that one.

792
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,320
Was there ever an idea to not make it just a regular blaster,

793
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,160
like something weird like a sword or something?

794
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:21,080
No, it was pretty set on it was going to be a blaster throughout the whole process.

795
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,720
The big conversations with it had to do with like,

796
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,200
how much functionality would be on the blaster.

797
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:26,940
Right.

798
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,960
You know, there was a moment when you would have more ability with the blaster

799
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,400
to be like selecting different weapons and cycling through weapons and things like that,

800
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:45,400
but there was a concern about giving too much immediate on weapon depth,

801
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,920
excuse me, on blaster depth,

802
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,720
and that making any riders who are not familiar with

803
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,800
video games of that genre and things like that too confused.

804
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,800
And also you want people to be looking at the attraction and not the blaster.

805
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,360
Blasters have these great little screens on them that let you know what projectile you're using

806
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,720
and what your score is, but it's also like this pressure to, from ourselves,

807
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,240
don't use the screen too much because you don't want people staring down at the screen on their blaster,

808
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,000
which we could show whatever we want on,

809
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,680
but we'd like the action to be out in the big world around them where they're built out columns

810
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,240
and kids are already looking down at their screens.

811
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
You know what? I'm looking at screens on blasters.

812
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,600
There you go.

813
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,160
I think the blaster, I thought it was very satisfying to hold,

814
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,520
and it is larger than some other blaster based rides, but it is very light.

815
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Yeah, I mean that was definitely a challenge is figuring out what,

816
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,680
because all of the stuff that you put into it can make it heavier,

817
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,200
so making it not too heavy, but also having the functionality that you want.

818
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,800
That's...

819
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,440
Evan wanted a soda dispenser cut for weight.

820
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,720
Dispensing tech was like the soda itself.

821
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,800
And then just to finish the walkthrough of the ride,

822
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,880
you do the Vicious Six challenge, and each member of the Vicious Six,

823
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,680
whether that be Strongholds, Vengeance, or Nunchuck,

824
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,560
they kind of have their own room that they've designed that they have

825
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,800
their own kind of unique way and challenges of how you can earn more points,

826
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,680
cause more destruction.

827
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,600
Concluding in, and this is a little bit of a tip to, you know,

828
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,840
my fandom of wrestling, which Carlson can relate to,

829
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,080
Bell Bottoms tells you a version of Ric Flair is to be the man,

830
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,120
you gotta be the man.

831
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,800
It's to be the best, you gotta be the best.

832
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,640
And as a surprise, all of the iconic villains from the Despicable Me

833
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,280
and Minions franchise, you discover, are also there in competition with you,

834
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,960
whether that is Scarlet Overkill, Brat, El Macho, Vector,

835
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,680
and they come in and it's a fun thing that if you're riding the ride multiple times,

836
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,040
you might have a different version of who you go up against.

837
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,120
Oh, who takes lead in the ride.

838
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,360
Right, okay, so the first time you go through, you might be finishing a battle

839
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,680
with Vector and then El Macho comes in, and then the next time you do it,

840
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,040
it might be Scarlet Overkill.

841
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,080
So that's a little bit of variation and you have a face off against,

842
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,280
iconic villain and you can either win or lose against that iconic villain.

843
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:26,120
And that battle is happening, it's gotten so intense that it's blasted out into

844
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,200
Universal Orlando and you can see some of the iconic universal landmarks,

845
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:37,400
which was a really fun, I think, idea that Van and I really liked and pushed for.

846
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,960
Yeah, this was, this seems like the, I don't know if we can give you,

847
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,040
you tell me if it's 100% credit for that idea, but certainly like that it ends at

848
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,080
the practical universal skyline seem like a real victory.

849
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,400
I don't know what the modest way to say yes is.

850
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:03,480
It took other important stakeholders saying yes, and that's arguably as valuable as our coming

851
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:11,880
up with the idea for it. And it also took heroic efforts and conversations with universal legal

852
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,520
about the ability to blast at universal properties and objects and what could and could not be

853
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,320
included. Shooting a fart gun at volcano bay.

854
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,960
Well, yeah, cause you get sort of say what's on that skyline. It felt, it was,

855
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,920
it felt validating for me as a fan of universal Orlando and like the grandeur of universal and

856
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,840
like how, because I think for all the, you know, we'll get into a lot of complaints about

857
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,800
city walk Orlando, but I think a real victory is the big lake or the big lagoon, whatever you

858
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:50,040
want to call it with kind of like the primary icons all there. It's the studio gate for universal

859
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:56,360
studios proper. It's what's the lighthouse Jason, I cannot remember the Ferros lighthouse based on

860
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,200
one of the wonders of the ancient world. Ferros lighthouse. I keep thinking fanos. It's not that.

861
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:09,160
No. And then, and then it's not there literally, but the, the volcano bay volcano is there. And

862
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:15,160
then of course, most importantly, tooth, some chocolate, emporium and the big smokestacks.

863
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:24,280
So those are all lined up and a fantastic backdrop for a scene and they, you can damage them, right?

864
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,480
I feel like I saw a video with like cracks on the, the universal globe is there.

865
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,560
Certain letters can be shot to unlock something. Whoa. Wow.

866
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,160
Little inside tip. Geez. Yeah.

867
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,520
Just trying to think what word that could apply to the franchise can be spelled with the letters in

868
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:50,280
universal. And you might get there. I can't, I need to take a minute to figure it out.

869
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,560
There was a cut for time plan for tooth. Some factory to be able to have a sort of a chocolate

870
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,000
explosion. Oh, wow. That was sadly, we just didn't have the like a bandwidth.

871
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,160
When we were told that tooth, some could be included, I really went in on wanting to

872
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,240
explore the tooth of mythology as a part of this ride. Of course, at a certain point was told,

873
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,280
you know, he did pitch replacing the vicious six with Jacques.

874
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,840
Wow. Wow. He did not.

875
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,840
Was there an idea that when you start shooting or excuse me, you start blasting a tooth, some

876
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,080
that Dr. Tooth, some like comes on and goes, please stop.

877
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,080
My home. I'm running a business here.

878
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,640
In fact, there are no people.

879
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,280
In fact, no people at all.

880
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,400
Very good point. Yeah.

881
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:39,800
As you think about it.

882
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,240
Yeah. All right. If we're going to do that, no people, no, no guests, no executives.

883
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,920
Jason, are you upset at the possibility that your beloved Ferris lighthouse could be damaged in

884
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,880
some way? Well, I mean, I was going to raise more of the objection that if you were going from

885
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,400
right to left, you would see the universal arches before to some. And yes, you see it.

886
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,280
But, you know, I figured if it passed legal, that was acceptable.

887
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,800
Yes, this was.

888
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,760
We did have to take some geographical liberties for layout reasons to preserve the illusion

889
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:22,040
that you were looking outside of a wall. There's essentially a concern with the parallax effect

890
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,440
as you move past these screens because they are two dimensional screens. But you want to be able

891
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,240
to maintain the depth illusion the entire time. And so the layout and arrangement of objects

892
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,560
on the screen is very carefully done so that it doesn't suddenly feel like what you're looking at

893
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:46,440
what you're looking at isn't it doesn't have depth in the right way.

894
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,240
And I was the big one bringing up the parallax concern.

895
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,400
Yeah, I was kind of figured it was a parallax.

896
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,240
You call it the parallax concern?

897
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,740
Yeah.

898
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,280
Scott, you mentioned concern about two from being destroyed. The good news is when you get to the

899
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,160
next, which is called the kiss good night, which is a term that I had not heard where Bell Bottom

900
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,240
tells you, hey, you did a good job. You unfortunately, because it hasn't happened yet,

901
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,360
no one's made the vicious six, but you can get back and try again. But you can see behind her

902
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:21,000
that robots are putting back together all of the damage at the park. So that when you do the ride

903
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,200
again and you discover that it has not all been destroyed, it's built into the story.

904
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,760
What happened that it's being reconstructed. But if you do go outside the building,

905
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,240
I think you'll see a little bit of damage that has been done.

906
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:42,120
That's fascinating. Wow. Yeah, kiss good night. That's a good bit of terminology that you,

907
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,120
because we've talked about that as like a, I've heard that reference as a Disney thing,

908
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,000
where all the characters wave to you. Yeah, at the end of the night.

909
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,640
But specific rides, there is this desire to like give you one more little moment.

910
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,360
Yes. And I will say when we were down there testing out the ride and riding it over and

911
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:06,520
over again for two hours, they have an employee that is there. And I saw an employee who had only

912
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,400
been there for two hours, but could say the whole kiss good night word for word, because he heard

913
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,320
it over and over and over. So that was a unique experience. You don't think that when you write

914
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,880
something that someone was going to have to listen to it. I think that the origin of the term is

915
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,120
when John Lester was in charge of the Disney park. Upon exiting every meeting,

916
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,040
you would have to give him a kiss good night. He was really committed. He's the first one in

917
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,720
the morning and he insisted on being the last one to leave. The last one to leave the park.

918
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:43,880
This is for everyone. Okay, so you just referred to, Evan, you just referred to like

919
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,880
going down there, getting to test. Now here's the, I would like to get into the portion where

920
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,560
you guys make us jealous. Make us jealous of access and cool things. I mean already the

921
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:00,200
fact that you had a version of this in your office. What is it like, what springs to mind when I say

922
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,880
like some part of the process that you got to do and had early access to that where we would,

923
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,840
you know, nerd-gasm about it. I mean I hope we've covered it already.

924
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:16,360
That's right. We were getting to do it. So first of all, I was able to enter for a meeting

925
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,160
Universal Hollywood through Walters Gate. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean we've drawn Walters Gate.

926
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,920
We walked through it. So that was my day. Every day was that for me. Yeah, that's good. I'm not

927
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,760
saying it's that good. I'm just saying we have to. That's all I'm saying. A funny thing that

928
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,760
happened early on was to test a version of the ride before it was up and running in my office.

929
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,480
We tested it at Universal City Walk in one of the theaters. Now we're talking. Yeah. Wow.

930
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:50,200
Wow. It got like, they hooked it all up so that we could use a temporary blaster that was built

931
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,240
out of like pipes. Oh my god. Yeah, that's great. Wow. And so that the levels could be

932
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,280
shown at the actual scale that they were going to be on the ride. Wow. Wow. Oh, so they're not even

933
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,480
necessarily using the entire screen. No. They're like showing exactly what it will be. Exactly.

934
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,840
So each level would be shown in different sizes. Geez. That's cool. That's really cool. And knowing

935
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,600
that like, you know, for anyone who thinks that City Walk is, I don't know, mundane or something,

936
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,200
that there's, you know, magic like that could be happening around any corner. Yeah. Wow. And then

937
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,920
you got, you made it down to Florida. Yes. I was there on there twice. I think Evan was there once.

938
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:36,920
The first time I got to go when the ride was mid construction. And so the demolition of Shrek

939
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,320
was complete except for a few, you know, like a donkey ear here and there, you know.

940
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:53,160
Gingerbread bits. And the rooms had kind of been like cordoned off and sketched out and they were

941
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:59,880
starting to put up some of the giant fake marble columns for one of the rooms. But it was like,

942
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,600
the whole place was kind of half constructed and that was a really cool experience to be inside of

943
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:15,160
a ride as it was coming together like that. Yeah. And then they took us to the, like basically the

944
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:23,560
universal R and D lab where they were working on the ride outside of that. And what was very funny

945
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:30,200
was right next to us, someone was testing a new iteration of the Harry Potter wands.

946
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,800
Oh, wow. Wow. So it was like a fake thing from a movie about how you would imagine this works

947
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,560
where like they're working on it right here and literally right there someone's got magic wands

948
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,800
and they're like pointing in that a bookcase that's lighting up. It's like the Richie Rich scene with

949
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,640
Professor Keen Bean where there's just chaos going on everywhere. It was like that. That's the most

950
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:57,240
famous version of what you're talking about. Yeah. The ride vehicles for the Velocircoaster.

951
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,840
There was a like section of track that could just go around in a circle that had the ride

952
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:08,440
vehicle on it that could move just around and around. It wasn't running while I was there,

953
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:14,200
but it was there to test something. Wow. The Velocircoaster.

954
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:20,840
So there are a few places where I would like for you guys to hear something and then

955
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,080
never reference it again and please bleep it out of the podcast. That's going on you.

956
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,160
Okay. Well, we could always use the plan that Susser instituted that our bleep is the song

957
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:37,000
moves like Bert that bleeped a story. The people are still kind of curious. There's been requests

958
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,760
maybe to hear a story, something that happened to you at Sesame Place in full. People behind the

959
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,240
paywall maybe are like, don't we deserve to hear? What do you think of that?

960
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:52,920
What do you have? You have the second gate is? The second gate and club three a little

961
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,400
further than that. Maybe club four. Okay. So once we do a club four,

962
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,080
you can finally hear the admittedly scarring, unpleasant, probably unsatisfying story.

963
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,760
Should we in keeping in the minion universe though, should the bleep on this one be like

964
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:18,200
happy or despicable me song? Maybe just a minion exclamation or something like that.

965
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,600
Yeah. So anyway, let's figure that out later and we'll get to the. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

966
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,160
Well, we're on a little writer's room to figure out. You guys are the experts. You can tell.

967
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,200
What is the big new minion phrase that we could? Yeah. So next to us, I kind of snooped around a

968
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:48,040
little bit and I saw the. Wow. So that is okay. That's pretty good. Interesting. And just to be

969
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,240
clear, the intention here is to, you want us to leave in all of us going like, Oh, wow. Oh,

970
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,920
and then the listeners don't get to find out exactly what that is. Yeah. They're not going

971
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,200
to like this. Oh no, they're not going to like it. Well, they didn't, you know, they loved the

972
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,320
last time we did moves like Bert. Remember everybody was thrilled when I remember that.

973
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,040
Oh, this is deep story. This is different though, cause this is fun. The other two are awful.

974
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,720
This is the first step. Wait. Yeah. Well, that's maybe why the sound has to change.

975
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,280
It's like Bert is only for when it's something deeply, deeply unsettling. Yeah. Yeah. No,

976
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,840
this is great. So it was very exciting to kind of be inside the dream factory, so to speak,

977
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:28,120
seeing other things. And then I'll say back to the like, where any of like the dream come true. One,

978
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,160
one fun thing, you know, in addition to work on the ride, we eventually started working on

979
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,760
the greater minion land. Oh yeah. That's around there. And when we were down for the trip,

980
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,120
we got an email. Hey, we're gonna have to start this day a little early. Cause we got to do a

981
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,400
taste test at a bake my day of all of the cupcakes and treats that are going to be sold at the park.

982
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Wow. If only you were there to have, you know, the executive chef at universal talking through

983
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,840
every cupcake and treat and all of the different flavor combinations. I mean, you know, I think

984
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,400
that they had really come to lean on van for his technical expertise.

985
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:18,600
But then we need you. So sir, Mr. Cesar, we noticed this white napkin that's been tucked into your

986
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:25,000
shirt. This month, for months in a fork and knife. Can you tell us something that you got to taste?

987
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,600
And can we use the same bleeping mechanism, even though we don't need to just here? Tell us with

988
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:37,800
something that you got to take a bite of a minion cupcake. Oh, whoa. Okay. Okay. Do not let that

989
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,760
through. I'm going to not. Yeah. Yeah. It's that. Don't worry. I, well, yeah. I mean, we can get

990
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,160
into some, some broader, yes, because this is part of there's the, there's the attraction. Yes. But

991
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,200
then there is the broader minion land, which connects a despicable me minion ma'am, which

992
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:58,600
has been there for a while. And then minion cafe, uh, which you guys also participated in. Yeah. I

993
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,560
think that that was a little, we were not as full time on that project, but they would definitely

994
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:11,960
come to us for a decoration copy and also a few items on the menu. Do you, yeah. So what made it

995
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,280
through that you, or do you need to look at a menu to know? I would maybe need to look at it,

996
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:23,320
but again, I mean, all of it was very collaborative. I don't feel the need to go through. I want to see

997
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,320
your initials next to everything. Something that I think we can take credit for that ended up in

998
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,880
the minion cafe, not as a consumable item, but just as a decoration, um, was as part of the

999
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,880
queue, uh, we were trying to figure out ways to, uh, stretch the production budget for the videos,

1000
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:49,000
for the line, uh, to make them not repeat as often. And so we added some static cards that are sort of,

1001
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,080
um, the sort of information you would be being told at a comic con. Oh yeah. Yes. You know, where

1002
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:01,080
the, um, what the schedule is and things like that. Oh, all of the implications of panels. Yes.

1003
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,240
That are occurring. I wait, the one I have in front of me isn't from the video part, but it's

1004
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:11,400
from the, like the sign iteration of it. But I really liked, uh, mind control masterclass. You

1005
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,880
all, you already RSVP'd. But all the, all the video still versions are so funny. And one of those was

1006
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,480
a concession stand slide. Um, and for that we were trying to come up with what are some like

1007
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,560
fun villainous items that would be available at a concession stand. And one of the things that we

1008
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:34,520
came up with was, um, this, uh, villainous energy drink called manic energy. And, uh,

1009
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,760
the artists did a great job designing the can. The can is available as a collectible inside of the

1010
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:46,760
game. Oh, wow. There is a, um, a full size in the minions break room area of the minion cafe.

1011
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:52,360
There's a non-functional, but full sized vending machine that has various items. And there are

1012
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,920
cans of manic energy drink in the vending machine. And that's, that was one of the things where I

1013
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,040
showed up and I did not know there was going to be a fully realized three-dimensional organic

1014
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,640
energy drink that was, came, come to exist. Well, and it's, it's also, it's the most fun experience.

1015
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:13,400
It's the most you thing also given your work with rain with rain energy drink is the official sponsor

1016
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,800
of bugcon. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a real, you can really just like see straight through to,

1017
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:24,040
there's a straight line. That vending machine is really fantastic in general that they're like,

1018
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:29,400
I mean, it's like specific products you can read, but the, the, like that there's just a full, uh,

1019
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:37,720
ice cream Sunday in there. The cafe, um, set deck people did a really tremendous job, uh, with a lot

1020
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,680
of the fine details like that. The vending machine also has like exactly the right amount of bananas

1021
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:48,840
to be not too many. Um, funny that they're even in there. A really functional amount. It's like,

1022
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,840
one joke is that it's all bananas, but how satisfying is that the, the awkward spacing out

1023
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:02,040
of selective rows of bananas and then just a random fart gun in the middle. Yeah. Fart blaster.

1024
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:09,000
Fart blaster. Yeah. Sorry. Um, I, yeah, it is definitely a restaurant worth going into and

1025
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,720
poking around details. I feel like you guys, I think there was a moment where you must've,

1026
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:19,720
you were texting me because you were specifically working on the break room sign with a lot of dos

1027
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,640
and don'ts. And I saw a little like a peek into the process of like, what are the kinds of jokes

1028
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:32,200
that would be rejected for whatever like danger reason, minion unlike ability reason. Also,

1029
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,640
there was a not to put, uh, there was a about the microwave not to put any, uh, any minions in it.

1030
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,800
Because can you imagine a child would go home after reading that sign and say, well, they said,

1031
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,160
don't put a minion in a microwave, but surely I could put my little kid brother.

1032
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:58,200
And they may have just watched the flash and that would have been a whole thing too. So

1033
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,720
I've shown some restraint and not bringing up flash gate. I don't think so much to talk about.

1034
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,160
I was going to say that's what I thought, but there's a tease of this and business to go over

1035
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,720
with Evan. Yeah, don't worry. We'll find a time to do it. I'll tell the story.

1036
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,120
The fourth gate. Oh, that's not a bad combo. Um, you know what though? I'm looking at the sign

1037
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,960
that you wrote van or that I assume you guys wrote together and here I'm looking at the don'ts list.

1038
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,480
And one of them is don't, this is about the refrigerator. Uh, don't unplug to charge fart

1039
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,440
guns. Jason was correct. No need to correct Jason. I think there was a bit of questioning

1040
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:41,160
that's canonically called the fart gun. Yeah. This was a tough balance that had to be struck

1041
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:48,360
working on a property that does explicitly use guns and knives and other violent while trying

1042
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:55,080
to kind of tip toe around that. But, but yes, um, I feel like, I mean, these are all, these ended up

1043
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,480
really funny, especially the last one, the last don't being don't replace this list with a joke

1044
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:08,280
list. Um, and then like, I'm pretty sure, um, that's very good. Uh, and then like lots of,

1045
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:14,440
like minions advertising their, uh, services, uh, you know, the one does lawn when one, uh,

1046
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:20,600
one's a DJ, DJ Carl. And then this reminds me also that there is a poster in here that connects back

1047
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:27,480
to the attraction for the cosplay contest. Um, and this really, uh, I mean, you, this manifests

1048
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,920
in the line and in your pre-show videos, but also in the store after where there are minions

1049
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:40,440
that are in costume as vicious six members or other despicable me universe villains, uh,

1050
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,320
which is some very fun specificity and really good, like figures in the gift shop. The figures in

1051
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:52,440
the gift shop are awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I like seeing the presence of, of Brad of belt is our

1052
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,960
bread, which also something we haven't talked about is the, the actual voice talent being part

1053
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,800
of basically everybody returned to do the voices and we were lucky enough to be in the recording

1054
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:09,480
session. So all of them amazing and so impressive, but especially for me personally, Trey Parker,

1055
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:17,480
uh, was really wild to see him do his thing. He was super game to do it. He was really excited.

1056
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:23,000
He's a big theme park fan himself. And so the idea of being a voicing a ride in a theme park was

1057
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,240
really fun for him. I think that's chances of a South park theme park ride are very slim.

1058
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:36,200
Given the, uh, some of the issues with the IP and, uh, the theme parks in general. Um, and so I think

1059
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,240
this was like a big shot for him at, at theme park, uh, Oh man, immortality, immortality.

1060
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,200
Yeah. Yeah. So smart. And, you know, I think, you know, obviously his voice talent, but he also

1061
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,360
cannot help himself just being creative overall in general. And he was, you know, thinking he was

1062
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,200
like, you know, wait, maybe I should do it like this, because I think if I'm yelling at them,

1063
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,200
even though it's supposed to be intense, I think that, you know, you don't want to be only intense.

1064
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,160
And he was, you know, really thinking about the, you know, guest experience of doing it. Uh,

1065
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,960
Wow. Wow. So yeah, he did a lot of questions about, you know, what exactly is happening,

1066
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,640
what are people doing? Um, and so that was really cool. Yeah. Yeah. Intimidating on any level. I

1067
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,360
mean, what a cool, I can't, like, of course it's everyone who did voices in this really impressive,

1068
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:25,800
but Trey partners, the only one for like personally, I would be just, yeah, there was a concern

1069
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:36,040
that he would be like, who wrote this funny. I was trying to figure out the timing with, um,

1070
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:42,680
the pandemic and everything of like, were there any remote, they were always record, like just

1071
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:49,240
trying to imagine Dolph Lundgren or John Claude Van Damme plug setting up a blue Yeti mic in their

1072
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,600
home. So the way these were done, they were remote, but, um, it would be the talent at a

1073
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,280
actual, like local recording. Oh, okay. But no, but the director and all the producers and everybody,

1074
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:06,520
they were remote. Yeah. Right. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Um, correct me if one of these people is not in it,

1075
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:13,240
but Taraji P. Henson, Dolph Lundgren, Danny Trejo, Lucy Lalas, John Claude Van Damme all appear in

1076
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:21,880
this, uh, attraction or any of those. One of the names, um, that you said, uh, was not able to

1077
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:27,720
appear in all of their dialogue is reuse. Um, as a result of, uh, but we, but we carefully selected

1078
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,560
the reason you won't even be able to, I believe they were having a shoulder or knee surgery.

1079
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,600
Okay. Does that narrow it down to somebody who like, I don't know.

1080
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:47,400
Taraji, you just go too hard. Um, I would like to know a little bit about

1081
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:55,400
this project or any other, any interactions with the mysterious voice of the minions, uh, Pierre,

1082
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,400
what's the last name? I don't want to bungle a French pronunciation or is it just coffin?

1083
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:07,720
What's the guy's name? Coffeen. Okay. Um, we did not have any personal interactions, uh, with him,

1084
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:13,720
but we write a lot of stuff for the minions specifically for commercials, stuff for the

1085
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:21,160
movies, stuff for this. Um, and the original minion stuff was recorded for this. Um, and what I can

1086
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:27,960
say about the, the, the, the relationship is it's, it's, he is the minions. And so you can

1087
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,840
give him stuff one of two ways. You can figure out the minion ease. That's the language, the

1088
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:39,240
minions speak yourself, or you can write it in English and say in minion ease and he'll figure

1089
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:44,360
it out. And it's kind of a balance between writing in those two styles. But you by now

1090
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,360
are comfortable with minion ease. Yeah. It's, it's tough to put your finger on exactly how it works

1091
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,280
and how it functions, but we can just kind of write it. And also, you know, sometimes he will

1092
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:01,560
make it his own in his own sort of way. But he basically, like, you, you write it

1093
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,520
in that way, you send it to him and what we get back and what's in the stuff always is just like,

1094
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,880
it's great. Like he's, he's, he's the man. He's the pro at it. There's no concern about like,

1095
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,160
well, we, we better be on the zoom on that one. Make sure he gets it. He might fuck up doing the

1096
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:22,040
minion voices. No, no, he does a great job. Okay. What have, what have we missed? Um, any, any other

1097
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,360
details you're proud of already? Like favorite parts of the experience? Uh, one thing I think

1098
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:32,280
that, I think that there are, so in the minion cafe, it's, you know, the dining room is kind of

1099
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,960
in different sections. And one of them is kind of the break room where the minions who work at the

1100
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:42,120
minion cafe, uh, where they take their break and we have some, uh, fake motivational posters that

1101
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:47,320
are minion. Yes, I like those. Yes. Yeah. Those are some fun to work on and come up with, uh, fun

1102
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,560
slogans for, but I think overall the whole experience really was, um, like anything when,

1103
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,640
you know, when you write a movie or a television show, it's a real question of like, what is this

1104
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,440
going to be like when it, you know, comes to fruition? And I think the whole thing was pretty

1105
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:07,160
wild of like thinking about it theoretically, but even more so being like, well, what is this actually

1106
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:12,840
going to feel like and be like, and overall, I mean, the whole thing is a delight. Yeah. And

1107
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,800
being on the ride was a wild experience because, you know, I've written TV shows and films where

1108
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:25,560
I've been on the set and I've also watched the finished product and it was weirdly like having

1109
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:33,400
both of those experiences at once, like being inside a fully like all four walls, no fourth wall

1110
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,320
version of a thing that I had imagined. Yeah. Um, so it was a strange feeling to sort of just be

1111
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,920
transported inside, uh, literally, um, cause when you're on set, it's a little different because

1112
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,960
there you, you, the conceit that it's all fake is there because there you, there's cameras and

1113
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,120
there's lights. It's still a process. Maybe there's like a physical item you thought of and like,

1114
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,840
wow, there's one of those. Yeah. And then when you're watching the finished product, well,

1115
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,680
you're removed from it because that's all on a screen and you're separated from the reality of

1116
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:06,200
it. But with this, I was just inside of these imagined spaces and it was a cool experience.

1117
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:14,680
Oh, and I will say one personal highlight. Uh, so, uh, our, someone who worked on this, uh, Carson,

1118
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:23,480
who you guys believe, so there is a theme park tradition where the names of people who worked on

1119
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:29,880
an attraction are, uh, put hidden somewhere inside the attraction. And there is, you know,

1120
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:37,080
a hall of infamy when you get to the end of this. And he had taken the Liberty as a fan of both

1121
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:45,320
podcasts, the ride and no boys that a commissioner Evan is on the wall. Yeah. Um, and that was, uh,

1122
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:52,280
that was a real highlight and van Vandal is the van representation. Yeah. Yeah. He shows up as

1123
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:58,440
vicious van. Oh yeah. There was some politics. It was the main name. That was the main name of the

1124
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,360
the ride and that I would somehow, uh, step on that cause confusion. But going back now to what

1125
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,520
I said about, I mean, we couldn't, we probably can't talk about more, but you two now are in,

1126
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:14,760
in the universe. Oh yeah. So they could be characters. No, that when I, when I, uh,

1127
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,840
obliquely referenced some sort of possible ride spin-off that was the van Vandal and the commissioner

1128
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:27,800
and ride that would also be film. Yeah. Which ties together, uh, the despicable me universe

1129
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:34,120
and the doughboys universe migration thing now. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then lost continents going

1130
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,680
away for this new expansion. I heard. Yes. I also, and I don't want to correct you, but I don't know

1131
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,840
if you know that your name isn't actually, it is the commissioner. Oh, it's a commissioner.

1132
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:49,240
It does not say, Oh yeah, it's even better. Um, wow. You're just breaking his heart. I'm just

1133
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:57,240
stating the commissioner is better. Um, because last names were not going to be allowed. So

1134
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,640
commissioner Susser, while that would have been very fun, last names were not going to be allowed.

1135
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,880
And then commissioner Evan is not what I would have liked to let you believe it forever. It would

1136
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,240
have been better to let you believe it for. Yeah. It's more canonically correct. Yeah. Um, I don't

1137
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,440
know how I was the one telling Mitch about that. Mitch didn't know that there was this permanent.

1138
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,000
He did. He did. This is me telling him something he'd already heard, but it was in one ear.

1139
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,240
Well, maybe the listeners to these shows will have a chance to tell Mitch themselves and it'll be like

1140
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,480
the first time he's heard that. No, I have never heard that. Definitely two people have never told

1141
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:39,000
me that. Um, can I ask, did either of you come up with the phrase Agnes's honeymoon soup? No,

1142
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,040
actually that was, I think that that was already by the people at minion cafe. Someone came to that

1143
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,240
and that was considered a, like almost a North star for all of the, for all of the food items

1144
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,560
on the menu. That's the level. I only bring that up because that was my lunch. The very

1145
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:58,840
Oh, and how was it? It was good. Yeah. I liked all the food. At the minion cafe, uh, you know,

1146
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,440
we were involved in the names. We've not, we're not involved in any of the, uh, preparation of

1147
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,520
the food or anything like that. So I feel like I can somewhat objectively say, I think it's,

1148
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:14,440
if not the best, some of the best food in the park. It seems like reviews. It seemed like what

1149
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:19,320
Jason said. And let's, let's, uh, let's talk about those tots a little bit. You have this,

1150
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,160
I like the tots a lot. Yeah. What's the official name of the tots? Does anybody know?

1151
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:29,960
I think it's just minion tots. They're more like crispy outside kind of mashed potato inside.

1152
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:37,160
And the minion faces represent it's kind of like smushed into the potato piece. Well, well, cool.

1153
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:43,240
Yeah. It seems like you got an iconic new snack there. Did you, sorry, did you say anything when

1154
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:46,840
you tried it? Was there anything like, you know, these tots are salted too much or anything. Did

1155
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:52,200
you say anything along those lines? Just, just a little bit of a like plus up. So I can say,

1156
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:58,440
um, for the, uh, there's a lot of, uh, purple evil minion desserts. Yes. I drank the drink. Yeah.

1157
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:05,000
Sure. PX 41. Um, but there's a, uh, some purple, uh, minion cupcakes and things like that.

1158
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,600
And there was during the taste testing, some people concerned about the flavor, um, being,

1159
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:21,080
seeming too medicinal because it had that sort of diamond tap grape flavor to it. Yes. And I was a

1160
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:27,480
big defender of diamond tap grape, one of the all time best flavors. Yeah, I hear you. Um, and I said

1161
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:34,760
to me, that's, that's a plus. And they kept that then. Here's my thing is that the flaming

1162
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:41,080
Mo is not medicinal in the way that it was described on the episode of the Simpsons.

1163
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,360
And it's still, I think the same kind of like orange flavor thing. And it should be more like

1164
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,000
cough medicine or something. I think so. So speaking of the flavors, I have to say the, uh,

1165
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,720
the, there's some, uh, dipped popsicles that they sell there and we got to try those. Those are

1166
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:06,840
really good. Um, and the vectors orange popsicle has a great orange flavor. Okay. Okay. Um, and the

1167
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:12,440
banana flavored minion one, they've got a terrific banana flavoring going on on all of the stuff at

1168
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:19,320
the minion land. That is not the like candy banana flavor you're used to. I don't like that

1169
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,720
flavor so much. So I know I don't know. I haven't had the universal. Okay. Yeah. I'm like curious.

1170
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:29,400
Banana runs flavor. I don't like people to put them to banana runs. I'm not, I don't like them

1171
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:37,080
personally. I don't like the people. I guess actually it came out, you know what? It really

1172
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,720
drives me nuts. And I start to dislike people that don't like banana. I have to admit it here.

1173
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:47,560
Why does it shows up on every podcast and creates discord. You just blow up the banana runs. He

1174
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,360
always brings banana, but I like banana runs, but, um, I understand. I guess if you don't like it,

1175
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,960
like the other flavors though of runs are okay. Yeah. I just, that banana run flavor is not to me.

1176
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:03,400
What do you think of a banana runs? I like it. Jason. Uh, I like it. Isn't there a whole thing

1177
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:09,240
of like, Oh, that's how bananas used to taste. And that one is exactly. Yeah, right. That's a

1178
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,280
common old wise tale common knowledge. Are you in the middle on banana runs? I'm trying to figure

1179
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:20,200
out. No, I like them. Okay. But are you saying that because I'll hate you forever. Are you afraid of

1180
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:26,120
you need to curry Mike's favor in this tense situation? I, uh, my fists are clenched again.

1181
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:31,480
Jason, you're either with me or you're with Mike. Choose, choose your favorite. They do this every

1182
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:37,720
time. Please help. Help. Help. There's always so much pointing in these records. Yeah. Uh, anyway,

1183
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,560
I should have tried. I really now, now that you're talking about banana runs, now I'm more excited

1184
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:48,120
about going to try those, but not doing what van is because it's the, it's not a similar, right?

1185
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,360
So you will never eat the banana stuff down there. Yes, I guess not. I guess I'll try it,

1186
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,800
but just only to get mad just so I can make myself upset closer to run flavor. Um, I have one more

1187
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,720
cafe question on the second gate. We just did an episode about the today cafe, which is a nearby

1188
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:10,040
restaurant. And I watched a video where Al Roker was, um, talking about his new butternut squash

1189
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:14,440
tart at the today cafe. But he also talks about the minion cafe a little bit. And he says that

1190
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:21,400
he had a dish that, uh, that was meant to be minion brains. That is something that Al Roker

1191
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:26,680
said on television. I do not know. Can you shine any light into the process? I have no idea what

1192
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,800
that is. I think what he's talking about, um, and it is not meant to be minion brains, but it's

1193
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:39,960
the udon noodle soup that is served inside. If you follow it, a lot of steps. If you haven't

1194
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,440
heard the second gate episode, and please check that out if you want, if you want more cafe talk,

1195
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:49,240
uh, but it's like, there's like a, uh, it's a translucent, it's a bowl, uh, with a minion

1196
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:55,320
face on it and you kind of turn it over and dump it. Um, and it's yellow noodles. So Al just took

1197
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:01,320
that as his, his brain saw that for interpreted that as minion brains. And then he goes on to say,

1198
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:07,240
uh, kind of grim, but tastes good. It's a tasty dish. He was, he was like upset by, he thought he

1199
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:14,360
was devouring the brain. He thought he was doing Ray Liotta, uh, eating a brain. But, uh, I think

1200
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:19,080
it's a fun, uh, fun accident. Uh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. It's open to anybody can interpret it.

1201
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,920
However, I have another, I have another good little funny story. Well, involving food while

1202
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:29,000
we were there. So, uh, at our lunch, uh, from working, uh, there was some, uh, writing the,

1203
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:36,120
I had to get done for, you know, I think for the ride that I, you know, had to do at our free time

1204
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:42,200
and I was like, okay, I just need somewhere to work inside the park. So, uh, I think with Van,

1205
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:46,760
we went and we just got a quick burger, uh, at this burger place. I'm like, okay, I'll set up

1206
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,000
my laptop here and I'm working. I'm trying to focus. I'm like, you know, as far as places and

1207
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,480
a park goes, it's just a burger place. It's relatively quiet. And then all of a sudden

1208
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:05,000
a simulated earthquake began because I was in Richter cafe, a themed San Francisco where there

1209
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,800
were earthquakes that regularly go off. So I didn't know that about Richter cafe. I've never

1210
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:16,280
been in there. I know that name. You get an alarm and rumble. So it's not, not the best place to get

1211
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:22,360
some work done after all. That's very funny. And some new information to me about Richter cafe.

1212
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,760
I've never had the pleasure. How was the burger? It was good. I thought it was good. Yeah. Yeah.

1213
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:32,520
Not as good as making cafe food. No, no, no, no, of course not. Um, I, uh, what else on the way out?

1214
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,440
And you've been working with it. You requested a pen over there. I don't mean to start if you're

1215
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,920
not ready with whatever you're up to. I've got one thing that I want to do. This is just a fun

1216
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,840
little surprise. It's going to involve some bleeping though. Okay. Got it. We've got the

1217
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:49,240
sound effect where I say, yeah, pleasant bleeping or unpleasant bleeping. Pleasant,

1218
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,640
pleasant bleeping, but it's because I want to do something groundbreaking on the podcast. Oh my God.

1219
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:59,240
Um, so we cannot say what it is, but, uh, Evan and I are working on another piece of themed

1220
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:07,320
entertainment and, uh, a full, a full physical spacey mountain. I can't, I can't get into the

1221
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,200
details of what it is, but I actually have part of a script that is in process, uh, between Evan and

1222
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:18,440
I, and, uh, because I was busy with a bug main concert, I didn't get back to Evan in time with

1223
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:24,280
this work and this is due. And so what I'm going to do right now is I am going to do a little bit

1224
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:30,120
of our work on this piece of themed entertainment live on the podcast. So this is, we're going to be

1225
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:35,400
really quick here, but this is going to be for a piece of themed entertainment somewhere.

1226
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:42,200
And it was given notes were given on it and conversation was had live on the podcast.

1227
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,440
Wow. Wow. So here's, here we go. You're hearing the creative process. So some of it,

1228
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:53,960
Evan, uh, you've got these lines, uh, in the intro, uh, for this character.

1229
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:05,400
And I think they're good, but some of them are a little long. Uh, and the windup lines specifically,

1230
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,840
I was going to say brevity is probably important. They're too long. I don't know what they are,

1231
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:18,760
but they're way too long. Um, so I think we should do another pass where we just trim down

1232
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,360
the length. Okay. Sounds good. That's it. Okay. Oh, okay. We don't get to hear the lines.

1233
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:29,720
Wow. Okay. I got to hear a little bit of the process. So you might be somewhere on this globe

1234
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,880
hearing a line and then you might think that was the perfect length for a line to be.

1235
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,200
Work that happened just now. You will know that it was tuned up, but that ultimately the length

1236
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,880
Evan got there, but Van really caused the length to be perfect by giving the note.

1237
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,960
That's correct. Can I ask why you needed the pen?

1238
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,280
To figure out what needed to happen. I hadn't read this at all. Oh, so you literally,

1239
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:58,520
that was a live thought you had. During this podcast, I have been working on this and

1240
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,440
noting this up and figuring out. What the fuck? Did you tune out when we were talking about

1241
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,440
banana runts or something? Yeah, I love banana runs, but I wasn't paying attention. So you just

1242
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:12,600
said something. Yeah. Wow. And so that was a live come up with note. I didn't come in with that

1243
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,480
note. That happened on the podcast. Geez. I think it's cool. I guess I don't like that you're kind

1244
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:24,760
of like double dipping that you're on the clock with multiple things. You're here getting a very

1245
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,720
generous guest fee and then you're also accepting another salary at the same time. But I guess it's

1246
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:35,320
that double up that lets you accomplish so many things. Contractually, we're allowed to do anything

1247
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:40,040
that's not interfering. And so I think that that meant I had to get that work done while I was here

1248
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,760
to really prove that shit. It is allowed contractually because we don't have a contract. So really

1249
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,760
anything is allowed. You could do, you guys could do what anything goes. Yeah. You're not even,

1250
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:54,280
it's nice of you both to like participate and talk at all because that's not even something that we

1251
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:58,600
contract. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. You could, you could just sit here and not tell us anything.

1252
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:03,800
That's true. But I guess it was more fun that that you talked and told us behind the scenes

1253
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:09,880
information. Can I ask one question? Yeah. How many different behind the scenes bathrooms did

1254
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:16,840
you get to go to in Universal Orlando? Stuff that's not available to the general public.

1255
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,360
Two. Two. Anything unusual about them? Eight.

1256
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:33,240
You had two scenes right? Okay. Okay. And did anything like interesting or scandalous happen

1257
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:37,400
in any of the bathrooms that we show? Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. That's good. So we'll lay off on the

1258
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:45,800
bleeps for now. But I, hey, if that kind of winds it down, then I think I can say,

1259
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:52,360
Evan Susser and Van Roche, you survived podcast The Ride. What a blast. Thank you for all of your,

1260
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:57,400
your not only behind the scenes intel, but doing behind the scenes work right in front of us.

1261
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,240
Thank you. Yeah. Fascinating to see the process. And Evan, I am going to do a pass on this. I'm

1262
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,200
not actually just kicking it back to you. What if he wants to, maybe you want to get your,

1263
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:10,920
get your hands in there. I don't know what we had to bleep from that. I said the name of the

1264
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,440
character. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, can you tell us what that is and we'll bleep again? What property you're

1265
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,320
dealing with? No, no. Unfortunately not. No. God. Shit. Yeah. All right. Then you're not even. Can

1266
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:27,080
we Google that name figured out? The name is not out there? Oh, interesting. Okay. Wow. This isn't

1267
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,600
a name that's out there, Puck. So you, I mean, in a way we don't have to bleep it because it's not.

1268
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:36,280
No, you do. Okay. You do. But we haven't signed any NDAs. Do you need to make us sign an NDA

1269
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:41,240
before, or maybe we just wrap this up before we get out of here before you can make us do that.

1270
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,680
And then we can release whatever we want. Can we name a couple of movies real quick? And you say,

1271
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,200
yes or no. I'm writing NDA on my knuckles right now. Land before time, right?

1272
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:55,640
Wedding pressures two now done as a ride and not a film. Oh, you got it.

1273
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:03,240
Wow. But we need your help to do the ultimate wedding crash. We can't do it alone this time.

1274
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:09,800
Seems good. Yeah. Getting to crash it. And then you're in like a wedding crash or vehicle using

1275
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:16,040
a wedding crash or on the tram tour and you have to come in and be like, I'm on to you. My private

1276
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,520
eye. He looked into you guys. You gotta see he's not doing all the rides at this point. He didn't

1277
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,920
do rocket in Florida. Wedding. You know what? Well, tell me where fake nose.

1278
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:34,920
Then he's in. Can be even bigger than the previous wedding crashers as a, like a bar or a club at

1279
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,360
old pleasure Island would be a really good idea. It's a wedding every night. You're always crashing

1280
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,840
your always crashing a big wedding and it's all just the tropes of a wedding. That's a great,

1281
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,760
but there are characters playing. There's going to have to be a few performers, but it's of course,

1282
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,800
as the years go on, there'll be fewer and fewer. Yeah. So there'll be like a bride and a groom by

1283
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,480
the end. Kind of like a Tony and Tina's. Yes. Oh, which we didn't do this year yet. I wanted to do

1284
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,600
Tony and Tina's wedding this year, but we didn't do it. I would love to do Tony and Tina's. They

1285
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,480
have, yeah. How do we do? Where do we go? I don't know if it's running right now, but we'll have to

1286
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:19,400
figure that out. There's a nice Peter out. Yeah. So yeah, Tina's performance losing after the dessert

1287
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:25,320
course. All right. I had a good idea. And then, okay, well, we forgot one thing, which is exiting

1288
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,440
through the gift shop. Yeah. Is there anything you'd like to. What I want to plug the ride.

1289
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:35,480
Yeah. Go to the minion blast. Oh yeah. That's right. Wait a minute. Wow. For the first time,

1290
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:41,160
one in the same, the plug and the topic. I don't think that's, uh, well, maybe to some extent it's

1291
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:45,320
happened before or people are on plugging something. This is perfect. Wow. Symmetry. Yeah.

1292
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:49,880
Doubling up on any, anything else to throw up at you. I feel like I'm throwing it to you,

1293
