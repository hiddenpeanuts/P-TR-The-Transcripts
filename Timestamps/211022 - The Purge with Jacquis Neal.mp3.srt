1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,580
This is not a test.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,660
This is your emergency podcast system announcing the commencement of a purge episode sanctioned

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,820
by hot cast the fright.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,740
Commencing at the theme song, any and all body topics, including murder will be legal for

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,780
90 continuous minutes.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,760
Blessed be our guests, J'Kees Neil and Halloween Horror Nights, a Universal Studios seasonal

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,460
event reborn.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:46,900
May God be with you all.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,380
Welcome to haunt cast the fright, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who would use

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,140
a real life purge scenario to switch clothes with the robots on Pirates of the Caribbean.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,300
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,640
Twelve hours.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,180
All crime is legal for 12 hours.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,180
That's right.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,740
I think I could get in and out of there.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
Easily.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,140
Yeah, we get a few outfits.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Scott Garner here.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,460
Are you already scheming for what outfits you would steal from which robot?

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,420
Well, I'd want to wear isn't there one balancing five hats?

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,660
And then I'd want to like just to get bang for the most clothes.

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,740
Let's get under those five hats.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
You would steal the five hats.

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,900
Jason, do you have a pirate?

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,660
You would his outfit?

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,860
Um, I well, maybe the one with the pigs, the one who's rolling in the slaps rolling in

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,860
the slop.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,500
You know, it feels appropriate, you know, for the night for the events of purge night

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,780
to then have a slot code on.

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,840
You would do all your murders wearing the pirate's outfit covered in and explaining

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
like, guess what?

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Guess what?

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,880
This is that would be like your version of like, do you know how I got these scars?

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,560
Or did you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
And with like 15 minutes left, I'll flip it.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,040
What do you mean with whatever unscrupulous Susniana collectors are out and about doing

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,760
deals of like, oh, flip it for money.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,640
Oh, I thought you were going to flip like the phrase on its head.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
And I was like, oh, you're going to or the or your clothes.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Yeah, flip it inside out.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
So I look nicer.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah.

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,760
So the mud is on the inside comes up the second siren when the second siren sounds.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
I want to look right.

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm glad you know more of the rules of the purchase.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,440
I know the rules, but I'm I'd had the I'm a little rusty.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,780
So it's a thing where I have seen cumulatively one purge movie pieces of every movie adds

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,960
up to one movie.

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
But I know a lot about the lore about the new founding fathers.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
I know about the new.

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Let's let's bring our guys.

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,680
He knows probably more actor, podcaster, you know him from Marvel's What If and Culture

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Kings.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
This is J'Key's Neil.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh, what's up, fellas?

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Hey, man.

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,080
How are we doing?

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Pretty good.

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
We're getting ready to be in here.

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,320
We ready to talk some rides, everybody.

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes, we are.

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,560
Thanks for reaching out.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,600
We never know who's a theme park guy.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
And you get us up.

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
But now we know we're always happy.

69
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
We want to know all of it.

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
We want to know everybody.

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
We hear.

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Yeah.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
It's kind of wild, too.

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,360
I I went to I've been a theme park person my whole life.

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,280
I went to Disney World the first time in my life at 21.

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,320
OK, I became a Disney park guy.

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
That's an adult Disney.

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,240
I'm always impressed with that.

79
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Yeah.

80
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah.

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Because you didn't have the little kid like brain for it.

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,440
If I ever have kids, you know, listen, ladies, if you want to have a kid with me, I'm telling

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,640
you now, telling you now, we ain't taking the kids to Disney World until they're at

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
least 13.

85
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't think it's a place for kids.

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I think it's a place for adults.

87
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
A lot of people listening to this show are like, yes.

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Yes.

90
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
They pump their fist at that.

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,280
Almost all the times I've spent like significant hours I've spent away from my child so far

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,080
as 18 months have been at theme parks without him.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah.

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,400
So much leaving him to go on kiddie rides.

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah.

96
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Disneyland, I'll take the kids.

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Disney World is a vacation.

98
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
That's for me.

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Oh, yeah.

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah.

101
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,120
They got to be able to handle it and roughen it and like, you know, do it.

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,560
You were saying you're going, you're going to go, you're going to do nine days, you're

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,680
going to do a big like kids have to be ready to deal with a big, a big old.

104
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
And they can't.

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
They're not.

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Yeah.

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Yeah.

108
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
They're not.

109
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
They're finicky.

110
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
You don't want tantrums.

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,400
When you were 21 and you went.

112
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Yeah.

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,040
You look at like the handful of things you were like, whoa, this is this is so.

114
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
This.

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
All right.

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
So I.

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,840
So I went it was my graduation present to myself.

118
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,360
I had just graduated college, Columbia College, which I'm sure you know you're from Chicago.

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,840
And it was also me and my girlfriends at the time one year anniversary.

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
So we went together.

121
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,320
She went when she was a kid, but she hadn't been since she was like 12 or some shit.

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,440
And I went and I didn't know what to expect, but I was excited to go Magic Kingdom.

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,640
I don't remember exactly the first park I went to, but I think the first fireworks show,

124
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,000
I was like, oh man, this is like dreams at the time was going on.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,640
This is the way this is always so I was like, oh, this is like crazy.

126
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,240
This is dope.

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,680
And then I saw Fantasmic and I was like, I love this shit.

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Fantastic was the coolest.

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,920
I mean, I'm from the South Side of Chicago.

130
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,080
I don't see no shit like Fantasmic in Chicago.

131
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,920
Like you're watching this and this show, all these this water and then Mickey's down below

132
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,160
and then a little fireworks and he pops back up at the top and I'm like, this is the best

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,440
thing I've ever seen in my life.

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,560
I think that's the moment I fell in love like with the Disney parks and Disney in general.

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
I get that the music, I assume.

136
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,240
Also very memorable.

137
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
It's great.

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,840
Do you ever listen to Fantasmic theme just in the car?

139
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Not in the car.

140
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,960
I have. I have.

141
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
OK, sure.

142
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Sure.

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,680
In the last 24 hours?

144
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,120
I mean, you know, add a couple, add 10 hours to that, you know, and then you got the answer.

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,520
No, I've listened to I've listened to them.

146
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,000
I mean, it's good music.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
It makes me feel like I'm in the park.

148
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,120
I've been in Disney World five times now and like I miss it sometimes.

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,640
So every once in a while, I'll like listen to like the firework theme music or some shit.

150
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
And I'm like, this is cool.

151
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,840
This is cool. Yeah.

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah, that's I mean, we have you seen like and maybe I'm introducing something that'll be like

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
you'll get sucked in loops.

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,720
They have just sort of like long multi hour loops for sort of like walking around in Tomorrowland.

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
The area music.

156
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,440
Yeah, the background music.

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
No, I have not done that.

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
All on YouTube.

159
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
I don't know if I can.

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
That might be that might be that's dangerous.

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,000
It is dangerous.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
Yeah, I hate loops.

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,720
I like it's a small world.

164
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,080
Is the worst ride of all time.

165
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,520
Like I immediately fall asleep when I is my nap time.

166
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Whenever I go, I go every time I go to any Disney Park.

167
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,360
It's a good that is a 15 minute allotted nap here.

168
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,200
Yeah, I was just talking up.

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:04,040
I like take a little nap on the Mexico Bo ride or I accidentally fell asleep on the Haunted Mansion.

170
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,440
Yeah, my first time after pandemic, a little ride nap.

171
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
I've been advocating.

172
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,520
Ride nap is quintessential for a long day at any park.

173
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,320
Yeah.

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,680
And there's like that we've talked about it before to the Orlando air conditioning.

176
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Specifically, there's something about getting from humid inside.

177
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
There's a weird smell to it, but I like it.

178
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,440
I don't know how to even describe that smell.

179
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,160
You know what I'm talking about?

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
I know what you're talking about.

181
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,720
Well, in the Orlando elements, you need the ride naps because the heat and the sun and

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
the humidity will just beat you up.

183
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
It will beat your ass.

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,120
Oh, yeah.

185
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,880
I was first time I went in.

186
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh, it was June, which is dumb.

187
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,680
Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,960
Oh, so hot.

189
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,400
I was I remember at one point I was just like in a tank like my little like tight tank tops

190
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
that you used to wear.

191
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,000
And I'm like pulling my shorts up like it is hot.

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
And I'm from Chicago.

193
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,560
We got humidity.

194
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,040
Oh, yeah.

195
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
Like that Florida.

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah, that's another.

197
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
It's crazy.

198
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
You were just saying, too, and we'll get to like the scary stuff in a bit.

199
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,920
But you said something that we all like gasped right before we started recording.

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,360
That you have done a voice that is currently being used somewhere in Disney.

201
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, we don't know anything about this.

202
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,840
So, yeah, reveal it here.

203
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,440
Yeah.

204
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,000
So I have a voice at Epcot right now and is actually Donald Duck.

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,400
But but not like the traditional like not that Donald Duck.

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
So in DuckTales, DuckTales came back recently.

207
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,760
And in that TV show, there are episodes where Donald Duck shows up

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,080
and he puts a voice modulator in this and then he can speak regularly.

209
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,440
And on a cartoon that's Don Cheadle.

210
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,920
Don Cheadle was like, I ain't doing this shit for you all for Disney World.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,840
And so I got it.

212
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
You're a voice match for Don.

213
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,040
But you're a voice match for Don Cheadle as Donald,

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,240
which is funny because my role in Marvel's What If is also a roadie.

215
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,880
So for whatever reason, people think I sound like Don Cheadle.

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,320
Or I can do his voice well when I try.

217
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,840
But I guess I don't know.

218
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,640
I don't want to put you on the spot, but like, do you what do you have any like?

219
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,360
What do you do to make yourself?

220
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
So I mean, like, it's been a minute since I've done it.

221
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,720
But like so Don Cheadle, like Don Cheadle, like first, like he like softens his voice up.

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,240
And, you know, he'll he'll he'll say,

223
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
hey, we all about that superhero life here, you know, like he'll

224
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,760
I mean, it's way softer than my voice.

225
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,880
A little hushed, a little hushed.

226
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah, very slick, very together.

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,840
Very slick, very together.

228
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
Tony Stank Stank. I like that. I like that.

229
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,480
So like just a little like little like little swag, but

230
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,960
articulate slag is swag is what I called it.

231
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,240
Wow. Yeah, that's really good.

232
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,560
I hear that when I when if I have a job, then I'll like listen to it

233
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
and like really get into it.

234
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,120
But like, yeah, I got that, which was the cool.

235
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,440
I've been very lucky over the past two years booking a lot of dope

236
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
veal things and the coolest thing I've booked,

237
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,680
which is nowhere near as much money as I made for other things.

238
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,880
But the coolest thing I've booked is the thing Epcot.

239
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah. Where is it? Yeah.

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
What's the thing?

241
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,040
I so that I don't exactly know because I haven't been to actually see it.

242
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,120
I do know that it is so they were doing

243
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,360
it's like a new interactive thing in one of their new building

244
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,280
because they are revamping that quite a bit.

245
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,120
Or we may be in the play pavilion.

246
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
Is that which maybe is not open?

247
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,360
Is that? Well, it was open last year.

248
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,480
OK, OK.

249
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,360
I know they had it in something last year because I recorded that

250
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,560
in summer for Christmas of 2020.

251
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,720
OK, OK. So it is DuckTales World Showcase Adventure.

252
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,960
Does that sound right?

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,080
That is exactly it. I think it's coming.

254
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, it's not open.

255
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,280
Twenty two. Oh, it's not even open yet.

256
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,520
It's not open yet.

257
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,280
It was supposed to open twenty twenty and it was one of the things that got pushed back.

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
OK, you missed it then.

259
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,880
So I haven't missed it yet.

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,080
Maybe I should go for the opening day.

261
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
It's gotta be dope.

262
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Staying outside. Disney World yet, apparently.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
This is the thing about voiceover, especially for animation or animated stuff.

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,720
You'll do it a year plus before it even drops.

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,680
So you kind of forget about it.

266
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,000
I had no idea it didn't open yet.

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,120
You probably did in there like, oh, it's opening in like three months.

268
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
You're like, oh, cool. OK. Yeah.

269
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Yeah. I was like, well, I'm not going.

270
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,640
So yeah, I kind of just I didn't forget about it, but I didn't like follow up

271
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
to make sure it actually opened.

272
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
Yeah. We're we're we're it's in the World Showcase.

273
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
Does it say where it specifically is there?

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
I think it's going to be throughout World Showcase,

275
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,080
because there used to be like a Phineas and Ferb like kind of

276
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,840
scavenger hunt sort of thing.

277
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,160
Kim Possible at one point in time. And Kim Possible.

278
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,560
So I think this is then technological upgrade where very cool.

279
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,040
There's spots and the Play Disney Parks app is involved.

280
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,720
They were very hush hush.

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,160
There's probably more information on it now, because when I booked it,

282
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,200
it was very hush hush.

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,280
It was just this. These are your line.

284
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,200
Working for Disney is crazy.

285
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
Like these are your lines.

286
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,360
This is your own password to log in.

287
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,520
It will self destruct in 24 hours.

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,920
You will never be able to go on this site again.

289
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,840
You is and I'm not even joking.

290
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Like, that's exactly how they work.

291
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,920
Wow. But you're I mean, it's crazy.

292
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,560
You're Donald. That's pretty.

293
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,800
It's crazy. It is crazy.

294
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Parks. It is crazy.

295
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
I don't equate it as I'm Donald Duck.

296
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,800
Like that would be the easiest thing to say is, yeah, yeah.

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Donald Duck at Epcot.

298
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,640
But because it's not the Donald Duck voice, you know, so people are asking you

299
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,360
to do that voice, which is nearly impossible.

300
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,320
We've been tested and we're forced.

301
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,600
It is impossible. Yeah, it is.

302
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
It's very hard and it kills your voice.

303
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,280
Whoever kudos to whoever does it.

304
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,360
I think he has I heard some intel that he has like a limit.

305
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,560
He says like clock starts now.

306
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,680
I can't do it.

307
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,120
Literally can't do it.

308
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Yes, to certain with Tony and Selma.

309
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
I think that's smart.

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
Yeah, because they may be pushing your limit.

311
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,080
You're like, hey, give me give me a series.

312
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,320
Do three. Do ABC.

313
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
You probably like you get in the A.

314
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,920
And that's it.

315
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah, you can't blame him.

316
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,960
Yeah. Hopefully they'll just replace Donald's voice permanently with with you.

317
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,720
That would be nice. That would be a listen.

318
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Disney, I know you listening.

319
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,240
We know they're listening.

320
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,280
They don't like to respond.

321
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,240
They don't like to respond, but I know you listening.

322
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,360
I know by they than people who work at various stores and restaurants

323
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,200
and parks.

324
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,480
It was that counts as they've met a few inside.

325
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,240
We've met a few people who are like varying levels of varying levels.

326
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,320
Yeah, like inside by working.

327
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,840
Some levels that have made us go, oh, no.

328
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,640
What do they hear us say? Oh, no, that's fine.

329
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,720
I know what you're talking about.

330
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,520
Hint to me, what level were we?

331
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,720
What level? Oh, I don't know that it meant illegal.

332
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,920
Play legal. Yeah.

333
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,800
I wasn't as scared as Jason made it seem.

334
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,080
They also talked to somebody who has the last name, Iger.

335
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,200
We were.

336
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
He's that's talk about varying levels.

337
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,200
He's not even the CEO.

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
Is that who cares?

339
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
It's even not even anything to brag about.

340
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,520
Yeah. And I hear it's because we said some bad stuff about him.

341
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,160
That's gone.

342
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,440
I hear he's trying to get through our back catalog before he finally leaves.

343
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,960
That's why he's extending it by six months.

344
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
He's stuck on the city walk.

345
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Yeah, he's stuck.

346
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,920
A lot to get through.

347
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,000
City walk gag.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,360
He can't get through it. Yeah.

349
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah. OK, so let's talk scary.

350
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh, yes. The Halloween season.

351
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah. Do it.

352
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,520
When we asked if you had thoughts about about scary stuff or haunt

353
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,720
cast the fright here, the scary month.

354
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,160
And you and you sure did.

355
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,520
It seems like you're like you're into haunts in general.

356
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
I mean, I'm into it.

357
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,760
I listen today is a Thursday.

358
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
Tomorrow I'm going to the Hayride.

359
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,520
OK, Saturday I'm going to Knott's Berry's scary or not scary.

360
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,240
Oh, great.

361
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,320
Two weeks ago, I was at Horror Nights.

362
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
I mean, I'm there.

363
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,800
I love it. Great. I love it.

364
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,480
Fresh from it. Did you did you do Fright Fest?

365
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,840
I haven't done Fright Fest in years, which is funny because I have Six Flags

366
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,720
season pass.

367
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,320
I have a crazy story with Fright Fest that I can tell you guys.

368
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,760
We would love to hear pretty.

369
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,200
We love Fright Fest on this podcast.

370
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,840
So Fright Fest. I used to love Fright Fest.

371
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,720
Obviously, Great America.

372
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Sure. Yeah, we we had Fright Fest at in Gurney, Illinois.

373
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,480
And I so we were there one time.

374
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,600
And this is back in the O.G. days where like they could touch you and shit.

375
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
And like they was really they were really trying to scare you.

376
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,040
It was not sanitized to the degree it kind of is now.

377
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,280
Rule wasn't in place recently.

378
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,600
I thought that was always a rule.

379
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,760
No, they used to.

380
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,840
I I specifically remember.

381
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,000
I mean, they couldn't like molest you or like,

382
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,080
but they could like tap you on your shoulders and like really get in your face

383
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,480
and like put their little hands on you and stuff like that.

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,160
It's crazy. Yeah.

385
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,960
So we were in line for a maze.

386
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,120
It was me and like four people.

387
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,880
And we get in line.

388
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
We're kind of like as we're like at the back of the line,

389
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
like we walk in with the back of the line.

390
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,840
And as we get in line, this girl solo gets in line behind us.

391
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
And it's a long line, about our 10 minute wait

392
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,280
and like about 10, 15 minutes of us talking.

393
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
She like reaches out to she like injects,

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,280
interjects herself into our conversations like,

395
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
do you guys mind if I go in with you?

396
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,880
Like, I don't want to go into this ride by myself.

397
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
It's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
So we got to know Jasmine,

399
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,920
you know, because like I said, it's an hour long wait.

400
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,440
So we're talking, we're laughing, you know, we're chopping it up.

401
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,800
We're enjoying the wait.

402
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,200
And we finally get in.

403
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,480
And then like they put it, they take us in in the group.

404
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,160
It's like a group right in front of us and us.

405
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,640
So it's only like eight people because that's before they used to cattle you into.

406
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,240
And we're in there.

407
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,160
And then about 30 seconds into like the the actual like maze,

408
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,520
something jumps out of us, out of us and grabs her and takes her back.

409
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Whoa.

410
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,840
So we're all like, what the what?

411
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,520
But like, we don't know this girl.

412
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,360
So we kind of just like, uh, and now we're on edge.

413
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,800
Now we're on edge and we're walking through and like we're like, what do we do?

414
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,040
And so we just kind of keep going and we're just so now now we're extra jumpy.

415
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,840
Yeah, of course.

416
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,160
And then like toward the end of the maze, this girl pops out and is Jasmine.

417
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
She's like bloody now.

418
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,760
And she's like she was a part of the fucking ride.

419
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,520
Wow. She was a part of the maze.

420
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,560
She was a part of the maze.

421
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,840
Like she's like, help me, please.

422
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,920
She's calling our names specifically and like,

423
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,720
and then like they like grab her back and like, you know, apparently kill her.

424
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,680
But yeah, she was a part of the ride.

425
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,840
And I was like, this is the dopest thing I've ever.

426
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,080
Yeah. Experience.

427
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
I was maybe like 15 at that point.

428
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,040
Especially ago.

430
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,520
It was pretty dope. So yeah, what a job.

431
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,880
She only does that probably like twice a day, twice a night.

432
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah. I wonder like how many times they had.

433
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm sure now because because you're saying now they just like everybody kind of walks through.

434
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah, it's sort of really hard to do it now.

435
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,520
Yeah, because you'd really have to like make sure everyone was in groups.

436
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,160
And then there's like that have to be an interval between groups.

437
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah. Yeah. They probably can't do that, but that is such a great trick.

438
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,920
Pretty great. It was pretty great. Yeah.

439
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,280
I loved it. So I love RayFest.

440
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,720
I have not been to the one out here yet. OK. I should go.

441
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, we we we did go two years ago and

442
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,680
there's a lot of teens and a lot of fog.

443
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,280
And yeah, you know, I don't want to I don't want to ruin it.

444
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,640
But we're going back next year. OK.

445
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
And it is

446
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,400
junky, but good. OK.

447
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,480
I mean, that sounds like Six Flags.

448
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
Yeah. Yeah.

449
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,560
There's if you're worried that the Tasmanian devil is still not well represented, he is.

450
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh, still everywhere at Six Flags.

451
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,000
Magic. Beautiful. Beautiful.

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,880
So, yeah, you were saying

453
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,960
you were into that stuff.

454
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
You're into Disney Haunted Mansion.

455
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Yeah. Love that.

456
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,200
Mansion. Love it all.

457
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,120
And I I love the haunted like live stuff.

458
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,800
Was not a fan of haunted movies for a long time.

459
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,880
But OK, I'm starting to get back into them.

460
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,440
But like live in the flesh, I'm there for it.

461
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,480
I'm there for it. It makes me want to fight.

462
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
I don't know.

463
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,800
Oh, they love to hear that. Oh, they love to hear that.

464
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,360
I would never touch a scare actor.

465
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,400
OK, I'm a professional myself.

466
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,880
I get it. But I guess I like that.

467
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,080
It gets your adrenaline going. Yeah.

468
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,040
If you had to, if it came to that, you would be ready.

469
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm ready. I'm ready.

470
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,200
Now I make a joke out of it.

471
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Like I'll go through horror nights and I'll like, dude,

472
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,280
like the fake like fights just like as a joke,

473
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
like just to make people laugh around me.

474
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,000
But like it's it's a good time.

475
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,480
It's always a good time. I love it.

476
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,920
Yeah, I get that. I it's not I don't know if I've ever thought about like,

477
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,160
oh, this is fighting energy for me.

478
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,240
But it's definitely like I just like sky.

479
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,400
I never sky dove or anything, but it feels like that.

480
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Or you're like, it's a safe way to get your adrenaline up.

481
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,360
It is a safe way.

482
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,800
I truly do think it's fighting energy.

483
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,440
People are jumping in your face.

484
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,400
Yeah, I know you're close to fight energy as you could get.

485
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,680
Think about it.

487
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,760
If a stranger jumps in your face on the street, there was.

488
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,320
Yeah, I'm trying to think of like the closest.

489
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,080
I've never been in a fight.

490
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,120
Believe it or not, a guy who does a theme park podcast has not ever had a real fight.

491
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
Oh, man. We got to get you.

492
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
We got to get you in the fight.

493
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,480
You know what? Oh, that's right.

494
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Mike loves fights.

495
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
If we can get me into fighting for real,

496
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,000
I like pro wrestling, but real fights.

497
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,600
This is your path to become the Rogan of the show.

498
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,720
In two years, you look like him.

499
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
The hair is gone.

500
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,840
HGH and I'm getting in fights after Horror Nights.

501
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Yeah. I mean, look, if we lack for content in a couple of years.

502
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,320
Yes, I will do it.

503
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,520
You know what to do for the for the seven dollar tier.

504
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,520
Yeah.

505
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,720
I need that extra two dollars.

506
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,600
Closest I've ever been to a fight, it was at a wedding.

507
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,360
Oh, wow. I think it was like not so long.

508
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm just trying to think of it. Yeah.

509
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,040
And it is it's it is the same feeling.

510
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,640
It is like a like your body's like, I'm ready to do something with all of this.

511
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,000
And it is. Yeah. When Frankenstein attacks you or I can imagine, though,

513
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,280
I wonder, like, obviously not.

514
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,080
I usually only go to these big corporate, these not scary, the universal.

515
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,640
I wonder, there's got to be still places that can push you around a little bit.

516
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,000
They're 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,160
The desert. There's some weird ones like 40 minutes off the strip

518
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,040
that I've never been to that I'm like, they probably they they they mess with you.

519
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,560
There's some somebody I've never been to this and I would never go

520
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
because I'm not insane.

521
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,640
But like there is somebody I don't know the name of it, but they were like, yeah.

522
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,000
And like their goal is to torture you, like to get you to mentally break.

523
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,480
And like you're there for like four hours.

524
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,560
And yeah, like I'm not I'm not that's true fighting.

525
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,840
Now I'm ready to fight. Yeah.

526
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,080
You're ready to fight. Yeah.

527
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
At that point, there's no choice.

528
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
There's no choice.

529
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,280
I think a lot of those you usually have to sign a waiver.

530
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,480
But there and there was one downtown for years, downtown L.A.,

531
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,240
where they're like, OK, so they start by putting a bag over your head.

532
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,440
And then they lock you in a room.

533
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
And I'm like, OK, I already am uncomfortable.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,640
Like, that sounds like a nightmare.

535
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah. You're you're you're off kilter already.

536
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

537
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,680
The indie haunt circuit.

538
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,720
That's a question.

539
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,400
Are you going to start before the

540
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,280
your UFC days?

541
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,800
Do you? Well, before a 40 year old man gets into UFC in a few years,

542
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,640
although, you know, other 40 year olds have tried it.

543
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,320
Do I do the Indy Haunt?

544
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,960
I mean, I've done a little at last week.

545
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,160
We talked about how I failed at one.

546
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,200
I had an anxiety attack before doing an escape room. Oh.

547
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,040
But threat of a minotaur like it's going to be a really

548
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,400
I wasn't afraid of the minotaur. It's not really that's not that's a miss.

549
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
There was an issue. Yeah.

550
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
It was you were having this other issue.

551
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,400
But it's certainly in my head turned into that you were like flat.

552
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
You had very vivid nightmares of a 30 foot tall.

553
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,000
For the fun of the podcast.

554
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes. The narrative is that I was afraid of the minotaur.

555
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,760
But not the communal hoods that had been passed around.

556
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,320
No, they did pass hoods to us to put on our heads to get walked in.

557
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,360
Yes, because it was a horror escape room.

558
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,080
So they walked you in with a hood on.

559
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,840
And I was having some claustrophobia in regards to the mask.

560
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,760
And then the idea of a 90 minute tight quarters.

561
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,920
It was not the minotaur that was scaring me, although

562
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
it didn't help that it was a minute.

563
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,120
Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, this sounds awful.

564
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
Yeah. I mean, my friend was fun.

565
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
My friends did it.

566
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,720
They sounded like they were in a ball because it was literally happening

567
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,160
outside the room while I waited in the most pathetic way possible.

568
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,960
All right. But here is here is the only part of the story.

569
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,200
Not that matters, but that like dictates whether you were right

570
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
or wrong in this situation to say it out. Did they escape?

571
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,840
They they did escape.

572
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,200
They had a lot of problems with the first room.

573
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,480
And it's one of the escape rooms, I think, where like the mad scientist was like,

574
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,160
well, why don't you look over here?

575
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,360
Why don't you come over to the right side of the room?

576
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
Yeah.

577
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,600
I mean, to give you a hint.

578
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,680
Yeah. So I think they did.

579
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,840
But I think it was maybe I think they said after they were done

580
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
that it was clear that at a certain point, at a certain time,

581
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
the whole game clicked into easy mode.

582
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
Oh, OK. OK.

583
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,160
I think that's how they put it.

584
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,200
So they did.

585
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,400
They would have escaped earlier if you were in there.

586
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,200
That you know what?

587
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Someone in the group was being nice and said the same thing.

588
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,560
We needed you, man.

589
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,640
We got to the wire, bro. We got to the wire.

590
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,040
We'll have to do it again with you.

591
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,000
I got to do it again, unfortunately.

592
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,360
I have to conquer my fears here.

593
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,000
But in the yeah, I've done a little of the indie haunt scene.

594
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,720
But the phrase that we just made up, the indie haunt scene.

595
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,680
They're willing to regard it. It sounds cool, though.

596
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
When we did the Delirium show, we had to like hide under a bed

597
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,160
because the good robot told us to us he was dying because the bad robot was coming.

598
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,720
Yes, we did an immersive thing that it was like very intense.

599
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,040
And like you have to like roll under beds while like officers come.

600
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,200
Some like that sounds fun to me. It was fun.

601
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Yeah, that was very fun.

602
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,360
Yeah. Climbing in our rope.

603
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,720
Yeah, you guys swung on a rope.

604
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,880
We got went on a different path and had to like crawl into rocks and stuff.

605
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,200
But there's this thing.

606
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,560
Yeah, there's a thing called Delirium and there's a horror version of it now,

607
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,800
which we probably should go try as well.

608
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,560
But OK, giving me you know, I mean, mental note.

609
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,880
I love that. I've done some more and all that type of stuff.

610
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
I bet you would love this. Yeah, probably.

611
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,360
It's such a long thing, but it's not yet not in the tight quarters.

612
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,560
And I don't know if there's a minute term, but how's the stuff this year?

613
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,680
But I guess most of it you're about to do.

614
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,800
But you did Horror Nights. I did Horror Nights.

615
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,040
Yeah, man. Horror Nights.

616
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,800
Horror Nights is weird, man, because I do enjoy it.

617
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,280
Like the first time I ever went to Horror Nights was 2013.

618
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,880
I was fresh out to L.A.

619
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,840
I moved in 2012. So

620
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,480
and at that point, it wasn't like I went off peak season.

621
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I always go off peak season and it was fine.

622
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,080
Like it was still kind of like we're putting groups in instead of like cattle.

623
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,840
And then like around 2016, around that time, I don't know.

624
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,960
Like everybody just decided, you know what?

625
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm going to do Horror Nights, too.

626
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,960
Even though it's been around for a long time, it's gotten so much more popular.

627
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,080
It feels like in the past, like four or five years where it's kind of miserable now.

628
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,760
So like it's really miserable because it's just too packed.

629
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm talking lines of like two and a half hours to get to be just cattle, Dan.

630
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,760
So I didn't go to Horror Nights and like 17 or 18

631
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,320
because I went to Horror Nights in Orlando, which was great

632
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,840
because it's so much bigger.

633
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,440
Yeah. And it just seems like a party.

634
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,880
It's a party. It's a 100% party.

635
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,160
Yeah. So fun.

636
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,720
And like and they also had I mean, I think now they I know now they do.

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,760
They opened up Wizarding World during Horror Nights.

638
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
But at that point, they weren't.

639
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
But in Orlando, they did.

640
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,120
So you can go into like Wizarding World and it was like horror themed still, too.

641
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,840
It was pretty dope.

642
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,400
I went this week.

643
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,280
It was just as packed as like there's

644
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,160
COVID never existed.

645
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,240
It was just as packed as it's ever been.

646
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,440
Just like off putting for sure.

647
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,760
Just when even if there's not, you know, even if there's no actual danger,

648
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,400
you're just like, I've not been in a crowd of this nature in a year and a half.

649
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,840
It's pretty wild, man. It's pretty wild.

650
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
I will say this.

651
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
If you are lucky enough to afford it.

652
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Do express. Yeah.

653
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,240
We got there and we saw the line and we was like,

654
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,040
let's pull the trigger.

655
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,560
We still did it after you were in because Mike didn't get to Mike was too late.

656
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,920
It was sold out. It was sold out.

657
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,240
Yeah, we we we did it literally as before they opened the doors at seven.

658
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,080
Oh, yeah, that's why we saw how packed it was like to get in. Yeah.

659
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,680
Hey, the lines were always to the security line.

660
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,400
So we was like, let's just do it.

661
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,840
And when I tell you I'm an asshole when I when I get to express lanes,

662
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
like I do a Vince McMahon walk and everybody

663
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,840
like who's like I do, I do a straight power walk, man.

664
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Yeah, it is my thing. I love it.

665
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
I think it's so funny.

666
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,280
And eventually I felt bad because I was like, this is terrible

667
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,760
because they shuttle you in front of that entire line

668
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,120
and like just put you right in and you're walking past two hour lines

669
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,960
and cut it all of them like Fastpass is a little different because you,

670
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,920
you know, you eventually merge in with the real line.

671
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,200
And sometimes you can have your own line. Right.

672
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,880
It was none of that.

673
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,280
And you're going by the people that have waited the longest

674
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,080
because they're the front of the line. Yeah.

675
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,520
So it's not even like you're like the back of line.

676
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
It just got. They don't know. They don't know.

677
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,760
They don't know. They don't know to pay me.

678
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,800
These people set up the fajita effects like chilies.

679
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,800
But for theme part, like they like everyone in the line waiting

680
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,880
can see the express going to the front of the line and just going like,

681
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
oh, I should do that. I should have done that.

682
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,080
What can I ask what the fajita effect is?

683
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,360
Do you know? You know what this means?

684
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Yeah. So the fajita effect at places like Chili's and stuff is sizzling.

685
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,480
They put it on the sizzling skillet in the plate.

686
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,520
And they purposely from the kitchen to the table, take a circuitous route

687
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,960
so that it like wafts the smell, wafts throughout the room.

688
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,360
And then they sell more fajitas because people feel like, oh, I should order that.

689
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm a big Chili's fan and I actually didn't wasn't familiar with that right away.

690
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,840
Yeah. So that's also is the fajitas at Chili's have to be superb, correct?

691
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,920
I can only imagine.

692
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,600
They're fine. They're fajitas. They're seen everywhere pretty much.

693
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,960
They smell amazing.

694
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,960
They smell better than taste. Yeah.

695
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,640
Yeah. OK. So so you did front of the line, which yeah, that is the way to go.

696
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,400
If you can do it.

697
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Way to go. Otherwise, it would have been a miserable night.

698
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,680
So that's kind of where it is now.

699
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,400
And that was September. I went on the day of my birthday, September 30th.

700
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,080
So going even now, now that it's October, closer to Halloween.

701
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,880
It's crazier, doesn't it? Yeah.

702
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
It gets crazy. Yeah.

703
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,680
We did it last weekend.

704
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,920
And I mean, the only other thing I could say you could do

705
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,600
is get the frequent fear pass, which is like 200.

706
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
Yeah. And then just go like the last two hours every night.

707
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,320
Yeah, that's smart.

708
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,840
And then that's like way down the line will be way down that way.

709
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,200
I guess you have to figure out parking if you want to save.

710
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,760
You can park down on Lancashire, my guess.

711
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,000
Walk up, take the tram if you want to be frugal, which believe me,

712
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,440
I've done it a few times.

713
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,600
Yeah. You also you can also take like the bus there.

714
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
You know, I've done that.

715
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,600
I mean, I live close, so it's not that hard for me.

716
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,680
But subway subway stop, right?

717
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
So my stop is right there.

718
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,800
You know, red line. Yeah.

719
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,880
So there's ways you can do it.

720
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,600
There's ways you can experience it and not be miserable.

721
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,840
Then this year, were there highlight?

722
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,240
We talked a little bit about it last week.

723
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,880
What were your highlights at Horror Nights at Horror Nights?

724
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,040
Um, the Frankenstein maze was very good.

725
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,880
Frankenstein maze was very good.

726
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
I actually like I wasn't expecting to like it because it was

727
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,160
seemingly like the most unpopular one as far as the way time.

728
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,560
No, it's zero weight. Yeah.

729
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,320
So that was pretty cool.

730
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
I should at this point, I've started to forget.

731
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,520
There was a Pandora's box.

732
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,000
There was Halloween for Halloween for Pandora's box.

733
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,240
There was the ghost or the haunting hill.

734
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,280
I think Hill House. Yeah.

735
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,440
I would think I think Frankenstein was my favorite thing.

736
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
Jabberwocky's, which is not horror.

737
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,760
But oh, you saw that I did not get to see the show.

738
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh, really? So good.

739
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,120
It's so, so good.

740
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,560
Is there any horror?

741
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,120
Because, yeah, this I mean, people probably know this is a dance troupe.

742
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,720
But like the it is do they Halloween it up?

743
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,360
Not really.

744
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
They do like a like what?

745
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,640
Like a 30 second, maybe a minute long like to do to do to do to do.

746
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,520
They'll do like a little dance to like that or some shit.

747
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,320
You know, like, yeah, it's not is not horror based at all.

748
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
It is just straight up.

749
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,120
It's a show and a reason to sit down for half an hour.

750
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,600
So that that was the theme.

751
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,840
Yeah, I don't know.

752
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm having a hard time remembering, which I guess is not a good sign.

753
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,720
I don't know about for you.

754
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,440
Like, oh, I was talking I liked Halloween for I like the end

755
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,280
when the five Michael Myers attack you.

756
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Oh, yes. Halloween Halloween was fun.

757
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,120
I tend to like the ones where there are more.

758
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,800
Actual people instead of like fake.

759
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,320
Yeah, popping out at you.

760
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,480
When there's actually a human, because that's scarier.

761
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

762
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,520
So those are those are the ones I enjoy.

763
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,600
And there was a lot of Michael Myers and the Michael and Halloween one.

764
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,920
Yeah, because there were yeah, there were like five at the end

765
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
in the House of Mirrors that scared me.

766
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,920
Yes, that was a good one.

767
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,600
That was definitely a good one.

768
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,880
And in general, when you're in these mazes, what is your strategy?

769
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,640
Because I've seen I've seen people do a lot of different things.

770
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,000
My strategy still is a pretty cowardly one where I would prefer

771
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,560
if I was behind a group to not get the scare,

772
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,760
even though I can see the scare coming. Yeah.

773
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,160
I've done that strategy before. Yeah.

774
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,600
I've definitely implemented that. I hate being last.

775
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,800
They've been last.

776
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,760
I've done a couple of indie haunts where when I'm last,

777
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,960
there was one like creepy clown that followed me for five minutes one time.

778
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,520
And like at first it was funny.

779
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,040
There was cool.

780
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,520
I was like, I bro stuff.

781
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,920
Leave me alone.

782
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,000
But yeah, so I don't like being.

783
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,520
I don't mind being in the front.

784
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,840
Yeah, the front rarely gets it like.

785
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,120
Yeah, right. Right. Right.

786
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,040
The front really is always like two, three or four, like behind

787
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,480
because they'll see the front coming and like they don't want to blow their load

788
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,720
on like the first two people.

789
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
So they'll like wait like just a couple.

790
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,520
But now it's hard for me to like the last few times I've gone,

791
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,320
I've gone with like people I've dated, I'm dating. Sure.

792
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,880
And so I'm just like a shield at that point.

793
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,480
Well, you have to do that.

794
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,360
You have to be the shield in this scenario.

795
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah, I'm the shield.

796
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,240
I've been the shield lately. OK.

797
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,480
So it's been hard for me to have a strategy because I have one shoulder.

798
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,600
Your full body you can't access.

799
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah, I have a whole side of my body I can't access.

800
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,840
So, you know, like there will be sometimes

801
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,320
where I'll like get surprised and actually jump and scare.

802
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,560
But most of it is just like, oh, there's something right there.

803
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,120
Try to get the other person to get off my body. Yeah.

804
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,840
I've seen people do and I saw we had one person or a group in front of us do this.

805
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,080
And then a couple of years ago, we ran into Justin Michael and Betsy Sidaro.

806
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,000
And they did this, too.

807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,840
They hold the line themselves in the maze in order to clear

808
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,040
the people in front, maybe from a full room.

809
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,080
So then they go into the room completely alone.

810
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,480
So they get the scares themselves, because now there's no one in front of them

811
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,320
because they want fresh scares each time.

812
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
And somebody did it. I think it was on maybe it was the Exorcist.

813
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,720
I forget which one somebody did that to us.

814
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,800
And I noticed the behave. I knew what it was because they were in front of us.

815
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,080
And then I was with my friend, Tim, and he was like, what is it?

816
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,680
Oh, they're trying to hold because they want the full scare.

817
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,840
And it is smart if you're like, if you like that type of thing. Yeah.

818
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,040
That's pretty smart.

819
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,400
I was like when Betsy and Justin were first doing it, I was like, what are they doing?

820
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,240
It's crazy. What? We're going to get all the scares like.

821
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,800
Yeah. But then I go, oh, don't you see, Michael?

822
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,160
It's precisely the idea.

823
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,640
Just the scariest man I know, Justin Michael said to me. Yeah.

824
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,480
Most fearsome person.

825
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,680
Scariest man. And the cool thing about that is like nobody's going to be

826
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,760
really mad at you because everybody's so disarmed.

827
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,120
You're not even realizing like, right. Right.

828
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,320
These people ain't moving.

829
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah. Like in front of me. Go, go.

830
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,760
You ain't even like clocking that that much.

831
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
Yeah. It's not like a drive through. Right. Right.

832
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,760
But yeah. So that is another strategy.

833
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,440
I guess. Cool. Yeah. It's not.

834
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,040
It's it's good because also, like, I do wish you had a little more time.

835
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,000
Is what we were talking about in the old days where you could kind of take your

836
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,280
time a little more versus now how they're just like you're literally just speed

837
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
walking through them.

838
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,040
The I will say the last couple of times I've been to the hayride.

839
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
Which I really enjoy, actually.

840
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,040
I think the Hayride is pretty fun.

841
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,640
Griffith Park. Yeah.

842
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,240
OK, OK. Yeah. The Hayride is pretty fun, but they also have mazes there, too.

843
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,880
Oh, really? I didn't know that. OK, OK.

844
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
Just like two or three.

845
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,000
And every year they have the big one, which is not a it's a true maze.

846
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,680
So it's not like, oh, you have a you have a you have a like

847
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,760
direction to go is go in, find your way out.

848
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,400
That's the that's the maze.

849
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,040
And so because of that, like you get I mean, you get lost.

850
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,760
Yeah, sure.

851
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,480
Like so you will get multiple scares and they so that's actually very fun.

852
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,440
I do. I actually have not done that.

853
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,480
That does sound really scary.

854
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,320
I'm going tomorrow, so I was hopefully they'll have it again,

855
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,840
because that's always generally my favorite thing to do there.

856
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,840
But and then like once you do finally find your at least the last two years

857
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,520
I went finally find the end,

858
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,560
you have to basically go through a birth canal.

859
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,760
It feels like where like you're walking and then it's tighter

860
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,040
and you're squeezing through it and it's just like all up on you.

861
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,680
And then you finally pop out outside.

862
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,320
Can I make of what leaves corn corn?

863
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This canal is made of human body parts.

864
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,080
It's big plastic.

865
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,960
OK, it's not like inflated, like garbage bag material.

866
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,080
Exactly what? Yeah.

867
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I see. Yeah.

868
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,800
It's like a big balloon or something you're going through.

869
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,440
Oh, interesting.

870
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,840
They have that at what's there's there's I think it's paranormal

871
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,120
ink at not scary farm.

872
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,680
That's sort of how the end is, I think.

873
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,760
I think I'm probably messing messing around.

874
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,360
And you've not been to nots. That's great.

875
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm going Saturday. OK, yeah.

876
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,680
That's great. Yeah.

877
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,960
There's an outdoor there's a hallway.

878
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
Did you do terror tram?

879
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
This? Yes.

880
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,760
The since since the topic is the purge.

881
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,200
Yes. I'll spoil this for people because it's been open for a while.

882
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,600
But there's I watched the walkthrough.

883
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,160
I actually watched someone live streaming at opening night.

884
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,040
But it was like five thirty in the afternoon and the sun hadn't set yet.

885
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,920
So I've seen the terror tram in broad daylight and also in pitch black.

886
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,320
OK, scarier in pitch black, I'll say that.

887
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,080
But there is one there's that outdoor hallway of like netting

888
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,120
and people in what I believe are called ghillie suits jumping out.

889
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,200
But I was like, oh, my God.

890
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,080
Yeah, yeah.

891
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,280
Yeah, that got me a couple of times.

892
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh, I got me a couple of times.

893
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,440
The tram was generally not as exciting because it's very short.

894
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,720
Yes. Or once you get off the tram.

895
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,160
But like once you get to that part you're talking about

896
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,240
the first that was my first real like, oh,

897
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,280
oh, no.

898
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,520
Oh, yeah, it got me.

899
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,280
So, yeah, if you haven't done Halloween Horror Nights

900
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,200
Universal Hollywood, the the the tram tour drops you off

901
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,360
on a part of the back lot that you wouldn't normally be walking around.

902
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,600
It's like towards the end of the the typical tram route.

903
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,840
And it seems like they still do it in the same place where you're going through.

904
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,720
Now Whoville's gone.

905
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,560
They don't have to make a demented Grinch world.

906
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,560
Like, how do we justify clowns?

907
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,000
I don't know. How do we justify Christmas here?

908
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,960
We don't have Jack Skeleton as our property.

909
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,640
We do a scary Christmas without all of the scary Christmas characters

910
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,000
that everybody knows.

911
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,720
That's a mystery.

912
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,400
So but it is, you know, it's scarier stuff on the route

913
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,080
because you got the Psycho House and the Bates Mattel

914
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,480
and then the War of the Worlds plane crash set, which is really, really brutal.

915
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,520
And the theme changes of what this is, they seem to incorporate

916
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,920
different horror properties into the videos that you watch on the way down.

917
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,760
And I think Chucky's been part of it or I forget all.

918
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,000
Chucky was a part of it.

919
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,240
My favorite one, I mean, since this is what we're talking about, was the purge.

920
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,520
Which is this year.

921
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,760
No, it's not this year, but that's my favorite one.

922
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,600
They had this year is no theme, really.

923
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,040
Oh, I mean, overall, overall.

924
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,560
So we have purged down there and stuff like. Yeah. Yeah.

925
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,480
So there was. Yeah. So what?

926
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Twenty eighteen. Is that right?

927
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,320
Was it was the one you're talking about, which was like the whole

928
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,240
like theme, basically? Yeah.

929
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,720
Like they've done Chucky and they've done the purge

930
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,040
as the theme of the terror tram at some point. Right.

931
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,200
Right. OK. Yeah.

932
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,480
Well, this year, it's the second time it's the purge.

933
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,760
It's mostly the purge. Is it mostly the purge still?

934
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,840
They're calling it the ultimate purge.

935
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,440
But then Norman Bates is also hanging around.

936
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,280
Yeah. Confuses it. Yes.

937
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,880
I like. Wait, why Norman still?

938
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,360
Yeah. You're absolutely right, because I took a picture of it.

939
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,720
Me and a friend go watch every purge movie in the theater.

940
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,120
So when they come out.

941
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,880
So like I took a picture of the ultimate purge and sent it to her.

942
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,120
So I forgot that probably because most of it didn't feel like the purge.

943
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,840
Like the shit you're talking about when they jumped out at you.

944
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,680
They don't. That's not the purge.

945
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,520
Yeah. It could in theory happen in a purge.

946
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,080
It does. But you know, a lot can have any.

947
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,360
The purge is just general.

948
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,480
I guess if somebody wanted to dress up his leaves and jump out of a bush,

949
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,400
then I can and then slink back into it.

950
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
I guess that is the reason not kill you.

951
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,120
Just scary.

952
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,680
We stole the ghillie suit.

953
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,560
This is not my property. It is a crime.

954
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,480
We have 12 hours. We have 12 hours to jump scare anyone we want.

955
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,480
That's what the new purges move very suddenly.

956
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,640
Yes. In ways we've been trained to move, but still like our weapons

957
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,400
never get that close to you.

958
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,640
But we jerkily move.

959
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,760
Everyone's trained to move in a very jerky fashion

960
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,080
that is unnerving to watch a human do. It is. Yeah. Yeah.

961
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,280
So I think that's what made me fall in love with Horror Nights.

962
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,880
And I to talk about the purge a little bit.

963
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,120
I don't want to jump ahead or anything like that.

964
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,040
But like I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.

965
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,840
The first one, the Ethan Hawke one.

966
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,760
I thought it was going to be a steaming pile.

967
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,640
And like it was actually very good. I was like, this is good.

968
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,000
Like the concept is like interesting.

969
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,560
And the movie was well executed and you you root for him.

970
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
You hate people. You like people and shit.

971
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,640
I was like, OK, I like him. He's good.

972
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,880
I watched it a couple of nights ago in preparation for this, having not really.

973
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,720
I did watch Election Year and I remember absolutely zero of it.

974
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,920
So I can't speak to Election Year.

975
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,280
I remember being entertained by it.

976
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,080
But yeah, pretty is a real movie. It's pretty good.

977
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,920
The first one is like a true like story.

978
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,160
And yeah, yeah.

979
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,160
My qualm with it maybe is that

980
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,320
it does become like a people are trapped in a house

981
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,960
and people other people are trying to kill them and get into the house.

982
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,400
It becomes that kind of movie.

983
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,160
And it's a good version of that kind of movie.

984
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,640
But I am just so obsessed with the premise

985
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,880
and that America would adopt this purge plan.

986
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah, that I just want to see like periphery.

987
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,880
I want to see congressional hearings.

988
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,720
Like how did they get to this point?

989
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Well, that's what did the various parties think?

990
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,880
How did it make like how did that vote go?

991
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,560
Yeah. What was the debate like on CNN and the lead?

992
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,000
Or podcast saying, sounds like maybe there's something you need to watch.

993
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
The first purge.

994
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,520
I was wondering if I should.

995
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,320
The first purge is exactly that.

996
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
They do go into dry.

997
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,520
They go into logistics. OK, OK.

998
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,680
They go into the logistics.

999
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,960
You see what? Because all right, here's the thing.

1000
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,400
If the purge happened in real life, who we are?

1001
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720
No, I know we can.

1002
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,360
I mean, somebody, I guess, would murder people.

1003
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,920
But we're going to be fucking on the streets and stealing and shit.

1004
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,880
Like we're going to be murdering people like for the most part.

1005
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,000
People still don't have it in them to like it seems like in the purge,

1006
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,240
in the purge verse, 70 percent of people are murdering at least.

1007
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
Yes. And we all have a secret.

1008
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,160
No, of course I would.

1009
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,960
Like most of us would do it.

1010
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,160
But in reality, probably it's just like it gets a little kooky.

1011
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,200
It's a little kooky.

1012
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,640
Like, you know, because in my mind is like, all right, I murdered this person.

1013
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,120
And then what tomorrow I got to go like to, you know,

1014
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,320
Ralph's with your nephew. Like, I don't want to like.

1015
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,120
Oh, how they happen.

1016
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,760
Huh? I killed your auntie last night.

1017
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can't do that.

1018
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,160
It was legal. It was legal.

1019
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,920
It was legal. You know the rules.

1020
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,280
You know, they said on TV and everything in the first one,

1021
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,160
they have to all still live in the same cul de sac.

1022
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,320
They all live in this fancy neighborhood together.

1023
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,920
And like, yeah, what's and then things do go very badly.

1024
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,680
So, yeah, what's the rest of the year like for the community?

1025
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,280
Bad, terrible, horrible.

1026
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,880
Yeah, really. But the first purge, the actual movie.

1027
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,920
So not the first purge movie, but the movie that's called the first purge,

1028
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,640
which I think is the purge for or something like that.

1029
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,520
Yeah, you're right.

1030
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,000
Because election year kind of wraps it.

1031
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,840
I don't want to spoil anything for you, Scott.

1032
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,720
The election year kind of.

1033
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,640
Ironically, the purge election year had a happy ending.

1034
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,800
But then in 2016, in real life, Americans voted for a real life purge.

1035
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,400
Yeah, the movie had a happier ending.

1036
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,200
Then they go back to see it.

1037
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,200
And then there was a TV series that's ongoing, I think.

1038
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,440
Or did it get canceled?

1039
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,120
I think it got canceled.

1040
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,600
And then whatever idea he had for the third season, he's like,

1041
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,480
I guess I got to make another movie.

1042
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,720
Like, it seems like they're always like, you want to keep making one release?

1043
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,160
And they're like, hell, I wasn't going to.

1044
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,240
But then I had an idea.

1045
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,240
Purge ever after or purge forever.

1046
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
If you want the things you're explaining,

1047
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,520
you want to see is basically purge two through five.

1048
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,640
Where it's just like murder and debauchery.

1049
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,840
And then you even get one in there that explains like that, you know,

1050
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,400
this is the thing we want to do.

1051
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
Oh, it's not working. What can we do to make it work?

1052
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,520
And like, yes, boardrooms, schematics, overheads.

1053
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,360
Yeah, I watch a whole movie where there is no purging.

1054
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,880
Just watch like kind of just a dry like a film.

1055
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,280
You want like the Senate parliamentarian?

1056
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,040
Is that what the position is?

1057
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,120
The one who's making all the problems.

1058
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,920
Right. The one who like says, oh, yeah, you can't pass this bill today.

1059
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,840
And they go, oh, I guess that person's right.

1060
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:31,160
The negotiating with I want to see who the the fucking who are these best

1061
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,640
cinema and the mansion.

1062
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,800
Yeah, I want to see who's holding up the purge.

1063
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,080
Like, what do they want in return?

1064
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,520
They don't want anything. They just want chaos, I guess.

1065
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,440
Yeah. Right. If we give you this, you want to see who's the Mitch McConnell of the Purge?

1066
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And where does he where does he land?

1067
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,280
I forgot that there was there weren't

1068
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,080
I didn't realize that the founding fathers of the new founding fathers of America

1069
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
is a party.

1070
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,440
I knew that premise that that is exists in the better that it is.

1071
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,880
You have Democrats, you have Republicans, and then the new founding fathers

1072
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,360
show up and like, no, no, no, we're wiping the wiping the room like in a maze.

1073
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,760
You're all gone. Yeah. We stand for purge.

1074
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,640
And it did. Yeah. Boy, it works, too.

1075
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,800
It fixes. I mean, listen, they I guess I guess it works in their in their world.

1076
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,360
You know, three hundred and sixty four days of the year.

1077
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,080
Everybody's happy.

1078
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,600
Somehow like somehow unemployment goes down specifically.

1079
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,320
It's not just because there's less people.

1080
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,120
There is less people.

1081
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,640
And they get a little into the later ones.

1082
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,440
I remember it's like, oh, they they explain the less people part.

1083
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah, there's some other stuff going on.

1084
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,640
Well, there's a lot of there's like a big seasonal employment

1085
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,200
and like post purge morning blood sprayer downers.

1086
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,800
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1087
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,560
If it does, even if you only work one day out of the year,

1088
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,400
you get up severed arms in real life.

1089
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,720
They're employing Frank Grillo just constantly.

1090
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,040
So they have like eliminated unemployment for one guy who works,

1091
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,520
seemingly works a lot.

1092
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,600
So there was a thing going around Twitter a while back.

1093
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,200
It's like, here's like eight action movies Frank Grillo did in the last two years

1094
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,840
that you never know.

1095
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,360
Very funny.

1097
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,480
I wonder, is he in any with Bruce Willis?

1098
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,200
He has to be. Oh, yeah.

1099
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,840
That shows up. I'm this too much of a sidetrack.

1100
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,560
But Bruce Willis is movies.

1101
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,040
He works. He works like how are we like on a completely?

1102
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,920
There's one of the biggest movies of all time, and he's made probably

1103
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,480
20 movies we've never heard of in the last two years.

1104
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,880
Well, him, Nicholas Cage and Schwarzenegger are no less of stars.

1105
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,200
They're all as famous as they were and are in hit movies sometimes,

1106
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,360
but also sometimes they are maybe a lot of times they're in movies

1107
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,360
that don't exist, essentially. Yeah.

1108
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,600
Wild. Anyway, I can't think of the last Bruce Willis movie I saw was Glass.

1109
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,680
Oh, yeah.

1110
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,400
But I don't think I've done one since Over the Hedge.

1111
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,240
Oh, just just because.

1112
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,040
No, no, no, no. You got to read a few here.

1113
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,560
Out of Death Survive the Game.

1114
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,800
No, these are words.

1115
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,840
Midnight in the Switchgrass. Nope.

1116
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,800
Breach Cosmic Sin.

1117
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,000
Now, these is first movies.

1118
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,640
These are from 2021. Oh,

1119
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,360
we all have nothing to do but watch stuff and we haven't even heard of

1120
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,360
seen a YouTube video promoting one of these.

1121
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,720
I thought it was Grillo, but it might not.

1122
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,720
It's a different guy. I think.

1123
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,960
All right. Just just a few more.

1124
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,840
Just indulge me, please.

1125
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,360
Hard Kill.

1126
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,080
I've I've actually heard of that.

1127
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,120
It's Tracy Morgan in that.

1128
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,880
No, no. Who's in that?

1129
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,280
So that's Jesse Metcalf.

1130
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,480
I don't know. I haven't heard.

1131
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,240
You just think you've heard of it, maybe because that's like you're like,

1132
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,920
how a movie must have been called Kill by now.

1133
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,320
Movies have been going for many years.

1134
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:51,840
I will say that.

1135
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,640
You're going to that.

1136
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,760
He plays Chalmers in Hard Kill.

1137
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,840
Chalmers Chalmers.

1138
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,680
Simpson's name. Simpson's name.

1139
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,360
Survive the Night.

1140
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,160
Trauma. I've heard of Survive the Night.

1141
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,320
Trauma Center.

1142
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,120
No, wait, I think I know Survive the Night is the name of like

1143
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
that's what they called the Purge event.

1144
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,720
One of the years of following our.

1145
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,480
It's all tied together. Wow.

1146
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,320
That's kind of that phrase.

1147
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,000
Oh, no, it's really.

1148
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,760
It's a pretty common phrase.

1149
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,800
Survive the Night. Yeah.

1150
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,200
And that we should say that at

1151
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,920
Universe Studios Hollywood's Horror Nights,

1152
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,960
the Purge has been used a lot.

1153
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,120
The Purge is very popular.

1154
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,000
When you put some of this up.

1155
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
Yeah, there's been so many Purge things.

1156
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,560
There's been a lot since.

1157
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,760
So I went to the first one in 2014 because the first Purge movie is 2013.

1158
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,520
I think it's 2013 and there was a scare zone simultaneously.

1159
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,560
I mean, that's the same year.

1160
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,240
So I definitely.

1161
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,280
I mean, at this point, that was almost 10 years ago.

1162
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,320
So I vaguely remember that.

1163
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:57,960
But I remember when like the Purge was like the like the theme of horror.

1164
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,880
Seemingly.

1165
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,960
And the reason I loved it so much because I saw the movie

1166
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,520
and it was one of those fun things where you kind of get

1167
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,840
where you see a movie is like, hmm, I wonder what that would be like.

1168
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:16,200
Right. If that like that as outlandish as it is, is somewhat conceivable.

1169
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,720
You know, like Michael Myers is not conceivable, like Jason is not conceivable.

1170
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,200
But like that, we can see a world where shit falls apart.

1171
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,120
It's like, yes, conceivable, right?

1172
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,440
Or since the movies started coming out.

1173
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,720
Exactly right.

1174
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,760
And so like.

1175
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,720
Like being in the in in horror nights, you know, before they let you in,

1176
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,880
everybody's just kind of huddled in the front there.

1177
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,840
And so as is getting time to open at 7 p.m.

1178
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,240
once 7 p.m. hits, the first thing that hits is those sirens.

1179
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,560
So you kind of like, oh, shit,

1180
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,440
kind of like push that like.

1181
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,600
And then you hear tonight is the founding, like the same message

1182
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,800
they do in the movie is what they do.

1183
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,600
And then when it's like blessed be the founding fathers and a big explosion

1184
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,120
goes up, the doors open and fucking all the scare actors go at it.

1185
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,880
Yeah, it was dope as hell.

1186
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,000
It was dope as hell.

1187
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,200
I was like, oh, this is cool as shit.

1188
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,240
That sounds really good.

1189
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,600
It was very fun.

1190
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,480
And now it's time for it is 7 p.m.

1191
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,040
like in the movie. That's nuts.

1192
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,760
Yeah, it really it really worked.

1193
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,880
And like the people I were with, we were freaking out because the thing that too,

1194
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,800
when they do the chainsaws, you can actually smell the gas.

1195
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,400
And like it was pretty it was pretty dope.

1196
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,640
So at first it was great.

1197
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,680
Now it's just kind of like the go to the well.

1198
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,320
We have this lying around.

1199
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,080
Yeah, we have this lying around.

1200
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,120
You know, I guess it works.

1201
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,760
So and I still enjoy it.

1202
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,040
It's still fun. But now it's pretty old.

1203
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,720
But like Orlando over like, yeah, about eight or 10 years,

1204
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,440
they did they've done two scare zones and one like haunted house out here.

1205
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,800
There's seven different.

1206
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,480
Yeah.

1207
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,720
I heard things right over the years.

1208
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,120
One year there was a scare zone and a maze like in the same year.

1209
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,200
Yep. Yeah, they kind of like I'm trying to think of this year they had

1210
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,840
like they sort of the Bride of Frankenstein Lives was kind of tied

1211
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,840
into the scare zone with like the Cirque du Soleil performers.

1212
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,320
Yeah. Kind of. Yeah, kind of.

1213
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Things were a little muddled this year.

1214
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1215
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,920
Horror Nights, which was fine.

1216
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,160
It was fine. Yeah.

1217
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,000
But they there were no like true scare zones.

1218
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,560
It felt like where like, you know, you're in this section

1219
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,560
and this is the per section. This is this section.

1220
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,320
Well, yes, to be super clear also, because I haven't been

1221
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,240
and I'm still parsing this myself.

1222
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,400
A scare. There's mazes in their scare zones and scare zones are like

1223
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,320
general areas of the parks that are not just like thoroughfares.

1224
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,760
Like you're going to walk through here and there are going to be chainsaw

1225
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,560
people or people jumping out of here or whatever.

1226
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,200
So it's like it's the equivalent of like they would turn

1227
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,880
like like Main Street would be a scare zone.

1228
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,360
Sure. During the day.

1229
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,520
It's pleasant. Yeah.

1230
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,480
So like that's how is.

1231
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,560
So it's just like the areas you walk through to get to stuff

1232
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,920
or the different lands or whatever are scare zones.

1233
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,400
And not everything is.

1234
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,800
There are certain areas of the park that are just a place.

1235
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,440
Right. A lot of a lot of the upper lot of there is.

1236
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,520
They tell you on the map which places usually are scare zones.

1237
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,800
Notts has the very robust scare zones this still this year.

1238
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh, good. Excited for that.

1239
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,360
And that's like to you.

1240
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,280
Not as good because when we were going on the scare zone,

1241
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,640
all of a sudden, like fog got pumped.

1242
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,720
Like, first of all, we were like, we're the only people out here in this area.

1243
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,360
Then fog pumped.

1244
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,280
We walked through the fog and then we're like, there are 20 scare actors

1245
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,200
just for two of us.

1246
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,840
And we just walk through scare actors.

1247
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,600
You're like, that's pretty good.

1248
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,480
Yeah. And they followed us for a little too long. But

1249
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,920
a little a little.

1250
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,600
Sometimes I be following you to and after a while you like, I bra.

1251
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,000
There's like, yeah, you're like 20 seconds ago.

1252
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,920
And if you left, it would have been perfect.

1253
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,160
But this extra 20 seconds, I cannot I cannot appreciate.

1254
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,720
Yeah. So, yeah.

1255
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,920
So like two years ago at Horror Nights, they had a full.

1256
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Did you say you went to two years ago? No, I went.

1257
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,800
I went 2019. I went the year before COVID shut down.

1258
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,240
Yeah, it goes. Was like one of the.

1259
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,400
Yes. I've seen Ghostbusters because like they had a full scare zone

1260
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,880
when you would walk down by like Transformers in the lower lot.

1261
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,080
You would have to walk from basically Transformers to another section

1262
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,200
on the back lot to get to Ghostbusters and get to two other mazes, I think.

1263
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,360
And there was a hole in that tunnel.

1264
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,440
Yeah. And it was a scare zone.

1265
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,440
Yeah. It was really cool.

1266
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,160
And that was Purge, I think. Right. Was that purge related?

1267
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,200
Yeah. Was that what that was?

1268
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,680
I should double check that to make sure. Is that toxic tunnel?

1269
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,800
Was that what that was?

1270
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,360
Isn't there one thing that there was something called zombies or mutants?

1271
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,320
Maybe that's what it is. Toxic.

1272
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,880
Yeah, I got to check.

1273
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,400
That's where someone accidentally hit me with a lead pipe.

1274
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,720
Yeah, they can't listen.

1275
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,800
Like, you know, the scare actors when there's not purge,

1276
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,080
you know, they get close and this stuff.

1277
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,440
But the purge specific scare actors, I mean, kudos to their training

1278
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,320
because they are literally trained to push it an inch

1279
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,560
in like in front of your face.

1280
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,440
Oh, this hit me somehow.

1281
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,840
Like I hit me and I looked around and no one was like I was like 15 feet.

1282
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,800
I was like, you know, on purpose, man.

1283
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,040
I'm really like Nick, like Tonya Harding style or.

1284
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,880
Yeah, it was that it was I was OK.

1285
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,200
But I was like that's what was supposed to happen.

1286
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,640
Yeah. That guy got like maybe it was like his first night.

1287
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,960
And he's like, I'm going to take a swing.

1288
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,920
And then it flew out of his hand.

1289
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,960
Hit me in the leg.

1290
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,320
Maybe you didn't tip somebody or I didn't tip it or look.

1291
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,320
I knew it was a tip at horror nights.

1292
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,360
Was there a was there a thing outside at the end?

1293
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,120
I am always conscientious of tipping.

1294
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Well, when you go through a maze, you're just supposed to have some

1295
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,760
like small change, small bills in your hands and you're like, yeah,

1296
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,720
for each Adam in the chaos and they'll pick it up after you're gone.

1297
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,760
It's a strip club.

1298
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,000
You don't know the money on the ground when you go through the maze.

1299
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,520
You didn't notice all the money.

1300
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,760
You're just throwing money at Michael Myers.

1301
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,880
You go through each maze.

1302
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,760
Thanks for the scares. Oh, that was a good one.

1303
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,400
Thank you. Just look at the movie.

1304
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,200
I was wondering why the website fax section said like, arrive early,

1305
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,720
make sure to allow time to park, consider express, bring ones.

1306
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,160
I think, Jason, I think you are correct.

1307
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,520
It was called the toxic.

1308
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,360
The specific one we're talking is toxic tunnel.

1309
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,560
OK, but is it so different than the purge?

1310
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,040
I don't know. Yeah.

1311
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,800
Not a guy with a pipe and a mask where the purge, I guess, just fits

1312
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,920
like something universal needed.

1313
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,800
It's just that we need a property that is mayhem and people run around

1314
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,240
and scary masks. Yeah.

1315
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,800
Which is what they were doing anyway.

1316
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,320
And now they can say, oh, yeah, that's a theme.

1317
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,320
That's a purge is what that is.

1318
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,560
And it allows them to have like realistic weapons like lead pipe.

1319
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,400
Yeah. Right. And the chainsaws, like they are really revving those things up.

1320
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,920
I'm sure they're not real, but they smell it.

1321
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,880
Yeah. Well, they take.

1322
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,280
Yeah, they take the blade off of the chainsaw.

1323
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,120
Oh, that's why it still has the grind. Is that right?

1324
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,480
Yeah. They yeah, they take the blade off.

1325
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,440
And also my girlfriend used to work in universal.

1326
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,000
She ran into someone she used to work with and he's like, oh, yeah,

1327
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,280
I'm back in the room. I'm working the hard night shift.

1328
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,400
I'm in charge of the chainsaws.

1329
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,440
Like there's a guy whose job is just to make sure the

1330
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,960
chainsaws don't kill people. Make sure they're all gassed up.

1331
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,640
Yeah. Oh, the blade is on this one.

1332
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,400
Oh, the blade. Yeah.

1333
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,640
OK. Yeah. One out of every ten.

1334
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,000
That's a big job.

1335
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,240
So they take the chain off.

1336
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,760
Those masks are scary. Those masks are creepy.

1337
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,320
Oh, yeah. Like the the white.

1338
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
I mean, you know, I'm a black.

1339
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,480
I'm a black man. So white mask scare me.

1340
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,320
But the white, the pretty blonde white.

1341
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,440
I'm like, that shit is terrifying.

1342
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's terrifying.

1343
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,080
They are. Yeah, it does all play into that.

1344
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,240
Like in the I've kind of only recently seen that first one.

1345
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,280
But since that is like upper crust shitty snooty housing development

1346
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,880
and that is it's this like sneery like and that main guy

1347
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,400
who is like depicted in various mazes, like the sort of like

1348
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,080
the buttoned up suit.

1349
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
See a little patch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1350
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,280
With the long smiling mask.

1351
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,480
Like, yeah, yeah. I love this.

1352
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,360
He is he's referred to in multiple different ways.

1353
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,600
He's called the polite stranger.

1354
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,640
He's also called the smiling perjurer.

1355
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,000
And one wiki page listed him as the appropriate gentleman.

1356
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,600
Yeah. It's the polite stranger, the thing where you sit in your hand.

1357
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,480
You know what I'm talking about?

1358
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,360
I know what you're talking about.

1359
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,440
Sorry to be lewd. Sorry to be lewd on the podcast.

1360
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,600
Like you mean, and it goes up and it goes down.

1361
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,600
No, no, no, no, no.

1362
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,960
You know, you know, that's it.

1363
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,160
Scott, you're thinking further.

1364
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,600
You're thinking of the proper gentleman.

1365
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,240
That's what that's called.

1366
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,320
Up your butt as a gentleman.

1367
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,000
The stranger takes the front, the gentleman takes the back.

1368
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,640
I see. OK, OK.

1369
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,400
Now I know. Yeah, yeah.

1370
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,760
Now, you know. Now, you know.

1371
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,760
Scott, I'm going to edit yours out because that was lewd.

1372
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,560
That was the talk about that.

1373
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,720
I thought you were saying no, no, no, no.

1374
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,320
You sit on your own hand and put it up your butt.

1375
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,120
You sit on it for so long, it eventually goes up your butt.

1376
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,640
Look, I mean, somebody has for sure done that.

1377
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,880
People probably do that every day, but I'm sure they have.

1378
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,200
I was talking about.

1379
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,120
So what's this gentleman Jason was talking about?

1380
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,880
Oh, that's that's the guy.

1381
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,920
Yeah, the general smiling guy.

1382
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1383
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,160
But like I reading, I mean, the the fandom page for Halloween Hard

1384
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Nights, it's so funny to see all the scare actor characters listed out of like

1385
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,800
teeth mask perjurer.

1386
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,040
Yeah. Big Daddy's Minions.

1387
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,400
It's weird, though, because like the reason and like this

1388
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,320
the last movie that came out this year,

1389
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,160
which I was very high for when I went to go see.

1390
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,800
Oh, no, I was very high when I went to go see it.

1391
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,600
It was a delight. I enjoyed it.

1392
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,880
You would not, Jason.

1393
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,040
I couldn't. I like these.

1394
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,080
What I've seen of these movies, like I want to do them all the way through.

1395
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
I really like this world.

1396
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,080
I think they're they're very current.

1397
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,400
It's like a great example of like genre movies that you can force, like topical.

1398
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,000
You put the topical stuff into.

1399
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,880
Yeah. And it works and it feels very modern.

1400
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,160
The first purchase was very topical.

1401
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,680
It involves like Black Lives.

1402
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,520
And like that is very top.

1403
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,680
And this last one is very top.

1404
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,720
It might as well be called Purge. Trump is president.

1405
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,000
That's pretty much what it should be.

1406
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,480
He's blown out. They were so psyched when Trump got elected.

1407
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,480
Now we can put it all in the movie.

1408
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,200
Put it all in there.

1409
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1410
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,160
Because the election year does seem like they thought

1411
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
the other result was going to happen.

1412
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,080
Of course. That's exactly what they thought.

1413
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,240
And this was like this was what could have been.

1414
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1415
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,240
But the reason the first I mean, they use

1416
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,640
just the first one, really, because the first two through

1417
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,400
the rest of them.

1418
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,520
Gets a little wild.

1419
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,000
Like, yeah, people are tripping out of their mind.

1420
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,600
The murders are a lot more brutal.

1421
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,320
There's a lot more sexual assault.

1422
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,200
There's a lot of things in and that purge world that aren't

1423
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,120
universal horror night.

1424
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,200
Yeah. Right.

1425
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,920
But the first one, there's nothing really in that outside of killing people,

1426
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,120
which we love murder.

1427
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,600
So we can kill people.

1428
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,640
Murder is fine.

1429
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,600
Murder is fine.

1430
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,440
We can put that around all your kids.

1431
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,480
Murder is cool.

1432
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,760
So that's easy.

1433
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,880
So that's why you get a lot of those characters or you get big daddy's minions

1434
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,280
instead of big daddy, because big daddy was fucking people.

1435
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,160
Oh, is that right?

1436
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,160
When does big daddy come in? What's what movies?

1437
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,960
I can't remember.

1438
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,240
Is he in multiple names?

1439
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,920
They don't they don't name them in the movies.

1440
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,360
I yeah, just in like the credits or like fan pages.

1441
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,680
They probably have to go through like when they're like looking at the new movie

1442
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,880
or something, they're trying to apply it.

1443
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,960
And they're like, OK, let's get the politics out of this.

1444
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,000
Let's get the message out of it.

1445
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,040
OK, but can we keep all of the murder?

1446
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,600
Yes. Yes.

1447
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,760
We cannot say anything political.

1448
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,640
Yeah. OK, good.

1449
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,800
I think one of the reasons, Scott, the first one you're saying,

1450
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,160
like is a little more tame and all was it had a three million dollar budget,

1451
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,840
which is very small.

1452
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,560
And then it made a box office of eighty nine million dollars.

1453
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,800
So a wow, a grand slam.

1454
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,120
So there's a case scenario.

1455
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,280
Yeah, it is like, yeah, it's a how it does become a all in a house.

1456
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,800
Like a lot through a movie kind of the easiest.

1457
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,440
So the budgets for the the following ones kind of went went pretty high up.

1458
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,640
But I think all pretty successful. They keep doing.

1459
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,640
They still keep doing.

1460
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,960
I mean, I don't know how this last one did because, you know, pandemic and everything.

1461
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,280
And the last one was pretty.

1462
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,000
I also want to preface this by saying this.

1463
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,920
I really love the purge movies.

1464
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,160
They're very far. I enjoy them.

1465
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,920
I have, like I said, I have a purge friend.

1466
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,760
We go see each movie with.

1467
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,920
But like, as I say that, make no mistake, they aren't they not.

1468
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,200
They aren't like great movies.

1469
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,840
Sure. Yeah, they are.

1470
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,320
It's not like, you know, they are.

1471
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,600
You know what you're going into,

1472
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,440
like as you sit down in the theater to watch these movies. Right.

1473
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,600
Or so I think they just keep making them because they're just fun movies.

1474
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,320
And like you said, it's very easy to put a topic on it.

1475
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,600
And although I don't know where they can go after Purge forever,

1476
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,800
it does feel like that felt like the end.

1477
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,880
It feels like like a Blumhouse is like, come on, come on.

1478
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,880
And he's like, no.

1479
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,880
And then there was an interview where it was like, well, I kind of had an idea.

1480
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,080
Like there was something in use on the TV show.

1481
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,880
So yeah, yeah.

1482
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,520
And the way it and I don't want to spoil it.

1483
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,600
I mean, Purge forever is self-explanatory.

1484
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,280
Sure. It's like, is it in a town

1485
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,920
where they've decided like, oh, we're just going to like or is or a whole state?

1486
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,840
What is the reach of the place where the Purge?

1487
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,120
No, I guess it.

1488
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,480
They don't do very well with

1489
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,640
it always stays and just kind of like one part of the town or whatever.

1490
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,920
I guess the last one does kind of go to different

1491
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,080
states or whatever.

1492
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,040
But I would probably say it's a national movement.

1493
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,760
I see. It's a national movement.

1494
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1495
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,800
It's a metaphor. It is 100 percent.

1496
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,840
If I can.

1497
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,200
It's a metaphor for one. Yeah.

1498
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,680
The first one was very much like, what if the future was like this?

1499
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,560
Now it's kind of like, damn,

1500
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,240
y'all been living it.

1501
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,880
What if this is a solution for getting out of it?

1502
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,680
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

1503
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,120
So I don't know what they're going to do in the parks, you know, because.

1504
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,200
It's very fun.

1505
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,040
It seems like they're going to keep going to that well.

1506
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,360
I don't know how they can heighten it in the parks.

1507
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,080
It feels like what you're saying is the correct me if I'm wrong.

1508
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,280
It never got better than that first seven p.m.

1509
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,480
siren with all the scare actors for me.

1510
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,960
No. And I guess part of that is because like I went

1511
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,760
to the first one and to multiple ones after that.

1512
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,760
So maybe if you go for the first time, I don't think they're doing that anymore.

1513
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,120
We're like, you know, the open of universal is the open of like the purge.

1514
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,520
They haven't done that in the past couple of years

1515
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,560
because they even did that like three years in a row.

1516
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,840
But that first time they did that specifically felt super special.

1517
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,400
And it legitimately freaked me out.

1518
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,280
It freaked people out because you were because as you're walking through,

1519
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,160
there is like a hundred scare actors, all purge related.

1520
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,080
Yeah. Like just coming at you with chainsaws and bats and swords

1521
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,440
and like all types of like the weapons that they had in the first purge movie.

1522
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,800
Because pretty well.

1523
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,200
Yeah, that sounds like because we've talked about like when they're adapting,

1524
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,680
either either they're a excuse me, a ride or a themed experience.

1525
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,600
Like, what do you want from it?

1526
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,240
If you like this movie, what do you want from it?

1527
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,680
That sounds like the ultimate version of what you want.

1528
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,240
So until they are, if they don't do that, you're just getting OK.

1529
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,200
Little tastes of it.

1530
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,240
But it's like, you're not like maybe I would assume too, with like, you know,

1531
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,680
we've seen this many times, nothing, no property stays dead.

1532
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,200
So maybe it needs like a five year break.

1533
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,560
I think that's probably best.

1534
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
Yeah. It needs a nice break.

1535
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,800
And then the sirens can blare again in five years at Horror Nights.

1536
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,720
It is. You know what I equated to?

1537
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,640
And I not purposefully did this, but it actually works.

1538
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,880
For whatever reason today, I decided to watch Final Destination three.

1539
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,800
And then it made me really it made me think about that franchise

1540
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,920
where because they put out about four or five of those.

1541
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,360
Yeah. In a 10 year span, too.

1542
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,160
And then after a while, you're just like, OK,

1543
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,080
like, we kind of got to stop doing this. Right.

1544
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,200
Where else do we go with this? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,880
And and they did.

1546
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,640
They there hasn't been a final destination movie in like 10 years until

1547
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,720
there is now one being filmed.

1548
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,840
So now it feels like, all right, we kind of went away from that.

1549
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,120
Well, for about five, 10 years, it will feel a little more fresh now.

1550
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,640
You say, yeah. Yeah.

1551
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,880
Give the audience a little just, you know, a few of us have done improv training.

1552
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,360
They say rest the game.

1553
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,480
The game. Yeah.

1554
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,160
This means to, you know, put whatever thing you're doing on hold for a few

1555
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,400
a manner of minutes or seconds.

1556
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,200
Seconds. Yeah.

1557
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,080
Scream. That happened with Scream.

1558
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,560
Yes. They did a bunch of Scream movies.

1559
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,280
They did a TV show, an MTV, I think, kind of only tangentially related.

1560
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,880
And now there is like Scream sort of like the David Gordon Green

1561
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,200
Halloween's where it's like everyone's back.

1562
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,080
They've aged in real time. Yeah.

1563
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,760
And there's a new generation also dealing with the killer. Yeah.

1564
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,400
So which means, you know, when

1565
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,800
the purge comes back, Ethan Hawke will be back in it.

1566
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,600
Senator Charlie Rowan.

1567
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,800
All our favorites.

1568
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,040
All your favorites.

1569
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,120
Big Daddy, Frank Crullo.

1570
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,480
But they'll all be a little wiser, a little older, a little gray.

1571
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,440
Everybody's got beards.

1572
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,160
I'm poking through the masks.

1573
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,720
I'll say this to the listeners.

1574
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,640
I don't know that the TV show is as good, but if you want something

1575
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,000
a little less gruesome, the two season purge TV show that was on USA

1576
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:51,560
by nature is less brutal than the movies because it was on broadcast cable.

1577
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1578
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,560
The movies are.

1579
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,880
I mean, like after the first one, the first one isn't so bad,

1580
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,000
but like the rest of them are brutal.

1581
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,360
Like they are pretty pulpy and schlocky. Yeah. Yeah.

1582
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,360
But then that what I could tell, because I threw on a second of the TV show

1583
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,200
and it just like once you've once you're at like

1584
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,440
Canadian TV production value,

1585
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,960
you kind of like the pulpy sound of it.

1586
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,960
Yeah, I felt like maybe it'd be interesting to watch some of the show.

1587
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,280
And it's like so much slower and it's not all boring.

1588
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,600
And then like you just watch a trailer of election year and like, oh, yes, a style.

1589
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,200
Like I think it's meant to be movies probably.

1590
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,560
It is meant to be because it's supposed to simulate a night, right?

1591
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,360
Which is much easier to simulate in a movie as opposed to over a season.

1592
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,560
Now, I haven't seen the actual TV show, so I don't know if they're still doing like

1593
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,200
I don't know how I'm sure it's probably like they lead up to the night

1594
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,760
and maybe the aftermath, I don't know.

1595
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,520
I mean, I'll probably watch it. Flash forward. Yeah.

1596
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,480
Dreams. Well, everything else we can do where the movie is very,

1597
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,200
it very easily lends itself to say the start of the movie is the beginning

1598
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,720
of the purge and the end of the movie is the end or the start of the movie

1599
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,920
is the beginning and the end of the movie is the end. That's it.

1600
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,480
That's it. It's pretty tidy to have a siren that begins your movie

1601
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,440
and a siren that ends your movie.

1602
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,080
Yeah. The fans commence.

1603
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,960
Should I add the siren at the start of the episode?

1604
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
I think you should.

1605
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,000
I think you should. Yeah. All right. I'll do it. Yeah.

1606
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,600
Yeah. But also you should leave you asking that question into the.

1607
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looking here.

1608
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,160
That you're like, ah, pull behind the curtain. Yeah.

1609
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,240
And the intro has to be.

1610
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,600
Oh, that's to be the intro. Oh, yeah.

1611
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,480
I wrote it already. Oh, did you?

1612
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,200
Great. Oh, wow.

1613
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,040
Scott wrote the great.

1614
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,320
I love it.

1615
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,480
You'll have heard it already. Yeah.

1616
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, the creative process at work.

1617
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,240
I'd be remiss if we didn't mention

1618
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,560
one of the more infamous Halloween Horror Nights purge

1619
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,160
a little Halloween Horror Nights.

1620
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,800
Whoopsie. That happened a few years ago.

1621
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,320
Oh, I know. Yes.

1622
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,720
I found this on L.A.S., but it was on most news websites at the time.

1623
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,040
So in one of the purge movies, they recreated this in the park

1624
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,920
in one of the scare zones where an auctioneer is auctioning off

1625
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,320
victims for purgers to then purge.

1626
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,640
And the auctioneers are very crass and bawdy. Of course. And

1627
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,520
a this is from the L.A.S.

1628
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,880
A trio of 13 year old girls and their mothers are not very happy about

1629
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,960
a universal Halloween Horror Nights actor who referred to the girls

1630
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,560
as hookers and sluts during a press conference yesterday.

1631
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,640
Two of the girls and their mothers, along with feminist lawyer

1632
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:50,000
Gloria Alred, said the incident occurred while they were visiting a hut

1633
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,320
based on the purge anarchy, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

1634
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,920
So if you are at a press conference,

1635
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,000
if there is a press conference being called with a number of people

1636
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,680
and Gloria Alred and it is about you, you fucked up.

1637
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,720
Yeah, that's a person I'd like to never say my name.

1638
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,920
Yeah.

1639
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,280
Listen, I will say that's one thing I do appreciate about Horror Nights.

1640
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,640
I, Fright Fest is probably the first, like, big entity of like horror

1641
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,800
that I went to as a as a teenager.

1642
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,800
And I don't remember them being able to curse and stuff like that.

1643
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,960
Obviously, and I cursed at Disney is not even a real Halloween.

1644
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,080
But like the.

1645
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,200
Yeah, we've never even talked about it.

1646
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,160
Who cares about it?

1647
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,680
It's boogie.

1649
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,560
Very nuts.

1650
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,120
It was scary.

1651
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,360
I will never pay for that in my life.

1652
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,600
And I love Disney.

1653
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,960
I will never pay for that.

1654
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,000
Boo bash.

1655
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah, boo bash.

1656
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,040
You're going to pay for the boo bash?

1657
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,480
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1658
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,840
But they like could get crass.

1659
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,760
Like I remember Chuckie like cursing people out one year.

1660
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,760
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1661
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,400
And, you know, we mentioned it already.

1662
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:05,920
It is on game for purgers to say stuff like that,

1663
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,680
because, again, all crime is legal for 12 hours.

1664
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,160
So they're not really thinking about decorum.

1665
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,040
And nothing about decorum at all.

1666
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,640
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in those movies that it's like, oh, we can't really.

1667
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,880
Even with the horror night standards, we can't we can't really do this.

1668
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,880
Yeah, you should probably like ID everybody.

1669
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,160
Make how old are they?

1670
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,400
All right. What am I allowed? OK.

1671
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,440
There's an age limit.

1672
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,240
I thought it was I didn't think it was as young as 13, but maybe I think you can go younger.

1673
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:38,240
I saw a very young child going to the house in front of me with her assume with father.

1674
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,560
And some of them look very excited to be there.

1675
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,000
Well, that's what I'm like, like, like this the whole time.

1676
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,960
And I'm like, child appears to be not fazed at all by any of this.

1677
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,800
Yeah. I don't know if it says more about me

1678
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,880
that if I would have heard that live in the park,

1679
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,440
I would have lost my mind laughing.

1680
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,640
I mean, it's absurd.

1681
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,800
Because I think I mean, like to I think.

1682
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,760
I mean, maybe you have to just kind of say on the ticket, which nobody reads,

1683
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,960
like, hey, this is going to be going to get some profanity here.

1684
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,760
You're going to get some of these things, right?

1685
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:21,080
This is this is PG 13 or, you know, at high PG 13.

1686
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,000
This is TV 14. Well, yeah.

1687
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,640
The problem is, no one reads the ticket.

1688
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,320
Well, I mean, yes, the protestors, actually, and nobody reads the ticket.

1689
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,160
But like you said, it makes sense that they would say wild shit.

1690
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,800
I mean, maybe don't call sure.

1691
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,720
And a hooker in a slut.

1692
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah, but it makes.

1693
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,800
But if I would have heard that, I wouldn't have like thought it was as jarring.

1694
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,840
Well, if I like if like because, you know, they have the new on the regular day,

1695
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,440
they have the New York Street performers.

1696
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,720
Yeah. We're like, hey, look at this guy or whatever.

1697
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,520
Like, if one of those guys called me a dickhead, I would have loved it.

1698
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,040
Yeah. Look at this guy.

1699
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,120
Look at this dickhead right here.

1700
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,400
And I'd be like, whoa, what? Oh, yeah.

1701
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,080
We have the Starway called you the evil Starway.

1702
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,640
Oh, you know about this, that the escalator turns.

1703
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,520
Yes. Mean.

1704
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,440
During or not. Yeah.

1705
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,920
This escalator. Yeah.

1706
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,400
Talks about you and like not like it's not life specific, but it does get mean.

1707
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,560
What's the thing about because they reference drugs.

1708
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,120
They I was on it.

1709
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,600
They do not mention weed anymore.

1710
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,320
They mentioned it multiple years in a row, at least not in the I was doing the whole thing.

1711
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,840
Like a couple of years ago, whenever we did it, it was like in like no smoking on the

1712
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,120
Starway. And that goes for weed.

1713
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,600
Yes, I remember that. No.

1714
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,560
It's so funny. It was great.

1715
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,960
I again, I was like, whoa, weed and universal.

1716
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,480
They said weed. Yeah.

1717
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,200
They did not say weed this time when I was on the Starway and I was crestfallen.

1718
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:55,080
I was so upset and I mentioned it to Tim Chang, who I was with and I was like, Tim, they

1719
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,080
usually say weed about weed.

1720
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,520
And he goes, what do you what?

1721
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,960
He goes, it's legal.

1722
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,680
I guess. Oh, yeah.

1723
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,120
That kind of hurts.

1724
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:03,880
Yeah, I guess it's not.

1725
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,440
No, we. Nark.

1726
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,240
Yeah.

1727
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,760
I guess. Hold on to the handrail.

1728
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,960
That means you hookers.

1729
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,120
I mean, I guess if you if you're going to call anybody a hooker, call everybody a hooker.

1730
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,840
Don't just single out.

1731
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,080
That's safer.

1732
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,720
That's a single out of 13.

1733
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,440
And it specifies that like the actors like, come here, come here.

1734
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,800
Hey, OK.

1735
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,360
And also at least just go because we're pro sex work.

1736
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Go. And that's a good thing.

1737
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,680
And we're fine with that.

1738
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,640
Yeah. Right.

1739
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,080
It should be legal outside the 12 hour.

1740
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,680
But you have to be 18.

1741
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,000
We went. We made mom and we say go, mom.

1742
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,440
Oh, it would be to be a working mother.

1743
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,040
You get to perch.

1744
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,320
Instead of be perched, you get to perched.

1745
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,640
Get it out of your system.

1746
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,440
Yeah, I can see why.

1747
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,280
I can see why mom was mad.

1748
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,440
I can see why.

1749
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,800
I laughed. I'm not going to lie.

1750
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,720
I laughed. It was funny.

1751
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,120
But I can see why mom was mad.

1752
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,440
One hundred percent.

1753
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,480
Well, and the moms, they didn't immediately call Gloria Aura.

1754
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,600
They tried to complain through email and phone calls.

1755
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,920
We're getting no response.

1756
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,360
And one of them's like, well, yeah, we could try.

1757
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,040
The ultimate record.

1758
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,360
I know someone we could reach out to.

1759
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,280
Yeah.

1760
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,600
Did they did they settle?

1761
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,440
What happened?

1762
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,040
I don't I think it was probably just like an apology or whatever.

1763
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,680
I would only got an apology.

1764
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,400
Like like in the way they just stopped doing Bill and Ted.

1765
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,680
They might have stopped like doing the auction or like just told the actors

1766
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,600
like, all right, I'll back that back.

1767
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,200
They got to go back with the megaphone and call the auctioneer, a hooker and a slut.

1768
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,720
And then it was even revenge.

1769
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,880
I was going to say, are they like Donkey apologized or something?

1770
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,920
Another character.

1771
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,440
Can you imagine them like specifically calling Eddie?

1772
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,400
You busy? So we need you to voice something for us.

1773
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,600
It's really going to help us out of a bind.

1774
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,080
It's really going to help us out of a bind.

1775
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,800
I make one movie every five years.

1776
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,240
You think I'm going to come? Right.

1777
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,520
It will count. This will count toward your contract.

1778
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,320
OK, this is one movie.

1779
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,960
It's a whole movie just to do Donkey in the Park one day.

1780
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,360
Well, that actually their their contracts for the first Shrek movie did specify.

1781
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,320
That's how they ended up being the actual voices in Shrek 4D.

1782
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,800
It's specified they had to do any theme park.

1783
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,960
And then, of course, it was another massive hits that, like, of course,

1784
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,120
they renegotiated for more money as they kept making Shrek movies.

1785
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,400
Hey, we haven't said officially R.P. Shrek 4D in Orlando.

1786
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,880
I just saw that. Yeah.

1787
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,160
I just saw they're closing it down.

1788
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,800
And look, I don't know what they're going to put in there, but I did like Shrek.

1789
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,720
I did like Shrek.

1790
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,280
Listen, I'm a fan of a show.

1791
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,880
I love a show. Sure. In part, it's a chance to rest.

1792
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,040
It's a chance to get some AC. Yeah.

1793
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,320
It's a chance to actually, you know, we're we're performance.

1794
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,240
It's a chance to see some performances or see like some content.

1795
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,520
I love I love a good show.

1796
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,880
So I really enjoyed the Shrek 4D.

1797
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,080
It was cool. Yeah, they put it there. Yeah. Yeah.

1798
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,720
They got rid of it out here already.

1799
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,200
But yeah, the last is do we know this Shrek 40 will be somewhere

1800
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,920
around the world still, right? Oh, there's got to be a few places.

1801
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,680
So showing in that giant castle, it's in a much better venue

1802
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,320
in one of the Asian parks. I don't remember which one. Right.

1803
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,000
So Japan, I think that's the only other universal, isn't it?

1804
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,840
No, there are. There's a couple.

1805
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,320
There's a couple like Beijing, Beijing, Beijing.

1806
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,160
Just open Singapore. The other one, Singapore.

1807
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,960
Or is there Japan? Am I wrong?

1808
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,200
No, there is. There is. OK. OK.

1809
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,920
So Saka Saka. Yeah. OK.

1810
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,440
That's interesting. That's cool.

1811
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,200
So they're all right.

1812
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,160
As long as Shrek will be somewhere in the world, we still wear in a world.

1813
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,520
He's big in Japan. Yeah.

1814
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,360
Any great music, Curtis? Yeah.

1815
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,400
I think that's what that's one thing I really love about horror nights.

1816
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:56,920
While I'll keep going and I'll complain how long the lines are

1817
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,960
or shell out two hundred dollars to get express, of course,

1818
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,120
absolutely asinine how much it is.

1819
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:08,560
But I do like that, like unlike other horror based things,

1820
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,080
they are taking properties that you know,

1821
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,000
and then you can be a little bit more adult.

1822
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,240
Sure. I'm a better word. Right. Sure.

1823
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,400
You know, they could take it too far, which they obviously did.

1824
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,680
But they can also have Chucky running around in this.

1825
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,520
I mean, I think they're used to kid or as a short actor.

1826
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,440
But it's like somebody like three feet tall.

1827
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,640
I remember one year. They do Chucky, really?

1828
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,240
It's somebody like three feet tall, like, wow, running around with a knife.

1829
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,240
Get the scares on.

1830
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,840
And it is funny, but it also kind of freaks you out

1831
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,480
because you just like see this thing coming at your kneecaps.

1832
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,680
Oh, yeah. They're all the old house of horrors.

1833
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,760
I think I said this, the first haunted house I had gone into in years

1834
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,280
was like six years ago, and they had a guy playing Chucky.

1835
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,840
They had someone playing Chucky.

1836
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,600
And at first they made them look like a robot, like with some like jerky movements.

1837
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,040
And then Chucky just came to life and threw a knife in my friend's throat.

1838
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,640
And I was really freaked because I had not been in a haunted house

1839
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,080
in years ever, maybe a very mild one when I was like little, probably.

1840
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:23,000
Yeah. So it's what you were saying, though, about theme parks, not being for kids,

1841
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,480
because then it finally feels a little bit more like now you have options

1842
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,520
for something that's a little bit more adult.

1843
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,840
Because like Universal Disney, I have to cater

1844
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,000
to tiny children and families.

1845
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Of course, we get it makes sense.

1846
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,120
I don't want everything to be like murderous and body.

1847
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,400
But I like magic.

1848
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,400
Of course, we all love magic.

1849
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,800
Equate murder and body.

1850
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,640
Those are two equal things for me since the two were.

1851
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,520
The two were since.

1852
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,720
Sex and death. Exactly.

1853
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,800
And I want a little time for both of them.

1854
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,880
Yeah. In my parks.

1855
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,760
But it just does a certain time and a place.

1856
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,560
There's a time and a place for it is what I'm saying.

1857
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,600
So, yeah, you get that with horror nights.

1858
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,040
Yeah, you do.

1859
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,440
I mean, I remember, I don't know, my first horror nights.

1860
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:19,160
They literally had go go dancers like in cages down in that area.

1861
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,200
This is when The Walking Dead was very popular, too.

1862
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,320
So it was the first year they had The Walking Dead maze.

1863
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,400
And like down there in that area where like

1864
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:33,640
the New York is near or something like that, they had like cage dancers.

1865
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,360
And like, I'm like, this is why.

1866
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,360
This is wild. Yes.

1867
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,400
That will only usually barely ever dance on the line.

1868
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,520
That's the whole isn't we.

1869
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,480
I was forever ago that we talked about the horror water world, slaughter world.

1870
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,560
Yeah. But isn't there kind of like a leather babe in it?

1871
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,760
Basically, yeah.

1872
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,080
I don't remember the specifics.

1873
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,480
They can find a way to work in some sort of like body burlesque

1874
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,880
to any franchise. Yeah.

1875
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,800
At our nights. Yeah.

1876
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,800
They can't.

1877
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,120
Uh huh. They can't.

1878
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,440
He's already got the bride.

1879
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,080
So there that's to you.

1880
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,880
And I don't quite know how they would have done it for Ghostbusters or us.

1881
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,920
And the licensing thing might not have been allowed.

1882
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,040
Yeah. Us is hard. Us is hard.

1883
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,360
Us is hard. Ghostbusters, I don't know.

1884
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,200
Yeah, probably. Dana, I guess.

1885
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,440
Zool? Zool?

1886
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,600
Gozers? Oh, Zool.

1887
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,000
Yeah, that was dancing to Gozers.

1888
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,960
We'll just recreate the Dan Aykroyd scene in the first.

1889
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,880
Just got to say, just got to say,

1890
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:37,280
just have just have a whole bunch of people going and unbuckling people's pants.

1891
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,320
It's instead of a room full of mannequins and one of the move,

1892
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,920
one of these ghosts starts going to town on the Aykroyd statue.

1893
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,560
There's five Aykroyd statues in this room.

1894
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,840
Yeah, they don't even do it to the guests.

1895
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,640
It's just a Dan Aykroyd statue.

1896
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:00,680
The statue doesn't move.

1897
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,800
But his eyes do.

1898
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,600
That's right. That's the only thing, the eyes just keep rolling.

1899
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,480
A recording of his actual voice coming.

1900
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,840
As I assume the noise he makes.

1901
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,440
A Crystal Hive vodka endorsement in between.

1902
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,200
What do you think Aykroyd sounds like?

1903
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,280
That would actually be very funny.

1904
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,040
Yeah, I was going to ask you, probably wrapping up soon.

1905
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,640
But what is there a thing from like if you were envisioning purge?

1906
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,920
Yeah. What would you do? Would it be a ride?

1907
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,520
Would it be a walk? What would it be?

1908
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,600
So are we keeping this in Horror Nights?

1909
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,640
Can we take it anywhere you want to be a theme park?

1910
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,800
So if I was if I was to do it now, now that you know,

1911
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,960
Universal has limitations, right? Yeah, of course.

1912
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:53,080
And I also know an hour ago, I said, man, I would never do the shit

1913
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,240
where they like and touch you and do all this.

1914
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,600
But, you know, I'm a hypocrite.

1915
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,200
So like that's the type of like purge that I would you want.

1916
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,360
I would do like sign the waiver. Yeah.

1917
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,080
Get the get the waiver, put it in the area and make it a night.

1918
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,240
Like, sure. Make it overnight because they have that.

1919
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,480
They have an overnight thing was designed to scare you.

1920
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,400
So make it an overnight.

1921
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,640
Make you feel like you are fighting for your life.

1922
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,040
And you get to hide places and see if people catch you.

1923
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,640
And like if you get caught.

1924
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,840
So there's it. So I would make a game out of it.

1925
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,520
If you get caught and you get killed, then you're out.

1926
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,800
You know, and then you go to like then you go to like just,

1927
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,200
I don't know, the holding area where now you can just relax

1928
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,920
for the rest of the night and drink and have fun or do whatever.

1929
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:45,080
But I would want it to be something where you can feel a little sense of the danger.

1930
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,200
You can feel people actually chasing you.

1931
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,960
Somebody can put their hands on you,

1932
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,040
which I know sounds daunting and crazy, but like what you're there for.

1933
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,560
That's what you're there for. Right.

1934
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,120
You might get messy. You know what I'm saying?

1935
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,920
So I would do something in that realm.

1936
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,760
They can lock you in a room.

1937
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,040
Like shit like that.

1938
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,400
Well, or things like that. I guess I should ask if I could curse.

1939
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,200
I'm so sorry. Oh, no, we're good.

1940
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,040
Just like a horror night.

1941
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,880
Yeah, just like their team.

1942
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,200
But only in October.

1943
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,200
October.

1944
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,760
So I think that would be my ideal thing, because I think the fun.

1945
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,160
And then it starts exactly how it starts.

1946
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,480
Seven p.m. The sirens go off.

1947
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,480
We hear it and you have to disperse.

1948
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,400
It's if you've ever been asleep no more.

1949
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,120
I have not, but I've heard.

1950
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,400
Yes. Sleep no more is a five story immersive theater

1951
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,720
where you can go anywhere and things like that.

1952
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,240
I would make it something similar.

1953
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:48,200
So I don't know if I would do it outdoors, because that would be indoors

1954
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,720
and it would be something similar to that, where you can go

1955
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,840
anywhere in this building, people can grab you so you can hide.

1956
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,800
You could do what you got to do and try to strategize surviving the night,

1957
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,040
which is for those of you who forgot, a Bruce Willis movie.

1958
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,040
Is it?

1959
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,040
Double check.

1960
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
Twenty twenty one.

1961
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,040
It came out.

1962
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,040
Another one.

1963
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,080
Twenty one came out an hour ago.

1964
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,480
Exclusive to to be.

1965
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,200
I have the night to.

1966
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,720
Yeah. Ready?

1967
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,320
So yeah, that would be my I think that would be my ideal thing.

1968
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,600
I would I would want to make it an immersive thing

1969
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,800
where you truly feel like you have to survive tonight.

1970
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,640
Yeah. Gamifying it is interesting.

1971
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,360
Yeah, definitely. Like making it.

1972
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,280
I don't know how you would figure that out.

1973
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,560
Maybe you could even have people reintroduced.

1974
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,880
It's a point thing even.

1975
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,040
I don't know. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

1976
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,960
Because I guess if you get killed in the first five minutes, you would be salty.

1977
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:52,440
Sure. So maybe like if you get killed, you you get to.

1978
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,480
And then obviously the actors will rotate.

1979
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,880
The scare actors rotate.

1980
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,080
You become a per you become one of the bad guys.

1981
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,760
Maybe you can become a perjurer.

1982
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,280
That might get dangerous.

1983
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,280
Yeah, probably.

1984
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,680
We can't do this completely flesh this out on my.

1985
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,040
Yeah, we have to sit and really crack this somewhere else.

1986
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,920
There's a foundation there for something like that.

1987
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1988
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,880
I think there was maybe it was 2019 or it was going to happen in 2020

1989
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,320
and it got canceled.

1990
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,520
But there was going to be an overnight kind of not officially Camp Crystal Lake.

1991
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,920
Yes. Sort of thing.

1992
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,640
I thought about doing it.

1993
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,440
Yeah, because you could buy different levels of ticket where they'd be like,

1994
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,200
oh, you would roast, you know, do s'mores.

1995
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,360
It would be like a camp.

1996
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,640
You would have a tent.

1997
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:39,040
There would be s'mores, but like certain zones like

1998
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,480
and you will go to sleep in your tent and then a monster will pull you out of your

1999
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,520
sleep like you will go to sleep and you will get up my coolies and scary like

2000
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,840
pulling like run.

2001
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2002
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,480
I still try to sleep.

2003
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,560
How could you go to bed knowing it was oh, boy.

2004
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:02,080
I mean, like the thing the thing with those is is mental.

2005
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,320
Right. Yeah. Like, yeah.

2006
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,480
In your heart of hearts or deep in the recesses of your brain,

2007
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,480
you know, they're not going to kill you.

2008
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,080
Yeah, yes.

2009
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,800
But like, there is an element of that where like it gets to a point

2010
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,200
where you start questioning like, am I in danger here or this doesn't?

2011
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,440
I don't like the way this feels.

2012
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,240
Something can go wrong.

2013
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,480
Yeah, I could be the first accident

2014
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,800
of this event or something like that, right?

2015
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,080
Well, which I was thinking, I mean, maybe you were talking about

2016
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,200
needing to put the franchise aside and bring it back.

2017
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,440
What if the way it comes back is there is a successful it's a movie

2018
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,760
where the purge movies exist in the world of the movie.

2019
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,920
And this this scenario now is a thing where you can do a fake purge night,

2020
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,880
but then it becomes thanks to a bunch of narrative wills.

2021
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,560
Yeah. Yeah. But it's real.

2022
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,000
Like an adaptation sort of meta.

2023
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,840
Yeah. Yeah.

2024
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,000
They were going to purge becomes a real purge.

2025
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,440
That's fun. That's good. Yeah.

2026
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,720
Do that with the movie. This is the end.

2027
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,560
Where you remember the movie?

2028
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:12,240
Yeah, I changed Franco and Seth Rogen and all those guys were playing themselves.

2029
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah, they were going to do a sequel to that movie.

2030
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:20,720
And the sequel was going to start with them at the premiere of This Is The End.

2031
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,280
We start the whole concept of the movie.

2032
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,040
So the sequel is going to start with them.

2033
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,200
Like one was a movie, but two really happened.

2034
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,960
And they didn't obviously they didn't do that.

2035
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:37,640
But I read like that was like the plan for what that was supposed to be.

2036
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,800
We've got that a little bit.

2037
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,880
There's something like that in another one of the great horror franchises,

2038
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,480
somehow untouched by Halloween Horror Nights, the human centipede.

2039
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh, where in the second one, it's I think like a guy who sees the movie

2040
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,360
and is obsessed with it.

2041
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:55,120
And then he gets the actress from the movie to be in his right.

2042
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,040
Yeah. You can't say it paid.

2043
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,920
I don't know why.

2044
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,760
I don't know. I don't know.

2045
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,720
You can't say it paid.

2046
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,440
I don't know why Universal is not people like they want to hire up scared.

2047
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,520
Why not have a 40 person human centipede?

2048
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,800
You're demanding that. Yeah.

2049
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,360
Get a centipede. I think it would be fun. Yeah. Yeah.

2050
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,000
Well, if they bring him breaks to give him a chance to breathe.

2051
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,040
Yeah. Make another movie.

2052
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,480
Yeah. There's another movie, right?

2053
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,040
There's been a couple of years since they've made one of those.

2054
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,560
And you just you shop the title and you do what they do with you.

2055
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,120
Just call it centipede.

2056
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,080
But everyone knows. Oh, good.

2057
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,560
Yeah. And then you play the human centipede theme just on a single piano key.

2058
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,520
Yes. Can I pitch this to?

2059
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,160
Yeah, of course. So I pitched what I would do for the Purge.

2060
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:44,200
That's me. Yeah. For Universal, if they're going to keep bringing the Purge in,

2061
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,240
which this is a very easy franchise for them to marry to Horror Nights.

2062
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,000
I get that. I get it. And it's fun.

2063
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,360
I'm not I'm not like it's so boring now where it's like this got to go.

2064
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,080
Sure. It's still very fun, especially if you're not into the movies

2065
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,360
or it's your first time going like they get you.

2066
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,120
I think what they should do

2067
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,880
because we know Disney is listening, but we also know Universal's listening.

2068
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,400
So we do NBC, NBC.

2069
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,520
I know you all hear this.

2070
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,400
I think what they should do is allow the Purge

2071
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:14,600
scare actors to go loose on the other scare actors in the park.

2072
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,240
Like, let's see, let's see, let's see.

2073
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:22,920
Like somebody from the Purge grab Chucky and beat the shit out of him.

2074
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,040
And like see it like you sitting there watching like, are you seeing what I'm

2075
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,880
seeing? Like that? Yeah, that would be fun.

2076
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,280
Like, yeah, because like that is the world, right?

2077
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,840
Like the Purge is supposed to be real and all these other things are moving into

2078
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,440
these. Like let the Purge free. Let them like go do some stuff.

2079
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,680
Yeah. I'm walking line in the month. Let them go into the ride.

2080
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,920
Yeah. Like let them free.

2081
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,600
I think that's the only phase.

2082
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,000
That's the only logical thing they can do at Universal.

2083
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,000
You've learned. I think you're taking what you learn from that first Fright Fest

2084
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,080
line and applying it to the defying X.

2085
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,560
Right. Defying expectations for the for the this is actually I mean,

2086
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,720
that's actually very good.

2087
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,200
Yeah, that's a natural heightening of that magic.

2088
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,200
The Jasmine with you in line, like which is just a magic trick.

2089
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,640
It's playing with your expectations.

2090
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,960
It's the event and something totally shocking happens.

2091
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,000
And it's like, yeah.

2092
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,240
And it was still mess with us and things like that.

2093
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,040
Like nobody's off limits for them.

2094
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:27,600
And obviously the people who are also actors, those are planned events.

2095
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,720
But for people watching, they don't know that.

2096
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,360
Right. I think it would be dope.

2097
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,720
I think that's their I think that's their next step.

2098
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,760
If they want to keep it going.

2099
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,520
It's a great idea.

2100
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,360
So let them go like kill the indominus Rex and

2101
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,000
the right around.

2102
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,920
Let them go to Jurassic World.

2103
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,760
Putting arrows in their throat.

2104
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,600
Yeah.

2105
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,160
Found it, father.

2106
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,520
This is so fun. This is a blast.

2107
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,840
Thank you so much for being here.

2108
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,600
This is a pleasure.

2109
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,160
Survive podcast, the raoncast, the fright.

2110
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:04,240
Oh, perilous one of scary one, a body one.

2111
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,120
And thanks for bringing us this topic.

2112
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,880
Let's exit through the we haven't horrified the gift shop.

2113
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,760
Yeah, you're right.

2114
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,000
Um, the gift shop.

2115
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,640
The good thank you for a few.

2116
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,800
Perfect. Let's exit through the gift shop.

2117
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,920
Is there anything that you would like to plug?

2118
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,920
Oh, thanks to plug.

2119
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,000
Yeah, you know, I think it's really hard because

2120
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:30,720
like I've been doing a lot of veal things, like I said, so come out.

2121
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,520
So we have to look at in twenty twenty three.

2122
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,080
So I think the easiest way to say for things that I'm not allowed to talk about yet

2123
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:42,600
is social media. Once things pop, then I'll like let people know.

2124
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,560
But there's a video game coming out that I might be in.

2125
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,040
There's a couple.

2126
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,520
There's a feature that I might be in soon.

2127
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,720
I might. I am. I record.

2128
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,840
And there are things coming out that

2129
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,800
that that are that are going to be viewable and able to watch.

2130
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,080
So I'm excited for some future stuff.

2131
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,400
Nice. Do you want to plug your social?

2132
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,680

Was that the siren?

2145
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:57,560
Oh, that's just my mouth.

2146
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,440
The prayers don't sound like it's over.

2147
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,960
That was fake.

2148
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,680
This is a trick. This is a purge trick.

2149
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,440
