1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,920
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,020
a show that with the number of tangents

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,140
and off-topic discussions could be described

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,160
as a series of legendary journeys.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,400
Yeah, you know, I like to think, that's good.

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,160
I like to think of what we're doing as like legendary.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,520
Like, you don't often think about your legacy

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
when you're in the middle of forging your legacy,

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,700
but now that I think about it, you're right.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,020
And what we're doing is going to be sort of

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,020
a Lord of the Rings style adventure,

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,220
the whole catalog we're building here.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,080
So thank you for that.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,140
That's true.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,080
And like a Lord of the Rings TV show

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,260
where every episode costs like $20 million an episode.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, the budget of Podcast The Ride,

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,140
people don't understand, is very high.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,140
Very high.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,300
Very high.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
I like Lord of the Rings and Hercules and Xeno.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,640
We are in New Zealand right now.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,040
We do zoom over in New Zealand.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,460
Scott Garner actually is on location elsewhere,

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
which is costing us a lot of money.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,940
Yeah, it's an island that even you guys aren't allowed

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,480
to know the location of or which ocean it's in.

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,460
Is it Mushake?

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,660
Let's just, well, let's just say that there's a number

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,060
of very helpful monkeys around.

33
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,860
All right, it's Mushake.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,040
I'll just say it's Mushake.

35
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,260
Okay, good.

36
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,480
Why do I dance around it?

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah.

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,480
Yeah, but it's, you know, the recording quality's great here.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,160
The ocean air actually, it all like kind of cancels out

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,060
and just sounds like nothing.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Like you're just in a room.

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,260
Yeah.

44
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,300
People don't know that the microphones,

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,020
we throw away a microphone after each record.

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,020
That really adds up as far as budget is concerned.

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,600
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,240
And don't clean them up very often.

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,380
You just end up with a big old pile like a dorm room trash can.

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,100
Yeah.

51
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,900
Or he's daring each other to be the one to take it out.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,780
We each have a room full of mics in our apartments and living spaces.

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,740
There's just a room full of unused mics.

54
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,220
We're waiting for somebody to pick them up.

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,240
Yeah, but if you bury down deep enough in them,

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,040
you will pull out like a fish skeleton with the head and tail still on.

57
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,220
Heathcliff style.

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,560
What, you're saying you've been eating fish in the room

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
and you've been throwing it in there?

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,180
Well, I need the, you know, it's the kind of good fats

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,840
in the Omega 3s and that sort of thing.

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,460
So you're saying it's almost like a junkyard that's mostly microphones

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,120
except for some remnants of fish like in a normal junkyard,

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,500
like Riff Raff and the other cats.

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,040
Yes.

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,320
Hector, my friend, my idol Hector would eat and throw in the junkyard.

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Yeah, I slide down the junk microphones to get to my Honda Civic,

68
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,960
much like his red Cadillac would come out of the junkyard.

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay, I get it.

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
I understand what you're saying now.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm not sure I want the tangent, but I don't think I know about your idol Hector from Heathcliff.

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:25,940
Oh, okay.

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
This is not a joke.

74
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,620
This quick side note here.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,840
I hate to say, I really want to talk about the Xena show.

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,760
Hercules and Xena, wizards of the screen.

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,480
They're wizards of the screen and we'll get to that.

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,900
I think I've mentioned it a little bit on the show.

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,400
Maybe I haven't said it specifically.

80
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,480
I just said this to Lindsay three days ago when I put Heathcliff on,

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,560
because I said Heathcliff doesn't generally make any sense if you watch it.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
Your memory of it is like, oh yeah, I kind of liked that when I was a kid.

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,900
The show doesn't, like, things happen and you're just really confused the whole time

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,140
because obviously nobody gave a shit.

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,740
But Hector, his look and his style, he was one of, there was a style,

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,640
like there were two cartoons basically, Heathcliff and then it was Riff Raff and the Cadillac cats.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,300
And they lived in a junkyard.

88
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,660
They had a car that transformed and I was like all in on the Cadillac cats.

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,500
I didn't care that much about Heathcliff.

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,880
And Hector had a headband and a tie.

91
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,220
And I thought this was the coolest guy I had ever seen on TV.

92
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,960
And I don't know exactly why, but whatever reason, you're looking at him now, Scott?

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
I'm looking at him now.

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,660
Yeah, I guess, I don't know.

95
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,520
I mean, your style isn't dissimilar.

96
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,120
You don't wear a lot of ties, but he's got, you know, it's sort of shaggy hair as you currently have.

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
I was wearing a couple of weeks ago, I was wearing a gator on my head,

98
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,100
which I honestly should put on now because my hair is still long and unruly.

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,820
But I was wearing and I think I said to Lindsay, hey, I look like Hector from the Cadillac cats.

100
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,660
She's like, what?

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Who?

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,600
I go, Hector, you know, Riff Raff's friend from Heathcliff.

103
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,900
She's like, oh, OK.

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,660
And I was like, yeah, he was like, I liked Hector a lot.

105
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
Well, good for you.

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,340
Yeah.

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,340
Very supportive.

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,580
A lot of people say after I shout information at them.

109
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,780
Well, I obviously was very fond of Riff Raff because he's a short guy with a real big mouth

110
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:29,720
and he had a jaunty scarf and a big hat, you know, a cat girlfriend that was basically had the body of a human woman.

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,640
That's true.

112
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,280
And taller than him, like my girlfriend, like anyone I've ever dated taller than me.

113
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:47,180
Yeah, this is an extremely sexualized in Google Image Search in various forms on your Deviant Arts, Cleo, the cat.

114
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,160
This is like people got a problem with boy, this goes and goes and goes.

115
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:01,000
So pages, I'm not sure I've ever seen this much sexualized animated animal art of Cleo.

116
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,160
I can't you can barely even find regular photos of Cleo.

117
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:14,580
I think it's very it must be because she like it's very like come hither eyes and then a ponytail and then like in very and like sort of like a big 80s workout socks.

118
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,940
And then the skin tone is just like kind of human flesh colored.

119
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,480
So if you like squint, it just kind of looks like a naked woman.

120
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:33,220
That being said, little too much Cleo, the ratio of sexualized Cleo to regular Cleo is like 20 to one.

121
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,940
It's crazy.

122
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,240
I guess that shouldn't surprise me.

123
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,180
I have not looked into this.

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,940
I was not when I watched Heathcliff.

125
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,340
I was not I had nothing dirty on my brain.

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,500
I was not I was not thinking of that way.

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:55,320
But if you see Cleo, you can imagine that like a bunch of messed up people that made an impression on them.

128
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,180
Maybe not messed up.

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,940
I shouldn't say that.

130
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:08,700
But just maybe they were at the right age and they were appreciating the human form via a cartoon of a cat woman, I guess, when when you say it like that.

131
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,480
And then, yes, that leads to all the deviant art that we should never speak of again.

132
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:24,300
We just had we had just nothing but respect for, you know, comedic icon characters like this fellow in a tuxedo pulling his tie.

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,100
It looks like kind of like a fancy like a cat skills comedian or almost Liberace.

134
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,140
And according to the episode title, his name is the Great Pusini.

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,360
I guess I'm putting that poose on it so that I'm not just saying Pusini.

136
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,220
But who knows?

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,300
I'd have to watch to find out.

138
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:50,080
There's no pornography, though, of this like cat Krusty the Clown-esque character, the Great Pusini.

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,420
There's a very cute drawing of Cleo in Riff Raff.

140
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,840
He's given her a rose.

141
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,580
That's wholesome.

142
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,580
Yeah, that's wholesome.

143
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,480
That's what we like.

144
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,860
But she's also like sticking her butt at him.

145
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
I think there's still this is still a sort of sexual.

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,740
It's just tamer than the other stuff.

147
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,420
It's just tamer than the other ones.

148
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:17,640
I think that you can see a lot of like animators and people who are designing things like working stuff out as far as their female character designs over the years.

149
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,420
And that's still continuing, especially their feed.

150
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,540
They're animal female characters.

151
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,820
And the big criticism is that like, you know, your Lola Bunny has the body of a human woman.

152
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,760
And then the other Looney Tunes are all just like little weird aliens, weird little animals.

153
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah, I wish there was more like idealized drawings or like exaggerated drawings of short King Riff Raff.

154
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,200
You know, it's a lot of Cleo.

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,420
Do you think Riff Raff has like a little cane?

156
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,280
He wears a Dom DeLuis kind of hat going.

157
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,540
Is this a thing, Jason, you thought about maybe one day acquiring and putting into your fashion rotation?

158
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:15,980
Any time as a theater kid, I was in the prop room and there was like a little cane in a bin with like, I feel like any theater prop room has like a bin of crutches, canes, umbrellas.

159
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,600
Like, you know, I was fiddling around with that sort of thing.

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,980
Or it would be like if I had a part in something, I was like, hey, could this character have a cane?

161
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Could this character have like a fun hat?

162
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,140
Like, yeah, I think that's good.

163
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,680
I think you need.

164
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,500
Yeah, I think coming out of the pandemic, you got to do something.

165
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,340
Yeah, we put all the accessories right, right.

166
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,280
And I think maybe the riff raff is what you're looking for.

167
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,660
Yeah, I mean, I have the mustache.

168
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,560
I think I do need some more accoutrements coming out of quarantine.

169
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,880
Yeah, so cane, if you see a man with a mustache with a little cane and a Dom DeLuis hat, it's Jason.

170
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,180
It's not Riff Raff.

171
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,780
Yeah.

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,500
Yeah.

173
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah.

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,680
All right.

175
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
Well, today's episode involves some Jason performance.

176
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,660
Yes, it does.

177
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,560
I understand.

178
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, that's what I understand too.

179
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,700
That's true.

180
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:25,340
Hercules and Zeno, Wizards of the Screen, a very powerful title for a ride that an attraction that limped along for about three years before eventually literally being condemned.

181
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,680
Yes.

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:39,380
I think it is notable among in my eyes as being one of the few theme park experiences where when they said, can we have a kid volunteer?

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,420
I, shocking my family, strongly raised my hand and volunteered to do it.

184
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:46,980
Wow.

185
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,520
Wow.

186
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:58,680
So you are a star of this attraction, which I, you know, when I was a kid, I saw my mom do the soap opera show at Disney's Hollywood Studios or MGM Studios at the time.

187
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,160
But I was scared.

188
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,500
So you, did you even, let me ask you this, did you surprise yourself with it?

189
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,420
Because sometimes that would happen when I was a kid.

190
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,180
I would sort of surprise myself by doing something.

191
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,880
I think so.

192
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,160
I think it worked out where we were like, we were in the kind of in the front of the area when they asked.

193
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,880
And I had done a few plays at this point.

194
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,980
So like, I'm josing, josing for stage time for attention.

195
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,400
And I raised my hand and my family was like, oh, fuck, really?

196
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,420
All right.

197
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,060
That's what they said.

198
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,500
Oh, fuck.

199
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,920
The audience volunteering section.

200
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,040
That's right.

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,840
My, my famously profanity averse mother was just like, shit, man.

202
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,360
She was.

203
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,260
Yeah.

204
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:59,960
And, and I, I volunteered to be, I don't know if I knew what I was volunteering for even because this was like not a show that we knew we were like, oh, there's something new here.

205
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,180
I think we probably would have done it like summer of 98.

206
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,360
So it'd been going for a little while, but they used audience volunteers.

207
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,200
This was a big green screen and ADR kind of show.

208
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,660
And I was like a child centaur.

209
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,940
They, they take some audience volunteers.

210
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:30,380
They put them in like, you know, armor and head pieces and then blue screen from the waist down to be like the bottom half of you was a horse.

211
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,680
And you helped Hercules like shoot crossbows at bad guy.

212
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,000
Like you kill some people and then you waved like Hercules.

213
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,040
What does he say?

214
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,960
I caught the video.

215
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,620
There's not a, there's footage of this online.

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,300
It's really cut up, but there you can find footage of Hercules going like, uh, thanks centaurs.

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,240
He just hit the play.

218
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,680
They like throws to a little moment.

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,580
Yeah, from the audience.

220
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:03,980
Cause by then they know these are some of us and they're in the show just kill every time it really does kill in the footage online.

221
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,660
He literally says, Hey guys, thanks a lot.

222
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,200
And then goes about his business, gives them a look like these, these knuckleheads.

223
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,540
Hey, well, whatever, whatever it takes to get a 10.

224
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:27,900
So you're the, you were kind of the Ewoks of this, the like the odd creatures who get caught up in the battle and surprisingly, we were craftily resourcefully help save the day.

225
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,620
Yeah, pretty much.

226
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:35,760
And I'm sure there, there might be a quick picture, like a quick, like very dim picture.

227
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,200
Cause I think by like 98 or 97, we were like, we're not bringing the brick of a video camera to the theme park.

228
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,180
And we're like, we're good.

229
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,540
We don't need, and we don't watch these.

230
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,580
We take these videos.

231
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,980
We don't watch them.

232
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,820
So, and there's no purchase opportunity.

233
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,740
This wasn't one of those where you buy the $28 video of you as a center.

234
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,480
No, we immediately inquired about that.

235
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,740
Anytime I've won it one, there was not an option to buy not like Mike's fold, like karaoke spectacle.

236
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:20,540
But so there might've been one quick shot of like the, the point and shoot camera with some features right before we got a digital camera, you know, two years before we splurged for an early digital camera.

237
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,460
I've thought about this, like, cause there's, there's a lot of attractions like this where you go, oh, they should have had a video tape to be sold.

238
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah.

239
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,420
But it must just be because only a few people are chosen.

240
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:39,640
So the idea is probably maybe they'd only sell four like cassette, like VHS's after each performance.

241
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,220
And it doesn't make monetary sense to have that whole apparatus going.

242
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,080
You know what I mean?

243
00:14:45,280 --> 00:15:00,580
A live quickly spitting out videos because if they only make $300 in a day, if that, yeah, why have an on staff, a tape labeler, tape cranker out.

244
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:00,680
Right.

245
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,500
Doesn't make sense.

246
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,820
Yeah.

247
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,320
Money wise.

248
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,940
Because like the Star Trek show, the Star Trek special effects show, that was part of the appeal.

249
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,260
It's like you buy it at the end or you can buy it at the end.

250
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,180
Come do it.

251
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:21,740
When we talked about like there was a Nickelodeon kind of game show audience participation show at one of the former Paramount parks, they really push that.

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Like, and if you're in this game show, you can buy the tape of it at the end.

253
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,320
Like this was not the case with that.

254
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Probably because it's hard to film like, all right.

255
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,820
And then these people are behind a green screen.

256
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,420
This guy's hitting wind chimes.

257
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,260
This guy makes an ugly face that they superimpose on like a goblin.

258
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,500
This boy is taking a wrench and just wailing on a pipe.

259
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,760
Yeah.

260
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,520
To make noise.

261
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah.

262
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,760
I mean, this show, there's a lot of screen like you are put into.

263
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,500
I mean, they did film original footage with Hercules and Xena for this.

264
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,060
And it is projected on giant standard definition screens at weird angles.

265
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,860
Another screen ride though from Universal.

266
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,660
And another like, yeah, like here's how you make a show.

267
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,840
But then the things in the show are real.

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:23,500
Probably the thing to say about it that we haven't said because it's possible people don't know these shows anymore.

269
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,000
These were like the titans of syndicated television in the late 90s.

270
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,940
Sort of sort of taking over from Baywatch like as Baywatch descended.

271
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,940
So Rose Hercules, the legendary journeys.

272
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,780
That's why you said that.

273
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,020
Right.

274
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,360
That's the name of the show and Xena Warrior Princess, which is a spin off of Hercules legendary journeys.

275
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,500
Yeah, there is something very special about this era genre.

276
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:59,740
And I don't want to say low budget, but kind of low budget shows because they were still like shows that had a, you know, they were at production value.

277
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,560
We had to have.

278
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,220
Yeah.

279
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:08,060
But Lindsay's been watching some Xena lately and I'll come into the room and I'll be like, look, I like watching Xena.

280
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,240
Some of these sets look like a porno.

281
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:21,600
Like there's just no, like she's in supposedly like a magical cave and it's just like a piece of like an obvious piece of like wooden backdrop stone and then like a curtain.

282
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,820
And I go, this looks awful.

283
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,460
This looks so cheap.

284
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,660
And I like that.

285
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,920
I really like that about it.

286
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,840
I like that about this sort of genre of show.

287
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,620
Maybe it's like they could have made like they had the production value and they went and shot this stuff in New Zealand.

288
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,680
That's the big thing.

289
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
So you've got the natural beauty of New Zealand helping you out.

290
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:49,060
But maybe they had the budget and resources to make like three really good episodes, not 30.

291
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,420
Right.

292
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,020
Like the amount of crank it out that syndicated required.

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,960
Yeah.

294
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,340
Maybe.

295
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,520
The history of like syndicated shows like Star Trek Next Generation is famously syndicated, I think.

296
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,700
But even though some search for Next Generation looks cheap is like I think a bigger budget show than most of these things.

297
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,120
But like there was so many we've talked about, of course, beloved show Relic Hunter.

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,320
We've talked about all these different syndicated shows that were sort of in the same like hour long genre.

299
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,900
Yeah.

300
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,860
Your Valerie Irons Protection Agency, VIP.

301
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,800
Of course.

302
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,380
VIP.

303
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,480
I think it was VIP.

304
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,620
I think it was.

305
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,700
Because of the name, it's Valerie Irons Protection.

306
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,120
Pamela Anderson is Valerie Irons.

307
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah.

308
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,800
And there was, which was Christopher Lloyd in Relic Hunter.

309
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,220
He was in another one.

310
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,660
Are you thinking, Jason, are you thinking of Christopher Lloyd and Pamela Anderson's sitcom Stacked?

311
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,420
No, I'm not thinking of Stacked.

312
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,780
I think there was another genre show.

313
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,720
I know what you're thinking of.

314
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,340
And I've mentioned this before.

315
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,380
It was a UPN show.

316
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,340
And it was, and I'm already, he was of course Sebastian Jackle.

317
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
Yeah, Sebastian Jackle.

318
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,960
And there was a Bruce Campbell one too that was kind of a squashbuckler show.

319
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
Briscoe County Jr.

320
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,220
Adventures of Briscoe County Jr.

321
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,510
There was Sinbad that came up on the Sinbad episode.

322
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:28,160
Like as, as like the morning kids cartoons block wind it down, you would roll right into Hercules and or Xena, especially if there was like no sports.

323
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
And everyone, I remember watching them kind of checked out.

324
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,020
Like I was, it was not appointment viewing for me.

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,020
My dad, I think, would watch them too.

326
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:46,580
We'd all be kind of falling asleep, you know, falling into a Saturday nap watching these shows half awake.

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
I mean, though, that's really maybe not the show's fault.

328
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,480
You know, Saturday.

329
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,980
If we eat a large hot breakfast, you know, and everyone's just chilling out, you know, taking it easy.

330
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,120
Large hot breakfast.

331
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,060
Excuse me.

332
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,640
Excuse me.

333
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,380
I have a question.

334
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,580
Poor girl eggs, scrappling eggs.

335
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
They sit in your gut.

336
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,120
You know, how often would you have a large hot breakfast on Saturday morning?

337
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Oh, often like that.

338
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,260
We didn't eat hot breakfast during the week.

339
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:13,840
Like my.

340
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,260
Sure.

341
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Or if we did, like if my mom, we would microwave, like, you know, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches before school at most or like the pancakes, the sausage on a stick wrapped in pancakes.

342
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,040
Like that was as elaborate.

343
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,540
I feel like the sausage content over the course of your entire life is twice as much as the person.

344
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,680
You know, I we got feedback on the people commenting on the Toronto Raps episode.

345
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,820
It's like, I'm shocked.

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,420
Yeah, I cook a lot of sausage, you know, in other parts of the country.

347
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,960
I think we got comments saying comments on the page.

348
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,460
See, yeah, I did see somebody who was was like, they've never cooked sausage before.

349
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,940
Yeah, people from the Midwest.

350
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,140
I think we have.

351
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,220
All right.

352
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,280
Do we have not cooked sausage?

353
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,220
A lot.

354
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,920
OK, OK, sure.

355
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm trying to think if I've cooked sausage.

356
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,980
I don't know that I have.

357
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,400
I mean, I usually.

358
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:09,840
Right.

359
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,700
You think I know, but I'm not sure exactly.

360
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,060
I've I've.

361
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,820
If it's a hot dog, I reheat it.

362
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,080
If it's sausage, I feel like I always buy the cooked ones and you just eat them up somehow.

363
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,860
Boil it or put it in the microwave or grill it.

364
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,100
But it's already like cooked.

365
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,400
Do you think this may be a coast issue that as on the East Coast that your level of sausage consumption is average?

366
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah, East Coast and Midwest.

367
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,160
I mean, if you go to, you know, a real New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York kind of diner,

368
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:49,100
you're if you order eggs and potatoes and toast, it's like a it's a list of what your meat is going to be.

369
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,460
Sausage, bacon, Italian sausage, hot or sweet, Scrapple pork roll.

370
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm probably missing some corned beef hash, maybe a possible option.

371
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,520
I had a good amount of sausage in my life.

372
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm just saying cooking it.

373
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,480
Yeah, for sure.

374
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I mean, there's definitely a period where I was sausage over bacon if I was ordering at IHOP or Denny's.

375
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,680
So, yeah, I'm not trying to say, oh, I don't even know anything about this sausage.

376
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,220
That's not what I'm trying to portray here.

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,220
I'm just trying to say, yeah, I don't know.

378
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,400
You're not being one of those snooty I don't know about sausage guys.

379
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,840
No, I'm salt of the earth.

380
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,240
I know sausage.

381
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,340
I eat sausage, but I don't know.

382
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,680
Yeah, give me a truly raw sausage.

383
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,680
I'm a little I don't know exactly what to do with it.

384
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,220
Yeah, you don't want to get food poisoned.

385
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,880
I get it.

386
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,440
I get it.

387
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,700
I keep it in the freezer.

388
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,840
It's something to have in the freezer.

389
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,660
Pull it down for eggs or you cook it, toss it in some pasta or something.

390
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,620
So hot breakfast.

391
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,360
What did you say?

392
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,460
It was a big hot breakfast.

393
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,500
Hot and hot was the large hot breakfast.

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,260
So you're just hanging out large hot lunch.

395
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,900
Well, hoagies usually cold, but steak, you know, picking up steaks, cheese steaks.

396
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,460
That's hot.

397
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,820
But I feel like these syndicated shows were to like, I agree.

398
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
Yes, absolutely.

399
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,340
That was the yes, I don't all of these shows I have paid attention to if I was watching them.

400
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,260
I was not like where I mean, I was way into Star Trek Next Generation.

401
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,200
Deep Space Nine would come on.

402
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,520
Deep Space Nine I've still never dug into, which I've been meaning to.

403
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,220
But that used to come on Saturday afternoon, which I was even if I was watching it, I was a little checked out until like Quark showed up.

404
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
And I enjoyed his antics.

405
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah.

406
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,260
The Ferengi, the bartender of Ferengi.

407
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,480
But this at one point was the number one show in the world.

408
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,960
Hercules, at least according to if you listen to Kevin Sorbo talk for the actor who portrayed Hercules,

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:02,020
he will certainly toss out that it was the number one show in the world that was part of this lawsuit that came up where he felt entitled to more profits from the Hercules series.

410
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,940
And part of that was the number one show in the world.

411
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,860
Why would I not be seeing more from that?

412
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,300
I don't really it doesn't feel right to me.

413
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,960
Maybe if you just it's like you I don't know if being everywhere in the world doesn't mean it's the biggest thing in the world.

414
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,760
He doesn't even feel obviously Hasselhoff and Baywatch loom larger for me because I like them now.

415
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,800
But you kind of felt like you knew that Baywatch that Hasselhoff was huge internationally.

416
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,260
Was Sorbo?

417
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,860
I'm confused how big Sorbo got.

418
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,600
That's a good question.

419
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,260
I mean, I don't know.

420
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:34,600
Maybe.

421
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:42,480
Obviously Sorbo in recent years has been a little bit more Christian, a little bit more annoying.

422
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,440
Yeah.

423
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
So to put it lightly.

424
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,360
But maybe maybe just because Hasselhoff had outside like in depth, like he was doing, he was singing.

425
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,060
We knew about his singing career even back then.

426
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,520
We knew about some of that all like and maybe Sorbo wasn't doing as much extracurricular.

427
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,480
And I will look up does Kevin Sorbo have an album right now?

428
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,260
Oh, that's a good question.

429
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:13,760
Well, while you do that, there's a premise that I want to introduce into this episode because, you know, this can't be an all Kevin Sorbo episode.

430
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:28,580
And, you know, I want to make it about, you know, I don't even want to I don't want to make it about the personal life and the fact that he thought that the storm on January 6th was all actors pretending to be right winger because he tweeted.

431
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:39,860
He said, these don't look like patriots to me with a photo of the QAnon shaman like he thought it was a leftist pose like ruining the name of the great patriots.

432
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,840
But that's that's his personal life and his Twitter presence.

433
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:55,140
I want to pay tribute to this man's body of work because he has been I mean his level of his acting credits are as long as sausages that Jason is fond of.

434
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,320
It's a massive list.

435
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,940
There's so much there.

436
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,440
And I just want to like, in order to make it not just about Hercules.

437
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,560
Here's what's going to happen in this episode every 15 minutes an alarm is going to go off.

438
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,100
And that's the sorbometer.

439
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,400
And when that happens, I'm going to read several of his credits from his IMDb.

440
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:31,540
And just as an example, because there's so many and the people might not know if you're if you're a heathen and are not versed in Christian cinema or just generally unreleased cinema, then you might not know some of Kevin's work.

441
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,140
So let me just read a few of the parts that he's played and in what films.

442
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,380
Actually, these are all just announced.

443
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
These haven't even happened yet.

444
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,660
Detective Chase Riley in Ghost Killer.

445
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,900
Larry Masters in Final Invasion.

446
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,000
And let's see, Dr.

447
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,420
Ben Riley in The Girl Who Believes in Miracles.

448
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,720
Those are all post 2021 what I just listed.

449
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,180
And now I will I will reset the sorbometer just so all of these great films get their get their day.

450
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,540
Also the name of Spider-Man's clone in Marvel Comics.

451
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,620
So that's right.

452
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,280
Yeah, you're not really supposed to reuse exact character names.

453
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,220
But I know it's kind of doctor in there.

454
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,380
You have a doctor that's transformative, that's transformative.

455
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,320
OK, probably.

456
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,280
Yeah, that's different.

457
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,380
Plays a lot of doctors.

458
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,040
He's Dr.

459
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,140
Robinson in Faith Under Fire.

460
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
That sounds pretty good.

461
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,980
Faith, the movie Faith Under Fire in 2020.

462
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,100
That's a hot button.

463
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,900
Tell a lot of people feel they're facing.

464
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,780
Yeah, I here's a shock to me.

465
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,640
Kevin Sorbo, not in the crazy Roe versus Wade movie.

466
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,980
That's right.

467
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,660
He and Jamie Kennedy like didn't bother to read the script or the title of the project he agreed to.

468
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,780
Has he maybe made already like five Roe versus Wade movies and he doesn't want to repeat himself at this point?

469
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,200
Well, I'm going to let I don't want to step on Scott's toe.

470
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,560
I know some stuff he's made that probably falls.

471
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,880
I have a look.

472
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,560
I have some of it.

473
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,220
We can go.

474
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,500
It doesn't have to be all off of the sorbometer.

475
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,440
You can throw Sorbo's out regardless of the sorbometer.

476
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm happy to I'm happy to bow to the sorbometer.

477
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,280
Because God's not dead.

478
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,460
He's God's not dead.

479
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,900
Right.

480
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,980
I think so.

481
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,440
Yeah.

482
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,760
Yeah.

483
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,920
I mean, it's hard to find it.

484
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:25,360
It's a needle in the haystack of 144 acting credits, but he's at least in one of the is he like the yeah, he's the star of the big of he's

485
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,080
Professor Radisson and the first God's not dead.

486
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:39,600
He might be the liberal scumbag professor from like the he might be the encapsulation of those memes about Marine Todd going to punch out the liberal professor.

487
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:48,760
I hate to be lewd and bring up porno again, but it does feel like these are all like fake porno movie like act like character names.

488
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,120
And then he has the amount of credits that a porno actor would have as well.

489
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,960
Kind of like a hundred movies in a year.

490
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:07,300
And these sets were probably likely cheap rental houses deep in the San Fernando Valley that probably used for porno at some point after probably used for porno.

491
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:14,880
And if of course, if it's like something weird, if it's like a cauldron or even or even like a courtroom, if you need a cheap courtroom,

492
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,620
then you're either a Funny or Die sketch from 10 years ago, a Christian movie or a porno shooting.

493
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,360
I think we're like the doctor's office shares a wall with the courtroom.

494
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,220
And I've been in that I've been in that courtroom.

495
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,300
I've been in the bar set that's right by there as well.

496
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,720
One of them just closed a big one just closed where it was like it was all of those things.

497
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,220
Here's here's an airplane and a courtroom and all that.

498
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:44,380
And for some reason, the photo on the website was just like a like kind of a cheesecake style photo of the owner.

499
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:51,520
Like putting her putting her leg up like she was like, you know, posing on a bomb in a World War Two poster.

500
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Wow, really?

501
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,840
I don't think I even want to shoot here.

502
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,780
Meet me.

503
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,760
Hey, Martha.

504
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,220
I don't know who it was.

505
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,720
Just like a Louse.

506
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,880
We got a deal out this dorm room set.

507
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,320
The Christians are coming tomorrow.

508
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,160
Get the UV out, light out.

509
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,820
You see how many stains we can find.

510
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,360
I like how she's like little Vicky or something like she's an old showbiz legend.

511
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:30,300
Yeah, I want to give credit to Lucy Lawless, who you can find footage of the opening day ceremony of the the Hercules and Zena show.

512
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:37,580
And she just immediately she's much funnier and charismatic than Kevin Swervo.

513
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,760
Like you can tell in the few minutes that they're standing next to Universal executive Tom Williams.

514
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,580
Tom Williams still hanging in there, still hanging out.

515
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,780
His current title is he he's like a big wig still at Universal.

516
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,720
I forget where I say we like our we know our Disney people a little bit.

517
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,940
I can't say that I really track the Universal executives.

518
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,460
Yeah.

519
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,200
So Tom Williams, I think, was like maybe the head of just this park.

520
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,960
Tom Williams, current title is chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Parks and Resorts.

521
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,760
And he serves on the NBCU executive committee.

522
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,720
So he's like he's like the Josh Demaro of Universal.

523
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,300
It seems that way.

524
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:38,680
But like, yeah, I think he was an executive when this this was open in 97 and now it's just like climbed the ranks and it's still still hanging in there.

525
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,260
Well, he's not the Josh Demaro unless like everybody's like getting wet for him.

526
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,040
That's been the we don't know what we're talking about.

527
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,980
There's this Disneyland executive who's like, I guess, kind of handsome.

528
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,580
And then just the day that Disneyland reopened, I just there was just all these thirsty posts for this guy.

529
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,800
It just really weirded me out.

530
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,080
Like, I just never seen it before.

531
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,900
I guess it just hit me in a wave.

532
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,580
Maybe there was like a lot of like discussion of this guy that I hadn't been privy to.

533
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,000
And then just I think something about the emotion of Disneyland's opening just then also it's just like in this guy, man, this guy.

534
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,980
I just want to like crawl up against his shoulder for a couple hours and just cry it out and he'll keep me warm with his strength.

535
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,260
It's so weird.

536
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,760
You just need two things.

537
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,900
You need a three piece suit and you need a tailor to fit it to you.

538
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:40,180
You know, and that's that's how you can do a transformative like reality TV transformation for yourself is get get a suit properly tailored.

539
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,640
Yeah.

540
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:47,900
And if I mean, if Josh, Josh, tomorrow when it took it to a new level, he could get a little cane and Dom DeLuis hat as well.

541
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,840
Oh, well, now now I'm on board.

542
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,680
People couldn't handle it too much.

543
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,960
Too much to be thirsty for.

544
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,620
Yeah.

545
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,040
Thomas L.

546
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:05,500
Williams is probably not in he's probably not daddy like Josh tomorrow is, I will say.

547
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,420
And no offense to Mr.

548
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:06,880
Williams.

549
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm sure he's a very nice man.

550
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,860
To me, I don't know.

551
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,160
Bad looking guy.

552
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,160
He just looks like he's just a guy.

553
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,800
But Josh tomorrow is that nobody ascends to Josh tomorrow heights is what we learned.

554
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,740
We asked this question of can executive various Disney executives get it.

555
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,720
And I guess what we learned is he can definitely get it.

556
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,900
Are we going to do an episode of Josh tomorrow exclusively?

557
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,300
Maybe maybe the thing by asking the question, I feel like it becomes.

558
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,980
A guarantee you can, but I don't know this part out later.

559
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,520
I'd be sure I have no I have no problem with that.

560
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,700
It's because a name gets said.

561
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,380
Does it mean it has to be a full thing?

562
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,460
Maybe specific episodes for different people that were in the company at JPEG tomorrow.

563
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,340
Williams, we got a hit for a while.

564
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,300
Who's the new president of Ken Potts?

565
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,420
Potts.

566
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,320
Yeah, I thought it was Rock.

567
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,360
I could be wrong.

568
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,160
I've never rock is cool.

569
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,600
Rock is a cool last name, but that's that's the new president of Disneyland.

570
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:19,620
Man, that guy came on board like spring, like May 22, like first time to become the head of Disneyland.

571
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,060
He's a war time.

572
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,400
Wow.

573
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,460
Yeah.

574
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,360
So he's a war time president.

575
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,180
He's like, well, he's like Woodrow Wilson.

576
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,700
Yeah.

577
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,680
And FDR.

578
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,300
Yeah.

579
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,240
We were saying about Lucy Lawless.

580
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,680
I think.

581
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,920
Yeah, like I was just thinking about I forgot that that Zena spun off from Hercules.

582
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,960
And I feel like regardless of the stat of Hercules was the most popular show in the world.

583
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,300
I think Zena exceeded it in terms of pop culture relevancy.

584
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,240
And just, of course, everybody was so into her and into the character.

585
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,060
And he must have been so mad.

586
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:07,020
Sorbo must have been so mad that this spin off character, this woman even just takes the baton and just runs with it.

587
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Like and then they're equal.

588
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,700
He's at that opening probably going like Hercules and Zena.

589
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,980
She's with Zena Hercules plus Zena.

590
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,240
If we have time, she was created from Hercules's rib.

591
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,940
She was taken out of just his rib.

592
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,360
She was lesser than Hercules.

593
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,740
Is that the same?

594
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,480
Is that one here?

595
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,180
Oh, OK.

596
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
Is that can?

597
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,800
Could be.

598
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,020
Let's say it is.

599
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,520
Let's say it happened in an episode.

600
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:40,940
They mixed because the bad guy in this attraction is Ares, the god of war, and Hera, I think that's right.

601
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,800
They're all just kind of mushing mythology with general fantasy stuff.

602
00:35:46,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Well, there's in that to that end, I found an article saying that they there was a protest by a Hindu group that was upset because they just put Krishna in the show.

603
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,300
And like so like a whole here's this holy figure that's now just like, ha, it's me, Krishna.

604
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Like, and I'm presented as like, you know, it's a cyclops and a giant and Krishna.

605
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,760
And there's the there was the quote in an article about this.

606
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,860
We are outraged.

607
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,920
How would Christians feel if a bunch of Hindus took Jesus Christ and filmed Zena punching him in the face?

608
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,140
Which I'm like, they shouldn't be mad.

609
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Zena versus Jesus and sounds like the best episode ever.

610
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,700
I would be interested to watch that.

611
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Yeah.

612
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,300
Obviously, Kevin would have been upset about that.

613
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,240
Oh, boy, boy, boy.

614
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:50,180
I'm sure he had a lot to say about Zena and her partner, Gabrielle, like a pretty I don't know if they intended initially for it to be a gay coded like characters.

615
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:58,060
But like by the end of the series, it's like they're all but saying it, which was kind of a big deal in the 90s because there wasn't that much representation.

616
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,460
You know, yeah, that was the I was reading this about I was reading about this Hindu controversy and I was like, yeah, that's not good.

617
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,940
They probably shouldn't have put Krishna in.

618
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:15,260
And then the article keeps going and like it implies that our faith is OK with homosexual relationships with Zena clearly is like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

619
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,620
Get away.

620
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,760
This is a 90s controversy where everyone is wrong.

621
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,680
All sides, all sides are incorrect.

622
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,260
Boo.

623
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,180
Yeah.

624
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,460
So I was thinking, too, about just like lawless versus sorbo.

625
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:40,420
Sorbo very much in the like wake of Schwarzenegger, where they're like, you know, let's take a guy who maybe and I don't even want this to sound like a diss on Schwarzenegger maybe isn't so versatile.

626
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,780
I do think Schwarzenegger is versatile in the way that like he plays himself, but he can go back.

627
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,860
He can do some comedy.

628
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,640
He can do whatever.

629
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,860
But he's a little limited, but it works really well.

630
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,340
And Schwarzenegger is great.

631
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,840
Sorbo doesn't really is not as good as Schwarzenegger.

632
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,540
Whereas like Lucy Lawless is very versatile, I think, as an actor, and she can pop up and you go, oh, she's good.

633
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Yes, she was in Spartacus and she was in Parks and Rec.

634
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,460
And yeah, it was very funny.

635
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,060
Good on SNL, I recall.

636
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,420
Not to say they don't try with Sorbo, because this has come up more than once.

637
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,220
I brought it up more than once.

638
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm jamming this fact and people just this thing where he, Kevin Sorbo, rode a horse through City Walk for the premiere of Call the Conqueror.

639
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,700
He did a full path, which you can look at in great Ron Gaia stock photos.

640
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,420
I just I just like this not knowing what Call the Conqueror is.

641
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,220
I like that you talk about like the natural like appeal of Schwarzenegger.

642
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,840
And then this guy, he's got like that brawny look, but then he just wears like boring golf shirts all the time.

643
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,620
He's riding a horse and yet he's just in.

644
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,740
He's wearing what Greg Norman would wear.

645
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,040
But I like seeing this horse pass by the Sun Coast and the most beautiful faces in the world sign and under King Kong.

646
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:13,240
And then there's another one of him also wearing a boring shirt at a premiere that he's outside of the Wetzel's Pretzels at City Walk, I believe with William Hurt.

647
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,620
Oh, yeah, William Hurt.

648
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,710
This is the only recorded instance, though, of Kevin Sorbo wearing a shirt untucked.

649
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,850
And he he shivers when he sees it.

650
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,870
The deviant lifestyle that I was once a part of.

651
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,160
Burn all the photographs, get the images.

652
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,640
Yeah, some of the other photos he just I've never seen a polo so like hard tucked into like pants.

653
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:45,160
And it's like, oh, man, like there's like clasps inside his pants to tie the shirt to.

654
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,600
Make sure it stays there.

655
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:54,880
He just seems so square and he seems like a guy at the office who's like really loud and someone told him he was funny once.

656
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,120
And it's like, oh, Jesus, that was the worst thing you could have done.

657
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,040
Whereas like Lucy Lawless just at scenes effortlessly funny and charming.

658
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,140
Who has Kevin Sorbo been on Huckabee or am I am I just wishing there is no way he has not been on Huckabee?

659
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,760
Probably statistically.

660
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,600
It's just a matter of if he just hasn't made the trip to Brands.

661
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,060
But are they doing have they been doing Zoom guests or not?

662
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,500
Or did Huckabee never shut down?

663
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,220
Do they just like maskless?

664
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,620
I thought you would know.

665
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,600
I thought you would know.

666
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,480
I sort of lost track.

667
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,920
I had a big Huckabee phase and then I sort of I lost track.

668
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,300
I need to go back and see what's going on in 2021.

669
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,840
And then God obviously distracted everybody.

670
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,880
That's that's the hot new show in town.

671
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,960
And I got you know, but Huckabee is the Carson.

672
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,580
You ultimately come back to Huckabee and I will, of course, here confirming that.

673
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,220
Yes, he has been on with his wife, Sam Sorbo.

674
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,240
Yes.

675
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,980
So I don't know that that clip has been I would I'll look at it later if it's worth watching.

676
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:03,740
We'll see if it's worth you know, I'm going to get ahead of the sorbometer going off so that it doesn't interrupt any thoughts since we're sort of in a sorbo run.

677
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,620
And I'll just read three other credits.

678
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:18,780
Detective Gullickson in Shadow Witness, Reginald Cash in Sam Steele and the Crystal Chalice and Drake Hunter in the Santa suit.

679
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,100
OK, wait a minute.

680
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,220
Now, imagine all those are pornos.

681
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah.

682
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,840
And I think it works exactly the same.

683
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,100
I think you go, yeah, yeah.

684
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,240
Shadow Witness is fine.

685
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,920
Kind of a sexy detective in that.

686
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,680
Yes, absolutely.

687
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,600
Reginald Cash and Sam Steele sort of like lazy, pornoy names.

688
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Hard.

689
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,100
Yeah, like, yeah, you get it.

690
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
Crystal Chalice could be the name of an actress.

691
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,180
So absolutely.

692
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,860
Or a club like a sexual club.

693
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,220
A seedy club.

694
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,180
Yes, people could have sex in a giant Crystal Chalice.

695
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,780
Absolutely.

696
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,340
Yeah.

697
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,060
Welcome to the Crystal Chalice is what a character would say.

698
00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:02,060
I also I don't think it would go against it to say to add another one, the movie Coffin, in which he plays Sean Justice.

699
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,720
Absolutely.

700
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,940
That could be perhaps involving fucking in a coffin.

701
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,900
Now that's a coffin challenge.

702
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,020
How long can you last in the coffin?

703
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,300
Well, the coffin stands not built for that.

704
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,280
So careful it could collapse on you.

705
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,660
That is absolutely, by the way, happened at a Six Flags.

706
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,180
I think we speculate it whether someone like killed some time by pleasuring themselves in the coffin.

707
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,560
Yeah.

708
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,420
But I mean, like, you know, like somebody snuck in like you had like a date who snuck into the coffin in the middle of the night.

709
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,320
Oh, yeah.

710
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,620
Yeah.

711
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,280
The 4 a.

712
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,500
m.

713
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,080
Yeah.

714
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,920
The shift change like, OK, quick, quick knock like a knock at your coffin door.

715
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,080
Hey, quick, let me in.

716
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,520
This breaks the rules.

717
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,660
I won't win that six hundred dollars.

718
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,140
No, I got to be in here for a week and get six hundred dollars.

719
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,440
OK, well, so what else about all this?

720
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,400
That's a lot of well, it'll be more sorbo.

721
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,620
But so I the one thing I like, I they the opening day ceremonies, they use swords.

722
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,400
They're doing the swinging sword thing again.

723
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,420
Lucy Lawless looks much cooler doing it than Kevin Sorbo.

724
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,620
Kevin Sorbo almost looks bored swinging his sword around with a kind of wrist motion.

725
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,060
And they unveiled the big sword sign, which looks pretty good.

726
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:39,180
But then I had a hard time finding the marquee for this attraction, like a good quality photo of it.

727
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,200
But it looks like they could not have spent less money on.

728
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,740
Oh, yeah.

729
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,320
Signage.

730
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,960
That is so trashy.

731
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:53,040
I remember I never saw this, but I went to the park around this time and I feel like the sign put me off like these.

732
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,120
That is a lot of clashy logo, like kind of low rent comic.

733
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,460
But those logos look like like logos from Christian comic books.

734
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,520
Yeah, that looks exactly right.

735
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,420
And that building, too.

736
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:17,640
I mean, they barely took like change the front of it from saying Murder, She Wrote Mystery Theatre to when it was close to closing.

737
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:25,780
I guess they changed the name from Murder, She Wrote Mystery Theatre to Murder, She Wrote post production, which is a real downgrade.

738
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,860
Oh, yeah.

739
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:28,980
Yeah.

740
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,820
But then they jazzed up, they jazzed it up.

741
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,080
They got rid of murder, sure.

742
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,040
And that boring title.

743
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:43,760
And they put this in Hercules and Zena, Wizards of the Screen, which is more exciting than a lot of what happened in their show.

744
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,400
What does it mean?

745
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,020
Who are the Wizards?

746
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:54,280
Hercules and Zena or the people or like the the ADR operator?

747
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,620
Who's the wizard?

748
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:01,700
Yeah, yeah, because everyone's kind of doing a bit like the director and the sound guy and the graphics guy.

749
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,320
They're all kind of playing like the kooky Hollywood versions of those roles.

750
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,320
Yeah, but why?

751
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,860
Yeah, Wizard.

752
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,100
Why not like Warriors of the Screen?

753
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:17,480
Because they're not they're warriors, at least in like Wizards isn't even a thing you truly associate with, like the post production crew of a TV show.

754
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,960
They're very good.

755
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
There's a lot of talent in that.

756
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,160
Of course.

757
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,680
Area, but Wizards, I'm not sure.

758
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,480
Yeah.

759
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,920
So, yeah, that is confusing.

760
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,640
Very strange title.

761
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,920
You know, even before we talk about what happens in the show, it might be a good thing to play.

762
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:45,420
Well, first for me to click away from some pop up ads that came from me trying to find if there was any riffraff porn hold off on that.

763
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,100
It was a little too distracting for me to not mention Cliffhanger for later.

764
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,860
But now let me play this Universal Studios ad.

765
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,040
And so here's what they framed this show as.

766
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,040
Here we go.

767
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,860
You control their fate.

768
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,260
You decide their destiny.

769
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,560
Universal Studios Florida introduces Hurtleys and Xena, Wizards of the Screen.

770
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,500
Come have a brawl at Universal's newest attraction.

771
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,660
And here's another new attraction for Florida residents.

772
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,200
Save $10 from now.

773
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,980
But the pretty dramatic.

774
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
You control their fate.

775
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,380
You decide their destiny.

776
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:44,140
And then I don't know if we're spoiling it by saying that by controlling fates and destinies, we mean you get to see what it's like to ADR sound for actors and create sound effects.

777
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,560
And you learn how green screens work is what they're trying to say.

778
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,880
You control their destiny from a post house in the way they are portrayed and heard.

779
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:05,380
You control their fate in terms of is your dad in a funny costume going to appear in front of a field or an outer space?

780
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,120
What will you control his chroma fate?

781
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:30,760
Because this is sort of a, I mean, it's basically like a reskin of the Murder She Wrote attraction, which as alluded to in that boring title was about post production.

782
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,120
There's a scene for Murder She Wrote where there is no sound and the audience members have to make the sound.

783
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,840
It's like the Harry and the Hendersons thing that was in Hollywood.

784
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,920
We just talked about all this with new friend Moe, Maura Quirk.

785
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,160
This is a show that she was part of, the Murder She Wrote version of what she did in the park.

786
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,420
And I don't, as I said to her, I don't remember that show very well.

787
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,820
We haven't done an episode about it yet.

788
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,780
But that's sort of the gist, right?

789
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,700
There's the like, hear a clang on this thing to make the sword banging sound effects and that kind of stuff.

790
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:13,400
Yeah, and that's what I saw what I was talking about earlier is there's a clip of this show, Hercules and Zena with a kid just banging on a pipe with a wrench just to make a noise for ADR, what ADR would be like.

791
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,880
Yeah.

792
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,060
And yeah, that was the same deal.

793
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,820
If they wanted like, I think I christened this area like Grandparents Rest Alley.

794
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,460
They really should have replaced the Murder She Wrote Mystery Theater with the Diagnosis Murdery Mr.

795
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:26,960
Theater.

796
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,560
Oh man.

797
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,620
Or the Marshall Law starring Sammo Hung Action Theater or something like that.

798
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,560
Like every Walker, Walker, Texas Ranger.

799
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,100
Yeah, we're Walker.

800
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,720
Like Hercules and Zena is pretty dynamic replacement.

801
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:49,780
A bit too, yes, a bit too lively, especially when things from the show start happening in the theater.

802
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:55,180
It gets a tad loud, I would say, when there's lightning and magic going on.

803
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,920
How are you supposed to take a nap during that?

804
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,400
Yeah, that's a good point.

805
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,820
I mean, I guess Walker was a little more high.

806
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:11,720
That was a bad, I should have said like Father Dowling or another one of an old sitcom and like an elderly sitcom actor solves murders every week, which is my favorite genres of shows.

807
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,220
Well, you know those theme park sinners are averse to anything stinking of religion, as Kevin Sorbo would probably tell you.

808
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,340
Sure.

809
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,100
That's a good point.

810
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,440
It's so perverse in Orlando.

811
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,100
Let me tell you, it's just a they've lost their values there.

812
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:34,600
They want you now you pay an amount of money in the morning and then you just get meals all day and that's gluttony.

813
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,100
These meal plans are gluttony.

814
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,680
Kevin Sorbo should reboot Father Dowling for a new generation.

815
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,840
What's Father Dowling again?

816
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,140
Don't do Father Dowling dirty like that.

817
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,240
Sorry, Father Dowling was what's his name from happy days?

818
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,820
Dad from happy days and I'm losing.

819
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,620
Tom Bosley.

820
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,040
Tom Bosley, thank you.

821
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,500
And he was like a priest.

822
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:05,180
The podcast where sometimes two people happily say in unison, Tom Bosley, I think it's Tom Bosley.

823
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,420
And that's shameful that I didn't know that.

824
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,700
I've said Tom Bosley like with no thought before on this podcast.

825
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,160
So I know Tom Bosley.

826
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,940
You're really owed.

827
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,280
I think for that we have to do one of those scolding.

828
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,780
Michael, we got to give you the full name to really make you feel bad about it.

829
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,020
I do deserve it.

830
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,280
And I will tell the priest about it on Sunday.

831
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,380
But Father Dowling would solve murders.

832
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,260
I mean, he was like a priest and he would always kind of get embroiled in something.

833
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,760
And a little fun fact, I lived in an apartment owned by one of the cast members of Father Dowling 10 years ago.

834
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,720
I forgot about that.

835
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,460
Which one are you allowed to say?

836
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,640
Do you remember the name?

837
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,720
Why can't I think of his name?

838
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,440
I got to look him up.

839
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,740
I don't know.

840
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,060
Should I say his name?

841
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,560
You don't have to say it.

842
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,620
It doesn't matter.

843
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,600
There's more fun facts.

844
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,780
I'll tell you off the air.

845
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,420
Sure.

846
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,240
That's for another tier of Patreon.

847
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,480
Learn who owns the building from Father Dowling that Mike once lived in.

848
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,260
That's an extra $100 a month, everyone.

849
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,520
You just get the name.

850
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,480
It's like John Grayson.

851
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,700
Okay, great.

852
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,040
Now I know.

853
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,460
Okay, so the show.

854
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,740
It is hard to find footage.

855
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,080
It is hard to find like a full run of the show.

856
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,480
It was one of those where you move from room to room and see different steps of the process.

857
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,220
It took me going really deep into it.

858
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,440
There's a very good video about all this made by Yesterworld, correct?

859
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:37,880
Yes.

860
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:44,440
In his sources, there's a video that's pulled from some family's entire vacation footage.

861
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,500
You have to go deep into that to see, oh, there was a thing where there was like a puppet.

862
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,660
A bunch of kids all manipulate a dragon puppet.

863
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:57,340
Here you do the eyebrows and you do the arms and you wiggle them around.

864
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
That seems fun.

865
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,140
It's a good looking puppet.

866
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,020
It's a good practical thing.

867
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,920
It seems like they pulled that part off pretty well, at least.

868
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,660
The puppet was good.

869
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,820
I remember I think I was standing in front of it at some point like this child that I pulled from a video.

870
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,920
And I kept looking back of like, I do not trust that puppet.

871
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,020
Although at the end, it's CG in the footage and it looks bad.

872
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,480
They keep cutting back and forth between the bad CG and the good looking puppet, I think.

873
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,220
Pretty awful CG throughout this whole series and that scene, yes.

874
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:41,420
It all culminates in a six minute sequence custom shot by the makers of Hercules and Xena.

875
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,900
Where everybody gives it their all and it's like the show.

876
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,680
I bet if you're a fan of the shows, then like, oh, this is an episode I can only watch here.

877
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,420
That's cool.

878
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,960
But that's CGI.

879
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,100
Oh my God.

880
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,940
I think that's what it was like in the show too, in the real show.

881
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah, that's why even like the bigger budget like Battlestar Galactica stuff, I always have a hard time watching.

882
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:10,660
Like really heavy genre TV shows because I'm like, oh, these effects are going to age really fast.

883
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,080
You're talking about like the Cylons and the newer Battlestar?

884
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:25,160
Like in the new, yeah, like any sci-fi on TV, like the stuff that imply that like Twilight Zone has aged better because they just imply everything or it's all practical makeup.

885
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,040
Right.

886
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,820
I see what you're saying.

887
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,080
Yeah, as opposed to Stargate SG-1, you know?

888
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,100
Yeah, it depends.

889
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,660
It depends.

890
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,520
There's a mixed bag.

891
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,420
There's like, there's sweet spots for CG where I feel like it was like good for two years and like the mid 90s and all of a sudden it's bad for four years.

892
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,640
And then you get like pockets and you go, oh, that looks pretty good or whatever.

893
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,020
Like, but you never know.

894
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,980
You never know what you're going to get.

895
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,260
Some of it looks at first Steven Summer's Mummy.

896
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,300
Yeah, it still looks pretty good.

897
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,600
Second Steven Summer's Mummy with the scorpion.

898
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,440
Oh man.

899
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,100
This is where they're like, oh no.

900
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,440
And it's like, oh geez Louise.

901
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:06,420
I forgot that the show we were referencing earlier with Sebastian Jackal was Deadly Game on UPN, which also had some real bad like CGI transformation stuff and it was like very internet bay.

902
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,580
It was like in the net.

903
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,840
You were going in the net.

904
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,660
Oh, well, that I love.

905
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:18,700
I love or if you're going, if you see the physical internet that I will give a million passes to the hackers kind of internet.

906
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,980
Yeah, fair game.

907
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,400
Let's let's talk a little bit about what you what you did and what like what you wore.

908
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,520
First of all, because you just pulled up a photo of some audience volunteers.

909
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,360
Can we describe what you're what you had to put on?

910
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,220
Well, yeah, it was like a helmet.

911
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,600
I think they gave you like a cap.

912
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:51,980
They gave you like an under layer, which was probably the only thing they washed like a white essentially white sheet and like a white skull cap.

913
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:00,380
And then they put a helmet on you and they put like like armor and chainmail with like fringe fur at the bottom.

914
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:05,860
And then you would stand behind a blue block in front of a blue screen.

915
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:14,300
So that way they could make your lower half a horse and make the background like the the field, the empty field where the battle is happening.

916
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,500
Now, how did that work?

917
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,760
Was it did you just have to stay very still?

918
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,860
And then there is a like how much is that bottom half really doing that?

919
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,980
Well, it's not that your bottom half is just hidden behind the block.

920
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,440
Like you didn't really have to do anything with your bottom half because the horses were on the screen.

921
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,020
But it's but it is like is it like a digital lower half horse body or is it on?

922
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,780
OK, yeah, it here you can see from this angle.

923
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,100
I'll share some of these pictures so people know we're talking about.

924
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,580
So you're totally obscured.

925
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,880
Very much like here's a big blue block or bench or something.

926
00:55:51,940 --> 00:56:01,420
Yeah, they tell you in one of the videos you drape your little like your shirt or whatever over the block to make it look a little bit more realistic.

927
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,440
That that's part of you.

928
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,400
It like blends in better if there's not a hard break between the block in your body.

929
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,200
That's a little tidbit.

930
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,940
That's a good little special effects.

931
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,240
Sure, it was good.

932
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:23,520
And I think we were given or maybe one guy was given a hollow crossbow, hollow plastic like crossbow looking thing because it's fired in the footage.

933
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,260
And you're just he was just like holding it or we were all holding it.

934
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,380
And then they just want us to wave at the end and then everyone laughs.

935
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,060
Mm hmm.

936
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,480
Right.

937
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,220
Yeah.

938
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,860
So you remember Jason doing it.

939
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,380
How do you start?

940
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,360
You know, did you feel were you like this is awesome.

941
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,560
I'm a star.

942
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,560
I'm a you like a Mark Holberg at the end of Boogie Nights.

943
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,420
I well I was a 12 year old boy.

944
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,700
Right.

945
00:56:48,700 --> 00:57:00,420
But so I guess the equivalent of that, I did feel like like I was clearly the most excited to be doing this compared to the the adult man and adult woman also doing it.

946
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,500
Hit to cut you off there.

947
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,240
We got the sorbometer going off.

948
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,240
You're all in it.

949
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,060
Make it fast.

950
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,100
These don't always have to be belabored.

951
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,100
OK, so let's read a few credits.

952
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:21,700
Pastor Dave in the sparrows nesting Pastor Matthews in Confessions of a Prodigal Son and Gojan Pie in Mythica, the Dark Spore.

953
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,920
I think it's a jolt of energy.

954
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,000
Back to his fantasy roots.

955
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,060
Mythica, the Dark Spore.

956
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,400
I think Mythica is a series.

957
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,240
I think he played Gojan Pie a number of times.

958
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,460
Well, you gotta see what he's up to, you know.

959
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,960
And a number of that was a couple pastors in a row.

960
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,240
Those were like next to each other in his filmography.

961
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,140
I'll try to find.

962
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:46,160
Oh, he's going to be in a movie coming up called The Pastor where he plays Big John.

963
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,740
Lots to look forward to.

964
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,940
Anyway, please continue.

965
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,120
It's reset.

966
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,480
I'll talk to you in 15 minutes.

967
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,700
Oh, OK.

968
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,140
Yeah.

969
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,180
So I mean, going room by room, I think they dress.

970
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:06,540
I don't think dressed us in the last room and we kept walking or they dressed us before the last room and we kept walking around.

971
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,640
But like they highlighted each technology individually of like, here's how we do sound effects.

972
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,440
Here's how we overlay someone's face onto a monster.

973
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,800
Here's how we'll put you guys in.

974
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,420
And then at the end, it all comes together.

975
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,560
Right.

976
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:27,140
And when you were seeing it was you were a kid who liked watching special features, I assume.

977
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,220
I mean, I guess that wasn't around yet, but like you were a kid who liked movie, the magic of the movies.

978
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:41,540
So was that like your first taste of like, wow, like this is what the lights are like and I can see how the sausage is made, so to speak.

979
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:50,220
Well, this is the first I think I got so close to it because I had been to Universal a few times at this point and I was the kid who it's like, hey, I got to I can't.

980
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,140
Can we make sure we're home?

981
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,480
There's a making of like face off that I really want to watch.

982
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:07,460
And that was like, I feel like I did not see a lot of I went to the movies pretty regularly, but I think I was pretty my parents were pretty strict about PG 13.

983
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:07,920
Right.

984
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,240
Like we would go to PG 13 if my dad came, but it was like, well, you're not 13 yet.

985
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,080
And I'm like, why are you buying that?

986
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,700
Like, what do you think's in this?

987
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,120
So but I would want any making up like I would always watch those.

988
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,480
So but yes, I was thrilled to be by like a C stand or like, right.

989
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:40,540
That's yes, that's that's what I was hoping an apple like my my dear set friend, Apple boxes, hollow wooden boxes that actors stand on to appear very tall that all actors stand on unless you're Mike's height.

990
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:41,620
Right.

991
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:47,980
Very well brought up to pretty sure you see a lot of Apple boxes for on guts.

992
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,680
Sure.

993
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:54,760
So yes, I stood on any sort of combination of like, get a couple more Apple boxes under him.

994
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:10,520
I always remember in these kind of shows that moment where it's when it's if it's somebody you know, then they disappear for a little bit and they come back in a funny costume, the nerves that you have while they're gone and the relief when they return.

995
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,180
But the mockery of the silly thing that they're wearing, this stuff always works.

996
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,080
These things are just caked.

997
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,700
It's a really good format.

998
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:25,440
I remember I remember when I saw my mom do the soap opera show, I was a little disturbed because I was like that.

999
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,380
Those are again, those like those aren't her clothes.

1000
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:33,720
She is acting different and I know this isn't real, but I don't like this.

1001
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,000
Thought she had been brainwashed.

1002
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:48,100
Yes, is she maybe she's been like lying to me this whole time and she's actually like about to pull a gun like she's been a like a fur coat wearing gun wielder.

1003
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,180
This is the real her finally.

1004
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:50,680
Yeah.

1005
01:00:51,320 --> 01:01:00,660
See now this is the point at my age where I was like, I have to go backstage to get in costume and then I come out on stage in costume or right.

1006
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,080
Mom, can we go to Blockbuster so I can rent singing in the rain?

1007
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,080
I don't want to go to the beach today.

1008
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,080
Sunset Boulevard is on Turner Classic movies.

1009
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,480
Yeah, 98.

1010
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,220
I would not have had the I'm talking about maybe early 90s when I was in that mind mindset.

1011
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,820
But yeah, 98.

1012
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,100
I would have understood.

1013
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,820
I was in the seventh or eighth grade play at that point and I knew.

1014
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:45,080
Yeah, and that was that was this is all a result of Universal Studios and MGM Studios warping my brain so that the one vacation ruined the rather summer vacations because they're like Jason's watching old movies again.

1015
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,940
We have to go.

1016
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,000
We have to go to a family party.

1017
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,200
Come on, man.

1018
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:56,240
The old that's what I don't get is how did you veer to the 40s and the 30s?

1019
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,840
That does naturally happen.

1020
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,720
I just love I love Gene Kelly.

1021
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,100
I love Gene Kelly.

1022
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,460
I love just big characters and Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard.

1023
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,580
There's no one bigger.

1024
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:16,760
And yeah, I even at that time, I liked like old detectives like old CD stuff, you know.

1025
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:23,560
I mean, and also like you were born like mentally in the 40s, too.

1026
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:30,620
I feel like there was some sort of like mix up that happened with like brains and the time based on continuum or something.

1027
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:46,720
Well, the thing I realized when I was older, too, is that all the weirdos making children's entertainment liked these old movies and would find a way to do like a detective parody in like step by step or Ninja Turtles or something.

1028
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,000
And then when I would get a chance to get the actual thing, it was referencing.

1029
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,940
I was like, well, I'm already familiar with all of this crap, you know, and I love it.

1030
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,820
Yeah, I get that.

1031
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,580
Yeah, that makes sense.

1032
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:08,420
We all had to sit through a lot of like jokes about dames and gams and the thing where like the the narration then like somebody hears the narration.

1033
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,340
Like, what was that?

1034
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,680
Oh, so you can hear that.

1035
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,380
Like there was a lot of deconstruction of film noir tropes.

1036
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:21,640
And I'm like, I don't know what the film noir I've seen 20 times more deconstruction than the real thing.

1037
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,240
I mean, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,440
By the time I got to it, I had seen a lot of deconstructions.

1039
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,340
There's multiple Maltese Falcon parodies.

1040
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,820
When I was six years old, like there's a Turtles episode called the Maltese Hamster.

1041
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,420
And I think there's like a Ren and Stimpy comic I read and it was another Maltese Falcon.

1042
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,520
And I was like, what is like I was actively like confused.

1043
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:53,480
But later on, you're like, oh, OK, it's that 40 year old movie, which is funny because of those kinds of movies, the Maltese Falcon is very stiff.

1044
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,740
Like it's very it's carried by Humphrey Bogart.

1045
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,280
And is Peter Laurie in it?

1046
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,600
I think like it's kind of carried by the actors.

1047
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:10,820
But like compared to like out of the past or the big sleep, those are much more dynamic movies that seem more what we consider modern, I think, at least.

1048
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,940
Peter Laurie is indeed in Maltese.

1049
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,800
OK, yeah.

1050
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,200
And that's another guy who's in like every other Looney Tunes.

1051
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,040
There's a Peter.

1052
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,520
Like trope or character.

1054
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,380
Yeah, constant cartoon Peter Laurie.

1055
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,620
So yeah, I just said Ren and Stimpy and Stimpy, the Martin's voice.

1056
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,620
Yeah, the Marx Brothers come up in a lot of that stuff.

1057
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,420
Yeah, who I loved.

1058
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,500
I love the Marx Brothers.

1059
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,400
I don't care about the three stooges.

1060
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,840
I never got into Laurel and Hardy.

1061
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,320
But even as a kid, I loved the Marx Brothers.

1062
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:46,740
Or I can't figure out how to transition other than to say, yeah, we can't get out of this.

1063
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,580
Please, we can't get out.

1064
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:58,560
I well, you want to talk about what it culminates in that now an episode comes to life like the fruits of our labor have had.

1065
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,420
We filmed the Jason's as the centaurs.

1066
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:07,220
We've got our pre-taped material and now we're going to drop it into an episode of Hercules and Xena.

1067
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:14,280
But then the episode comes to life and there seems to be a moment where like things start happening in the room.

1068
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:22,340
A bunch of lightning shoots out of the screen and then it's almost like you know, like you almost do with this at this point in universal history.

1069
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:27,840
I want to say like, just don't even we know you don't have to say it because this one just really lays on thick.

1070
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
They just say the line.

1071
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,380
This isn't one of our special effects.

1072
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,940
This is real.

1073
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,500
You've been doing Ghostbusters for seven years now.

1074
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,900
We know we know.

1075
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,560
And you're also this is also a much lazier iteration of it.

1076
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,380
We get something goes wrong.

1077
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,000
I think one of the screens Hera is in the real with the real world.

1078
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:54,580
And then she's like starts making things happen in the soundstage and you know, the sword falls out of the screen.

1079
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,360
They got to toss back in the screen.

1080
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,660
That stuff's fun.

1081
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,260
It's fun to see here here.

1082
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,440
Yeah.

1083
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,610
An object goes from our world into Kevin Sorbo's hands.

1084
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,350
I and yeah, magic affects people again.

1085
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:12,750
It's like hard to there's not the best full.

1086
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,840
Here's the here's a giant video of this, but you can piece it together.

1087
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:27,410
Yeah, it's all it's all stuff that would have been like fun if I was little, but I think I would have been a little it would have been a sleepier show.

1088
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,530
If I was, yeah, I don't know, 14 or 15.

1089
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,070
I wouldn't have not enjoyed it, but yeah.

1090
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:41,150
Well, and we're maybe at the point where do you just want to do a Hercules and Zena stunt show and not 100% like completely?

1091
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:46,930
There was already that question maybe in the early 90s a little and by now by the late 90s for sure.

1092
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:52,110
We want to just see action and not like so here you have to hear.

1093
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:55,790
Let's queue up the tape and you got to splice it.

1094
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,810
Make sure to splice that tape exactly on that at point you want.

1095
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,410
Yeah, I think we talked about this before another show.

1096
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:05,290
I'm sure is that like yeah, back in the 90s, there was still a little more mystery.

1097
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:12,920
And now it's like you can edit a movie on your computer like so who like that's a the whole thing has been a bit demystified.

1098
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:18,960
Yeah, and it's like now we're just skipping separate editing procedure.

1099
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:26,550
It's yes, that's true, which so you know, mostly there's not mostly these sorts of things are gone.

1100
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,250
I'm trying to think is anything else.

1101
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:36,470
Is there anything oddly late that is teaching us about stuff that we don't that is no longer relevant in terms of that is a good question.

1102
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:41,830
I haven't done the tram tour in a long time, so I don't really I don't really know what's going on in the trim.

1103
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:47,410
I mean, the special effects stage is still in Universal Hollywood.

1104
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:55,470
Yeah, and then like animal actors is like like kind of do like a behind the scenes, but there's action in it.

1105
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:59,650
Yeah, they've kept the more practical stuff like light a guy on fire.

1106
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:00,870
Right.

1107
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:04,390
Bird of prey takes a dollar out of your hand like that stuff.

1108
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,530
I think people always like seeing, you know, because you can't see it in your daily life.

1109
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:17,230
Yes, but there's yeah, there's no there's no theater show where they show you what it's like to audition for a role in a movie or TV show.

1110
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,050
Yeah, yeah.

1111
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,950
I've seen it pointed out.

1112
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:35,430
Was this a comment in our group or just somewhere in general like theme park chatter that if there's going to be this kind of thing like that, I feel like there are still the studio parks and at least within the world of Disney.

1113
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:45,030
That like one of the few things that's come up in the recent past that genuinely is interesting like oh, that's how they do it is the Mandalorian and those crazy realistic.

1114
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:48,030
We've those are cool.

1115
01:08:48,030 --> 01:09:04,090
And if there was a we have this theory, I don't remember this came from the idea that like if there was some show or they could replace something that was a little more ailing with, you know, here, let's show you how let's make a Mandalorian scene on the spot by just pulling up these backgrounds, changing the lighting and look.

1116
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:10,310
It looks exactly like the like just yeah, these digital backgrounds they use genuinely.

1117
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,170
I think that stuff is incredibly cool.

1118
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,550
And there's maybe a little meat on that bone.

1119
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:19,370
If they're if they were to ever do some sort of Mandalorian making of experience.

1120
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:20,970
I don't know that we are.

1121
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:21,810
We came up with that.

1122
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:30,950
But that is yeah, if you've ever you haven't seen that go on Disney Plus and there's the making of Mandalorian and basically it's like instead of just putting a blue or green screen behind the actor.

1123
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:36,830
It's this crazy like 360 theater that has like high def.

1124
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:41,050
I guess it's an unreal engine, which is what powers a lot of video games basically.

1125
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,210
But it can be real time manipulated and rendered.

1126
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:50,870
So like almost everything on Mandalorian in the background is a screen, but it looks good because there's depth.

1127
01:09:50,870 --> 01:10:04,570
There's like an actual like depth between the screen in the background and the actor as opposed to green screen, which like if you watch the prequels, it's got like a there's a weird feeling in it because they're really like so close to the background that's supposed to like stretch out far.

1128
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:09,490
And for the actors, they're able to actually be in the place, which which helps.

1129
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:11,130
Yeah, it gives them a little bit of a vibe.

1130
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:14,650
There's like practical pieces of ships and stuff when they're getting off things.

1131
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:21,270
But like like armory swords get actual reflections of the lighting of why it makes so much sense.

1132
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:24,350
It's very it's yeah, it's really cool.

1133
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:30,910
And it's a shame only the most expensive shows in the world can possibly use this technology green screen.

1134
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,890
We can do in our backyard.

1135
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,070
The this is this you need a lot of money.

1136
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:35,750
You need big.

1137
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:36,930
Yeah, yeah.

1138
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:44,630
All of my I feel like I know multiple friends who have a green screen and it's like shoved next to the it's rolled up next to the toilet or next to the toilet.

1139
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:52,090
The washing machine in the unfinished basement or something like that's how cheap green screening is now.

1140
01:10:52,550 --> 01:11:06,470
Obviously, eight K or the K plus or whatever that kind of projection and real time manipulation is super expensive, which is probably why they haven't like duplicated it for three different theme parks or whatever.

1141
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,650
Yeah, yeah.

1142
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:14,030
But but so but so this thing, it's sort of, you know, it was like a relevant thing to introduce.

1143
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,990
You can have your press event with Sorbo and Lawless and they're big right now.

1144
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,210
And that's in 97.

1145
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,470
But by 2000, it already feels a tad stale.

1146
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:26,390
I feel like the tide turned quickly on this one.

1147
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:38,950
I saw an article where a universal spokesman said to the Orlando Sentinel in 1999, quote, It's the kind of show you can change without the audience asking where it went.

1148
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,950
Yeah, pretty cold.

1149
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:42,910
Yeah.

1150
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:43,950
Yeah, really?

1151
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,510
Yeah.

1152
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,550
And I alluded to this earlier.

1153
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:54,810
So the building, it closed in February 2000 and then the building sat empty until Horror Nights 2004.

1154
01:11:54,930 --> 01:12:01,070
And then after, like at some point, the city came in and condemned the building.

1155
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:05,170
They said, You can't do anything, but like you can't use this building.

1156
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:08,090
Like, you know, I don't know.

1157
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,130
But like, eventually it was demolished.

1158
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:12,630
And that's where Transformers is now in Florida.

1159
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:17,770
That was just that was some Hollywood canceling or some Orlando, some fake Hollywood canceling.

1160
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,870
They just knew Sorbo was in there and they had them on.

1161
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,570
This was early cancel culture.

1162
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:23,970
Oh, okay.

1163
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,790
But how often does like some of the most…

1164
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,910
It was called condemning culture back then.

1165
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,350
Oh, and here we go.

1166
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:31,670
Speak.

1167
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,150
I said Sorbo again and that's Sorbometer.

1168
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,090
Let me go to it quickly.

1169
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,210
Okay, let's see.

1170
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,790
Dodge Davis in Tommy and the Cool Mule.

1171
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:51,250
Bird Tatums in an episode of Psych called Bounty Hunters exclamation point.

1172
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:52,250
So that's more, he's not…

1173
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,290
That's actually pretty good.

1174
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:53,470
Yeah.

1175
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:53,790
Yeah.

1176
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,010
Yeah.

1177
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:54,750
No, Psych is legit.

1178
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,670
He hasn't fully made the switch to his corner yet.

1179
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,530
And Mr.

1180
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,150
Phoenix in Bitch Slap.

1181
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,150
Whoa, wait a minute.

1182
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,790
That's bold.

1183
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,970
I think that also he's maybe not fully…

1184
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,730
Yeah, he hasn't been kicked out.

1185
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:15,070
Lucy Lawless is also in that.

1186
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:17,830
Interesting.

1187
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:25,910
That might be some like Cameo Fest put together like Movie 43 or something.

1188
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,670
Well, he's elsewhere in his credits around this time.

1189
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:29,830
Meet the Spartans.

1190
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,110
He's in Meets the Spartans.

1191
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,050
That's a movie movie kind of…

1192
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:40,930
And he's in An American Carol, the weird creepy right wing parody.

1193
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,510
Sure, the Farley brother, right?

1194
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:47,850
With the Farley brother as documentary filmmaker Michael Malone.

1195
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,090
Michael Moore stand in.

1196
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:56,130
Who's taken to ground zero by a ghost played by country singer Trace Atkins.

1197
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,930
No!

1198
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,970
Have you ever seen that?

1199
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:04,850
Or it's like he's in a church and like, what's all this in this building?

1200
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,510
Dust?

1201
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,230
You gotta clean this place up.

1202
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,350
No, it's not dust.

1203
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,590
Trace Atkins opens the doors and they're at.

1204
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,970
Oh my goodness.

1205
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,290
It's a jaw dropper.

1206
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,150
Kelsey Grammer is in it.

1207
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:25,730
And that was like they had not yet figured out the bizarre like the Christian movie Closet.

1208
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,310
This was like in theaters.

1209
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,010
This was a…

1210
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,010
They made the push.

1211
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,010
It's by a Zucker.

1212
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:31,890
Right.

1213
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,430
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

1214
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:35,390
Yeah.

1215
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,150
Yeah.

1216
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,090
Well, I really quickly was the cool…

1217
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,230
What was the cool mule about?

1218
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,370
Was it a Christmas story?

1219
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,270
Yeah, let's check that out.

1220
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,270
Tommy and the cool mule.

1221
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:50,310
Yeah, because I know one cool mule who was like hanging out by a manger and then stuff started happening.

1222
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:54,990
Yeah, that makes me think of the Troy McClure movie Gladys the Groovy Mule.

1223
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,610
He kind of is.

1224
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:58,010
He's a…

1225
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,290
He's our Christian.

1226
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,390
He's our Troy McClure.

1227
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,710
Oh my God, he's real Troy McClure.

1228
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:03,890
He's just…

1229
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:04,470
But he's not as fun.

1230
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,050
He's got…

1231
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:06,910
He's like Troy McClure with an agenda.

1232
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:10,530
Is Kevin Sorbo bad for many aquariums?

1233
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,730
Could be.

1234
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:15,330
Maybe that's why he's not allowed in Hollywood.

1235
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,270
It's not his political views.

1236
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:19,330
Tommy and the cool mule.

1237
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:22,890
Here's a really horrendous poster I'm showing you guys.

1238
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:26,970
I like how these two actors aren't allowed to have their full faces shown.

1239
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,650
They are mostly covered up by a mule head.

1240
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:33,290
It says, not your average talking mule.

1241
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,450
So we at least know that about it.

1242
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,370
Ice-T is the voice of a mule.

1243
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,570
Yeah, like my computer is not…

1244
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,230
Is fighting back against…

1245
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,370
Yeah, mine is also not…

1246
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:46,030
I'm looking at it on the internet, but for some reason it's not working.

1247
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:46,610
I see it though.

1248
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:50,770
Ice-T is in it and he's the voice of the mule?

1249
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,450
Yeah, maybe.

1250
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,850
Jackie A, the voice of the mule.

1251
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,270
You know, I think this movie is a trick.

1252
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:06,750
I think that it has a fun title and a fun cover and you think that it's a fun silly movie perhaps where a mule farts or something.

1253
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:15,730
But then the description is, Tommy Braxton's father goes to war and never returns, forcing Tommy to become the man of the house and support his mom and sister.

1254
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,750
That is not…

1255
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,850
That doesn't sound fun.

1256
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,990
No, I think it's a serious…

1257
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,250
I think they canker-rejected it.

1258
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:26,290
I think they decided to make it a silly animal movie in editing because it was too boring.

1259
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,210
Well, here I wanted to show…

1260
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:30,990
I have…

1261
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,450
This is in…

1262
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:35,110
I found it in one video about this ride.

1263
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:39,410
So this is a promotional item from Universal at the time.

1264
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,490
And they used to be…

1265
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:48,910
In the Michael Eisner era of Disney, they would talk a lot about, well, our idea with movies…

1266
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:53,570
You know, as Disney was trying to get back on its feet, we got to hit a bunch of singles and doubles.

1267
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,210
We're not trying to hit home runs or grand slams.

1268
01:16:56,430 --> 01:17:02,930
And it certainly seems like after the grand slam of T2 3D, you get…

1269
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:08,270
Here are the new thrills and all new excitement that Universal Studios Florida had.

1270
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,590
Twister ride it out.

1271
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:17,370
Hercules and Xeno, Wizards of the Screen, Universal Studios Islands of Adventure preview center.

1272
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:22,790
So I'm going to go ahead and say the preview center was the most dynamic of those three options.

1273
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:24,150
Well, to you, this was like…

1274
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,450
This was your church, the preview center.

1275
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,210
Well, that's true.

1276
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,950
But like that is the double, I think, of the singles of…

1277
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,530
I mean, Twister ride it out.

1278
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:36,750
Certainly a much better experience than Hercules and Xeno, Wizards of the Screen.

1279
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,570
But my affection for Hercules and Xena is because I got to do it.

1280
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,270
You lived it.

1281
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,110
Had you not lived it, how would you feel?

1282
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:44,990
I wrote the movies.

1283
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,090
You wrote the movies.

1284
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,290
Yeah, we should say so this…

1285
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,970
Yeah, I guess the building got condemned.

1286
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,130
They couldn't use it anymore.

1287
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,990
So they couldn't even just put another attraction in this soundstage building.

1288
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:59,330
They had to just tear it down entirely, which they did and replaced the whole area with Transformers the Ride.

1289
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:04,270
So if you're in Universal Orlando now, that's what's there.

1290
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:23,270
So look at it now and point out before you get on Transformers and have your adventure with the AllSpark, turn to whoever you're with and say, you know, once this was where the Wizards of the Screen rained and they will stare at you and consider leaving the park entirely.

1291
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,590
But then maybe you'll just go in and have fun on the ride.

1292
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,830
Is it Wizards because there was magic stuff in the shows?

1293
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,850
I guess, but they weren't…

1294
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,030
They weren't…

1295
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:36,970
I'm sure they fought a Wizard or they befriended a Wizard on episodes.

1296
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:37,830
Constantly, seemingly.

1297
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,830
Yeah, but they weren't Wizards.

1298
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:40,570
So I just don't know why…

1299
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,110
Not in this show.

1300
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:42,810
There's not a Wizard.

1301
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,030
Hercules is a God.

1302
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:48,010
Well, the crew who makes all your favorite Hollywood TV and movies.

1303
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,770
They're the real Wizards of the Screen.

1304
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,130
That's right.

1305
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,950
Look, I agree with that, of course.

1306
01:18:52,950 --> 01:19:03,390
That's what Universal was there to teach us and to teach them that those tributes are more important than watching a show that is full of kicking and punching and swinging around on ropes.

1307
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:07,930
You need to learn what ADR stands for, what looping is.

1308
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:14,450
I mean, in reality, they should have like, at the time, they should have been showing you how to use that, what was it called?

1309
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:20,250
The Thompson's Guide, that old giant phone book size map that showed you every street in LA or whatever.

1310
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:26,050
Or like, here's how a PA wraps a napkin around a can of Diet Coke to hand to this movie star.

1311
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:27,570
Don't look them in the eye.

1312
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,730
They hate that.

1313
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:34,250
They should have done more PA tips, more tips for burgeoning PAs.

1314
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,410
Yeah, well, that's how the real stuff…

1315
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:36,810
I cannot…

1316
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:42,570
I've lost track of how many people I've read about, like, and they love Diet Coke with a napkin wrapped around it.

1317
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,290
It's like, what?

1318
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,910
So their hands don't get what?

1319
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,570
What the fuck, man?

1320
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,610
This is another Jim Belushi tale, I think.

1321
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,930
I think that's what it's about.

1322
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,810
Probably.

1323
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:57,090
There should be one where like, there should be a Halloween Horror Nights maze where you have to…

1324
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:01,730
The like, final room is that there's a guy playing Scott Rudin, movie producer.

1325
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:02,390
Jesus.

1326
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:07,170
And he like, screams at you and throws stuff, and it's like the scariest thing.

1327
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:14,370
Just repurpose, like, if one of the King Kongs that got removed, just like, reskin it.

1328
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:19,910
Keep, like, the giant speakers, because you'll need that to be the amplification of a Scott Rudin scream.

1329
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,170
Yeah, exactly.

1330
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,910
And he has banana breath, too, for some reason.

1331
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,070
Really scary.

1332
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:30,930
I think that was on the list of places that took interns when I was doing internship, like…

1333
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:35,090
And I was just like, on paper, it's like, well, they've made some cool stuff.

1334
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,750
And it's like, oh, thank God I dodged that bullet, or dodged that binder hurl across the room.

1335
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,750
Yeah, literally dodge.

1336
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,910
Yeah, I think that's what the job would have been.

1337
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,250
Closing thoughts, have we missed anything?

1338
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,510
RIP, or Killy Xena?

1339
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:52,850
Yeah, I…

1340
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:57,250
It was past its time for this type of attraction.

1341
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,970
I wish it was more of a stunt show.

1342
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:07,370
I wish it, yeah, ended up being like, more kitschy and fun, like some of the episodes, or most of the episodes.

1343
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,390
But yeah, it ended up…

1344
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,550
It was stuck.

1345
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:14,450
It had to fit into the framework of the previous murder she wrote.

1346
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:25,230
And I feel like the IP of Hercules and Xena then wasn't done full justice, because it was trying to fit, you know, a square peg in a slightly round hole.

1347
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:38,090
The lawsuits of them trying to get owed residuals or owed TV money kind of helped wind up a lot of Hercules and Xena.

1348
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,690
There were Hercules and Xena walk-around characters for a while too.

1349
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,250
Mm-hmm, right.

1350
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:44,430
And yeah, so…

1351
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,750
And I'm sure they, by the way, they probably deserve that money.

1352
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:48,950
Oh yeah.

1353
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:50,250
Talked a lot of residuals.

1354
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:52,490
A lot of talk about residuals.

1355
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:53,690
And yeah.

1356
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:54,070
Yeah.

1357
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:58,470
So even despite Kevin Sorbo, he did get his money, right?

1358
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,510
He got more money, I believe.

1359
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,210
I think they probably settled the issue.

1360
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:02,810
Yeah, I don't think they did.

1361
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,950
I don't think it was a successful lawsuit, actually.

1362
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,610
I don't think they got what they were looking for, but it might have gotten something.

1363
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,750
So yeah, anyway.

1364
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:23,130
Well, you know, I guess in the end, Hercules and Xena did not get one more round like the movie One More Round, where Sorbo plays Billy Jack Taylor.

1365
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:28,590
But will there be other great attractions based on our favorite TV shows in the future?

1366
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:36,750
You'd have to hope that there is, for such a thing, that there is a Hope Bridge, like the film where Kevin Sorbo plays Eric.

1367
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,450
Hope Bridge.

1368
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:39,070
Oh my God.

1369
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:45,590
Can we, can there be like, can they make rides or experiences and put it in the Ark encounter for some of these movies?

1370
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:46,910
Oh yeah.

1371
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:56,690
That would be a great, perfect tie in and get a little more, yeah, get some new attractions going to pique people's interest to get back to the Ark encounter.

1372
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:58,470
Welcome to the, oh yes, go ahead.

1373
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,790
I was going to say, here's how we filmed this scene in silhouette.

1374
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,350
So Kirk Cameron could be shown kissing a woman on screen.

1375
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:13,090
That is actually his wife, not the actress he acted opposite this movie, because he refused to kiss anyone who's not his wife.

1376
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,530
And that was okay.

1377
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:19,690
You know, that wasn't a massive pain in the ass that goes against most filmmaking rules.

1378
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:22,570
But okay, here's how we did it.

1379
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:30,850
Majority of our budgets is to create false kisses between, to remove married partners.

1380
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:41,430
And that's, and that's, that's what you've learned from the Bernie the Dolphin 2 Wizards of the Screen experience.

1381
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:47,430
And good job to our volunteer Jason for his portrayal of Winston Mills.

1382
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,750
Thanks for participating.

1383
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:55,830
I was an allegory for Barabbas, the unrepentant, crucified.

1384
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,590
He plays King Herod in something.

1385
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,290
That's a good reel.

1386
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:00,770
Yeah.

1387
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,470
That's a meaty role to sink your teeth into.

1388
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:04,630
Yeah.

1389
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,550
In a list of otherwise, I think Italian actors.

1390
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:10,790
I think this is, this is an Italy Italian shot film.

1391
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:11,910
There it is.

1392
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:16,330
Check out the Penitent Thief with Sorbo as King Herod.

1393
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,950
You survived podcast The Ride.

1394
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,190
Yeah.

1395
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,370
So, so much homework.

1396
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:29,930
You know, obviously go out and rent and buy all of the films that I mentioned and put money in Sorbo's pocket being that he's missed out on his residuals.

1397
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,970
But if you have any left at the end of the day, keep it tuned here to podcast The Ride,

1398
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:38,010
the second gate for three bonus episodes every month.

1399
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,190
And oh, that's right.

1400
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:58,430
I knew I had something to go out on, which will be the sounds of Mike and Jason reacting to a admittedly adorably drawn gang bang between Riff Raff and other members.

1401
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,570
That's Top Cat.

1402
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,450
Yeah, that's Top Cat.

1403
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,310
Oh, it is.

1404
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,570
But Riff Raff's over there.

1405
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,910
He's over on the right.

1406
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:08,410
Jason might say there was no porn to picture of Riff Raff.

1407
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:12,470
Who's that woman that Riff Raff is making love to?

1408
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:13,910
Oh my God.

1409
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,590
Top Cat has his tongue out.

1410
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:18,850
He's in ecstasy.

1411
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:19,970
Oh God.

1412
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:29,950
This is going to be a recurring feature, I think, where we are 34 something midway through an episode and go out on the shocking reveal, but not tweet the photo.

1413
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:33,390
That's not what a cat's genitals look like.

1414
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:35,370
That is not accurate to that.

1415
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:37,910
I think a cat's genitals might be grosser though is the problem.

1416
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:39,030
Yeah, you might be right about that.

1417
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:43,330
I guess if these are like half man, half cat or anthropomorphic cats, maybe.

1418
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:49,890
I mean, I don't know what their anatomy looks like, but I will say this is, I could do an hour on what's wrong with this.

1419
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:54,090
But pretty accurate drawings though of Riff Raff and Top Cat's hats.

1420
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,870
I would know the hat anywhere.

1421
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:57,970
Credit where it's due.

1422
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:06,030
Cover the bottom of it with your hands and then just look at the hats and then you've just got a well-drawn series of hats.

1423
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:07,610
It is.

1424
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,150
Look, I agree that the hats are well done.

1425
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:16,150
Maybe we'll tweet that, just the top half of this Cadillac cat gangbang photo.

1426
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,170
Swap.

1427
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:17,490
I don't know.

1428
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:22,830
Top Cat has his own gang of guys too that are not around here.

1429
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:29,430
So it's like the two leaders of like a bunch of cats getting together and like swapping wives maybe?

1430
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,450
This is a cat key party.

1431
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,610
You think that's Top Cat's love interest?

1432
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,670
Yeah, maybe.

1433
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:35,570
Yeah.

1434
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,750
I don't recognize her.

1435
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:41,930
Why didn't they invite the Heathcliff gang and why didn't they invite Oliver and company?

1436
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:42,890
The Cadillac cats?

1437
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:44,930
Oliver's a child.

1438
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:45,810
Yeah, yeah.

1439
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,350
Sorry.

1440
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:48,690
Dodger, maybe Dodger.

1441
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:49,610
He's a dog.

1442
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,670
He's been with Oliver and Company in 20 years.

1443
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:52,290
Alright, let him grow.

1444
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,370
Dodger is in the corner watching.

1445
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:58,930
Licking his lips.

1446
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:00,210
Oh, he's a…

1447
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:00,250
Yeah.

1448
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:01,270
Oh, no.

1449
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:02,830
And you know what he's saying?

1450
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:04,510
Why should I worry?

1451
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:05,430
Why should I care?

1452
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,950
Well, he always says that.

1453
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,650
It sounds like Dodger.

1454
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,570
Alright, let's get out of here.

1455
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,150
This is all I talk to you next time.

1456
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:15,170
Goodbye.
