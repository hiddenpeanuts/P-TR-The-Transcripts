1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,520
Forever.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,320
Dog.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,200
Warning, the following podcast may contain a high volume

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,620
of recently passed kidney stones and our ashes.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,380
Thankfully, it doesn't contain the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,360
Molly Lambert joins us for the wildest topic

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,260
in the wilderness.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,340
It's Big Thunder Mountain on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,668
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast about theme parks

10
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:51,508
hosted by three guys who think it's perfectly normal

11
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:55,628
to text each other late at night about Imagineer Joe Rhodey.

12
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,948
I'm one of those guys, Scott Garner,

13
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,408
also Mike Carlson is here.

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,128
I am here, my name's Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,488
I initiated, I think what you're talking about.

16
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,008
It was an idea for when we get Joe Rhodey on the show,

17
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,548
which I cannot reveal because I was so tickled

18
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:10,948
by my own idea, I would never reveal it

19
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,408
until it actually happens.

20
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,068
It's great, and I didn't mean to roast

21
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:16,788
that we were doing that because of course we should,

22
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:21,028
when we inevitably have our next great Imagineer

23
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:25,228
on the show, Joe Rhodey, we need to do a lot of fun stuff.

24
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:27,588
I was just reacting to, I was falling asleep

25
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,468
and what am I doing?

26
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:32,508
I'm texting my male friends about Joe Rhodey right now

27
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:33,648
as I pass out.

28
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,288
Well, I will bring Jason Sheridan in, Jason Sheridan.

29
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:36,948
Yeah, hi.

30
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:40,248
I will say this, I was disappointed

31
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,548
in both of your reactions to the idea

32
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:44,648
because I thought the idea, it was late at night

33
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,648
and I was so happy with myself

34
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,168
and I was waiting for like, oh my God, what a great idea.

35
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,948
And you guys were like, oh, it was a very

36
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:54,888
not impolite response, but it was like, oh yeah,

37
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:57,488
and then a couple ideas and then there were no LOLs written,

38
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,108
there were no ha ha ha's.

39
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,148
So I was like, oh, maybe it's not as good as I thought it was.

40
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,468
I was probably asleep.

41
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:04,428
I was probably texting you from a dream state.

42
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,668
It makes a lot of sense that you would be asleep

43
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,208
at midnight.

44
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,408
Yeah, I'm a real sleepy bitch.

45
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:10,008
I had night will kicking in at the time.

46
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,048
So to even get, I think I texted you one thing back

47
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,628
and it took a lot of energy.

48
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,268
As will this, if I sound a little bit sick,

49
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:21,688
that's why, that's just too inside business for you.

50
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:22,808
But why not?

51
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,668
Might as well speak my truth, my sick truth.

52
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,288
Anyway, we will have Joe on, it will be great.

53
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,628
And this bit is gonna kill, I think.

54
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,808
Let's tee it up real hard,

55
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,208
but let's also talk about our guest today,

56
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,688
here to help us address one of the big ones,

57
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,028
one of the great rides in Theme Park World

58
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,468
from the podcast Night Call.

59
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,988
It's Molly Lambert, hello.

60
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,728
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

61
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:47,288
Thanks for coming.

62
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:47,908
Absolutely.

63
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,768
I just wanted to say that as a person who's also

64
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:53,408
on a podcast with three hosts who text each other

65
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,468
about things late at night,

66
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:57,848
sometimes from different time zones even,

67
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,888
all the good ideas come right before you fall asleep.

68
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:01,408
Right.

69
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,308
But that's also when you're the least likely

70
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,948
for anyone to respond.

71
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:05,788
Right.

72
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,028
But also when you're the most excited about whatever it is.

73
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:10,288
Yes, it makes a lot of sense.

74
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,548
Like sleeping and I guess, it's lame,

75
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:14,828
like shower I guess is also the other time.

76
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,328
Doing a shower is when you think of a good idea.

77
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,108
But I can't text as easily.

78
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:20,428
Yeah, driving too.

79
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:21,048
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,328
It's always when you like have it,

81
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,628
it's the least write downable.

82
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:29,008
But you have a time zone differential,

83
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,868
so that messes things up, I guess.

84
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:31,608
Yeah, we all get it.

85
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:34,388
We also just all, we all get excited about things

86
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,968
at different times of the day.

87
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:39,748
So we all text, like we'll all just do bursts of text,

88
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,548
but at very different times from each other.

89
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,888
Okay, so you just have to like marry it all later.

90
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:47,588
It just can't all happen live in the moment.

91
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,828
You might have to put the pause button

92
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,368
on an exciting idea for three hours or so.

93
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,528
Also sometimes having those three hours,

94
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,968
you're like was that a good idea or was,

95
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,608
I just really drinking a lot of coffee

96
00:03:58,608 --> 00:03:59,848
right around that time.

97
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:01,688
Because your brain is reacting to it

98
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:04,828
as if you said the idea to a person in the room.

99
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,388
So when you don't immediately get a gratification,

100
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,688
at least mine is, is like you say the joke

101
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,068
or you say the idea and then you're like waiting

102
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,148
for like an immediate response as if you just told a person

103
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,108
and then you don't get it.

104
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,808
So your brain, even though it knows consciously

105
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:19,628
like what's going on, there's still part of it

106
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:23,248
that's like now we wait to find out if I'm good or not.

107
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,688
I'm like this is the time I'll find out

108
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,568
if I'm real, if I'm a fake or not.

109
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:30,088
Do you guys like, oh wait a minute,

110
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,648
I was, I realized, you were not on Twitter anymore.

111
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:33,568
I was gonna ask a Twitter question.

112
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:33,808
I know, I put Twitter.

113
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,248
Okay, okay, well congratulations first of all.

114
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,928
Here's headline number one.

115
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,768
Thank you, I am very smug about it

116
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,408
and would advise everyone to do it.

117
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:44,808
It makes, it made my life better.

118
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,908
And the number one thing that I did that I now can say

119
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,628
was like a concrete thing I did

120
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:51,208
because I wasn't on Twitter was I built

121
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,128
a spooky Halloween carnival for my cats

122
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,468
out of cardboard boxes.

123
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:56,188
Oh wow.

124
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,468
That's moved on to healthy activities.

125
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:02,288
It was the best thing I've done in just months.

126
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:04,508
I was just like, oh wholesome.

127
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,648
That's like low level imagineering.

128
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,788
Yeah, low level imagineering.

129
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:10,848
Placemaking.

130
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,928
They could not have been less interested

131
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,948
in the haunted castle.

132
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:17,728
Was it made of trash though?

133
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,208
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:19,268
Because cats love trash.

135
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:22,608
It was made of boxes that are from

136
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,008
things I've gotten from podcasting.

137
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:27,328
It sounds perfect.

138
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,068
I leave those boxes out for them anyway

139
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:29,748
because they enjoy them.

140
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:31,128
But it was like they enjoyed it less

141
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,688
the more effort I put into it.

142
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,708
I think they were like most excited

143
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,548
when it was just like some flat cardboard

144
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:40,888
and the more it became a spooky tunnel or something.

145
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,088
They were like, mm.

146
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,508
They could smell the desperation.

147
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,148
Yeah, exactly.

148
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:44,688
Yeah.

149
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,088
Like now I'm not interested.

150
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:51,648
Yeah, my cat always like not into like fancy toys

151
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:53,388
but into an amoeba bag.

152
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:56,088
That was always the highlight of my cats.

153
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:57,368
The more low tech the better.

154
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,348
Yeah, cats are just real low tech.

155
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:01,008
Let's be honest, you know.

156
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,608
Cats and dogs, they don't like fancy stuff.

157
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:04,348
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:05,408
They're salts of the earth.

159
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,548
Their favorite rides are the walkthroughs.

160
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,268
Mm-hmm.

161
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,208
Don't need anything fancy, yeah.

162
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:15,068
When you talk about Twitter making your life,

163
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,888
getting off Twitter making your life healthier,

164
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,608
really the only reason I am not now is because,

165
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,528
like is really because not to just kiss

166
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,508
the ass of the audience but truly.

167
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,068
Go for it, Scott.

168
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,368
Like podcast the ride has made my Twitter feed

169
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:32,388
like so much more joyous and fun.

170
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:36,108
It really, I feel like I unfollowed a lot of angry,

171
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,048
strident stuff.

172
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:37,448
Yeah.

173
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,568
And followed a lot of people talking about, you know,

174
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,008
gummy bears and whatever.

175
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,348
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,488
Pictures of little elephants and rainbows

177
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,368
from Epcot Center in the 80s.

178
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,208
Now your life is better because of it.

179
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:53,948
Theme park Twitter is like Christmas day.

180
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:57,388
Well, I've always loved theme park social media.

181
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:00,088
I feel like you guys epitomize the best of it.

182
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:03,328
I was very excited about the City Walk series.

183
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:04,308
Oh, thank you.

184
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:04,748
Oh, yes.

185
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:05,988
But you grew up in the valley.

186
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:07,008
Because I grew up in the valley.

187
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:10,728
So I spent my formative years, like my tween years,

188
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,988
going to City Walk a lot just to like go there

189
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,088
because it was a place you could hang out underage,

190
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:16,688
you know?

191
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:17,348
Sure, mm-hmm.

192
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:21,328
And I am just fascinated and obsessed with it

193
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:24,068
and so I really enjoyed the like the punishing,

194
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,428
the punishing aspect of it.

195
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,828
The level of detail and how much did you really wanna go back

196
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,028
into your preteen years?

197
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,248
Well, it's like having been to City Walk

198
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,888
or I feel like this happens at a lot of theme park

199
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,808
and theme park like environments.

200
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:41,748
It's like because it's such a high level of immersion

201
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:44,548
at a certain point, you're like, get me out of here.

202
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,248
Anything else.

203
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:47,888
Well, I feel that way.

204
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,688
That's what Scott feels, but Jason and I don't have that.

205
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:51,368
You don't have that, it never kicks in?

206
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:51,648
Never.

207
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:52,628
What about Las Vegas?

208
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,468
Yes, oh, 100% Vegas.

209
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:55,788
Vegas is too much.

210
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:56,388
It's too much.

211
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,088
Okay, see, so you have a point.

212
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,328
Yes, you're right, that's fair.

213
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,528
I do have a point and it's Vegas.

214
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,768
And I love Las Vegas, but like for two days

215
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,288
and then you're like, I have to be away from here.

216
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,908
I have to smell real air again or I'm gonna die.

217
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,368
The escape is so thrilling when you need the Vegas.

218
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,328
The arrival in Vegas is wonderful

219
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,048
and the leaving is perhaps even more wonderful.

220
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:19,228
This is why I feel like living in space permanently

221
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,168
will never work.

222
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,088
Oh, because artificial environments will drive you insane.

223
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,268
Right, like eventually.

224
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:27,328
And I've never been to Disney World,

225
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,688
but I'm a little afraid of it

226
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,328
because I'm a little afraid of Orlando.

227
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,488
Like one of the things I love about Disneyland

228
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:36,268
is that you can leave at the end of the day and go home.

229
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,868
I don't know, you're losing me a little.

230
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,288
Give us a moment, hang on.

231
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,548
I had a Disneyland pass.

232
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:46,228
I used to, I worked for Disney for a few years

233
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,228
for a corporation that was under Disney and-

234
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:48,808
Oh, me too.

235
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:49,448
Scott too.

236
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,488
So it was like bought by them.

237
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:52,568
Did you have the silver pass?

238
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,388
Yes, I got the silver pass.

239
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,688
We both had like weird, like we weren't,

240
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:59,068
we didn't have to be like in the main Disney mechanism.

241
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,768
Yeah, we got the silver pass.

242
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,048
I got it for like two years

243
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:05,608
and it allowed me to get into the park for free

244
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,088
on all the days except the blackout days

245
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,268
and to bring in three guests, which is insane.

246
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:13,028
Can you believe that today they're trying to eliminate

247
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,428
like all things like that.

248
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,208
I feel like we could just bring in,

249
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,908
us knuckleheads could just bring in three other knuckleheads.

250
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:22,488
It was like the motivating thing about work to me

251
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,148
was that I could go to Disneyland for free.

252
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,108
Sure, the thing making you not quit the job.

253
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,108
Well, but then I had a period where the job kind of was over

254
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,328
but we were sort of like had been laid off

255
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,148
but we're getting paid through the end of our contract.

256
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,728
So I had the silver pass for a few months

257
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:37,028
and I went to Disneyland every day, essentially.

258
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,048
Hell yeah.

259
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:41,128
And I like told everybody, I knew,

260
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:44,648
I was like going increasingly over time,

261
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,428
just like more and more as I was feeling more manic

262
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,528
about like figuring out what to do with my life.

263
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,388
And then I just was like, tell my friends,

264
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,648
I can go to Disneyland for free,

265
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,508
just tell me when you wanna go and we'll go.

266
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,048
And so I was like going for the last month,

267
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,608
like a bunch of people realized it was gonna run out

268
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,028
and that now was their chance.

269
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,808
And I went just like every day for like two weeks.

270
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,228
Cause I was also like, I have to purge my system

271
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,608
of the desire to go to Disneyland

272
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,708
cause like I'm not gonna be able to do it.

273
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,168
Like I'm gonna have to pay for it if I wanna go now.

274
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,668
And that's a whole other experience.

275
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:18,828
Did that work?

276
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,088
Did you feel like you got it out?

277
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,928
Did you hit a wall at some point?

278
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,228
That was the thing.

279
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,368
I like, even by the end, there was like one day

280
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,088
where I was basically just like chaperoning my friend

281
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,748
and her boyfriend and I was like,

282
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,508
I don't wanna be here anymore.

283
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,168
Like I was like-

284
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,768
It's always fun to be the third at Disney

285
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,848
cause there's so many rides

286
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,048
where you're like in rows of three.

287
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:42,488
It was just like I had had it,

288
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,088
like it had been a fun way to hang out

289
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,788
with a lot of friends of mine to be like,

290
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,348
I could take you to Disneyland for free.

291
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:48,728
You just have to drive or whatever.

292
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,608
But this was just, I was sort of like,

293
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:52,928
you know, there's like a point when you're like,

294
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,968
I would like any food except the food in the theme park.

295
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:59,068
I feel, I don't think you feel this, Mike.

296
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,328
You guys love the theme park, right?

297
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,088
I really don't, I don't think you,

298
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,688
I've never seen you at the moment that I hit

299
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:05,468
where I'm like, I need a vegetable.

300
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:06,308
I need something.

301
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,668
The vegetable thing is real.

302
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,708
But you can get a vegetable if you look hard enough.

303
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:12,328
That's true.

304
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,268
It's harder in Florida.

305
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:15,348
It's harder, it's a little harder.

306
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,108
It's getting much better.

307
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,708
Hard, really hard.

308
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,328
Formerly at Universal Florida.

309
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,268
I think they now are, they're getting a little more with the-

310
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:24,388
What about the big pickle?

311
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,308
That's a vegetable.

312
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:26,568
Big pickle.

313
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,068
Yeah, the big pineapple is good for electrolytes.

314
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,128
I've actually gone to Disneyland with a friend

315
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,908
who's a vegan and like just knows

316
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,908
what all the vegan things are in Disneyland.

317
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,928
Yeah, there's websites that like track what food is vegan.

318
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,008
But pineapple whip is vegan.

319
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:40,288
Dough whip is vegan.

320
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,048
Mm-hmm.

321
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,048
You know, not so you can get just like a,

322
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,268
just a mango on a stick, slightly scored.

323
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,568
That's a good snack.

324
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:50,968
I think all of that should be a standardized

325
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:51,748
theme park snack.

326
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:53,648
Molly, I have to ask,

327
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:56,188
because I doubt any other upcoming guests

328
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:59,908
could be in this position talking about Silver Pass.

329
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,568
Did you ever go to Disneyland with Bill Simmons?

330
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,508
No, I did not.

331
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,808
I went, I never went with like coworkers.

332
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,028
It was like we just all had the,

333
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,968
but like I would run into other people that I worked with.

334
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:15,768
Oh, also flexing their Silver Pass.

335
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

336
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,428
I remember like running into my coworker,

337
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,128
Jacoby and his wife and like their kids.

338
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,128
And they were just like,

339
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,228
oh, we just came from California Adventure

340
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:26,088
and we snuck the wine from California Adventure

341
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:27,848
into Disneyland and nobody noticed.

342
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:28,568
Wow.

343
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:29,408
Wow.

344
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:30,668
How do you guys feel?

345
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:31,408
What are you, thermos or what do you-

346
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,668
Like just in the stroller, I believe.

347
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:34,408
Oh, interesting.

348
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,368
Oh, that's smart.

349
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:36,328
Oh, that's good.

350
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,548
I would like to know,

351
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,188
how do you guys feel about the alcohol in Star Wars Land?

352
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,808
Oh, I think we're all on the same page

353
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,408
that we're totally on board for it.

354
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:44,748
You're proud?

355
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:45,088
100%.

356
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,308
You don't think it's gonna ruin

357
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,588
the family friendly spirit of the park?

358
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,828
No, cause I think they're gonna make people jump

359
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:53,588
through so many hoops to get it.

360
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:54,888
I don't know that that's true.

361
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,688
I think the waits are gonna be so long

362
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:00,088
that no one's gonna get back in line for round two.

363
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:01,588
I think they're also gonna limit

364
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:03,408
how many you're gonna be able to order.

365
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,708
Do you think the way the lines and rides

366
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,028
are designed for Star Wars Land

367
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,928
is like a disaster waiting to happen?

368
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:09,808
Potentially.

369
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,148
Yeah, there's not enough capacity,

370
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:12,348
I think, already for the rides

371
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:14,248
cause they're not gonna be able to load enough people on

372
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,848
and then it's just gonna, where is everybody gonna go?

373
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,668
That's what I've heard.

374
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,308
It's gonna back up.

375
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:18,688
From mice chat.

376
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,628
Yeah, are you a mice chat?

377
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:21,028
Oh, I'm a mice chat.

378
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:21,828
You're on mice chat.

379
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:22,308
Oh boy, oh boy.

380
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:23,188
What else you got?

381
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,368
That's it, that's it.

382
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,988
Okay, but not Screamscape or anything?

383
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,288
I can't very into it.

384
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,368
I follow a lot of the Instagrams too.

385
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,808
I was following a lot of like, haunt Instagrams.

386
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:36,728
I do think, I will say real quick about the alcohol,

387
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,548
I think that Star Wars Land starts

388
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,948
just alcohol everywhere in Disneyland.

389
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,188
I think maybe it takes a couple years to roll out.

390
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:43,408
Well, it's always been funny that it's like

391
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,428
in California Adventure but not Disneyland.

392
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:46,428
Yeah, it's just.

393
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,828
But it's the one thing that they could be like,

394
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,588
here's why you have to go to California Adventure.

395
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:51,168
Yeah.

396
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:52,108
Primarily in the early days.

397
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:53,208
Yes, yeah, yeah.

398
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,368
Oh yeah, in 2001, absolutely.

399
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:55,808
Right.

400
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:56,728
The main feature.

401
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,828
But yeah, we've talked a lot about how,

402
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:02,648
why is it like, no, this would be against Walt's wishes,

403
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:07,068
but if you go 100 yards away into another place,

404
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:07,828
then that's fine.

405
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,108
Walt has no problem with that.

406
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,208
I feel strongly that you should be able to drink alcohol

407
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,808
on fake Bourbon Street.

408
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:13,828
Of course.

409
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:14,768
Yeah, certainly.

410
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,168
It'd be great, and in that new tropical hideaway,

411
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,668
give me a Tiki drink.

412
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:19,768
Where's the tropical hideaway?

413
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,528
It's next to the Tiki Room, they're opening it.

414
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:24,328
Oh, oh, is that where the bathroom used to be?

415
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,508
No, the bathroom is still there.

416
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:27,048
The bathroom's still there.

417
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:30,008
They love that secret bathroom, I'm sad that it went away.

418
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,188
In a Latin's oasis, you're saying?

419
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,908
No, there was like a women's bathroom.

420
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,088
No, that's still there.

421
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:36,908
You're talking about that, that's the one

422
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:37,908
when you enter the Tiki Room.

423
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:39,648
I think so, yeah.

424
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:40,588
Yeah, it's still there.

425
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:41,008
You sure?

426
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:42,928
Yeah, preserved.

427
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:43,608
I'm pretty sure.

428
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,048
Is it taking away the secret back access

429
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,628
to the Dole Whip stand?

430
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,028
Where you go pretend you're waiting for the Tiki Room

431
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:50,828
and get the Dole Whip?

432
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:51,368
No, that's real.

433
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:52,108
Oh, that's smart.

434
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:52,408
That's still there.

435
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,008
Whoa, oh, very good tip.

436
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:56,228
But the tip really now is the mobile ordering

437
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,648
for the Dole Whip,

438
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,268
because then it just is ready when you get there,

439
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,288
and you skip the line.

440
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,648
That's too advanced.

441
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,828
You and Scott are on the same page about a lot of things.

442
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,588
I would do the mobile ordering.

443
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:10,568
I can't count on my mobile to work in Disneyland in general,

444
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:11,408
is my feeling about it.

445
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,128
They have spotty Wi-Fi.

446
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,268
Yeah, the Wi-Fi is spotty.

447
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,068
There's just so many people, I think, too.

448
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,068
Let me clarify, Mike.

449
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,828
I'm not against mobile ordering,

450
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,788
but I was against figuring it out in that moment

451
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,348
when we were five steps away from the actual line.

452
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,888
I wanted Scott to mobile order a bangle barbecue,

453
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,528
and he didn't want to hear it.

454
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:34,028
It was more irritating to me than just standing in a line.

455
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,568
Well, all right, next time mobile order.

456
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,468
Since we were next to a line we were next to.

457
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:39,888
We were walking toward.

458
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,808
We had forward momentum to a line.

459
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,188
But I have here, back to that tiki thing,

460
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,288
which is if you don't know,

461
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,888
they're putting in kind of like a tiki bar area

462
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:53,008
facing the final part of the river of the Jungle Cruise,

463
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,428
but what is the point of it if there's not alcohol there?

464
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:57,948
There's gonna be food and stuff.

465
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,268
Yeah, snacks and fruit juices and that sort of thing.

466
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:01,948
Non-alcoholic drinks.

467
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:06,328
But I still think, give us a couple years and maybe.

468
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,088
Is there booze in Epcot?

469
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,728
Oh yeah. Oh my goodness.

470
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,268
Is that where the California Adventure

471
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,628
Having Booze idea came from?

472
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,888
Is there not booze in Disney World,

473
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:14,968
but there's booze in Epcot?

474
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:17,268
Well, there's booze in Disney World now.

475
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,728
That's also another reason why.

476
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,608
Oh, there is?

477
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:20,788
All four of the parks.

478
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:21,428
In the Kingdom?

479
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:22,428
Yeah, all in the Kingdom.

480
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:23,628
Was there ever not?

481
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,468
Yeah. Yeah, or initially.

482
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,948
And I think that Paris didn't have it initially,

483
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,488
but they got it very quickly

484
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,548
because that was feedback from Europeans.

485
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:34,408
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,928
They were like, we have to be able to smoke the cigarettes

487
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,048
on It's a Small World.

488
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:39,608
And. Yeah.

489
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:40,988
And feed them to the dolls.

490
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,088
Our children need cigarettes.

491
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:48,468
Maybe I could start bringing us into the topic

492
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:51,508
of today's show, but one of my now favorite memories

493
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:55,308
in any park was a beer that I enjoyed in the saloon

494
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,188
in Frontierland in Paris,

495
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,648
having just been on Big Thunder,

496
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,808
or in fact, having gotten off Big Thunder,

497
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,468
but we'll get to that later.

498
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:08,808
But having a good draft beer in Frontierland, fantastic.

499
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:09,028
Right.

500
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,628
I think I've said it on the show maybe 10, I don't know,

501
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:12,728
10 times, how many times?

502
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,488
I said saloon has to have a beer in Frontierland.

503
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,388
There needs to be tiki drinks in Adventureland.

504
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,628
There needs to be some sort of space cocktail

505
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,768
in Tomorrowland.

506
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:24,008
And then there needs to be maybe wine on Main Street

507
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,868
or like at the, what's it called?

508
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:27,368
Is it carnation?

509
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:28,068
Carnation, yeah.

510
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,128
Yeah, something like that.

511
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:29,968
And that's it.

512
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,508
Yeah, no walk around alcohol.

513
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:33,268
Oh sure.

514
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:33,848
Yeah, yeah, you do.

515
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,068
Wait, no walk around alcohol?

516
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:35,708
Not in Disneyland.

517
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,468
I'm against walk around alcohol.

518
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,928
Oh wow, this is strict.

519
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:39,688
Really?

520
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:40,808
Even on Bourbon Street?

521
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:41,848
Are you genuinely?

522
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,668
Or is that like a good-

523
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,288
I like the stance.

524
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:45,908
I like the hard stance.

525
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,888
What about in the cantina?

526
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:49,868
You can only have it in the cantina,

527
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,048
can't leave the cantina.

528
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:52,768
I think that Disneyland is so,

529
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,008
there'd be too many people carrying booze

530
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,308
as they go through that horrible Adventureland stretch,

531
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,688
which is my favorite part of the park,

532
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:02,448
but it's the tightest and I don't know, I feel like-

533
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,488
There's no way you expand it, it's very narrow.

534
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:07,428
I just feel like I'm gonna get spilled on a lot.

535
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,588
But maybe that's fake.

536
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:11,588
Well, maybe they're gonna make some kind of a cup

537
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,668
that's like has a Darth Vader on it and doesn't spill.

538
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,068
Probably won't have booze in Vader though.

539
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:19,608
It'd have to be like a different character.

540
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:23,088
It'd be like a Elsa frozen margarita.

541
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:27,328
Or you have to like suck it out of like

542
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,468
the cow type creature like last Jedi.

543
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,368
Oh yeah, you have to drink it out of the mudder.

544
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:34,368
Yeah, you have to milk, if you want that alcohol that badly,

545
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,468
you have to milk it out yourself.

546
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,228
That is gonna be a drink in Star Wars Land.

547
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:38,108
You think so?

548
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:39,268
I think I've heard Reddit.

549
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,888
Can you just walk up to it and squeeze it yourself?

550
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,928
I think they like, if you're a fan,

551
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:46,728
you know that's where it came from,

552
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:50,108
but I don't think it says like from milked fresh by Luke.

553
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,488
You don't think it's gonna be scarring children

554
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:57,788
for a lifetime to see like animatronic utters,

555
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,708
like a cast member squeezing animatronic utters

556
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,008
for a milkshake, a child milkshake?

557
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,328
You don't think they're gonna lead with that?

558
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,028
I think if the milkshake is good,

559
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,708
it wouldn't scar a child too bad,

560
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,128
but no, I don't think that'll probably happen.

561
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:11,848
But we'll see.

562
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:16,428
They're gonna cook meat on a engine from a pod racer.

563
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:17,988
Who knows what they'll do?

564
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,588
Fry up eggs on the top of it?

565
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,288
That's one of the art, the pieces of art.

566
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:21,648
Is that right?

567
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:23,328
There's things frying on what looks

568
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,788
to be a giant pod racer engine.

569
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:26,568
Do you guys like Star Wars?

570
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,588
I do like Star Wars.

571
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,108
Are you excited about Star Wars Land?

572
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:31,448
Very excited, yeah.

573
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,828
My take is I only care about Star Wars

574
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:37,068
because it's affiliated with Star Tours.

575
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,388
Were it not, the movies themselves,

576
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:41,768
I wouldn't care about without the words.

577
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,728
I never liked Star Tours.

578
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:44,368
Ah.

579
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:45,328
Because I-

580
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:46,248
That's where you guys break.

581
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,768
Now I storm out.

582
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:49,428
I like animatronics.

583
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:52,208
And I was like, this is the beginning of rides

584
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,588
that are just gonna involve video screens.

585
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,188
Oh.

586
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,428
But you've got an animatronic right in front of you.

587
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:58,248
The best animatronic.

588
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,488
Not anymore, right?

589
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,128
Or do you still?

590
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:01,268
Yeah, it's still the C3PO.

591
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:02,308
The best animatronic.

592
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,428
I mean, I think also it made me a little sick

593
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:05,348
being on the ride.

594
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:05,988
Oh, that's okay.

595
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,408
A little herky-jerk.

596
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:07,928
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:11,588
Those were originally made as military simulators.

598
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,108
Of course they were.

599
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,568
Do you not go on it if you go?

600
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,128
I mean, I will if somebody really wants to,

601
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,248
but personally I feel like Tomorrowland

602
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:24,068
is my least favorite of the lands.

603
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,828
And as it has become more of a Star Wars land,

604
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:29,328
I've become less and less interested in it.

605
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,848
Although I enjoyed the Star Wars overlay

606
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,848
on Space Mountain just fine.

607
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:37,368
I think I went with some Star Wars fans

608
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:39,428
and they enjoyed it so much that I was like,

609
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:41,488
this is fine, great, whatever.

610
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,588
Oh, they convinced you, okay.

611
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:45,888
But I also enjoyed the new metal Halloween skull overlay

612
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,008
that everybody else hated.

613
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:48,428
I was like, this is great.

614
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:49,788
Oh, the Ghost Galaxy?

615
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,508
Yeah.

616
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:52,428
Which I think I've never heard it referred to

617
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:53,468
like that new metal.

618
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,448
I did see, I saw somebody on Twitter say

619
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:01,768
that they think Ghost Galaxy is a better overlay

620
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,508
than Nightmare Before Christmas on Imagine.

621
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,368
Well, Nightmare Before Christmas is a terrible overlay,

622
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,028
which I.

623
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:07,368
Oh, whoa, okay.

624
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:08,568
Coming in hot.

625
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:09,588
Coming in hot with that.

626
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,108
Let's hear it, let's hear it.

627
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,728
It lasts too long.

628
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:13,328
Agreed.

629
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,548
Halloween to Christmas.

630
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:17,488
When I go to Disneyland during Halloween,

631
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,728
I want classic haunted mansion.

632
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:21,608
I don't want fucking Christmas.

633
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:22,928
Can I curse on this podcast?

634
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,348
Oh yeah, go ahead.

635
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,308
I don't want Christmas.

636
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:26,008
Sorry, getting very passionate about that.

637
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:26,608
Oh yeah, yeah.

638
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,448
It's also just like,

639
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,868
it's not as good as the regular haunted mansion.

640
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,348
Regular haunted mansion is better, I think.

641
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,768
I don't, you know, it's actually surprising to me

642
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:36,728
that there is this,

643
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,188
I feel like I've only recently caught

644
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:41,648
that there is an anti-Nightmare contingent.

645
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:44,268
I like it a lot, and I don't, again,

646
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:46,528
disparate feelings from movie to ride.

647
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,808
I don't really care about Nightmare Before Christmas,

648
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:49,348
the movie.

649
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,588
I think I enjoy it.

650
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,448
But I think the overlay is neat.

651
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,808
I like that it's like jammed on top.

652
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:58,228
I love that it seems like he quickly shoved the pumpkin

653
00:21:58,228 --> 00:21:59,728
on top of the busts.

654
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,448
I like that it's kind of this muted color situation

655
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:08,168
with like, you know, with bright ribbons haphazardly thrown

656
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:08,768
all around.

657
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,988
Like, I think I like that they clash.

658
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,808
And I like that it changes out.

659
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,668
All right, the candelabra is zero now.

660
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:21,388
And it trades out the familiar elements

661
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:24,068
of haunted mansion culture in a bit of fun.

662
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:24,728
I think I'm just old school.

663
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,368
I like the original elements better.

664
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:27,108
I like that.

665
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:31,268
I love like Madame Leota and all that stuff more.

666
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:33,268
Yeah, I'm with you.

667
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:36,308
As is award winning,

668
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:39,208
or at least award nominated actor, Ryan Gosling.

669
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:40,448
Someone got him.

670
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:42,188
Bring Gosling into this argument.

671
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,868
Gosling agrees with us.

672
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:45,828
Where's he on record?

673
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:47,588
Gosling will totally eat his words

674
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,628
when they ask him to like play Jack Skellington

675
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:50,828
in a live action.

676
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:54,328
That's probably accurate because he'll get to dance.

677
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:58,468
I'm not against the overlay entirely.

678
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,688
I think it is fine.

679
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:01,988
I wish it were just for Christmas.

680
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:03,168
That's my feeling about it.

681
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,188
Yeah, unless if it's someone in our Facebook group

682
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:08,008
presented that, like what if it started November 1st?

683
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:09,288
I don't disagree.

684
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:11,388
That's not, I'll see that one.

685
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:14,028
But I think I would miss it if it went away entirely.

686
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,608
I appreciate how much it pleases

687
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,328
the Goths of Orange County.

688
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,528
And isn't that really what we're trying to do

689
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,508
is soothe the Goths?

690
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:22,548
The Tim Burton Goths of Orange County.

691
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,408
Also in Burbank, a very heavy stronghold,

692
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:28,208
home of Tim Burton.

693
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,048
We're in his backyard right now.

694
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,768
Wait, Tim Burton lives here?

695
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:33,568
No, he's from Burbank.

696
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:34,368
Oh, is he?

697
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,128
Doesn't that explain a lot about him?

698
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,008
That explains so, yeah, that explains a lot.

699
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,248
He grew up right near Disney, I feel like, in Burbank.

700
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,248
And I think he speaks of, he felt like Luke

701
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,848
looking up at the two suns.

702
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:51,448
He was dreaming of a world beyond this box mundanity.

703
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,668
If you've never been to Burbank,

704
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,408
it's very just rows of small box houses.

705
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:57,768
I have no problem with Burbank.

706
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:00,148
But you can see how you'd extrapolate that

707
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,868
into the exaggerated hellish suburbia that he imagined.

708
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,868
It's a twisted 50s dystopia.

709
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:12,128
At least he had a local Burbank landmark dark delicacies

710
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:14,848
to go to every day, maybe.

711
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:18,328
Well, there's always been a weird kind of Goth element,

712
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:22,028
I feel like, a slightly Goth underbelly.

713
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,628
Maybe because of the haunted mansion,

714
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,508
people's love of the haunted mansion.

715
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:29,948
Not exactly Goth, but David Lynch likes Bob's big boy

716
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,088
and had chilly johns when Peek's the return.

717
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,548
It's like a David Lynch-y kind of weird,

718
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,248
oh, it used to be the 50s here,

719
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:40,508
and it kind of feels like it still is, but time has passed.

720
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,708
And there's a bit, the major thoroughfares in Burbank

721
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,468
have, a lot of them feel like these are all the businesses

722
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:48,788
that were here in the 50s,

723
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,508
and only half of them are operating.

724
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:52,528
And how can it be so expensive to live around here,

725
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,468
but half of the buildings are vacant?

726
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:56,288
Oh, well, that's Los Angeles for you.

727
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,588
Yeah, that's true.

728
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:02,548
Yeah, well, sometimes it feels like a ghost town,

729
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:07,128
like an abandoned mining town or something.

730
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,528
Oh, gee, huh.

731
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:09,848
There we go, I found it.

732
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:11,248
A little thicker. You did it.

733
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,528
Just a little thicker.

734
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:16,388
The type of which can be found in our topic for today,

735
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,308
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

736
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:19,328
We're doing it.

737
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:24,168
One of the big ones, so excited to have you here for it.

738
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:27,248
So, I mean, why Big Thunder,

739
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:28,868
rather than like, it's great.

740
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:29,908
It's a great ride.

741
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,068
I think it's like probably the best integration

742
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,648
of being a roller coaster

743
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:37,828
and a themed animatronic using ride.

744
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:39,428
It's really nice.

745
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:42,748
And it's not, as I'm sure we will get into,

746
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:45,308
there's bizarre backstory that's there

747
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:47,208
if you feel like looking into it.

748
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:49,628
But if you just get on that ride,

749
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,228
if you are a child, if you're an adult

750
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,528
who's not paying any attention,

751
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,328
if you're someone who doesn't speak English,

752
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:59,588
there is no crazy, laid-on, thick mythology

753
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:01,248
that it's crucial that you know.

754
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:03,488
It's basically just a runaway train.

755
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,828
It's a runaway, it feels like a theme park ride

756
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:09,388
that could be in another theme park maybe,

757
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:13,008
but done so well because it's a Disney park ride.

758
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,188
That's the real thing about it.

759
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:19,108
We've spent a little time at Knotts recently

760
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:20,848
and talked about Knotts a lot on the podcast.

761
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,768
I love the ghost town at Knotts, I have to say.

762
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:24,668
Yeah, absolutely.

763
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,388
A real life Westworld.

764
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,448
Yeah, really.

765
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:30,728
I haven't really done the ghost town alive experience.

766
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:35,128
I love it, I went last year a couple times to Knotts

767
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:37,008
and I hadn't been in forever.

768
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,268
And I was very impressed by Knotts.

769
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:41,488
I was like, oh, the ghost town is amazing.

770
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:45,248
I just love the way that it operates all day

771
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:47,928
and then they were printing the newspaper every hour

772
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:50,968
and I was like, print is alive here, let's all move here.

773
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:52,408
This is amazing.

774
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:52,828
Do they print?

775
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,528
Yeah, they have, one of the things they have

776
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,148
is like somebody who's the publisher

777
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,868
and every hour they print up the ghost town gazette

778
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:03,808
that's like, this guy accused this guy of something

779
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,388
and then all day there's the interactive play

780
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:07,548
with all the people.

781
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,788
That's their new thing in ghost town.

782
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:12,208
Can you as a guest end up in the newspaper?

783
00:27:12,928 --> 00:27:13,708
I don't know.

784
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,168
I don't know if you can participate in the story,

785
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,568
but I feel like maybe there were some kids

786
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,328
that got to be a gunslinger or something.

787
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,608
Yeah, oh shit, maybe there's interchangeable elements.

788
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:23,568
I like the old west town

789
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:26,808
and I like the old west rides in Knotsberry Farm

790
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:29,248
and it feels like maybe that is just sort of like

791
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,928
a pre-existing trope of California theme parks

792
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:34,368
is you have your old west ride.

793
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:35,288
Yeah.

794
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,828
I think so, it's pretty in the DNA of it, isn't it?

795
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,708
And that's what I was saying is like,

796
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:41,148
I think Big Thunder advanced,

797
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:44,128
it feels like those great old west rides at Knots,

798
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:47,788
but a higher tech next level version of them.

799
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:48,668
Yeah, for sure.

800
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:53,488
I didn't realize of how much DNA of Disney is at Knots

801
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,288
and it's clear from Frontierland,

802
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,648
you're like, oh, it's just ghost town.

803
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,468
And it's just, that's clearly where they

804
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,608
were thinking about.

805
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:02,368
It was right across the street basically.

806
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:04,888
And Disney and Knots were friends

807
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:08,428
and visited each other's parks and stuff

808
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:10,188
and would comment on stuff.

809
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:11,288
Stole ideas.

810
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:12,068
Sure.

811
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,208
Sure.

812
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:16,548
I mean, the precursor to Big Thunder Mountain,

813
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:19,188
the Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland

814
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:24,008
is very close to the Calico Mine Ride at Knots.

815
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:25,748
Yeah.

816
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:30,928
So that's this area at Disneyland specifically

817
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:34,008
was like, it was an original opening day attraction.

818
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,088
I have to be honest, I don't know a ton about

819
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,408
Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland.

820
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:39,088
That's something I need to do a deep dive on

821
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:41,128
for when we eventually do it.

822
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,968
But it seems like, this seems like an early case

823
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:47,528
of an attraction that is like crucial to the DNA

824
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:49,588
for people who were there in the first five years,

825
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:52,028
that it was just, they hit a wall.

826
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,188
They had to take it out.

827
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:54,588
It didn't have the capacity.

828
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:57,728
It was, and people were probably mad that they took it out

829
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,128
and they had to find a way to do it in such a way.

830
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:02,648
I think there's something, I don't know if it's still there

831
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:04,808
after the Star Wars remodel,

832
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,308
but there was something that was like,

833
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:09,248
there's like a piece of rock work that has a hole in it

834
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,468
that you sort of just see when you're walking around

835
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:12,248
in that area.

836
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:12,988
It's still there.

837
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:15,068
On the other side of the pond,

838
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,468
there's like the tunnel.

839
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,528
There's like a tunnel to nowhere

840
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,548
and that was apparently part of Mine Train

841
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:20,228
Through Nature's Wonderland.

842
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,388
Yeah. Oh, gotcha.

843
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:22,548
But I think that was just like,

844
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:25,088
it was like a more low tech version.

845
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,788
It was like a lot of the stuff that ended up

846
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:30,728
in Big Thunder Mountain that's sort of the nature

847
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,888
aspect of it, of the like, you're in a cavern.

848
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:35,768
And there's colors in the cavern.

849
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:37,248
It's the rainbow cavern. Yeah, the rainbow cavern.

850
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,388
Yeah, slack types.

851
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,668
It's that sort of Disney, it's like nature,

852
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:42,848
but better than nature.

853
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,068
Because we painted it with Dayglow.

854
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,488
We could control this nature.

855
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,368
There were like spinning rocks on the mine train.

856
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,308
Oh, there was like a tipping teetering.

857
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:52,848
There were like rock effects.

858
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,008
Yeah, I love all the things in the park

859
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:57,748
that are like dioramas come to life.

860
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,708
You know, I love Primeval World.

861
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:01,588
Yeah, yeah.

862
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:02,768
We haven't talked about that much.

863
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,688
We were talking on our podcast recently

864
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:07,868
about people who get their ashes scattered in Disneyland.

865
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:08,728
Yes, yeah.

866
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:09,688
Oh, we had a big story about that recently.

867
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:10,628
It's very illegal.

868
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,548
Very illegal, but like such a big problem.

869
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:13,248
It's a lot.

870
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:15,008
And then we were talking about what ride

871
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,248
we would each like to have our ashes scattered in.

872
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:20,508
And my cohost Emily said, Primeval World.

873
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,708
And I was like, that's so indie of you.

874
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,688
Yeah, that is. It's off the beaten path.

875
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:25,888
She was like, where would you do it?

876
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:27,168
I was like, Mr. Toad.

877
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:28,468
Very edgy.

878
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:29,728
That's in hell.

879
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,528
But then I was like, I don't really mean that.

880
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,188
I would totally not do Mr. Toad.

881
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,068
And then I was like, what I would really want

882
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,168
is Big Thunder Mountain.

883
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:37,748
Oh, sure.

884
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:38,268
Where in Big Thunder Mountain?

885
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:39,388
And then I was like, actually,

886
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,908
I would not like to be like scattered in Disneyland.

887
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,328
It's all a hypothetical.

888
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,188
But if I had to.

889
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,868
But do you guys have strong feelings about?

890
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:50,868
About where we would be scattered if we were cremated?

891
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:52,808
I'm trying to think.

892
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,448
Yeah, like it would have to,

893
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:56,948
I would probably try to pick like the indie pick.

894
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,028
Like Primeval is such a good Brian Eno style choice

895
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,308
for talking music.

896
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,228
Oh, Emily would love that you said that.

897
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,428
I will relay that back.

898
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:08,188
I think I've said that on the show before.

899
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:09,628
That's what I know.

900
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:11,868
I compared Toad and Peter Pan.

901
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,228
The underground.

902
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:14,828
That the Toad is the best.

903
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,248
Well, because Toad is, I think,

904
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:18,268
is the more indie choice of between

905
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:19,808
what's the better one, Peter Pan or Toad.

906
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:22,108
But I argue Peter Pan is technically a better ride.

907
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:23,348
Ah, sure.

908
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:24,468
But it's a more mainstream choice.

909
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:25,528
It's a lot longer also.

910
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:26,708
Oh, a lot longer, yeah.

911
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,348
Always gotta weigh it.

912
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,428
And I think that's why.

913
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,648
So you would like to be scattered in Peter Pan,

914
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:31,108
is what you say?

915
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:32,388
That's the mainstream choice.

916
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:34,188
It was my favorite ride as a kid.

917
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,008
Very Michael Jackson-y choice of you two.

918
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:39,848
It was a creepy choice to me.

919
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:40,708
Well, now you say that.

920
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,768
I wanna be scattered in Peter Pan.

921
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,228
And I can live forever.

922
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,888
My ashes will live on the children.

923
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,668
I want you to dump me on Wendy, John,

924
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:50,428
and little Michael in the bedroom

925
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,668
right when you come to the start of it.

926
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:54,648
This podcast just played as evidence

927
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:55,888
in a trial in the near.

928
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,248
Yeah, just dump me on the robots, the kids.

929
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:00,268
Is that what pixie dust is?

930
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:02,048
It's just the ashes of the dead?

931
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:02,568
Yeah.

932
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:05,928
Well, you guys know the creepy thing about Peter Pan.

933
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:07,388
There's like a reading of Peter Pan.

934
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:09,648
And then he's like a psychopomp who comes to kids' windows

935
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:11,708
and tells them to jump out the window and then they die.

936
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:12,508
Well, no.

937
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,048
I am not familiar with this at all.

938
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:14,648
Oh.

939
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:15,668
Go ahead.

940
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:19,228
I think he was like maybe one of J.M. Barrie's kids

941
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,308
died or something.

942
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:23,368
Oh, and the guy who wrote Mr. Toad,

943
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:26,348
his son was like an itinerant drunk

944
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:29,608
who kept getting in car accidents and then died.

945
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:30,628
Oh, man.

946
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:31,688
From like crashing a car.

947
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,288
He might have just written Mr. Toad

948
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:35,048
to try and process like his.

949
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:36,048
Yeah, no, that's a hundred,

950
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:37,968
because I remember looking it up once to be like,

951
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:39,688
what the fuck is this ride about?

952
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,128
Like, because it's, see, that ride also feels like

953
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:46,428
it comes from like British seaside carnivals, you know?

954
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:48,548
Like that's what I like about that ride is it's like,

955
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:50,988
this is in the tradition of like dark rides,

956
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:54,708
earlier era dark rides where you would go to hell

957
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,608
at the end, maybe.

958
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:56,768
You know?

959
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,668
A lesson is taught.

960
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:02,468
But yeah, that is, that's what it's about, supposedly.

961
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:03,168
Interesting.

962
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:06,828
And wasn't J.M. Barrie like a morphine addict or a heroin?

963
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,248
Like he had something.

964
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:11,068
Maybe to process the death of this kid

965
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:13,108
that I don't, I can't prove he.

966
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,608
Mr. Toad, the real Mr. Toad is based

967
00:33:15,608 --> 00:33:17,308
on a teenage delinquent driver.

968
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:20,008
Wow, because I didn't, I was actually just recently

969
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:23,348
going through other, there's like stop motion Mr. Toad.

970
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,668
He was like a rich kid teenage delinquent driver,

971
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:28,328
which is why he could keep buying new like motor cars

972
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:28,908
or whatever.

973
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:31,068
And then I think he died by like lying

974
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,808
on some train tracks or something.

975
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,228
Whoa, like happens to you in the ride.

976
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:35,968
Yeah.

977
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,268
Whoa, that's crazy.

978
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:40,188
Do you know if you, like in all the,

979
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:42,028
I mean I think every iteration of Mr. Toad,

980
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,608
like the crazy driving is a big thing.

981
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,388
And I encourage everyone to go on YouTube

982
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,948
and type in Mr. Toad poop poop.

983
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,528
Because in the stop motion Mr. Toad,

984
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:54,588
and I think in the book too, the thing that he says,

985
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,248
well like it's him imitating the sound of an automobile

986
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,728
is poop poop poop.

987
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,708
And there's a bunch of videos that are called that,

988
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,708
you get to watch a crazy stop motion character drive around

989
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,228
and say poop over and over.

990
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,068
Yeah. It's a delight.

991
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,448
Well he's, those cartoons are great too.

992
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,228
You know the stop motion ones.

993
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:10,648
They're very fun.

994
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:12,668
Or no, not those, I'm talking about just the regular cartoons.

995
00:34:12,788 --> 00:34:13,468
Oh sure, yeah, yeah.

996
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,428
Like we watched this like a year ago and I was like,

997
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:16,908
these are funny. Except for the haunting

998
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:18,788
wind in the willow song.

999
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:20,388
Am I wrong?

1000
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:24,308
Isn't there like a lady singing a scary wind in the willow song?

1001
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:25,208
Maybe. I'm not sure.

1002
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:28,428
Here just to cover where you put in your ashes, Jason.

1003
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,428
Jason, yeah we got to.

1004
00:34:29,728 --> 00:34:30,608
Good question.

1005
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,508
I can go if you need to think.

1006
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:32,748
Yeah go.

1007
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:36,408
I gotta be Star Tours obviously.

1008
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:39,808
And I was trying to think of a place that is not,

1009
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,188
that's out of the way of guests

1010
00:34:41,188 --> 00:34:42,428
and that wouldn't bother anybody.

1011
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:44,388
I, nobody would see this.

1012
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:45,988
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:47,748
I don't want anybody choking on my ashes.

1014
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,628
So I would, nobody would know this was there

1015
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:52,268
but my family would know it was there.

1016
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,528
Cause I love that the Ackbars work at Star Tours

1017
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,588
is up in the top and if one of them had a coffee mug

1018
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:02,408
and my ashes were in them, it was just like his,

1019
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:05,108
one of the Ackbars bitter coffee while you know,

1020
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:06,868
running maintenance on Star Tours that day.

1021
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:09,208
That is a good, very well thought out.

1022
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,768
And that keeps you all together too.

1023
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,988
Usually when you scatter ashes, you go everywhere

1024
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,168
but this will be all concentrated so if,

1025
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:16,208
it'll be all in one cup.

1026
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:18,588
Just for one Ackbar to love.

1027
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:22,348
As long as no maintenance worker ever like picks it up.

1028
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,068
No coffee.

1029
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,508
Yeah, until refurbishment and you get like shop vac'd

1030
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:26,768
cause they forget you're there.

1031
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:27,788
What's this shit?

1032
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,028
What do you got Jason?

1033
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,228
So are we saying just Disneyland?

1034
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,128
Just borderland?

1035
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:33,208
Oh, anywhere in Themed Park.

1036
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,688
Of course you wanna bury your ashes.

1037
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:36,648
Well, anywhere in Themed Park,

1038
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:38,248
it would probably be the scenic waterways

1039
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:39,568
of Universal Orlando.

1040
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:41,528
Wow. Beautiful lush greenery.

1041
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:42,028
Really?

1042
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,128
Great walking paths down there.

1043
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,028
In Disneyland in particular,

1044
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:50,868
I think because it is so sweet and pure,

1045
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,388
the wishing, the snow white wishing well

1046
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,448
off the side of the castle.

1047
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,428
That's a great answer.

1048
00:35:56,628 --> 00:35:58,388
Yeah, again, won't bother anyone.

1049
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,788
They supposedly collect all those dimes

1050
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:01,788
and stuff for charity.

1051
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,768
Oh, you'd go to charity.

1052
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:05,408
Yeah, that's true.

1053
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,768
Your dishes would be fed to it, poor child.

1054
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:08,488
That's beautiful.

1055
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,728
He just wants to be next to money.

1056
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:15,668
I will finally be able to simulate

1057
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:18,368
the Mr. Uncle Scrooge diving into.

1058
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:19,528
The big money bin.

1059
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:22,588
Oh, oh, oh.

1060
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,088
Getting dressed doesn't have to be complicated.

1061
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:26,728
Everlane makes it really simple.

1062
00:36:26,848 --> 00:36:28,428
They go to the best ethical factories,

1063
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,068
produce premium products,

1064
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:31,908
and then sell them directly to you

1065
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:33,428
without traditional markups.

1066
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:36,168
Everlane only makes premium essentials

1067
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:39,168
using the finest materials without traditional markups.

1068
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,388
And they tell you their real costs

1069
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:43,548
so you know you're never overpaying.

1070
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:46,468
Everlane wants you to know what you're paying for and why.

1071
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,668
They're radically transparent about every step

1072
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,668
in their process from the materials they use

1073
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:52,688
to the ethical factories they work with.

1074
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:55,168
Because Everlane sells directly to you,

1075
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:57,388
their prices are 30 to 50% lower

1076
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:58,808
than traditional retailers.

1077
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,808
Everlane's clothes look better,

1078
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,488
cost less, and last longer.

1079
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:04,728
Essentials like their Cotton Crew T-shirt

1080
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,128
are exactly what they should be.

1081
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:09,128
Simple, stylish, and made from quality materials.

1082
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,688
Some things I like at Everlane include the cashmere crew,

1083
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:15,188
the Air Oxford, and the vinyl Weekender bag.

1084
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,168
Everlane's timeless essentials

1085
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,588
are just what you're looking for.

1086
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,208
No frills, just quality.

00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:32,628
Everlane.com slash theme park.

1092
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:35,168
Eee, eee, eee.

1093
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,868
Are you guys Uncle Scrooge heads?

1094
00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:40,108
I mean, I wouldn't, that's a bull.

1095
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:41,628
I wouldn't say that, but I really.

1096
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:42,908
Now that you've issued the challenge,

1097
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:43,908
how do I become one? I love Uncle Scrooge.

1098
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:45,288
I love those comics.

1099
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,428
There's like all the good 50s adventure comics.

1100
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:47,888
Oh, sure.

1101
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:48,988
That's a blind spot for me.

1102
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,088
I know people like those comics.

1103
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,968
A lot of them were ripped off for Indiana Jones movies,

1104
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:55,268
like Frame for Frame in the second one.

1105
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:58,468
And the Budget Duck Tales movie is very Indiana Jones-ish.

1106
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:01,128
I need to get all those collections, but anyway.

1107
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,628
Yeah, those are beautiful collections.

1108
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:03,808
Is it Banks or?

1109
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:04,808
Carl Barks.

1110
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:05,868
Carl Barks, yeah.

1111
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,028
Yeah, I have one or the two of the Donald Duck ones.

1112
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,968
Funny you mentioned Indiana Jones

1113
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:14,468
because I read somewhere that the sound effects

1114
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:17,228
from Big Thunder Mountain were repurposed.

1115
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:18,088
That makes sense.

1116
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:20,428
For the mine cart in Temple of Doom,

1117
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:21,768
like the mine cart scene.

1118
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,068
That totally makes sense.

1119
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:26,888
Yeah, back to the ride that we're gonna talk about.

1120
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:29,448
Yeah, I think it's just,

1121
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:31,108
it's one of the best rides in the park.

1122
00:38:31,148 --> 00:38:32,868
You get the best view of everything.

1123
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,568
Recently, if you do it at night, especially,

1124
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,628
it's like such a great ride to do at night.

1125
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:38,128
Yes.

1126
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:41,388
Because you're outside for like a large portion of it.

1127
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:43,248
But then you're also in some things.

1128
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:46,268
Right, have you ever gotten on the ride at night

1129
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:49,128
and had the fireworks been happening concurrently?

1130
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,068
Only once and it was the most amazing thing in the world.

1131
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:54,708
Yeah, it felt like the end of Mario Kart.

1132
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,168
Oh yeah, very good point.

1133
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:58,948
And then I really enjoyed doing it recently

1134
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:01,748
because you could see the Star Wars land construction

1135
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:02,908
from the top.

1136
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:05,168
The last time I did it, that was happening

1137
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,388
and I was like, this is great.

1138
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,068
You can see the construction.

1139
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:10,748
And the fireworks light it up so you can see it a lot,

1140
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,928
it wouldn't be lit so well otherwise.

1141
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,728
Yeah, Mike and I were heading down to Comic-Con

1142
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,828
and we did that and timed it exactly right

1143
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,408
and going around the big curve.

1144
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:21,228
You're so right about Mario Kart.

1145
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:24,068
I was coming back from Orange County not that long ago

1146
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,988
and I was like, ooh, are we gonna pass Disneyland

1147
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,108
during the fireworks show?

1148
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:29,048
And we did and I was so happy.

1149
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:29,848
That's great.

1150
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:30,368
Yeah, yeah.

1151
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,948
You can be right there on the five.

1152
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:35,608
I think that's a big thing to say.

1153
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,148
But a lot of what I love about this ride

1154
00:39:37,148 --> 00:39:39,688
is not this detail or that detail.

1155
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,328
It's just the basics of the experience

1156
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:44,928
and one of them for sure is that it's great at night.

1157
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:46,368
And I think that's a thing that you,

1158
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:48,508
not to be all fuddy-duddy about the screen rides,

1159
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,208
but it's definitely why you need a mix

1160
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,888
because it's so fun that Matterhorn is different

1161
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:55,028
in the day and the night

1162
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:56,588
and Big Thunder's different in the day and the night

1163
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:59,428
as the park in general can be.

1164
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,968
They really are different experiences

1165
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:04,168
and it's so, I was there last night in fact,

1166
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:05,468
if you can believe it.

1167
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:09,188
And just walking around through those little lanterns,

1168
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:10,588
there's like the dim lighting there.

1169
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:13,528
It's wonderful and sparkly and magical.

1170
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,928
It's great and it's interesting

1171
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:16,888
because I wonder how it'll change

1172
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:20,488
with the new passage to Star Wars land being there

1173
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:23,308
because I went there, the last time I went there,

1174
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,648
it was like they had just finished rebuilding

1175
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:27,548
that walkway around there.

1176
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,428
To Fantasyland.

1177
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:30,788
Yeah and it like, it blew my mind

1178
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:32,228
because it was like having a dream

1179
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:34,068
where you like go somewhere you've been before

1180
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:34,888
but it's different.

1181
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:36,928
You know, I was like, this is so weird.

1182
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:37,728
Like this wasn't here before.

1183
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:38,848
They did a great job on it.

1184
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:41,748
But will it be just destroyed

1185
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:44,828
when it's filled with people like snaking around?

1186
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:45,968
Yeah.

1187
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,108
Disneyland, it's gonna get a little bad

1188
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:51,148
and maybe that's a question for everybody here.

1189
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,208
Do you avoid it for a little bit

1190
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,228
or do you just, I'm going all summer.

1191
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:56,648
I don't care, I'm fighting through it.

1192
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,108
Scott, answer the question for me.

1193
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:58,348
I know, I know.

1194
00:40:58,348 --> 00:40:59,088
What am I gonna say?

1195
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:02,128
Molly, how do you cope with Star Wars?

1196
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,588
I haven't been in a while.

1197
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:06,988
I would like to go.

1198
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:10,108
I would probably try to go before Star Wars land happens

1199
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,828
because I'm not that interested in it

1200
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,588
and I know it's gonna be such a shit show

1201
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:14,588
when it gets going.

1202
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:15,388
Probably smart.

1203
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:18,628
See the place intact before all hell breaks loose.

1204
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,348
Jason, is that where your head's at too?

1205
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:21,068
Or do you like?

1206
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:22,868
I'm not sure.

1207
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:28,048
I mean, look, truthfully, I would love to go down

1208
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:29,748
for some sort of press event

1209
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:32,168
but as we've been told by multiple sources.

1210
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:33,008
Get your head out of the clouds.

1211
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,348
Don't press your luck, Jason.

1212
00:41:34,348 --> 00:41:38,468
It's hard to get press passes for Disney stuff.

1213
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,948
Yeah, you know where you can get press passes to though?

1214
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:41,828
Knott's Berry Farm.

1215
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:42,768
Knott's Berry Farm.

1216
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,728
We did it.

1217
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:44,408
We did it.

1218
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:47,088
That's how I went to Knott's Berry Farm twice last year.

1219
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:47,828
Oh really?

1220
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,268
It was a press affiliate?

1221
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:50,368
Yeah, we went once.

1222
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:53,228
I went once because my boyfriend was writing about,

1223
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:54,328
I think, Ghost Town Alive

1224
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:57,348
and then I went to meet Elvira.

1225
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,408
Oh nice.

1226
00:41:58,508 --> 00:41:59,728
Whoa, how'd that go?

1227
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,748
Oh, it was amazing

1228
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:02,468
and I'd never been to Scary Farm before

1229
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:03,888
because I'd always been too scared.

1230
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,408
My whole life too.

1231
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:07,848
Even though it was the number one group date destination

1232
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,628
for all the kids.

1233
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:10,488
Sure. Really?

1234
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:12,348
Oh yeah, spooky.

1235
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:14,248
You can go there underage.

1236
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,188
Many of the theme park things we talk about

1237
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:18,328
involve being able to go there underage.

1238
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:21,968
But it was great.

1239
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:22,908
I loved it.

1240
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:24,208
I didn't do any of the mazes.

1241
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:26,428
We just walked through the scare zones

1242
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:27,948
and saw the Elvira show

1243
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,908
but I liked the scare zones way more

1244
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:31,348
than I thought I was going to,

1245
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:33,568
especially because I'd just been to the park before

1246
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:37,688
so I was like, the ghost town is now a spooky ghost town.

1247
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,228
This is great.

1248
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:42,588
That seemed to be the most immersive zone

1249
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:45,388
from what we could tell from trying to enter

1250
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:47,388
and leave as fast as humanly possible.

1251
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:48,248
Just the amount of work

1252
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:49,708
that people put into their characters,

1253
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:50,768
that was very charmed.

1254
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,448
Oh yeah, you can tell

1255
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,808
that they all probably have a backstory

1256
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:56,448
if you were to be able to ask them.

1257
00:42:56,668 --> 00:42:57,868
Yeah, you could.

1258
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:00,488
Right, I don't know if they're allowed to talk about it.

1259
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:04,208
We were backstage and we could have asked some of them,

1260
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,248
we should have done that next time.

1261
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:07,888
Well, I don't think we knew the level of detail.

1262
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:09,208
I watched that documentary,

1263
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:10,448
I think it's called Haunters.

1264
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:11,928
There's a few different documentaries

1265
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:14,468
about people that are obsessed with doing stuff like that

1266
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,228
and one of them was about this woman

1267
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:19,328
who works every year at Knott's Scary Farm

1268
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:21,628
as a scare actor

1269
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:26,368
and a lot of them were Halloween widowers basically.

1270
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:28,408
A lot of people had partners who were like,

1271
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:31,568
I just have to let them go for those that month.

1272
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:34,428
They're doing their thing.

1273
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,828
But one of the big things was that people would attack you

1274
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:38,788
when you're a scare actor,

1275
00:43:38,888 --> 00:43:40,328
they'll punch you accidentally

1276
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:42,208
and so her husband was like,

1277
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:45,608
I just want her to get out of the being on the front lines

1278
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:49,508
and now she works as an actor in the mazes

1279
00:43:49,508 --> 00:43:51,668
where she's not one of the people jumping out.

1280
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:55,348
She plays the scary teacher in the maze or whatever

1281
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:57,388
and her husband was like, thank God.

1282
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:00,028
Now I don't have to worry about her getting punched

1283
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:01,048
in the face at work.

1284
00:44:01,048 --> 00:44:03,088
Because that would happen regularly.

1285
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,928
Because it happens regularly to people.

1286
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:06,508
They have the, cause we talked about it,

1287
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:09,228
they have a technique where they come at you from the side

1288
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:12,068
but still I imagine some people just, their arms flail.

1289
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:13,068
For sure, elbow.

1290
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:13,708
Yeah.

1291
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:17,288
A coworker of mine told me he did a very low-fi one

1292
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,588
that was like a corn maze

1293
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,428
and first guy who jumped out,

1294
00:44:20,428 --> 00:44:22,848
he just straight up punched him right in the face.

1295
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:25,508
It's like pure reflex immediately,

1296
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:27,548
like sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, sorry.

1297
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:28,808
Just a reflex.

1298
00:44:29,288 --> 00:44:31,568
Can't punch Mickey or you will get.

1299
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:32,808
Yeah, you're right.

1300
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:33,608
Bored from America.

1301
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:35,028
You'll get kicked out of the country.

1302
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:38,268
Well that's what they said, the universal people said,

1303
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:41,268
is like they have figured that if you don't block

1304
00:44:41,268 --> 00:44:44,648
someone's path, they'll be frightened but less frightened.

1305
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:48,348
Like a lizard brain instinct kicks over,

1306
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:52,648
kicks in if you cannot proceed forward.

1307
00:44:52,988 --> 00:44:55,868
But what I found unnerving going through the one maze,

1308
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:58,448
I mustered up the courage to do it nots,

1309
00:44:58,788 --> 00:45:02,068
was that when they started scaring the people behind me,

1310
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:05,088
then I would just see something in the periphery moving.

1311
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:07,868
Once you start to get in the scare mode,

1312
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:10,528
then just you see things in the periphery constantly.

1313
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:13,608
Because like I did six or seven of the mazes

1314
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:14,508
and now that I'm a big.

1315
00:45:14,508 --> 00:45:15,708
Which Mike is very proud of.

1316
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:16,588
Now that you're a big boy.

1317
00:45:16,808 --> 00:45:18,668
Now that I'm a big haunt fan and a big boy,

1318
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:21,488
yeah, you start to kind of get the rhythms of all of it

1319
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,588
and it's still like, it's not like totally fun

1320
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,088
for someone to like surprise you.

1321
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,908
But it's a lot, your brain kind of goes, okay, all right.

1322
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:30,588
It's like, I don't know, you figure it out.

1323
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,228
You realize they're not gonna stab you for real.

1324
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,808
Yeah, I think that's really, you just need like 20,

1325
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:37,048
for it to happen 20 times and you did not get stabbed.

1326
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:39,208
Maybe that's bad conditioning though,

1327
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:41,428
in case anyone ever does try to stab you.

1328
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,628
And you're like, oh no, no, I've seen this.

1329
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:43,928
I know, I'm sorry.

1330
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:46,708
Like if I was attacked outside of nots.

1331
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:46,948
Yeah.

1332
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:48,228
By just an assailant.

1333
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:49,928
Michael Myers was waiting.

1334
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:51,108
And I didn't react at all.

1335
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:55,108
Well, you were recently tracked by a wolf or a coyote.

1336
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,468
That was before.

1337
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:57,548
Oh, that was before.

1338
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:00,228
Yeah, well that was a very serious incident

1339
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:02,128
where my dog almost got eaten by a coyote.

1340
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:02,568
Yeah.

1341
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,088
I don't think your scare training

1342
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:06,408
would affect that in any way.

1343
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:07,568
No, I would be like.

1344
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:08,108
It would be equally as bad.

1345
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:11,368
Like don't worry, he's just gonna come at you from the side

1346
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,428
and he's not gonna do anything bad.

1347
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,708
They tell him you can't actually eat an animal.

1348
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:17,308
Yeah.

1349
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:19,948
Have you guys done the Rivers of America,

1350
00:46:19,948 --> 00:46:21,928
like the Mark Twain thing where you take the boat

1351
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:23,288
around the whole river?

1352
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:24,328
Yeah, oh yeah.

1353
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:24,928
Yeah?

1354
00:46:25,328 --> 00:46:26,508
Not as an episode.

1355
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:27,588
Oh, I get it.

1356
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:28,168
But I ride it a lot.

1357
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:29,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1358
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:31,168
That was shut off for a long time, I feel like,

1359
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:32,268
because of Star Wars Land.

1360
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:33,248
I feel like.

1361
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,188
Yeah, they were rerouting it.

1362
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,368
Because I feel like, okay, so the old Westland

1363
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:40,068
originally had a very politically incorrect

1364
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:43,188
Native American village component of it.

1365
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:43,628
Oh, yes, yeah.

1366
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:44,768
Where Critter Country is today.

1367
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,328
That they moved onto the Rivers of America.

1368
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,388
They didn't just get rid of it.

1369
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:51,328
Because they never get rid of things in Disneyland,

1370
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:52,688
they just repurpose them.

1371
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:53,208
Yeah.

1372
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:56,648
They were like, we'll just put it on over here,

1373
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,108
and update it a little bit so it's not as racist.

1374
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:02,608
But that's back when they had real Native American people

1375
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:03,348
in the park.

1376
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:03,748
Right.

1377
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,528
Legit doing ceremonies and stuff.

1378
00:47:06,548 --> 00:47:09,268
And you could ride a stagecoach or pack mules,

1379
00:47:09,508 --> 00:47:12,428
which I recently found out that pack mules were ornery.

1380
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:15,048
They did not like the guests.

1381
00:47:15,188 --> 00:47:16,248
Mules are ornery.

1382
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:17,768
Yeah, mules are not nice.

1383
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,388
They'll spit at you?

1384
00:47:18,388 --> 00:47:21,108
Yeah, they would spit at people, they would nip at people.

1385
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,568
Like children riding pack mules.

1386
00:47:23,688 --> 00:47:25,088
I'm sure they kicked, yeah.

1387
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:26,568
You would have loved the pack mules.

1388
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:28,368
Because Jason's favorite were the goats

1389
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:30,348
that used to be down in the ranch area.

1390
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,108
I love the goats.

1391
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:31,928
I was gonna bring those up earlier

1392
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:35,828
when you were talking about getting the nipple milk

1393
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:37,948
from the creature in Star Wars Land.

1394
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,708
And I was like, they used to have goats.

1395
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:41,628
You could do actual milking.

1396
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:42,868
You could milk those if you wanted to.

1397
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:44,588
They had nipples.

1398
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,968
I loved that area too.

1399
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:47,908
Yeah, I like all the things

1400
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,868
where there's some real nature in the park.

1401
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:51,348
The baby ducks.

1402
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:53,988
Did you ever, well, no, you didn't go to Disney World.

1403
00:47:54,008 --> 00:47:57,388
Do you know that there was a cow in the Magic Kingdom

1404
00:47:57,388 --> 00:48:00,268
called Mini Moo that had a Mickey

1405
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:04,488
that they say was just naturally born with a Mickey ear.

1406
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:05,028
Oh, sure, naturally.

1407
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:06,108
Yeah, yeah.

1408
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:09,008
So they bought her and put her in the park.

1409
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:11,328
I mean, one of the things I find fascinating

1410
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:13,308
about Disney World is how it's like

1411
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,128
it's a Jurassic Park aspect of it.

1412
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:18,088
It's like surrounded by alligators.

1413
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:18,628
Yeah.

1414
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:22,688
And in fact, when they drained the rivers of America

1415
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,768
to put in Big Thunder Mountain,

1416
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:29,948
because Big Thunder isn't kind of a different place.

1417
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:31,988
It's situated differently in all the Magic Kingdoms.

1418
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:32,588
They have Big Thunder in Disney World?

1419
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:33,528
They do, yeah.

1420
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:35,868
And it's more to the left of the rivers.

1421
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:37,788
It's like right alongside the rivers of America.

1422
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,868
So they had to drain it.

1423
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:41,808
And they also had to move the track of the riverboat

1424
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:44,608
so that it wouldn't scrape the edge

1425
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:46,008
of where they were putting Big Thunder.

1426
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,308
And when they drained the rivers of America in Florida,

1427
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:52,468
they found giant snakes and alligators.

1428
00:48:52,468 --> 00:48:52,948
Oh, of course.

1429
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:56,328
Living in there that had snuck in, I guess.

1430
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:58,228
I mean, you're in a swamp.

1431
00:48:58,328 --> 00:48:59,348
Yeah, yeah.

1432
00:48:59,548 --> 00:48:59,868
They're gonna.

1433
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,648
There was an amusement park in New Orleans.

1434
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,848
My boyfriend's from New Orleans.

1435
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,888
And there's this amusement park called Jazzland

1436
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:08,508
that I think then became a Six Flags.

1437
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:10,768
And we drove out there

1438
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:12,828
because they were shooting Jurassic World there,

1439
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,768
my friend had told me.

1440
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:16,188
So we just drove out to look at it.

1441
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,188
And it was just a theme park

1442
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,908
that had been just ravaged by Katrina

1443
00:49:19,908 --> 00:49:22,028
and kind of gone back to nature.

1444
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,168
And it was just totally in a swamp.

1445
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:26,408
And you couldn't go on the land

1446
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:28,288
because there were alligators and snakes everywhere.

1447
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:32,508
But they had somehow shot part of Jurassic World using it.

1448
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:36,768
And then my boyfriend's little cousin was like,

1449
00:49:36,788 --> 00:49:39,088
oh yeah, yeah, me and my friends snuck in there

1450
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:41,088
and climbed the roller coaster.

1451
00:49:41,788 --> 00:49:42,708
Whoa, really?

1452
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:44,568
Yeah, like nothing bad happened.

1453
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:45,348
Right.

1454
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:46,008
You know.

1455
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:48,428
If you got to the top of a roller coaster

1456
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:50,668
and then got bit by an alligator

1457
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:53,228
and then it made you fall off the roller coaster,

1458
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:55,228
that's a scary series of events.

1459
00:49:56,968 --> 00:49:57,428
Well, I know.

1460
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:00,148
Yes, that very complicated series of events is scary.

1461
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:02,788
You get to your last hand up at the top

1462
00:50:02,788 --> 00:50:05,648
and then like crunch, munch, and then you fall.

1463
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:09,068
Aren't there supposedly leeches in the Jungle Cruise?

1464
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:09,848
Real leeches.

1465
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:10,548
Oh, what?

1466
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:11,668
I have never heard that.

1467
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:14,088
I've heard that there are real leeches in the Jungle Cruise.

1468
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:15,168
Why is that?

1469
00:50:15,428 --> 00:50:19,808
I've heard there's an island in Bay Lake in Florida,

1470
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:23,668
sort of the main body water by the Magic Kingdom.

1471
00:50:24,228 --> 00:50:27,008
And that has just kind of gone back to nature.

1472
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:29,328
Oh, I read a thing about that too.

1473
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:30,748
That's the thing that used to be like

1474
00:50:30,748 --> 00:50:32,188
Island of Adventure or something.

1475
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:34,768
Yeah, there was a lot of birds and exotic animals.

1476
00:50:35,028 --> 00:50:37,988
Right, and then there were these urban explorers

1477
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:40,048
who swam out to it.

1478
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:41,608
Swam or used a rowboat.

1479
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,688
They swam and they made it there and back

1480
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,088
and then later found out that the whole thing

1481
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,548
was full of snakes and alligators

1482
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:50,308
and swimming was the worst thing

1483
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:51,388
they could have possibly done.

1484
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,648
But they made it there and then they took photographs

1485
00:50:53,648 --> 00:50:57,088
on the island and it just is so Jurassic Park

1486
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,748
because it's like a Disney animal park

1487
00:50:59,748 --> 00:51:01,388
that the structures are overgrown.

1488
00:51:01,488 --> 00:51:02,668
I feel like they might have turned it

1489
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:04,008
into something else by now.

1490
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:05,888
No, it's still ending.

1491
00:51:06,388 --> 00:51:06,648
It's still.

1492
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:07,688
We're talking river?

1493
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:09,768
Discovery Island.

1494
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:11,768
But river country's a similar thing too.

1495
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:14,188
Yeah, urban explorers love sneaking in there.

1496
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:17,088
That is what's so weird about Disney World

1497
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:18,608
that there's enough land there

1498
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,608
that you could just forget about things.

1499
00:51:21,088 --> 00:51:21,208
For sure.

1500
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,048
And foreclose things.

1501
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:24,268
And that there's just alligators everywhere

1502
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:25,928
in the things you forgot about.

1503
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:27,768
Yeah, which people didn't really,

1504
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,248
I mean you'd see them in the water

1505
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:34,068
off the side of the road sometimes for many years

1506
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:37,368
but until that incident where that poor child got eaten,

1507
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:42,848
the early travel brochures and stuff for Disney World

1508
00:51:42,848 --> 00:51:45,648
were like stay at these hotels with beaches.

1509
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:46,828
Swim in this lake.

1510
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:47,748
Go swimming.

1511
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:48,948
Go in the water.

1512
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:50,768
Just filled with animals.

1513
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,448
It is because when we built the lakes,

1514
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:54,308
because they're manmade,

1515
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:56,048
there weren't any alligators in there.

1516
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:56,808
Right, right, right.

1517
00:51:56,908 --> 00:51:59,068
We just happened to build them in Florida

1518
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:01,668
where there's alligators everywhere.

1519
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:03,408
It's almost like life finds a way.

1520
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:09,428
Well thank God there's only imaginary critters

1521
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:11,648
running around Big Thunder Mountain.

1522
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:14,048
So much, I didn't realize some of them

1523
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,048
were part of the Mind, Train Through Nature's one.

1524
00:52:18,088 --> 00:52:19,328
A lot of them are repurposed,

1525
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:21,708
which I guess is a Tony Baxter staple

1526
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,748
between Big Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain,

1527
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,448
the repurposing of critters.

1528
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:27,608
Have you guys done a Splash Mountain episode yet?

1529
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:28,628
Yeah. We did, yes.

1530
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:30,148
Yeah, I mean that,

1531
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,808
finding out that those were all repurposed

1532
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:32,708
from other things.

1533
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:35,468
Sort of almost made it make more sense.

1534
00:52:36,128 --> 00:52:36,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1535
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:38,508
How is this so expansive?

1536
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:40,068
How are there so many of these around?

1537
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:41,348
Well this is an interesting,

1538
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,868
it's the same players involved in the history of this ride

1539
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:48,608
where the ride was eventually done by Tony Baxter,

1540
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,948
our hero who we had in our live show

1541
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:52,688
and are still gushing about meeting.

1542
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:56,808
All coming from seeds of ideas

1543
00:52:56,808 --> 00:52:58,688
from an older engineer, Mark Davis,

1544
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,368
who designed all of those animatronics

1545
00:53:01,368 --> 00:53:03,488
for the thing, the show America Sings.

1546
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,928
And this is a similar situation

1547
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:07,408
where it's Tony Baxter achieving

1548
00:53:07,408 --> 00:53:09,888
what was at its core, Mark Davis' idea.

1549
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:12,748
He wanted to do this ride called Western River Expedition.

1550
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:15,488
And I don't know a ton about Western River Expedition

1551
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:18,888
except that basically it was like Pirates,

1552
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:21,188
but a boat ride where you do,

1553
00:53:21,288 --> 00:53:23,308
you sink and you go and see,

1554
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:26,048
you go see cowboy old west scenes.

1555
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:26,748
Wasn't there like,

1556
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:29,348
they were gonna do something besides Pirates

1557
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:31,208
for Disney World and then everybody was like,

1558
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,448
no, no, give us Pirates.

1559
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:33,168
That's this.

1560
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:33,668
Yeah.

1561
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,368
They were like, they've already got Pirates in Florida.

1562
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:37,868
They want cowboys.

1563
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:40,868
And people were mad when they went to Disney World

1564
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:42,028
and were like, where are the Pirates?

1565
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,948
We want the things from over there.

1566
00:53:44,128 --> 00:53:44,768
So yeah, then they.

1567
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:45,908
They rushed it in.

1568
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:47,528
Pirates was open in 73,

1569
00:53:47,548 --> 00:53:51,048
two years after Magic Kingdom opened in general.

1570
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:54,228
And they had, I think they were probably trying

1571
00:53:54,228 --> 00:53:55,708
to figure out a way to do all of it.

1572
00:53:55,768 --> 00:53:57,588
Well, can we also do Western River Expedition?

1573
00:53:57,688 --> 00:53:59,468
But by then, another problem too,

1574
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,868
which is there's no roller coaster.

1575
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:03,748
And Space Mountain had been fast tracked.

1576
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:05,408
Pirates cost a lot of money.

1577
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:07,128
Space Mountain cost a lot of money.

1578
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:09,308
It became clear we are not gonna be able to do

1579
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:14,108
this expansive multi-ride Western River Expedition area.

1580
00:54:14,328 --> 00:54:15,508
Yeah, so we have to find a way.

1581
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:17,408
That was supposed to be like a mini land almost.

1582
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,748
So it was gonna be more than just the one.

1583
00:54:19,748 --> 00:54:21,948
Do you think any of those things ended up

1584
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:24,768
in California Adventure and like the national park part?

1585
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:26,528
I don't think so.

1586
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:30,468
Seeds of some of the ideas seem to be elsewhere.

1587
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,628
Because I love Grizzly Falls, I was gonna say,

1588
00:54:32,808 --> 00:54:34,908
which feels like the California Adventure

1589
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:37,208
corollary to Big Thunder Mountain.

1590
00:54:37,488 --> 00:54:39,448
It's like the same ride, but as a water ride.

1591
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:40,988
Yeah, that's true.

1592
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:41,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1593
00:54:42,008 --> 00:54:43,708
I don't know if there's anything like directly from,

1594
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:45,888
I know that like the, in France,

1595
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,528
there's a lot of frontier land is kind of

1596
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:52,068
loosely called Thunder Mesa, which this thing,

1597
00:54:52,148 --> 00:54:55,828
that's like a term from this Western River Expedition thing.

1598
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:57,748
So that's what you find with a lot of like rides

1599
00:54:57,748 --> 00:55:00,568
that don't get built is elements of them fall

1600
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:04,808
into other things, but like not exactly as envisioned.

1601
00:55:04,808 --> 00:55:07,128
Do you guys have a favorite like unbuilt ride?

1602
00:55:07,428 --> 00:55:08,028
Yeah.

1603
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:11,128
There's a lot of those.

1604
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:16,028
I mean, I really, just because of the spectacle

1605
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:19,528
of the story of the movie and what,

1606
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:21,828
like that it could still be there today,

1607
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:24,628
the unbuilt Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers

1608
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,168
based on the Warren Beatty movie.

1609
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:29,228
I was just talking about Dick Tracy yesterday.

1610
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:33,288
You would have been in like a police car with a gun,

1611
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,928
zooming around, shooting a criminal.

1612
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:40,388
So like, and I'm sure the gun part would have been

1613
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:44,448
taken out or downplayed or something as the years went on.

1614
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:46,828
I think they would have just painted the gun yellow.

1615
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:48,628
It would have been fine.

1616
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:50,108
It would be like the Buzz Lightyear.

1617
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:51,028
Yeah.

1618
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:53,328
Yeah, yeah, or it would have been more cartoon,

1619
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:54,948
but they're probably, I mean,

1620
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:58,648
if they had built that and then eventually like closed it,

1621
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,568
there would, we would be reading articles about like,

1622
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:04,648
how dare they remove Dick Tracy's Crime Stopper.

1623
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:06,468
Anytime something is closed or changed,

1624
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:08,988
there's always the outcry of how dare they.

1625
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:12,608
Well, mine is in Westcott.

1626
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,108
It's that boat ride in Westcott,

1627
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:16,628
which was the Epcot of the West that never got built.

1628
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:18,528
And it was like a 45 minute boat ride

1629
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:20,028
that you could get off at multiple places

1630
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,308
and it had so many robots and so many like drops.

1631
00:56:22,308 --> 00:56:22,988
So many robots.

1632
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:24,008
So many robots.

1633
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:26,208
That's what Tony Baxter says at least.

1634
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,328
So.

1635
00:56:27,648 --> 00:56:28,268
I don't even know.

1636
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,628
I don't know if this, if this had been built,

1637
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:32,568
would it be my favorite thing?

1638
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,288
Maybe not.

1639
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,288
It might not have even been that great,

1640
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:38,148
but the name haunts me forever.

1641
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,088
It's so intriguing.

1642
00:56:39,428 --> 00:56:41,168
What almost replaced America Sings,

1643
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:43,188
Plekto's Intergalactic Review.

1644
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,728
I'm not forgetting a word.

1645
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,428
Yeah, what was that?

1646
00:56:46,688 --> 00:56:48,788
I'm not sure, but there was some like

1647
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,848
alien country bears equivalent.

1648
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:51,688
Oh wow.

1649
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,848
At least the name Plekto I love.

1650
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:56,268
The embarrassing stuff they'd like us to forget.

1651
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:57,188
That's what.

1652
00:56:57,228 --> 00:56:59,508
Plekto's fantastic intergalactic review.

1653
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:01,968
Everything involving that stage in Tomorrowland

1654
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:05,008
that lowers and comes out.

1655
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:05,568
Oh yeah.

1656
00:57:05,608 --> 00:57:06,388
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1657
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:07,008
Yeah.

1658
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:08,368
Still going strong.

1659
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:09,048
Recently.

1660
00:57:09,288 --> 00:57:09,608
Going strong.

1661
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,848
We walked by and the characters from the dog

1662
00:57:12,848 --> 00:57:14,428
and the child from Up were there

1663
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:16,608
and they were dancing to Gangnam Style.

1664
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:20,228
Or no, it was who let the dogs out.

1665
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:23,728
And then the kid from Up pointed at himself, like me.

1666
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:25,608
I don't think it was Gangnam Style.

1667
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:27,368
Didn't it switch to Gangnam Style?

1668
00:57:27,388 --> 00:57:28,288
I think you're imagining.

1669
00:57:28,548 --> 00:57:28,848
I don't know.

1670
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:29,268
I think you're.

1671
00:57:29,288 --> 00:57:30,268
I wouldn't put it past him.

1672
00:57:30,628 --> 00:57:33,188
But I think he hears Gangnam Style wherever he goes.

1673
00:57:34,328 --> 00:57:35,348
He sees people dancing.

1674
00:57:35,728 --> 00:57:37,248
Yeah, I think it was who let the dogs out.

1675
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,668
It was who let the dogs out

1676
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:40,568
and then I think it switched, didn't it?

1677
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:42,448
I could absolutely see.

1678
00:57:42,788 --> 00:57:43,828
There's no way of knowing.

1679
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:46,248
But yes, Jason Notorious Psyhead.

1680
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,748
Yeah, he loves Psy.

1681
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:51,448
Are you aware of any stuff that almost got built

1682
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:53,468
or anything that you've heard rumors of?

1683
00:57:53,468 --> 00:57:54,788
Now that I ask that question,

1684
00:57:55,048 --> 00:57:58,048
I have no, I can't think of anything actually.

1685
00:57:58,268 --> 00:57:59,248
Oh no, I don't, yeah.

1686
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:02,848
But I just have always felt like they should have built

1687
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:06,108
more dark rides around Beauty and the Beast.

1688
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:07,688
When they built the Little Mermaid ride,

1689
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:11,468
I was like, good idea, but many years too late

1690
00:58:11,468 --> 00:58:12,428
to capitalize on this.

1691
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:16,288
But I'm like, why don't they have the Frozen ride

1692
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:20,008
in Disney World now that replaced the beloved.

1693
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:21,908
Malfurion.

1694
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,988
Which also seemed cool because it's like Pirates of the Vikings

1695
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:27,028
which I was like, yeah, yeah, more pirates.

1696
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:27,928
It's so good.

1697
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:31,748
We've really not done a full service to Maelstrom

1698
00:58:31,748 --> 00:58:34,328
and we will, that's such a big one.

1699
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:35,168
Oh yeah, yeah.

1700
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:37,268
It's in my top five potentially.

1701
00:58:37,508 --> 00:58:38,708
I love the Maelstrom.

1702
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:39,628
Maelstrom's in five?

1703
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:42,788
Maybe not, it's not on paper a greatest, but favorite.

1704
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:43,328
In five?

1705
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:47,388
Because I loved it and a lot of, this reminds me,

1706
00:58:47,488 --> 00:58:51,408
Molly, you wrote an article recently about older millennials.

1707
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:56,328
And I was thinking about that in theme park terms

1708
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:00,528
because as I was reading it, you had a lot of details

1709
00:59:00,528 --> 00:59:03,368
in there that I very much related to of,

1710
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:06,448
what was the phrase, too young for Nirvana,

1711
00:59:06,548 --> 00:59:08,548
too old for the Strokes.

1712
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:10,268
Ha, it's not where I land, yeah.

1713
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:14,808
Which I almost landed, but I was a junior in high school

1714
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:16,988
when that album came out and I was really into the Strokes.

1715
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:21,388
But I very much related to too young.

1716
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:26,968
For Nirvana, but I was thinking about the older millennials,

1717
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:32,388
the divide, do young millennials, did something like Maelstrom

1718
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:35,568
hit for them and do young millennials know

1719
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:36,788
who Michael Eisner is?

1720
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:38,188
Like do they give a shit?

1721
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:40,688
That was like our era of Disney for sure.

1722
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,908
I feel like the big ones that opened,

1723
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:45,608
like Splash Mountain is what I remember being,

1724
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,008
the event, there's a new ride is opening at Disneyland.

1725
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:51,948
With all the specials and promotion

1726
00:59:51,948 --> 00:59:53,388
in the way that could possibly be.

1727
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:56,068
Then it broke down all the time when it first opened.

1728
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:57,328
Oh, they always do.

1729
00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:59,988
Anything new just breaks down for the first year.

1730
00:59:59,988 --> 01:00:00,408
Yeah, it broke down constantly.

1731
01:00:02,028 --> 01:00:04,068
Splash Mountain has always seemed like the weirdest ride

1732
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:06,028
to me that it did get built because it's based

1733
01:00:06,028 --> 01:00:08,628
on a property that they wanna bury and not talk about.

1734
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:13,248
And yet, strangely, was re-released several years prior

1735
01:00:13,248 --> 01:00:15,468
to the ride opening to test the waters.

1736
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:18,948
Did you guys see the PBS documentary about Walt Disney?

1737
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:21,268
It's like American Masters Walt Disney.

1738
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:22,248
I watched that one.

1739
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,608
It is the greatest documentary because they got license

1740
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:28,068
from the Disney company to show historical stuff,

1741
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:31,028
but it's not a Disney documentary,

1742
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:33,808
so it's not like, oh, fascist.

1743
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:34,768
It's not like.

1744
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,168
Showing the party line.

1745
01:00:36,448 --> 01:00:39,768
Right, it's about how Walt Disney was a dick

1746
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,428
and stole ideas from everybody

1747
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,668
and sort of about how he invented tech bro culture,

1748
01:00:43,668 --> 01:00:46,488
how he was like, we'll build a campus for our studio

1749
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:49,308
and all the employees will live on campus

1750
01:00:49,308 --> 01:00:51,548
and that way they can come to work right away.

1751
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:55,148
Like Elon Musk, he called people pedos with no proof.

1752
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:59,828
Well, the reason, there's the rumor as always

1753
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:01,388
that Walt was a big anti-Semite,

1754
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:03,288
but one of the reasons that that was a rumor

1755
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:09,088
was because he basically, he would pay the animators

1756
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:11,268
a lot of money and no women could be animators

1757
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:11,908
and stuff like that.

1758
01:01:11,908 --> 01:01:14,308
So there were a lot of underpaid employees at Disney

1759
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:17,008
who were supposed to just be happy to be working at Disney

1760
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:20,588
and then this animator, I think his name is Art Something,

1761
01:01:20,988 --> 01:01:24,988
who invented Goofy, saw a woman pass out in the cafeteria

1762
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:28,048
because she was so overworked and he was like,

1763
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:30,068
oh, you need to pay people a living wage

1764
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:32,988
and then Disney broke with him

1765
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:35,268
and that was when the workers went on strike,

1766
01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:37,068
when the animators went on strike,

1767
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:39,648
led by the guy who invented Goofy,

1768
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:42,348
who was also a really cool Jewish guy.

1769
01:01:43,148 --> 01:01:43,688
Oh yeah, that's good.

1770
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:47,628
Yeah, oddly enough, the Walt Disney Family Museum,

1771
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:50,568
the one that is like daughter made up in San Francisco,

1772
01:01:50,788 --> 01:01:55,408
you can see in the Presidio, is pretty thorough

1773
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:56,948
and doesn't really pull pun,

1774
01:01:56,948 --> 01:02:00,148
there is like a huge wing of it about that strike.

1775
01:02:00,288 --> 01:02:02,888
It's really amazing in the documentary too

1776
01:02:02,888 --> 01:02:05,928
because it's like, and then Walt Disney

1777
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:07,788
never trusted workers again

1778
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:10,688
and isolated himself from everyone.

1779
01:02:12,048 --> 01:02:15,148
Anyway, we thank our new corporate overlords,

1780
01:02:15,288 --> 01:02:18,128
Amazon and Netflix for all they do for us.

1781
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:21,788
We're just happy to work, we don't need those residuals.

1782
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:26,728
I was gonna say something about communists, but who cares?

1783
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:28,048
Let's get back to Big Thunder.

1784
01:02:29,348 --> 01:02:31,828
I was thinking though, the other thing that's not built

1785
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:33,988
was gonna be back in that Big Thunder area,

1786
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:35,928
I forget the name of it,

1787
01:02:35,928 --> 01:02:38,468
it was basically a reverse Tower of Terror

1788
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:41,188
where it was gonna be like a geyser,

1789
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:42,168
oh, called Geyser Mountain.

1790
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:42,988
Oh yeah.

1791
01:02:43,248 --> 01:02:45,488
And you'd go underground and see people working

1792
01:02:45,488 --> 01:02:46,348
and then they'd be like,

1793
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:48,708
luckily the geyser's not going to blow today

1794
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,408
and then you'd go down and down and see more

1795
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:51,928
and then all of a sudden the geyser blew

1796
01:02:51,928 --> 01:02:53,548
and then you would get shot up,

1797
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:56,628
like the reverse Tower of Terror out of the ground

1798
01:02:56,628 --> 01:02:57,908
with water on all sides.

1799
01:02:58,048 --> 01:02:58,588
Cool.

1800
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:02,548
That might be, I wasn't familiar with that one

1801
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:04,268
before you alerted me to.

1802
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:05,848
That's rad.

1803
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:09,248
Well, okay, what do we need to hit about this?

1804
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:10,728
Big Thunder is, I think Tony Becks,

1805
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:11,668
I've heard him talk about this,

1806
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:14,708
it's a lot of kids' first roller coaster,

1807
01:03:14,968 --> 01:03:17,068
which I think is kind of cool and important

1808
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:20,028
and then cool that it holds up,

1809
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:22,348
because there's stuff that when you go on it as a kid

1810
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:23,568
and you're like, wow, and then you go on it again

1811
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:25,188
as an adult and you're like, okay, it's fine,

1812
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:26,248
Jason's gonna be upset,

1813
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:28,408
but a Casey Jr. is a thing you'd go on,

1814
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:29,428
it's not a thrill ride or anything,

1815
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,028
but you can't go on that forever.

1816
01:03:32,728 --> 01:03:33,148
Well, I can.

1817
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:34,968
Well, I never had it as a child,

1818
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:38,008
because I didn't come out to LA until I was in college.

1819
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,668
You just love to go to the park

1820
01:03:39,668 --> 01:03:42,088
and just go straight to the little elephant train.

1821
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:43,548
I loved it.

1822
01:03:43,728 --> 01:03:46,648
Disney, that was another early, early Disneyland.

1823
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:49,148
That place was dirty with trains.

1824
01:03:49,268 --> 01:03:50,648
There were just trains everywhere

1825
01:03:50,648 --> 01:03:51,928
in the original years of Disneyland.

1826
01:03:51,948 --> 01:03:53,128
Dirty with trains.

1827
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:54,128
Dirty with trains.

1828
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:55,228
Putting that.

1829
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:57,828
Casey Jr., mine train through nature's wonderland,

1830
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,028
the Disneyland Railroad.

1831
01:04:00,188 --> 01:04:01,648
They're all train nerds.

1832
01:04:01,928 --> 01:04:05,528
There's art of Jason, Jason with dirty with trains

1833
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:09,308
and then in terms of his hands, he's making it train.

1834
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,428
He's tossing trains out.

1835
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:14,208
Just throwing train cars at unsuspecting children.

1836
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:16,388
That's a tip, we have to put that on a shirt.

1837
01:04:16,508 --> 01:04:17,228
I guess so.

1838
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:17,668
Keep adding.

1839
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:20,848
Make it train, Jason just dressed like Pig Pen.

1840
01:04:21,648 --> 01:04:22,328
Because dirty with trains.

1841
01:04:22,328 --> 01:04:24,888
A dirty, well, I think I'd be in a conductor outfit,

1842
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:25,488
but it's filthy.

1843
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:26,808
Oh, okay, you're right, that's right, that's better.

1844
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:28,828
I feel like Pig Pen might wear a conductor outfit.

1845
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,068
Does he wear overalls?

1846
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:31,088
Yeah, it's not dissimilar.

1847
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:31,668
Yeah, he's getting there.

1848
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:33,008
Just put the hat on, is it?

1849
01:04:33,388 --> 01:04:36,728
So kids, as a kid, kids go on,

1850
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,708
the five year olds can go on this if they're tall enough.

1851
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:41,948
Good first coaster, good, it's thrilling enough.

1852
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:44,468
Stays a little thrilling as an adult.

1853
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:49,108
Yeah, it's a perfect, it's a perfect for everybody ride.

1854
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:53,588
And another thing is, I think that's what we keep finding

1855
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:56,208
about it, it's just, it's there, it's trusty,

1856
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:59,248
it's just always works, you always enjoy it.

1857
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,008
And one thing about it, like.

1858
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:01,768
It's always a highlight.

1859
01:05:02,168 --> 01:05:03,788
It's always, yeah, it's always, you're always happy

1860
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:06,628
when you get off the thing, and I think part of what,

1861
01:05:07,088 --> 01:05:10,908
part of why that is, is like, line, never that bad.

1862
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,188
If you are stuck in the line, it's a fun place

1863
01:05:13,188 --> 01:05:14,228
to hang out for a little while.

1864
01:05:14,228 --> 01:05:16,728
Yeah, you're outside, it's better than being in one

1865
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,508
of the lines where you're just in, in a tunnel.

1866
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,388
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and it changes and shifts a lot.

1867
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:25,408
It's not like, I think like box lines,

1868
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:26,788
where you just go this way and that way

1869
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:28,548
and this way and that way can be very oppressive.

1870
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:31,348
Midway mania, it's like, boy, if you can get a FastPass

1871
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:32,128
for that, that's great.

1872
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:35,608
But, if you, and if you can get a FastPass for Big Thunder,

1873
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:37,628
it's usually only like an hour away.

1874
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:40,888
It's not one of those where you, you get the FastPass,

1875
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:44,008
it's nine hours, now your whole day is based around,

1876
01:05:44,268 --> 01:05:45,868
at the end of the day, we'll hit Big Thunder.

1877
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:48,848
You can plug it in between other things very easily.

1878
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:52,728
It's just, it's, Big Thunder's there, it's there for you.

1879
01:05:52,728 --> 01:05:55,488
It is like the glue that holds Disney together.

1880
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:58,228
It's like Phil Hartman in the SNL cast or something.

1881
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:01,408
Like, it's truly like, it's always so dependable.

1882
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:03,948
That is what I find fascinating, but I told Tony

1883
01:06:03,948 --> 01:06:05,348
that that's my low-key favorite ride,

1884
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,128
because I realized that after so many years of like,

1885
01:06:07,248 --> 01:06:09,668
it's the only one I'm always, I always want to go on it.

1886
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:12,848
Every ride is great and I will go on any ride at any time,

1887
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:14,488
but like, that's the only one.

1888
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:15,808
You know, we just did that.

1889
01:06:16,048 --> 01:06:17,468
Let's wait a couple times.

1890
01:06:17,768 --> 01:06:20,848
I happily go on Big Thunder probably every time.

1891
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:22,748
Yeah, I don't know, there's never been a time

1892
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:24,308
where I've been like, in that Big Thunder.

1893
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:27,628
I'm always, and this is, Lindsay talks, like she,

1894
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:29,988
she sometimes should be like, we've done it a lot

1895
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:31,388
or something, I'd be like, yeah, but it's great.

1896
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:32,888
Like, we could do it every time.

1897
01:06:33,328 --> 01:06:33,488
Yeah.

1898
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:36,228
But I don't know, yeah, I feel like that's, I don't know,

1899
01:06:36,228 --> 01:06:38,368
I'm trying to think of another ride, like, and I can't.

1900
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:41,068
Yeah, I feel like of all the big ones, of the mountains,

1901
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:42,028
and.

1902
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:44,008
Or maybe you don't go on, you know,

1903
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:45,888
maybe you're with people who like, like,

1904
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:47,988
as Space Mountain's like a little bit much for them,

1905
01:06:48,048 --> 01:06:50,028
or I didn't do Splash Mountain for a long time,

1906
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:52,448
or Matterhorn, it's like, ah, it hurts my back or whatever,

1907
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:53,308
and that line's boring.

1908
01:06:53,568 --> 01:06:54,868
There's really no.

1909
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:56,768
Right, there's no. Grievance or limitation.

1910
01:06:56,768 --> 01:06:59,848
It's like not rickety, it's a smooth, wonderful ride.

1911
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:00,668
Yeah. Yeah.

1912
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:03,188
It's like perfect, like, it's also like,

1913
01:07:03,388 --> 01:07:06,028
it's like the porridge, it's like, I've said this before,

1914
01:07:06,028 --> 01:07:07,368
I've used this before, it's like,

1915
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:11,328
it's the exact right amount of like, it's not too scary,

1916
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:14,088
it's not too intense, but it's also not boring.

1917
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,128
It's also, the line is perfectly, like,

1918
01:07:16,128 --> 01:07:17,868
everything about it is actually perfect.

1919
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:21,368
It's located in like, kind of a centrally part of where,

1920
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:23,928
of Disneyland, like every single aspect of it

1921
01:07:23,928 --> 01:07:26,168
is sort of perfect and right in the middle,

1922
01:07:26,468 --> 01:07:28,288
like right there, I don't know.

1923
01:07:28,448 --> 01:07:28,528
Yeah.

1924
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:31,128
I also love at the end when you like, get it off,

1925
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:33,368
and then there's like the little miniature, like, saloon,

1926
01:07:33,368 --> 01:07:34,028
and that kind of stuff. Oh yeah.

1927
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:35,568
There's like good stuff to look at

1928
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:37,068
even after the ride is over.

1929
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:38,148
Yeah, yeah.

1930
01:07:38,948 --> 01:07:41,308
Mike, would you like to discuss the,

1931
01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:43,588
what is now in one of those buildings?

1932
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:45,588
Well, yes, it's a.

1933
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:48,648
Recently added backstory of the attraction

1934
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,668
that is a new invention, as far as I can tell,

1935
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,828
in the 2010s.

1936
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:54,428
Let me, yeah, it was, I believe it was added when they added,

1937
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:57,048
cause so, they've done like various things

1938
01:07:57,048 --> 01:07:58,388
to the ride over the years.

1939
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:02,888
And they've added like, you know.

1940
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:05,908
It was closed for a good what, like two years?

1941
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:06,848
Or 14 months.

1942
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,468
They did a major overhaul at Disneyland

1943
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:10,468
where they changed out the entire track.

1944
01:08:10,988 --> 01:08:11,588
Yeah. Yeah.

1945
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,448
And they, but they changed, like they put some effect,

1946
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:15,888
the smoke effect at the end where like the mind blows up.

1947
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:16,968
Oh right, they added the like the TN,

1948
01:08:16,988 --> 01:08:18,328
I remember going on it and being like,

1949
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:19,248
I haven't been on it in a while

1950
01:08:19,248 --> 01:08:20,648
cause I do not remember this part.

1951
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:21,168
Yeah.

1952
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:24,808
Which by the way, we talk about plus ups on this show.

1953
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:27,228
That's one of the top plus ups.

1954
01:08:27,548 --> 01:08:30,088
They didn't have to do it, it was a fine ride without,

1955
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:32,708
but now you get a great bang at the end.

1956
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:35,388
Sometimes it's not working, that's the only bummer,

1957
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:36,908
but lately it's been working every time.

1958
01:08:37,088 --> 01:08:39,268
But I'm always a little nervous when I start going up the hill.

1959
01:08:39,388 --> 01:08:42,008
Were we not gonna get the big fireball at the end?

1960
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:45,808
But when you do, you're so, I like cheer for it every time.

1961
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:47,708
I put my hands up and cheer.

1962
01:08:47,788 --> 01:08:48,748
It's a great effect.

1963
01:08:49,148 --> 01:08:51,248
And also like I've, Tony Baxter has even talked about

1964
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:54,248
how the ride doesn't have such a great ending.

1965
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,708
That's like the visceral thrill at the end

1966
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:57,708
isn't as satisfying.

1967
01:08:57,748 --> 01:08:59,508
It doesn't feel like, oh, that's the biggest drop

1968
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:00,948
or that's the biggest like.

1969
01:09:01,048 --> 01:09:05,108
The stretch from hill two to three is the most exciting.

1970
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:05,608
Yes.

1971
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:08,348
Three to the end is probably the least exciting.

1972
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:08,688
Right.

1973
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,768
So it does peter out, unfortunately.

1974
01:09:10,828 --> 01:09:12,428
Probably due to limited space.

1975
01:09:12,428 --> 01:09:13,668
Yeah, I think that's what he said.

1976
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:16,468
There's so many baby animals along the way.

1977
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:17,828
Right, that's true.

1978
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:20,408
Well, and the infamous, the goat chewing dynamite.

1979
01:09:20,428 --> 01:09:22,468
Oh, I love the goat chewing dynamite.

1980
01:09:22,468 --> 01:09:23,608
Is a fan favorite.

1981
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:24,908
Everyone loves the goat.

1982
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:27,648
And we will do, we've said we'll do an episode

1983
01:09:27,648 --> 01:09:29,788
on the Patreon exclusively about the goat.

1984
01:09:31,288 --> 01:09:34,688
How do we, that one, it sounds funny, but can we.

1985
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:35,888
I don't know, we'll see.

1986
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:37,768
It's the hat ghost of that ride.

1987
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:38,528
It's just everyone.

1988
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:39,708
Oh, the hat box, yeah.

1989
01:09:40,308 --> 01:09:41,748
He's that, well he's the star

1990
01:09:41,748 --> 01:09:43,108
in the sense that he's the star, yeah.

1991
01:09:43,148 --> 01:09:46,328
And does everybody know that if you look back at it

1992
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:49,608
for as long as you can, you get a little extra thrill.

1993
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:52,348
That's the little like web secret.

1994
01:09:52,928 --> 01:09:55,388
It's like just keep your eyes on that goat.

1995
01:09:55,488 --> 01:09:57,048
And then I did it last night

1996
01:09:57,048 --> 01:10:00,248
and you do kind of get this extra weird little.

1997
01:10:00,268 --> 01:10:01,348
You're just disorienting.

1998
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:02,108
You're describing.

1999
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:03,428
Be getting dizzy, yes.

2000
01:10:03,428 --> 01:10:04,708
You're dizzy, that's what I'm saying, yes.

2001
01:10:04,808 --> 01:10:05,448
That's wonderful.

2002
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:08,288
I'm just making sure like,

2003
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:11,708
there's not a sound effect cue of like the goat saying like,

2004
01:10:11,788 --> 01:10:13,948
see you in hell, like or something that I missed.

2005
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:16,808
That's when they do the witch overlay on that ride.

2006
01:10:18,168 --> 01:10:20,728
He shits in defiance of you.

2007
01:10:21,028 --> 01:10:21,988
Did you guys watch Sabrina?

2008
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:23,728
I haven't seen Sabrina.

2009
01:10:23,728 --> 01:10:23,868
I haven't yet.

2010
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:27,628
There's a really good satanic goat in Sabrina, just saying.

2011
01:10:28,008 --> 01:10:28,388
Oh, okay.

2012
01:10:28,568 --> 01:10:28,848
That's fun.

2013
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:31,248
I'm the person who was a big fan of those comics

2014
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:33,308
and was very excited about there being a show.

2015
01:10:33,368 --> 01:10:34,188
It's pretty good.

2016
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,748
The Archie, original Archie Sabrina.

2017
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:38,588
Well, like they did a recent kind of like creepy.

2018
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:39,528
Oh, those, gotcha.

2019
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:41,228
Yeah, they did like a reboot that was kind of like

2020
01:10:41,228 --> 01:10:43,888
an EC horror comic type Sabrina

2021
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:46,488
and the show is very faithful to it.

2022
01:10:46,528 --> 01:10:47,188
Oh, good.

2023
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:48,788
I love Kieran and Shipka.

2024
01:10:48,908 --> 01:10:50,248
Yeah, I recommend it if you like.

2025
01:10:50,248 --> 01:10:53,188
If you like Ghosts and Satan, you'll enjoy.

2026
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:55,148
I like the Archie comics family.

2027
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:55,868
I love them.

2028
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:59,448
I love the dark Archie comics reboot, the Riverdale.

2029
01:10:59,848 --> 01:11:00,668
I guess that's like.

2030
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:02,348
Oh yeah, dark horny Archie.

2031
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:05,468
Who could have predicted that this would be such a hit?

2032
01:11:06,288 --> 01:11:07,628
I could have told you.

2033
01:11:07,908 --> 01:11:09,248
The kids always love it.

2034
01:11:10,128 --> 01:11:12,608
This was something, well, Mike and me

2035
01:11:12,608 --> 01:11:14,648
and past guests on the show, Marissa Strickland,

2036
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,728
were texting about last night,

2037
01:11:15,748 --> 01:11:21,028
I found a website that is selling like leather jughead crowns.

2038
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:21,328
Oh my God.

2039
01:11:21,328 --> 01:11:24,568
A fashion brand selling leather crowns.

2040
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,948
Also, I found this because it was an ad

2041
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:29,428
in the middle of Okay Cupid.

2042
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:34,628
Like saying, check out this leather crown website.

2043
01:11:34,848 --> 01:11:35,388
It's like, wait.

2044
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:37,228
But it was targeted at you.

2045
01:11:37,248 --> 01:11:38,728
But it was, I guess.

2046
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:39,988
I got it just right.

2047
01:11:40,168 --> 01:11:42,388
I saw somebody who was on Halloween

2048
01:11:42,388 --> 01:11:44,188
dressed as leather jughead.

2049
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:46,848
So it's taken off.

2050
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:47,588
No.

2051
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:50,408
They looked at your search history and they said.

2052
01:11:50,428 --> 01:11:51,488
They said leather man jughead.

2053
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:52,988
It's a match.

2054
01:11:53,528 --> 01:11:58,448
Yeah, single man looking for a date.

2055
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:00,208
It's like the ever world's largest sandwich.

2056
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:02,308


2057
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:05,668
And they're like, then the computer's like,

2058
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:06,988
I know what to target him.

2059
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:10,088
I know what crown, leather crown.

2060
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:11,668
It's only $30.

2061
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:13,948
They said I would go in three ways with Marissa

2062
01:12:13,948 --> 01:12:14,968
if you want it.

2063
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:16,648
Yeah, but then I have to wear it.

2064
01:12:17,148 --> 01:12:17,208
Yeah.

2065
01:12:17,248 --> 01:12:18,248
I think it could be your thing.

2066
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:19,688
It's definitely a statement piece.

2067
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,288
What did the pickup artists guys,

2068
01:12:21,548 --> 01:12:23,128
you had to have a statement?

2069
01:12:23,388 --> 01:12:24,088
Or what was that thing called?

2070
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:24,948
Oh, what did they say?

2071
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:25,168
Peacocking.

2072
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:25,888
Peacocking.

2073
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:26,388
Oh yeah.

2074
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,648
They were into hats.

2075
01:12:28,568 --> 01:12:29,548
Yeah, they loved hats.

2076
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:31,228
They were like, it's a conversation piece.

2077
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:33,048
People will be forced to talk to you

2078
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,088
if you're wearing a leather crown.

2079
01:12:34,368 --> 01:12:37,148
Or you stay very far away from you depending on.

2080
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:37,688
That's true.

2081
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,968
I was gonna say, if you start getting a lot of dates

2082
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:42,128
because you start wearing a leather crown,

2083
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:43,828
I'll be the most confused

2084
01:12:43,828 --> 01:12:46,148
about what's going on with our society,

2085
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:46,928
with our world.

2086
01:12:48,148 --> 01:12:50,488
Jason shared it in his trademark leather crown.

2087
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:55,348
Michael, did you wanna tell us about a certain.

2088
01:12:55,508 --> 01:12:56,188
Yeah, so they.

2089
01:12:56,188 --> 01:12:57,068
Someone for this round.

2090
01:12:57,268 --> 01:12:59,148
So when they did that renovation,

2091
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:03,948
they added a portrait in, is it the saloon?

2092
01:13:04,288 --> 01:13:06,908
It's in the saloon in Florida, it's in the line.

2093
01:13:07,548 --> 01:13:08,908
Oh yeah, right, right, right.

2094
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:12,108
And they added a painted picture

2095
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:14,848
of a character named Barnabas T. Bullion.

2096
01:13:15,668 --> 01:13:18,388
And he looks like Imagineer Tony Baxter.

2097
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:20,428
He is a.

2098
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:20,788
Aw, look at that.

2099
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,868
A lot of people, if you Google image Barnabas T. Bullion,

2100
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:25,788
a lot of people are putting him side by side,

2101
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:28,068
not just with Tony Baxter, but with Donald Sutherland.

2102
01:13:28,228 --> 01:13:30,168
He looks just like Donald Sutherland.

2103
01:13:31,068 --> 01:13:32,608
The curly, mustachey old man.

2104
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:36,868
And is the lead antagonist of the Marvel comic

2105
01:13:36,868 --> 01:13:39,968
Big Thunder Mountain, the mini series.

2106
01:13:40,028 --> 01:13:42,508
Oh, this is the inserted backstory.

2107
01:13:42,748 --> 01:13:46,008
Yeah, so would you care to read that panel, Jason?

2108
01:13:46,108 --> 01:13:49,088
He says, so the lower we go, the richer the vein.

2109
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:50,448
Wonderful, thank you.

2110
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:53,248
Here's also a panel where they caught Tony

2111
01:13:53,248 --> 01:13:56,948
reading the comic in the same pose drawn

2112
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:59,148
of him reading letters on a tray.

2113
01:13:59,148 --> 01:13:59,748
Oh, let me see that.

2114
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:02,908
Is this the backstory that links it to the haunted mansion

2115
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:04,388
and other rides in the parks?

2116
01:14:04,388 --> 01:14:05,708
Yes, yes.

2117
01:14:06,148 --> 01:14:08,668
So he's a member of a club called

2118
01:14:08,668 --> 01:14:10,908
the Society of Explorers and Adventurers,

2119
01:14:11,128 --> 01:14:14,748
which is called C, which is nicknamed or shortened to C.

2120
01:14:15,188 --> 01:14:18,448
And there are many other characters that own rides

2121
01:14:18,448 --> 01:14:20,448
across all the Disney parks.

2122
01:14:21,188 --> 01:14:22,708
And they've, I don't know who.

2123
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,888
This doesn't count Doc Brown

2124
01:14:23,888 --> 01:14:26,368
and the Institute of Future Technology,

2125
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,508
does it, the original named ride owner?

2126
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:30,748
I think we could count it.

2127
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:32,088
Get him into C.

2128
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:33,188
I think he should be in C. C doesn't have to be

2129
01:14:33,188 --> 01:14:34,768
a Disney thing only, but he was in C.

2130
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,208
Well, C, hold on, let me get the full list.

2131
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:38,268
Mary Oceaneer.

2132
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,948
Mary Oceaneer, Harrison High Tower of the Tower.

2133
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:42,928
What's Mary Oceaneer from?

2134
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:46,828
Well, she has, they just opened up a whole Mary Oceaneer area

2135
01:14:46,828 --> 01:14:48,508
in Typhoon Lagoon, I believe.

2136
01:14:48,688 --> 01:14:50,168
And on the cruise ships.

2137
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:54,448
So it's a new thing to make up a bunch of imaginary bosses

2138
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,208
of the rides?

2139
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:56,868
Yes, she's a kind of.

2140
01:14:57,348 --> 01:14:59,988
She's from the Adventurers Club too, I think.

2141
01:15:00,348 --> 01:15:02,168
Yeah, so she's Captain Mary Oceaneer

2142
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:05,648
of Oceaneer Labs and Misfortune Falls.

2143
01:15:06,628 --> 01:15:08,308
And there's all these pictures of them.

2144
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:10,848
I think she's, I forget who she's based on,

2145
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:12,528
like what, imagineer.

2146
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,128
So Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mountain,

2147
01:15:15,588 --> 01:15:18,428
and pirates are supposedly linked in a plot line?

2148
01:15:18,988 --> 01:15:23,068
Well, Haunted Mansion, because I believe I sent you also

2149
01:15:23,068 --> 01:15:25,068
this in the same conversation,

2150
01:15:25,068 --> 01:15:26,768
this is teasing what my bid is,

2151
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:29,128
but I sent you a picture of,

2152
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,748
I didn't realize that Hightower is the husband

2153
01:15:32,748 --> 01:15:35,108
who was killed in the Haunted Mansion.

2154
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:35,848
Oh.

2155
01:15:36,288 --> 01:15:38,668
By Constance Hatchaway.

2156
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:43,088
So Hightower, so there's George,

2157
01:15:43,088 --> 01:15:44,288
it's like George Hightower,

2158
01:15:44,368 --> 01:15:46,748
who has some relation to Harrison Hightower,

2159
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:50,028
the man who owns the hotel in Tokyo Disney Sea.

2160
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,268
So it's a rich, they're all members of C,

2161
01:15:53,468 --> 01:15:56,748
and we need to look and figure out if this is Rhodey,

2162
01:15:56,828 --> 01:15:58,128
all of this is Rhodey,

2163
01:15:58,628 --> 01:15:59,828
because I don't know who.

2164
01:15:59,828 --> 01:16:00,888
It seems up his alley.

2165
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:01,728
It seems right up his alley,

2166
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:03,248
because he's at Mr. Adventurers Club,

2167
01:16:03,348 --> 01:16:05,688
which is where all the members of C would hang out,

2168
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,668
members like Lord Henry Mystic,

2169
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:10,748
the man who owns Mystic Manor in Hong Kong Disney,

2170
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,328
which is supposedly like the greatest ride ever.

2171
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:15,268
And which Rhodey was heavily involved in, correct.

2172
01:16:15,268 --> 01:16:15,648
Is that right?

2173
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:16,688
Maybe, maybe.

2174
01:16:16,748 --> 01:16:17,368
I don't know actually.

2175
01:16:18,508 --> 01:16:20,748
But yes, we're making up fake characters

2176
01:16:20,748 --> 01:16:21,768
who own all of the rides.

2177
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:22,088
Sure, right.

2178
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:23,648
Because there was not enough to just go on the ride.

2179
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:24,408
Yeah.

2180
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:26,368
What do you feel about when they try to like

2181
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:29,428
add plot elements to rides that weren't there before?

2182
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:34,168
It all depends, like this stuff is so subtle

2183
01:16:34,168 --> 01:16:39,908
that 99.9% of people don't know or care

2184
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:41,948
about Barnabas T. Bullion.

2185
01:16:42,148 --> 01:16:43,708
The proof of Barnabas T. Bullion

2186
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:47,008
is a painting of him kind of behind some doors.

2187
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:49,728
So you can absolutely avoid

2188
01:16:49,728 --> 01:16:51,348
the Barnabas T. Bullion backstory,

2189
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,588
unless you're on a podcast about this.

2190
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,028
It's not in your face.

2191
01:16:55,268 --> 01:16:56,268
Do I love it?

2192
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:56,948
Yes.

2193
01:16:57,188 --> 01:16:58,488
I love it.

2194
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,968
And I want more of it.

2195
01:16:59,988 --> 01:17:02,048
And I want more, I want a show now

2196
01:17:02,048 --> 01:17:03,268
about all these characters.

2197
01:17:03,528 --> 01:17:05,228
Has anyone been on Pirates

2198
01:17:05,228 --> 01:17:09,208
since they changed the bride auctions?

2199
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:09,508
Yes.

2200
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:11,168
I think we all went on it together.

2201
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:12,428
Yeah, I think we've all been on it together.

2202
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:17,768
I've been told that they changed the redhead into a pirate.

2203
01:17:18,108 --> 01:17:19,088
She is a pirate.

2204
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:20,828
It could be clean.

2205
01:17:20,968 --> 01:17:22,508
It could make more sense.

2206
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:24,808
She's like a real, like,

2207
01:17:24,928 --> 01:17:27,408
now she's a pirate and they're auctioning off chickens

2208
01:17:27,408 --> 01:17:30,468
and she's sort of like, the men want the rum, don't they?

2209
01:17:30,628 --> 01:17:31,488
And she's got like a much-

2210
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:32,408
The men want the rum.

2211
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,428
And she's like, it's a real aggressive, like,

2212
01:17:35,748 --> 01:17:38,188
because the old redhead people had a lot of affection for

2213
01:17:38,188 --> 01:17:39,908
but like didn't have a lot of personality,

2214
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:41,348
didn't say anything really.

2215
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:45,188
But now I think they're like, she's a fiery pirate and she's-

2216
01:17:45,188 --> 01:17:47,928
And we've got merchandise you can buy of it.

2217
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:50,948
Yeah, you can get your picture with her in the walkway.

2218
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:54,368
I always liked that because I, as a ginger, like as a kid,

2219
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:56,648
I was very into that scene because they're all like,

2220
01:17:56,668 --> 01:17:59,548
we want the redhead, everyone else sucks.

2221
01:18:00,648 --> 01:18:01,668
Sure, representation matters.

2222
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:02,328
Yeah.

2223
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:03,908
So you walked out of there feeling like, oh right.

2224
01:18:03,908 --> 01:18:05,428
Well, I think I was also like,

2225
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,428
that's one of those parts of the ride.

2226
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:09,588
You know, there's things in Disneyland rides still

2227
01:18:09,588 --> 01:18:11,048
that are like vestiges of something

2228
01:18:11,048 --> 01:18:13,368
where you're like, this doesn't seem appropriate anymore

2229
01:18:13,368 --> 01:18:16,308
but it's still in the ride, like all of the Jungle Cruise.

2230
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:17,028
You know?

2231
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:17,928
Sure, sure, yes.

2232
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:19,748
But it's grandfathered in.

2233
01:18:19,748 --> 01:18:20,208
Right.

2234
01:18:20,668 --> 01:18:21,668
To a certain extent.

2235
01:18:21,828 --> 01:18:23,888
And then so like when they do decide to change things,

2236
01:18:23,928 --> 01:18:27,888
you're like, I don't know, is it gonna-

2237
01:18:27,888 --> 01:18:30,188
I realize now there's a couple, we just,

2238
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:32,868
this will come out after our Tokyo Disney episode.

2239
01:18:33,548 --> 01:18:35,428
Oh no, I can't tell it because Scott's here, shoot.

2240
01:18:35,428 --> 01:18:37,748
There's a spoiler of something.

2241
01:18:38,108 --> 01:18:39,588
There's a spoiler of something I won't say.

2242
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:41,028
I'll tell you after the podcast,

2243
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,268
but I can't say it because I want you to be surprised

2244
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:43,888
when you get there.

2245
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:45,348
I could go in the penalty box.

2246
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:46,448
Do you wanna go in the penalty box?

2247
01:18:46,628 --> 01:18:48,748
Go in the, how hard is it to get out

2248
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:50,128
from under that mic stand?

2249
01:18:51,068 --> 01:18:52,308
I mean, I don't feel like getting up.

2250
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:53,908
It's all right, fine, we'll talk about it later.

2251
01:18:54,068 --> 01:18:57,308
But yeah, there's stuff like that in Tokyo Disneyland,

2252
01:18:57,568 --> 01:18:58,288
proper, where you're like, oh.

2253
01:18:58,288 --> 01:19:00,428
I bet if you told me I wouldn't give a shit.

2254
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,468
Yeah, this one might not be that big of a deal to you.

2255
01:19:02,528 --> 01:19:02,808
Yeah.

2256
01:19:02,928 --> 01:19:04,248
This one might not be like exciting.

2257
01:19:04,348 --> 01:19:06,048
It's not exciting, it's just I was shocked.

2258
01:19:06,048 --> 01:19:07,868
I'll say it and I'll see if I'm like, how dare you?

2259
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,108
It'd be funny, yeah, react really if it's a spoiler

2260
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:10,648
that you care about.

2261
01:19:11,188 --> 01:19:13,848
The men still chase the women on Pirates.

2262
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:14,888
What the fuck?

2263
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:16,328
Oh, that's interesting.

2264
01:19:16,408 --> 01:19:17,208
I mean, you think they'll ever,

2265
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:18,508
yeah, do you consider that like,

2266
01:19:18,648 --> 01:19:20,948
is that like in Japan, it's fine?

2267
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:23,448
I don't, I mean, obviously I think it's the only place

2268
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:25,808
they didn't change it, because in the Pirates famously,

2269
01:19:25,948 --> 01:19:27,968
they changed, that people were like,

2270
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:29,728
oh, it's a little unnerving that these men

2271
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:30,968
are chasing these women,

2272
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,028
and I wonder why they're chasing them.

2273
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:33,868
Now there's food.

2274
01:19:34,288 --> 01:19:35,868
Yeah, and then they added food.

2275
01:19:36,288 --> 01:19:37,108
But then they.

2276
01:19:37,168 --> 01:19:37,768
They reversed it.

2277
01:19:37,768 --> 01:19:39,608
Then they just reversed it, so the men or the women

2278
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,748
are chasing them with like a rolling pin or something.

2279
01:19:41,768 --> 01:19:43,608
Yes, just much better for gender roles though.

2280
01:19:44,088 --> 01:19:44,688
Very, yes.

2281
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:46,988
As long as someone's chasing someone,

2282
01:19:47,308 --> 01:19:48,708
there's always gotta be chases.

2283
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,528
We've got this circular platform, we're not wasting it.

2284
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:56,768
Yes, so, but in Japan, it's the exact same as it always was.

2285
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:58,708
You know what, honestly, I think I would have gone on

2286
01:19:58,708 --> 01:19:59,508
and not noticed.

2287
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,048
Oh really?

2288
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:00,568
Yes.

2289
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:02,968
We were like, oh my God, because we didn't know about,

2290
01:20:03,088 --> 01:20:04,448
I didn't know, because they don't have,

2291
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:06,108
they haven't switched the auction scene either,

2292
01:20:06,108 --> 01:20:07,968
but then you're like, wait, are the men,

2293
01:20:08,108 --> 01:20:09,468
oh my God, it's the same.

2294
01:20:09,868 --> 01:20:12,568
So I mean, I guess maybe it's a cultural thing of like,

2295
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:13,388
hey, right on.

2296
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:17,428
Um, did you come across the,

2297
01:20:17,448 --> 01:20:21,188
are you guys aware of the other Big Thunder character

2298
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:24,608
who has been part of the ride for some time in Florida only?

2299
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:25,348
No.

2300
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:27,668
Oh no, or maybe, say it.

2301
01:20:27,668 --> 01:20:30,108
I did not, I've never heard this until today.

2302
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,888
There is an animatronic,

2303
01:20:32,028 --> 01:20:34,148
I was like, first of all, an animatronic, where?

2304
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:36,908
And there's a couple, there's a guy in a bathtub,

2305
01:20:36,908 --> 01:20:39,628
and then there's a guy in a big,

2306
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,408
like old, like a caboose or something,

2307
01:20:42,748 --> 01:20:44,208
or like an old medicine cart,

2308
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:48,468
and it says rain making, or rain maker on it or something,

2309
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:53,188
and this character's name is Professor Cumulus Isobar.

2310
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,248
Okay, I don't know that.

2311
01:20:54,368 --> 01:20:55,648
He's a man who built a- He's a man who built a-

2312
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:56,708
Cumulus Isobar, but I love him.

2313
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,648
He built, you know, when you see him,

2314
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,188
you'll love him again, because guess what?

2315
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,408
Top pet mustache.

2316
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:04,328
And he's a Tony invention.

2317
01:21:04,328 --> 01:21:05,808
It was based on this movie, I don't know,

2318
01:21:05,888 --> 01:21:08,448
I forget the full title, but I think it's like Dr. Lau.

2319
01:21:08,648 --> 01:21:09,168
Oh, yeah.

2320
01:21:09,368 --> 01:21:10,588
That's Cumulus Isobar.

2321
01:21:10,868 --> 01:21:12,668
Yep, and here's why, I was like,

2322
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:14,148
I've been on this ride in Florida,

2323
01:21:14,148 --> 01:21:17,088
why have I never seen this old rain making man?

2324
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:20,148
And it's because you have to look backwards to see him.

2325
01:21:20,268 --> 01:21:23,128
You can see him better on the train circling the park,

2326
01:21:23,248 --> 01:21:26,128
but I've never noticed this before.

2327
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,128
But anyway, go to Florida

2328
01:21:27,128 --> 01:21:29,188
and go see Professor Cumulus Isobar,

2329
01:21:29,408 --> 01:21:30,988
who obviously also will get his own episode.

2330
01:21:30,988 --> 01:21:32,448
He will eventually get a film

2331
01:21:32,448 --> 01:21:35,908
and needs to be invited into sea as soon as possible.

2332
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:38,448
Mm-hmm, he maybe was kicked out of sea.

2333
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:39,088
There is?

2334
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:40,828
He's a fraud.

2335
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:42,288
He was in the comics as well.

2336
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:43,588
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah.

2337
01:21:43,868 --> 01:21:46,128
And he says, do you want me to read his dialogue here?

2338
01:21:46,228 --> 01:21:46,448
Absolutely, sure.

2339
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,028
Cause I'd like to.

2340
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:47,448
All right.

2341
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:50,228
If there aren't rain clouds filling that sky

2342
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:53,108
this time tomorrow, I'll eat my hat in both my shoes.

2343
01:21:53,368 --> 01:21:54,848
Who needs swamp root?

2344
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,128
Indeed.

2345
01:21:58,328 --> 01:21:59,468
Works out of context, too.

2346
01:21:59,468 --> 01:22:00,588
Beautiful words never said.

2347
01:22:01,728 --> 01:22:04,808
I also, like, on Wikipedia lists, like,

2348
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,328
the backstory about how, like, the mountain is cursed

2349
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:10,148
or, like, mining the mountain is cursed

2350
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:13,028
and that the, in theory, the trains

2351
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,088
just kept running on their own,

2352
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:18,568
even when people abandoned Rainbow Ridge.

2353
01:22:19,088 --> 01:22:20,588
Did you guys come across that?

2354
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:22,908
And how was that conveyed?

2355
01:22:23,288 --> 01:22:24,408
Cause it's a ghost town?

2356
01:22:24,848 --> 01:22:26,748
Yeah, that it's like a ghost town

2357
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:29,448
and the trains are enchanted

2358
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:31,088
and just never stopped running.

2359
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:32,448
Is that what we're on?

2360
01:22:32,588 --> 01:22:33,328
Are we on a ghost train?

2361
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,228
We are on the out of control, like.

2362
01:22:35,228 --> 01:22:35,568
Mine train.

2363
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:36,888
Which has no conductor.

2364
01:22:37,028 --> 01:22:38,288
Which has no conductor.

2365
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:39,108
I see.

2366
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:40,048
Oh, that's interesting.

2367
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:42,928
But then, I don't know if that is kind of, like,

2368
01:22:42,988 --> 01:22:45,788
tweaked now that you end in a town

2369
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:48,548
that seems very populated with, like,

2370
01:22:48,608 --> 01:22:50,388
rowdy noises and music and stuff.

2371
01:22:50,388 --> 01:22:51,568
Oh, I thought they were just by ghosts.

2372
01:22:51,648 --> 01:22:52,608
It's a ghost town.

2373
01:22:52,608 --> 01:22:54,628
Yeah, I guess it could be a ghost town, too.

2374
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:57,728
There's, like, an evil backstory for the Paris one.

2375
01:22:58,108 --> 01:22:59,488
I don't think I know it off, man.

2376
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:02,628
It says, like, according to, Shoshani, is that right?

2377
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:03,788
Is that a tribe?

2378
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,228
I don't know.

2379
01:23:04,368 --> 01:23:06,208
The mountainous island in the middle of the rivers

2380
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,648
of the far west is a sacred site,

2381
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:09,248
the resting place of the Thunderbird.

2382
01:23:09,508 --> 01:23:11,428
It is said that those who do not respect the mountain

2383
01:23:11,428 --> 01:23:13,308
will bring misfortune and hardship upon them,

2384
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:15,488
a sign of the great spirit bird's wrath.

2385
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:16,928
It was left well enough alone

2386
01:23:16,928 --> 01:23:18,728
by the native people for this reason.

2387
01:23:19,148 --> 01:23:20,988
So that's a real hardcore, like,

2388
01:23:21,088 --> 01:23:23,348
it's haunted story for the Paris.

2389
01:23:23,428 --> 01:23:25,908
It's different stories in towns than a lot of them.

2390
01:23:26,128 --> 01:23:26,868
But you know what?

2391
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:31,208
They almost added an entirely other character,

2392
01:23:31,288 --> 01:23:34,368
mythology set of characters to this ride.

2393
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:37,628
If a certain film had been a hit,

2394
01:23:37,948 --> 01:23:39,968
they wanted to add animatronics

2395
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:42,768
of the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

2396
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:44,688
Ooh, aren't we glad it was not.

2397
01:23:45,628 --> 01:23:48,488
Just in case the Johnny Depp stuff

2398
01:23:48,488 --> 01:23:50,888
doesn't go anywhere better,

2399
01:23:51,388 --> 01:23:53,928
maybe it's good if there are not more

2400
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:54,808
Yeah, come on.

2401
01:23:55,068 --> 01:23:56,808
Johnny Depp animatronics in the park

2402
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:58,448
especially ones where he's portraying races

2403
01:23:58,448 --> 01:23:59,688
that are not his race.

2404
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:03,608
He's one 16th Cherokee, right?

2405
01:24:04,188 --> 01:24:06,088
It's like Pocahontas.

2406
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:08,348
Elizabeth Warren.

2407
01:24:09,608 --> 01:24:12,808
Yeah, thank God this did not occur,

2408
01:24:12,968 --> 01:24:13,768
Lone Ranger and Tonto.

2409
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:16,368
I feel like there was also talk of,

2410
01:24:16,508 --> 01:24:18,068
did they do a stunt show or something?

2411
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:20,748
Yeah, I think there was rumors of a stunt show.

2412
01:24:20,908 --> 01:24:22,408
They seemed very confident

2413
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:25,088
that Lone Ranger was gonna work.

2414
01:24:25,188 --> 01:24:25,988
It did not work.

2415
01:24:25,988 --> 01:24:28,148
They were waiting for the big pirates,

2416
01:24:28,248 --> 01:24:31,048
new pirates franchise for it.

2417
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:33,608
Which I feel like every few,

2418
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:36,868
westerns, when Disneyland first opened,

2419
01:24:37,228 --> 01:24:39,408
westerns were superhero movies now.

2420
01:24:39,628 --> 01:24:41,648
There was just so many westerns.

2421
01:24:42,108 --> 01:24:44,148
And now I feel like every few years,

2422
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:45,308
a western comes along,

2423
01:24:45,568 --> 01:24:48,428
people like it, they move with the True Grit remake,

2424
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:51,328
but there's no big cowboys.

2425
01:24:52,248 --> 01:24:54,188
Do kids still play cowboy?

2426
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:56,388
Like, I don't, I don't know.

2427
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:57,608
Do kids play cowboys?

2428
01:24:57,608 --> 01:24:59,928
You're pitching a lot of ideas for articles today.

2429
01:25:01,968 --> 01:25:03,568
Do kids play, probably.

2430
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:04,928
You got Westworld now.

2431
01:25:05,028 --> 01:25:06,588
That's our cowboy mythology,

2432
01:25:06,988 --> 01:25:08,068
but even that is. Children love Westworld.

2433
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:09,048
Of course, yes.

2434
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:10,608
All the kids are playing Westworld.

2435
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:11,668
Children love killer robots.

2436
01:25:12,768 --> 01:25:13,848
That's why they like theme parks.

2437
01:25:14,248 --> 01:25:15,868
Kids are all stripping

2438
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:18,148
and pretending to be malfunctioning robots

2439
01:25:18,148 --> 01:25:19,948
and stored in a back room somewhere,

2440
01:25:20,168 --> 01:25:20,828
having existential crises.

2441
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:22,028
I wanna be Jeffrey Wright.

2442
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,308
I wanna be Ed Harris.

2443
01:25:24,508 --> 01:25:26,328
Dips on Fancy Newton.

2444
01:25:27,028 --> 01:25:28,668
Somewhere that is happening.

2445
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:30,408
Like at least to one set of children.

2446
01:25:30,788 --> 01:25:32,708
Yeah, very precocious.

2447
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:35,028
But there is, I'm just glad,

2448
01:25:35,168 --> 01:25:37,908
I don't mind it staying this way

2449
01:25:37,908 --> 01:25:40,148
where there is only one speaking part

2450
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:41,768
on the Big Bear Mountain Railroad.

2451
01:25:41,828 --> 01:25:45,168
And that is of course the man who bids you farewell

2452
01:25:45,168 --> 01:25:46,788
before you go on the ride,

2453
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,908
who tells you that this year

2454
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:52,508
is the wildest ride in the wilderness.

2455
01:25:53,768 --> 01:25:55,588
Totally fine that that's it.

2456
01:25:55,588 --> 01:25:57,548
That guy is great.

2457
01:25:57,548 --> 01:26:00,008
But outside of Paul Freeh's Ghost Host,

2458
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,328
I think one of the best vocal performances

2459
01:26:02,328 --> 01:26:05,088
on any of the attractions, so much fun.

2460
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,048
And I think easy to get lost too,

2461
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,508
because the voices, you can sometimes miss it

2462
01:26:09,508 --> 01:26:10,848
because it's out in open air.

2463
01:26:10,908 --> 01:26:13,488
And sometimes it's easier to not hear that.

2464
01:26:13,488 --> 01:26:15,128
So you have to kind of pay attention

2465
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:18,428
to really enjoy his classic old prospector delivery.

2466
01:26:19,328 --> 01:26:22,568
Does anyone know the voice of this?

2467
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:24,268
I was gonna say, I don't know the voice of this.

2468
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:27,728
I just found out today, the guy's name is Dal McKennon,

2469
01:26:27,868 --> 01:26:29,588
or also called Dallas McKennon.

2470
01:26:29,628 --> 01:26:30,228
Oh, I love it.

2471
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:32,868
If you look him up, he looks like an old prospector.

2472
01:26:32,868 --> 01:26:33,268
Oh, great.

2473
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,488
Exactly what you want, a prolific voice actor,

2474
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:41,608
but most notably, the laughing hyena in Lady and the Tramp,

2475
01:26:41,848 --> 01:26:46,108
which is a hyena laugh that is used in many other things,

2476
01:26:46,228 --> 01:26:48,608
including the Crash Bandicoot games.

2477
01:26:48,628 --> 01:26:52,028
So he's like a pretty, when you think hyena,

2478
01:26:52,088 --> 01:26:53,788
it might be this guy's laugh.

2479
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:56,988
He's also Ben Franklin in the American Adventure.

2480
01:26:57,008 --> 01:26:57,708
Oh, wow.

2481
01:26:57,728 --> 01:27:00,628
He is Zeke in Country Bear Jamboree.

2482
01:27:00,728 --> 01:27:02,068
Oh my God, this guy's a legend.

2483
01:27:02,448 --> 01:27:03,228
I should've known this guy.

2484
01:27:03,228 --> 01:27:03,508
And the strangest thing of all,

2485
01:27:03,628 --> 01:27:06,528
a voice that's nothing like any of this, he's Gumby.

2486
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:09,368
He's frickin' Gumby is that guy.

2487
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:11,768
So next time you hear that prospector,

2488
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,508
he's also your old pal Gumby,

2489
01:27:13,588 --> 01:27:16,328
who probably you can't remember the exact voice of.

2490
01:27:16,348 --> 01:27:17,288
No, I can't, but.

2491
01:27:18,008 --> 01:27:19,888
Yeah, it's like, hey, pokey.

2492
01:27:19,888 --> 01:27:23,948
It's really odd and kind of sh** and unpleasant.

2493
01:27:24,028 --> 01:27:25,308
I think it's just like that.

2494
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:26,888
Hey. You nailed it.

2495
01:27:27,688 --> 01:27:29,348
We gotta stop the blockheads.

2496
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,968
I'm never gonna watch Gumby again, I guess.

2497
01:27:33,588 --> 01:27:35,348
Now that you know that's what he sounds like.

2498
01:27:35,348 --> 01:27:36,048
Now that I remember, that's kind of what he is.

2499
01:27:36,148 --> 01:27:38,308
They also made a Gumby movie in the 90s,

2500
01:27:38,308 --> 01:27:41,268
and they didn't make him cool, like new Chuck E. Cheese,

2501
01:27:41,448 --> 01:27:43,328
essentially, by its nature, yeah.

2502
01:27:43,428 --> 01:27:44,748
But they didn't update the voice.

2503
01:27:44,748 --> 01:27:45,908
He was just still that.

2504
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:47,668
I'm a movie now.

2505
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:51,088
Let me ask a potentially controversial question.

2506
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:52,868
What is Gumby?

2507
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,208
He's a bendy man.

2508
01:27:54,488 --> 01:27:56,388
Yeah, he's just like a little bendy green.

2509
01:27:56,668 --> 01:27:57,988
He's just a bendy man, right, okay.

2510
01:27:58,308 --> 01:28:01,028
He's a living, he's a celery stick.

2511
01:28:01,268 --> 01:28:02,408
Why did you say controversial?

2512
01:28:02,508 --> 01:28:03,028
What did you think?

2513
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,868
I don't know, I don't know.

2514
01:28:07,188 --> 01:28:09,188
I just, I can't, I never considered.

2515
01:28:09,188 --> 01:28:09,848
I feel like you had something in your head

2516
01:28:09,848 --> 01:28:11,508
that you thought baby Gumby is,

2517
01:28:11,548 --> 01:28:12,488
and you didn't wanna say it.

2518
01:28:12,488 --> 01:28:15,248
I just never considered what Gumby was before.

2519
01:28:15,488 --> 01:28:17,028
I think maybe you thought it was like.

2520
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:18,248
I was afraid I was missing it,

2521
01:28:18,248 --> 01:28:19,368
and it was right in front of me,

2522
01:28:19,368 --> 01:28:20,368
and everyone was gonna go like,

2523
01:28:20,368 --> 01:28:22,908
he's a tree, you idiot, like, but no,

2524
01:28:22,908 --> 01:28:23,888
he's just a little clay bendy man.

2525
01:28:23,908 --> 01:28:25,228
I see, not controversial, like,

2526
01:28:25,348 --> 01:28:27,648
he's like the sign of a cross that bends or something.

2527
01:28:27,988 --> 01:28:28,588
No, no.

2528
01:28:28,908 --> 01:28:30,728
He's one of the Gumbloids, duh.

2529
01:28:31,908 --> 01:28:33,248
Didn't you read the graphic novels?

2530
01:28:33,248 --> 01:28:35,148
He's a green clay humanoid.

2531
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:36,748
All right, self-tortured.

2532
01:28:36,748 --> 01:28:39,808
I sure am, right, right, I'm a humanoid.

2533
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:41,908
Wanna hang around with me, kids?

2534
01:28:42,188 --> 01:28:43,348
Oh, he's horrifying.

2535
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:46,328
Do we know the name of the character, old prospector?

2536
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:47,448
Does he have a voice? I don't think he's named.

2537
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:48,248
He doesn't have a voice?

2538
01:28:48,308 --> 01:28:49,088
I don't believe so.

2539
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:51,188
We'll have to add, the next time they shut the ride down,

2540
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:53,428
they'll have to add like, am I a name?

2541
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:56,988
You can see me on the Disney streaming service.

2542
01:28:57,228 --> 01:28:59,288
The first thing that the guy who made Gumby,

2543
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:02,088
Art Cloakie made, was a three-minute student film

2544
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:05,328
called Gumbasia, a clay parody of Fantasia.

2545
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:08,468
Whoa, wow, Disney connection.

2546
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,988
He started with Fantasia?

2547
01:29:10,608 --> 01:29:12,128
He made clay Fantasia.

2548
01:29:12,568 --> 01:29:13,488
Wow, geez.

2549
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:14,788
A parody, is that right?

2550
01:29:14,988 --> 01:29:15,948
It was a parody of it?

2551
01:29:16,008 --> 01:29:17,588
It was a parody, a stop-motion clay parody.

2552
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,128
So he was like, what's his name, Steve Odukirk,

2553
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,868
who does those thumb parodies?

2554
01:29:22,048 --> 01:29:23,228
Yeah. Famous movies.

2555
01:29:23,248 --> 01:29:24,468
Just like that thumb guy.

2556
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:25,348
He's like the thumb guy.

2557
01:29:25,368 --> 01:29:28,388
When are we gonna get Steve Odukirk's thumb universe

2558
01:29:28,388 --> 01:29:29,628
into the Disney parks?

2559
01:29:29,808 --> 01:29:32,548
They need to stop buying all these expensive properties

2560
01:29:32,548 --> 01:29:35,428
and get me Thumb Wars,

2561
01:29:35,428 --> 01:29:37,508
fingers edge.

2562
01:29:37,828 --> 01:29:41,328
That feels like, early 2000s,

2563
01:29:41,328 --> 01:29:44,228
I could see there being a California adventure attraction

2564
01:29:44,228 --> 01:29:46,128
based on Steve Odukirk's thumbs.

2565
01:29:46,828 --> 01:29:49,428
It was short-lived, six months, no one went in it.

2566
01:29:49,588 --> 01:29:52,028
They take you, they're the hosts in your journey

2567
01:29:52,028 --> 01:29:53,468
through a ring factory.

2568
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:54,548
Yeah, right, great.

2569
01:29:55,428 --> 01:29:57,608
Also, if for some reason people don't know

2570
01:29:57,608 --> 01:30:00,048
what we're talking about, there's a series.

2571
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:01,808
I hope enough time has passed that they don't.

2572
01:30:01,888 --> 01:30:04,888
There's a series of directed DVD movies

2573
01:30:04,888 --> 01:30:07,028
that are parodies of Star Wars,

2574
01:30:07,128 --> 01:30:08,568
and it's called Thumb Wars.

2575
01:30:09,168 --> 01:30:10,408
And it's just all thumbs,

2576
01:30:10,408 --> 01:30:12,548
and I've never seen a frame of one of them.

2577
01:30:12,588 --> 01:30:14,628
I've just seen the cases in movie play.

2578
01:30:14,928 --> 01:30:17,348
Thumbtanic, Thumbler's List.

2579
01:30:17,688 --> 01:30:19,128
Right, is there a Thumbler's List?

2580
01:30:19,268 --> 01:30:19,868
No, there's not.

2581
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:20,808
Thumbler's List.

2582
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:21,608
I don't know, maybe.

2583
01:30:22,488 --> 01:30:23,848
It's a good joke pitch, but also,

2584
01:30:24,808 --> 01:30:26,528
maybe Steve was outrageous, I don't know.

2585
01:30:26,868 --> 01:30:28,088
They did all the Holocaust movies.

2586
01:30:28,388 --> 01:30:29,888
Life is Thumbberful.

2587
01:30:32,268 --> 01:30:34,088
Yes, it's good there's not more animatronics

2588
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:35,168
on Big Thunder, though.

2589
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:37,948
And as I said to Tony, I think part of it that I like it

2590
01:30:37,948 --> 01:30:39,928
is that it's you out there,

2591
01:30:39,928 --> 01:30:41,968
and I think it's a thing that Tony likes

2592
01:30:41,968 --> 01:30:44,888
when he's talking about ride philosophy.

2593
01:30:45,388 --> 01:30:46,408
It's like there's not a lot of robots.

2594
01:30:46,448 --> 01:30:47,608
You're not watching a show.

2595
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:49,388
The thing is happening to you,

2596
01:30:49,588 --> 01:30:52,688
and it feels, the experience feels much more intimate,

2597
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:54,368
for lack of a better word.

2598
01:30:54,568 --> 01:30:56,268
There's something about that.

2599
01:30:56,288 --> 01:30:58,868
I love big robot bear shows, as everyone knows,

2600
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:01,488
but there is something cool about it,

2601
01:31:01,508 --> 01:31:03,148
because it's just like you're on this ride,

2602
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,848
and it's you, and that's it.

2603
01:31:04,948 --> 01:31:06,568
And I guess also like 20 people.

2604
01:31:06,908 --> 01:31:08,748
And of course, the other thing,

2605
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:12,108
and then I'll try to wrap up my fact brigade,

2606
01:31:12,148 --> 01:31:13,328
but I had to say all of these.

2607
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,768
What you do have instead of animatronics is fake rocks.

2608
01:31:18,288 --> 01:31:18,688
Oh, yeah.

2609
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,228
Y'all know we love fake rocks.

2610
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:20,688
Y'all know.

2611
01:31:20,748 --> 01:31:22,528
This ride's the king of the, fake rocks?

2612
01:31:22,868 --> 01:31:26,088
Y'all, where are the kings of fake rock fandom?

2613
01:31:26,388 --> 01:31:28,888
This is the king of the fake rock rides.

2614
01:31:29,268 --> 01:31:29,648
Oh, yeah.

2615
01:31:29,648 --> 01:31:31,948
And it's perfect fake rock wise.

2616
01:31:32,948 --> 01:31:35,568
And largely overseen by a guy named Skip Lang,

2617
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:37,768
a name I had not come across before.

2618
01:31:37,768 --> 01:31:41,988
He did most of the rock work that we love so much.

2619
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:44,368
Tokyo Disney Sea, this guy,

2620
01:31:44,928 --> 01:31:46,588
everything in Disneyland Paris.

2621
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,388
He was the on-site field director.

2622
01:31:49,468 --> 01:31:49,808
Wow.

2623
01:31:50,128 --> 01:31:50,648
Of all of the land.

2624
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:53,588
Like there were people designing these things from afar,

2625
01:31:53,648 --> 01:31:55,488
but Skip Lang is on the ground.

2626
01:31:55,688 --> 01:31:57,248
He's building their big thunder.

2627
01:31:57,688 --> 01:31:59,968
He's built, there's like a skull rock there

2628
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:00,848
that's really cool.

2629
01:32:00,988 --> 01:32:04,548
There's rock work in Discoveryland that's real cool.

2630
01:32:05,528 --> 01:32:07,848
He directed the fabrication and painting of rock work,

2631
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:10,188
show set installation, and finishes and facades

2632
01:32:10,188 --> 01:32:11,988
of all show related materials.

2633
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:13,088
That was his job.

2634
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:15,148
Tree of Life, I think he worked on as well.

2635
01:32:15,168 --> 01:32:17,108
So many of these environments that we love so much,

2636
01:32:17,148 --> 01:32:19,228
I think we're overseen by this guy, Skip Lang,

2637
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,568
worked in tandem with Tony Baxter,

2638
01:32:21,748 --> 01:32:23,608
also a big part of Indiana Jones Adventure.

2639
01:32:24,488 --> 01:32:27,188
And quote from Tony, apparently in 1981,

2640
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,308
he and this guy, Tony and Skip,

2641
01:32:29,368 --> 01:32:32,288
went to see a sneak preview of Raiders of the Lost Ark

2642
01:32:32,288 --> 01:32:33,328
before it came out.

2643
01:32:33,328 --> 01:32:34,848
It was not heavily hyped.

2644
01:32:34,848 --> 01:32:36,348
They didn't know what they were in for.

2645
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:38,168
They walked out so excited.

2646
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,608
They loved it so much.

2647
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:41,648
And Tony turned to Skip and said,

2648
01:32:42,028 --> 01:32:44,348
can you imagine if we could do something with this?

2649
01:32:44,408 --> 01:32:44,888
Wow.

2650
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:46,148
And then they did.

2651
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,588
They worked together for many years

2652
01:32:47,588 --> 01:32:48,588
and so many cool things.

2653
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,228
Big thunder, I think, seemingly, you know,

2654
01:32:51,808 --> 01:32:53,768
really the fruits of this Tony Skip relationship.

2655
01:32:53,988 --> 01:32:55,768
Skip passed away two years ago.

2656
01:32:56,388 --> 01:32:58,468
RIP did incredible work.

2657
01:32:58,768 --> 01:33:01,968
We, that feels like, if only he was alive,

2658
01:33:01,968 --> 01:33:03,608
because we could have him and talk about

2659
01:33:03,608 --> 01:33:06,468
our favorite fake rocks with Skip Lang.

2660
01:33:06,788 --> 01:33:08,108
A full fake rock.

2661
01:33:08,108 --> 01:33:10,408
A two and a half hour episode of fake rocks,

2662
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,528
just bringing up fake rocks and being like.

2663
01:33:12,688 --> 01:33:13,668
Especially that Paris one,

2664
01:33:13,768 --> 01:33:15,868
the Paris Big Thunder is just so massive.

2665
01:33:15,928 --> 01:33:18,468
And like on an island in the middle of the water

2666
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,708
where you start on the shore

2667
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:24,168
and then you go through a tunnel to get to the island,

2668
01:33:24,328 --> 01:33:27,168
ride around the, you know, the rock work and everything

2669
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,228
on the island and then ride back through another tunnel.

2670
01:33:30,528 --> 01:33:31,188
It's just huge.

2671
01:33:31,248 --> 01:33:32,148
It's a lot more grand,

2672
01:33:32,168 --> 01:33:33,688
there's a lot more space than the other ones.

2673
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:35,208
And as I've said this on the show before,

2674
01:33:35,408 --> 01:33:37,848
but really on the true highlight

2675
01:33:37,848 --> 01:33:41,408
of my Disneyland Paris visit is that going up

2676
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:44,088
that third lift hill in the tunnel,

2677
01:33:44,308 --> 01:33:45,988
the ride suddenly stops.

2678
01:33:46,308 --> 01:33:48,228
And we don't know, we don't know this version.

2679
01:33:48,268 --> 01:33:50,508
We didn't know if that was like part of, you know,

2680
01:33:50,568 --> 01:33:54,088
it stops for a second and you watch some explosion happen.

2681
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:55,268
It just stopped.

2682
01:33:55,668 --> 01:33:56,808
Like, what's this about?

2683
01:33:56,868 --> 01:33:59,448
And then it kept going for an uncomfortable amount of time.

2684
01:33:59,448 --> 01:34:01,408
Then the work lights came on,

2685
01:34:01,528 --> 01:34:03,108
then an announcement in French,

2686
01:34:03,328 --> 01:34:05,168
and we're starting to go, is this it?

2687
01:34:05,328 --> 01:34:06,628
Is this the walk off?

2688
01:34:06,948 --> 01:34:09,228
Are we the dream of many theme park fans?

2689
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,428
And we got it.

2690
01:34:10,428 --> 01:34:11,928
And at that point in the ride,

2691
01:34:12,308 --> 01:34:15,788
the furthest point away from land it could possibly be,

2692
01:34:15,928 --> 01:34:19,068
we got to walk the entire track backwards.

2693
01:34:19,348 --> 01:34:20,848
I took a lot of video of it.

2694
01:34:20,848 --> 01:34:21,548
I found it today.

2695
01:34:21,588 --> 01:34:23,788
I'll cut it together and do a little thing for Twitter

2696
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:27,068
so you yourself can see inside Big Thunder.

2697
01:34:27,068 --> 01:34:29,828
But like, it was perfectly at dusk

2698
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:31,868
and we're along the rivers there.

2699
01:34:32,088 --> 01:34:34,728
So we're like, it's beautiful sky.

2700
01:34:34,848 --> 01:34:36,548
We're going in and out of tunnels.

2701
01:34:36,868 --> 01:34:39,228
We're seeing, you know, all of the like,

2702
01:34:39,388 --> 01:34:41,228
all of the chicken wire and everything.

2703
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:43,628
And then just like cabinets and boxes

2704
01:34:43,628 --> 01:34:46,428
and like people's sign in sheets in French,

2705
01:34:46,768 --> 01:34:49,088
all the not magical stuff going on in there.

2706
01:34:49,168 --> 01:34:50,388
And then we walked off.

2707
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:51,608
Oh my God, that was so cool.

2708
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,448
What an epic walk off experience.

2709
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:57,448
Went and had the greatest beer in the frontier land,

2710
01:34:57,448 --> 01:35:00,088
the tavern, whatever you call it.

2711
01:35:00,268 --> 01:35:02,628
The highlight of Disneyland Paris.

2712
01:35:03,068 --> 01:35:04,588
So if you can make it to Paris,

2713
01:35:04,828 --> 01:35:06,648
make the ride shut down at that point

2714
01:35:06,648 --> 01:35:09,648
and then get a beer, you too will have a wonderful experience.

2715
01:35:09,648 --> 01:35:09,888
At dusk.

2716
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:11,048
Exactly at dusk.

2717
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:11,468
Yeah, yeah.

2718
01:35:11,648 --> 01:35:13,388
Just throw like a penny into the track

2719
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:15,048
and see if you can make it happen yourself.

2720
01:35:15,308 --> 01:35:17,888
This might be too early to start talking plus up.

2721
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:20,848
I don't know if whatever everyone else has to say,

2722
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,588
but I think I've said this before.

2723
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:25,268
I've tried to figure out on the map, an overhead map,

2724
01:35:25,368 --> 01:35:27,848
is there a place where you could put a bar

2725
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:29,528
that overlooks Big Thunder?

2726
01:35:29,628 --> 01:35:31,468
Because that's really my plus up as far as the riding.

2727
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:33,588
I'd love it maybe if the third, whatever,

2728
01:35:33,588 --> 01:35:35,408
two to three would be faster or bigger,

2729
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:36,548
but I think it's impossible.

2730
01:35:36,928 --> 01:35:41,148
But is it possible even just for like a five seat bar

2731
01:35:41,148 --> 01:35:45,308
where I can drink a beer and watch Big Thunder

2732
01:35:45,308 --> 01:35:47,328
and just live in Big Thunder for a little bit?

2733
01:35:47,328 --> 01:35:49,728
Maybe if they bring back the SkyTrams.

2734
01:35:49,888 --> 01:35:50,508
Oh, the Skyway?

2735
01:35:50,508 --> 01:35:53,928
So like a Skyway would stop overhead on a wire

2736
01:35:53,928 --> 01:35:57,268
and you would drink in the Skyway bucket while Big Thunder.

2737
01:35:57,428 --> 01:36:01,028
Like those pedal, those bars that pedal around town.

2738
01:36:01,508 --> 01:36:04,468
Like not LA, but like certain towns,

2739
01:36:04,728 --> 01:36:08,048
it's like people sitting on those giant bicycles

2740
01:36:08,048 --> 01:36:08,768
that are bars.

2741
01:36:08,908 --> 01:36:11,148
Maybe we just have to add another level to Disneyland.

2742
01:36:11,768 --> 01:36:14,068
They just need to build a whole nother level

2743
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:15,848
that looks down. Super exclusive

2744
01:36:15,848 --> 01:36:18,228
to look down on the commoners.

2745
01:36:18,228 --> 01:36:19,188
Yeah. Yes.

2746
01:36:20,008 --> 01:36:22,128
All right. So Sky Disneyland.

2747
01:36:22,488 --> 01:36:25,688
Sky, well, that was the rumor of third park in Tokyo

2748
01:36:25,688 --> 01:36:26,908
was Disney Sky.

2749
01:36:26,908 --> 01:36:29,388
Whoa. But it didn't come out there.

2750
01:36:29,568 --> 01:36:31,008
It didn't come to, because they're instead,

2751
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:32,708
I think they're just doing an expansion of sea.

2752
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:35,388
Okay. But Disneyland, Disney Sea,

2753
01:36:35,408 --> 01:36:37,128
and then Disney Sky was going to be third,

2754
01:36:37,308 --> 01:36:37,908
which is very cool.

2755
01:36:37,908 --> 01:36:39,528
How is it going to be in Disney Sky?

2756
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:40,568
Avatar land.

2757
01:36:41,288 --> 01:36:43,188
Oh, of course. Yes.

2758
01:36:43,408 --> 01:36:44,468
Because the mountains.

2759
01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:47,848
There's going to be a million movies worth of material.

2760
01:36:48,228 --> 01:36:48,928
Ups flying around.

2761
01:36:50,228 --> 01:36:51,788
Ooh, I love Disney.

2762
01:36:51,788 --> 01:36:53,308
Disney Sky is my favorite part.

2763
01:36:53,788 --> 01:36:55,348
Yeah. Then that's your favorite unbuilt thing.

2764
01:36:55,388 --> 01:36:56,148
Yeah, it is now.

2765
01:36:56,388 --> 01:36:57,028
In the hypothetical.

2766
01:36:58,548 --> 01:37:01,568
Molly, do you have any walk-off story?

2767
01:37:01,728 --> 01:37:03,448
Like has a ride broken down on you?

2768
01:37:03,648 --> 01:37:06,708
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, pirates who once had a walk-off.

2769
01:37:06,708 --> 01:37:07,348
Oh, where?

2770
01:37:07,768 --> 01:37:09,568
Like right when everything's on fire,

2771
01:37:09,588 --> 01:37:10,928
we were stuck there for a long time.

2772
01:37:10,928 --> 01:37:11,668
Wow. That's great.

2773
01:37:11,928 --> 01:37:13,988
Yeah. I remember thinking like the employees

2774
01:37:13,988 --> 01:37:15,948
at the front of the line had to like get in the water

2775
01:37:15,948 --> 01:37:16,968
and pull the boats over.

2776
01:37:16,968 --> 01:37:20,488
I was like, man, that sucks for them.

2777
01:37:20,508 --> 01:37:23,008
How far did you get to like walk through

2778
01:37:23,008 --> 01:37:24,408
anywhere weird that?

2779
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:26,208
No, but like we went out through an alleyway

2780
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:28,308
where people were like smoking cigarettes on their break

2781
01:37:28,308 --> 01:37:30,648
and it was very, you know, very glamorous.

2782
01:37:30,648 --> 01:37:34,548
But did you get close to a robot at all?

2783
01:37:34,728 --> 01:37:35,108
Was you were leaving?

2784
01:37:35,108 --> 01:37:36,668
As close as I would like to get.

2785
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:40,608
You didn't get to kiss one or pick their pocket.

2786
01:37:42,788 --> 01:37:43,748
Yeah, that would be,

2787
01:37:44,408 --> 01:37:47,108
that's the best part to get walk-off there though.

2788
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:49,688
I think in the fire or no, no, I guess right before,

2789
01:37:49,868 --> 01:37:51,608
not when the town is on fire, when they're just,

2790
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,988
I guess the auction scene probably is the best

2791
01:37:53,988 --> 01:37:54,788
walk-off area there.

2792
01:37:54,808 --> 01:37:56,568
Yeah, the town was on fire and then it was just like

2793
01:37:56,568 --> 01:37:59,048
a long period of like first the lights come on

2794
01:37:59,048 --> 01:38:00,388
and like they turn the sound off,

2795
01:38:00,388 --> 01:38:02,608
but you can still hear the animatronics like clacking.

2796
01:38:02,868 --> 01:38:03,808
It's very scary.

2797
01:38:04,448 --> 01:38:05,348
Sure. Yeah.

2798
01:38:05,828 --> 01:38:06,168
Yeah. Nope.

2799
01:38:06,168 --> 01:38:09,188
Broke down next to the giant animatronic snake once

2800
01:38:09,188 --> 01:38:10,308
at Indiana Jones.

2801
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,128
That would freak me out.

2802
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:14,028
That was, were you on the end?

2803
01:38:14,668 --> 01:38:16,048
Yeah, I was on the end next to that big old snake.

2804
01:38:16,068 --> 01:38:17,928
I get scared in that room in Indiana Jones

2805
01:38:17,928 --> 01:38:19,148
because of the fire effect.

2806
01:38:19,348 --> 01:38:21,788
I'm just like, we shouldn't have fire in this room

2807
01:38:21,788 --> 01:38:24,648
around all these like chintzy props.

2808
01:38:26,348 --> 01:38:26,728
Fair concern.

2809
01:38:26,828 --> 01:38:28,348
I went on it last night and I forgot

2810
01:38:28,348 --> 01:38:29,668
there was a big flame right there.

2811
01:38:29,668 --> 01:38:30,868
Because it's not always working.

2812
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:32,608
Sometimes it's like just a light effect

2813
01:38:32,608 --> 01:38:35,028
and I'm always like, it could just be a light effect.

2814
01:38:35,088 --> 01:38:36,988
Like maybe this is from an earlier version,

2815
01:38:36,988 --> 01:38:37,868
but I think it's very expensive

2816
01:38:37,868 --> 01:38:39,448
to run the fire effect obviously.

2817
01:38:39,688 --> 01:38:41,588
I'm disappointed when the fire doesn't happen.

2818
01:38:42,228 --> 01:38:44,108
I think I forgot it was there.

2819
01:38:44,288 --> 01:38:46,008
I did kind of go, oh, whoa.

2820
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,068
Oh, so it happened last night.

2821
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:47,368
Yeah.

2822
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:48,968
Because it hadn't happened the last couple times

2823
01:38:48,968 --> 01:38:50,048
I was on Indiana Jones

2824
01:38:50,048 --> 01:38:52,048
and I'm disappointed when it doesn't go off.

2825
01:38:52,348 --> 01:38:53,048
Huh, huh.

2826
01:38:53,348 --> 01:38:55,328
I think it's such a big part of when you zoom around

2827
01:38:55,328 --> 01:38:57,848
and you go, oh, the thing's shooting flames.

2828
01:38:58,328 --> 01:38:59,128
Sure, sure.

2829
01:39:00,628 --> 01:39:02,648
Well, are we winding it down?

2830
01:39:02,808 --> 01:39:05,528
Are we doing our final verdicts?

2831
01:39:05,528 --> 01:39:07,648
Yeah, I mean, I think this will probably be part one

2832
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,228
of our Big Thunder Odyssey over the next 10 years.

2833
01:39:10,228 --> 01:39:11,188
Oh, no, no, no.

2834
01:39:11,188 --> 01:39:12,708
As with all of these.

2835
01:39:12,728 --> 01:39:13,788
Let's talk plus up ideas.

2836
01:39:13,908 --> 01:39:15,048
What do we feel about it?

2837
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:15,748
Is it perfect?

2838
01:39:15,948 --> 01:39:19,448
Is there anything that could make this kind of

2839
01:39:19,448 --> 01:39:22,528
correct temperature ball of porridge any better?

2840
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,428
Cinnamon and sugar to this.

2841
01:39:24,528 --> 01:39:25,108
Oh, you know.

2842
01:39:25,328 --> 01:39:25,668
Perfect.

2843
01:39:25,888 --> 01:39:26,828
It's pretty perfect.

2844
01:39:27,288 --> 01:39:30,808
And here, one more thing before we totally wind it down.

2845
01:39:30,988 --> 01:39:33,468
I totally forgot about a bizarre block of stuff I found.

2846
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:37,328
For some people, this is beyond just a fun ride.

2847
01:39:37,648 --> 01:39:39,028
There is a real sense of relief

2848
01:39:39,028 --> 01:39:41,108
that they get after going on it

2849
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:43,228
because there was a study put out

2850
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:47,108
by the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association

2851
01:39:47,108 --> 01:39:50,308
that found, there were a doctor who specializes

2852
01:39:50,308 --> 01:39:55,248
in renal calculi, better known as kidney stones.

2853
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:59,488
That a doctor found that several people had come to him

2854
01:39:59,488 --> 01:40:04,028
and said that they were able to pass their kidney stones

2855
01:40:04,028 --> 01:40:06,828
successfully having been on Big Thunder Mountain,

2856
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:11,508
including somebody who went on three separate occasions

2857
01:40:11,508 --> 01:40:15,688
with three separate stones each time passed them

2858
01:40:15,688 --> 01:40:17,828
immediately having been on the ride.

2859
01:40:18,268 --> 01:40:22,608
So with Disney's permission, this guy did a study

2860
01:40:22,608 --> 01:40:26,528
where he brought a 3D model of a kidney stone

2861
01:40:26,528 --> 01:40:30,468
onto the ride and set it up such that

2862
01:40:30,468 --> 01:40:33,848
if it was successful, there would be a simulation

2863
01:40:33,848 --> 01:40:34,968
of the pass of the stone.

2864
01:40:34,968 --> 01:40:38,228
It worked just shy of 70% of the time.

2865
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:41,828
The same model was taken on Space Mountain

2866
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:45,448
and Rock and Roller Coaster 0% of the time.

2867
01:40:45,788 --> 01:40:49,028
It's something special about Big Thunder Mountain.

2868
01:40:49,228 --> 01:40:52,448
So not only a perfect ride, it also saves lives.

2869
01:40:53,028 --> 01:40:56,128
Also home to the coolest piece of Banksy art

2870
01:40:56,128 --> 01:40:58,488
for an hour and a half.

2871
01:40:58,488 --> 01:40:59,388
Oh boo.

2872
01:40:59,788 --> 01:41:00,728
Boo to that.

2873
01:41:01,628 --> 01:41:03,628
Yeah, that's a part of, if you haven't seen Exit

2874
01:41:03,628 --> 01:41:07,948
through the gift shop where there's like a Banksy prank

2875
01:41:07,948 --> 01:41:09,868
happens essentially at Big Thunder Mountain

2876
01:41:09,868 --> 01:41:13,648
and if they like put a fake Guantanamo body or something.

2877
01:41:13,928 --> 01:41:16,248
Yeah, and Mr. Brainwash records it.

2878
01:41:16,428 --> 01:41:17,228
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2879
01:41:17,228 --> 01:41:18,868
And they escape and there's a whole section

2880
01:41:18,868 --> 01:41:21,348
about how the Disney police tried to shake him down.

2881
01:41:21,828 --> 01:41:24,548
Lamest thing, I'm getting over Banksy.

2882
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:25,808
I don't know what it is.

2883
01:41:25,868 --> 01:41:27,708
Probably because he went after theme parks.

2884
01:41:27,768 --> 01:41:28,568
That's probably why.

2885
01:41:28,868 --> 01:41:30,828
This lame prank at Big Thunder that just freaked

2886
01:41:30,828 --> 01:41:32,508
a couple people out and made no point

2887
01:41:32,668 --> 01:41:35,428
and also Dismaland was stupid.

2888
01:41:36,248 --> 01:41:37,848
You're just getting over it?

2889
01:41:38,908 --> 01:41:40,688
I was a big Banksy kid.

2890
01:41:40,888 --> 01:41:41,988
Man in the 90s.

2891
01:41:41,988 --> 01:41:43,328
Up until. Love the strokes.

2892
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:45,408
Love Banksy.

2893
01:41:46,508 --> 01:41:47,188
Love Brian Eno.

2894
01:41:47,988 --> 01:41:48,948
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2895
01:41:49,868 --> 01:41:52,868
Yeah, so I mean yes, it's pretty perfect.

2896
01:41:53,008 --> 01:41:53,728
I don't know what else.

2897
01:41:53,728 --> 01:41:54,808
What would you do to it, Jason?

2898
01:41:55,028 --> 01:41:56,368
I think I would keep as is.

2899
01:41:56,728 --> 01:41:57,448
Is this the first one

2900
01:41:57,448 --> 01:41:59,228
where we're all keeping the ride as is?

2901
01:41:59,248 --> 01:42:00,068
I think so.

2902
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:01,868
Because I don't think we've ever had one

2903
01:42:01,868 --> 01:42:03,588
where I'm not like, well, we could do this

2904
01:42:03,588 --> 01:42:04,328
or we could add.

2905
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,308
I mean, if they put a bunch of country bears on it,

2906
01:42:07,308 --> 01:42:10,128
I wouldn't hate it, but just put those

2907
01:42:10,128 --> 01:42:13,748
on Grizzly River Run and make that much more interesting.

2908
01:42:13,988 --> 01:42:14,668
Do you miss the country bears?

2909
01:42:14,908 --> 01:42:15,888
Oh, every day.

2910
01:42:17,648 --> 01:42:21,588
Like a past relative, like a beloved uncle who passed.

2911
01:42:21,788 --> 01:42:22,788
They never really goes away.

2912
01:42:22,828 --> 01:42:24,268
They have them in Florida, they have them in Tokyo.

2913
01:42:24,468 --> 01:42:26,608
So look, I've been with them multiple times

2914
01:42:26,608 --> 01:42:29,328
in the last two years, but I can't see.

2915
01:42:29,348 --> 01:42:30,048
You know they're somewhere.

2916
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,368
You know they didn't get rid of them.

2917
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:32,668
They've got to be in a basement somewhere.

2918
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,428
We just have to find them and liberate them.

2919
01:42:34,728 --> 01:42:37,548
I think the Oogie, this could totally be wrong.

2920
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,428
I think the Oogie Boogie on the Nightmare Before Christmas

2921
01:42:40,428 --> 01:42:43,188
is like a big L, is the big bear, I think.

2922
01:42:43,308 --> 01:42:44,408
I could be totally wrong about that.

2923
01:42:44,428 --> 01:42:44,808
The guts, you mean.

2924
01:42:44,848 --> 01:42:47,028
We gotta find where they keep the country bears.

2925
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:50,968
That would be, if you could just with a God computer

2926
01:42:50,968 --> 01:42:51,788
know that. I just wanna bring one to this apartment,

2927
01:42:51,848 --> 01:42:53,908
like leave it here, and you just come downstairs

2928
01:42:53,908 --> 01:42:54,688
and find it.

2929
01:42:54,688 --> 01:42:55,968
I mean, I would weep.

2930
01:42:56,068 --> 01:42:56,708
I would weep.

2931
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,128
But of course, you're describing a privilege

2932
01:42:59,128 --> 01:43:01,228
that if done in an illegal manner,

2933
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:05,248
it would cause, to get an operating country bear here,

2934
01:43:05,368 --> 01:43:08,448
it would cost seven million dollars, something like that.

2935
01:43:09,168 --> 01:43:09,768
That's true.

2936
01:43:10,108 --> 01:43:13,028
But yeah, if any listeners know where the country bears

2937
01:43:13,028 --> 01:43:13,788
are being kept.

2938
01:43:13,988 --> 01:43:15,188
Where are the bears?

2939
01:43:15,488 --> 01:43:17,208
In Disneyland, let us know.

2940
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,508
I just hope they aren't rusting out in a field somewhere,

2941
01:43:19,628 --> 01:43:22,228
like the E.T. Rides botanicus, which we discovered.

2942
01:43:23,968 --> 01:43:26,248
That we found that out in a, or I found out that out

2943
01:43:26,248 --> 01:43:28,428
when I worked there, that he was just in a parking lot

2944
01:43:28,428 --> 01:43:30,828
without his skin collecting dust.

2945
01:43:30,828 --> 01:43:33,528
I mean, that sounds like an amazing thing to see also.

2946
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:34,608
It really was.

2947
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:37,048
I am thankful, but I don't wanna be selfish

2948
01:43:37,048 --> 01:43:38,328
and hide botanicas.

2949
01:43:38,408 --> 01:43:40,528
I don't wanna be the only one to get that experience.

2950
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:44,308
And botanicas shouldn't be slowly dying in a field.

2951
01:43:44,308 --> 01:43:46,868
Right, their liver lips McGraw should not be

2952
01:43:46,868 --> 01:43:49,308
sitting out in the sun somewhere, decaying.

2953
01:43:49,468 --> 01:43:50,088
It would be.

2954
01:43:50,188 --> 01:43:51,168
Longs in a museum.

2955
01:43:51,348 --> 01:43:52,948
Yes, thank you.

2956
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,488
So yeah, I don't know, it's perfect, I don't know.

2957
01:43:56,628 --> 01:43:57,488
I guess it's perfect.

2958
01:43:57,588 --> 01:43:59,748
How about, I got one idea.

2959
01:43:59,768 --> 01:44:02,448
What if, same ride, exactly the same.

2960
01:44:02,508 --> 01:44:04,908
So you get your experience intact as you want it.

2961
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:06,948
But then that saloon where the painting

2962
01:44:06,948 --> 01:44:09,268
of Barnabas T. Bullion is hanging out.

2963
01:44:09,288 --> 01:44:09,948
Go ahead.

2964
01:44:10,088 --> 01:44:13,308
You get to the very end and now your train stops

2965
01:44:13,308 --> 01:44:17,128
and an animatronic of Barnabas T. Bullion leans out

2966
01:44:17,128 --> 01:44:21,148
and says, hey, you came back empty handed.

2967
01:44:21,628 --> 01:44:24,168
I need more gold, go back in.

2968
01:44:24,328 --> 01:44:29,128
And then he uses the saloon door to kick the train backwards

2969
01:44:29,128 --> 01:44:31,348
and then you do the whole thing backwards.

2970
01:44:31,528 --> 01:44:32,128
I thought that you were gonna say,

2971
01:44:32,288 --> 01:44:33,508
and then he hands you a beer.

2972
01:44:35,368 --> 01:44:36,728
That's much too pleasant.

2973
01:44:36,868 --> 01:44:38,208
I want him to give me an assignment.

2974
01:44:38,928 --> 01:44:40,168
Here's some incentive.

2975
01:44:40,388 --> 01:44:42,208
You'll get the other half of the beer

2976
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:43,808
when you come back with some Bullion.

2977
01:44:45,228 --> 01:44:48,388
Yes, and then you get to have a beer

2978
01:44:48,388 --> 01:44:51,488
with Barnabas T. Bullion who by now is not an animatronic

2979
01:44:51,488 --> 01:44:54,028
but Tony Baxter in a top hat

2980
01:44:54,028 --> 01:44:55,568
and you get to hang out with him and drink a beer.

2981
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,968
Or on other off days, Donald Sutherland.

2982
01:44:58,608 --> 01:44:59,108
Sure.

2983
01:44:59,008 --> 01:45:00,388
It's either or.

2984
01:45:00,568 --> 01:45:02,268
Okay, also maybe an idea on overlay

2985
01:45:02,268 --> 01:45:04,408
is the Nightmare Before Christmas big thunder overlay

2986
01:45:04,408 --> 01:45:07,948
where Jack has taken over the mine train.

2987
01:45:08,248 --> 01:45:08,708
Perfect, right?

2988
01:45:09,008 --> 01:45:09,388
Totally signed off.

2989
01:45:09,388 --> 01:45:10,188
Yeah, makes perfect sense.

2990
01:45:10,868 --> 01:45:12,108
Totally adds up.

2991
01:45:12,968 --> 01:45:14,608
This is, it's honestly true.

2992
01:45:14,788 --> 01:45:17,388
It's, there's not much you could say you wanna do to it.

2993
01:45:17,608 --> 01:45:20,448
It's there, it's trusty, it's reliable.

2994
01:45:20,988 --> 01:45:23,928
The little train that could, no offense to Casey Jr.

2995
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:24,288
But.

2996
01:45:24,928 --> 01:45:25,788
Fuck Casey Jr.

2997
01:45:25,988 --> 01:45:26,548
All right.

2998
01:45:27,328 --> 01:45:28,928
I like Casey Jr.

2999
01:45:29,128 --> 01:45:30,008
Yeah.

3000
01:45:30,008 --> 01:45:31,528
I'm just trying to get into Jason's skin.

3001
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:33,728
All the trains are trying to rile it up.

3002
01:45:33,728 --> 01:45:34,448
All the train crazy.

3003
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:35,308
Make it train.

3004
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:37,048
Make it train.

3005
01:45:37,768 --> 01:45:40,488
Well, what a wonderful ride, what a wonderful time.

3006
01:45:40,628 --> 01:45:42,348
Molly Lambert, you survived podcast The Ride.

3007
01:45:42,388 --> 01:45:43,848
Yeah, thanks for having me so much.

3008
01:45:43,988 --> 01:45:44,348
Absolutely.

3009
01:45:44,388 --> 01:45:45,628
I'll see you guys at City Walk.

3010
01:45:45,988 --> 01:45:47,368
Yes, any time.

3011
01:45:47,528 --> 01:45:49,628
I feel refreshed, I could go back up there.

3012
01:45:49,628 --> 01:45:50,388
Yeah, you're always there.

3013
01:45:50,608 --> 01:45:52,128
Yeah, yeah, happy to do it.

3014
01:45:52,528 --> 01:45:55,608
Hey, our new thing, we exit, there's a quote Banksy,

3015
01:45:55,608 --> 01:45:57,448
we exit through the gift shop.

3016
01:45:57,628 --> 01:45:58,948
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3017
01:46:00,888 --> 01:46:02,948
Just a night call, everybody check out Night Call,

3018
01:46:03,288 --> 01:46:05,268
a podcast about weird stuff.

3019
01:46:05,608 --> 01:46:06,828
Sometimes theme parks.

3020
01:46:08,148 --> 01:46:08,748
Which are weird.

3021
01:46:08,968 --> 01:46:11,708
Well, it seems like it, and you do have this depth

3022
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:13,688
of knowledge and you taught us some stuff today.

3023
01:46:14,428 --> 01:46:15,388
Love Dark Rides.

3024
01:46:15,388 --> 01:46:16,128
Appreciate it.

3025
01:46:16,488 --> 01:46:19,028
We all are united in our love of Dark Rides.

3026
01:46:19,208 --> 01:46:21,168
Oh, jeez, as you should be.

3027
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:24,888
And I guess people can happily not find you on Twitter.

3028
01:46:24,888 --> 01:46:24,928
Yeah.

3029
01:46:24,928 --> 01:46:25,908
He's happy for you.

3030
01:46:26,708 --> 01:46:28,488
Would it be fun if they tried to look

3031
01:46:28,488 --> 01:46:29,368
and then couldn't find you?

3032
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:31,628
Would that give you a satisfaction of like, oh.

3033
01:46:31,848 --> 01:46:32,528
Got away.

3034
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:33,248
Yeah, yeah.

3035
01:46:33,448 --> 01:46:34,228
Where'd she go?

3036
01:46:34,348 --> 01:46:36,288
A Barnabas T. Bullion type character.

3037
01:46:36,288 --> 01:46:38,188
She slipped out of my fingers.

3038
01:46:39,928 --> 01:46:42,588
We would be okay though if you reactivated

3039
01:46:42,588 --> 01:46:44,448
for like one day to plug the show.

3040
01:46:44,868 --> 01:46:45,988
Cause you get a lot of followers.

3041
01:46:47,188 --> 01:46:48,908
You never know if I come back.

3042
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:50,228
Old bullion over here.

3043
01:46:50,408 --> 01:46:51,268
You're as greedy.

3044
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:52,488
Always greedy.

3045
01:46:52,488 --> 01:46:55,508
