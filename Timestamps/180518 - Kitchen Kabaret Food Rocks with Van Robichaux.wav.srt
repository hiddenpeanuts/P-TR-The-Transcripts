00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Warning, the following podcast contains suicidal cheese grainers, the comedy stylings of both

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,840
ham and eggs, another Disney doll face creature that will haunt your dreams, and the most heated

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,540
podcast the ride argument ever.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:38,640
It's Food Rocks and Kitchen Cabaret with Van Robichaud on today's Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Welcome to Podcast the Ride with your hosts, three guys who literally get drunk and argue

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,840
about how many days you need for a Tokyo Disney vacation.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,480
Joining me today is as always Mike Carlson who voted three.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,800
Yeah, this happened two days ago, it was at the end of my birthday and Scott was like

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,960
yelling at me I think because I said, well we're going to Tokyo Disneyland and I want

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,440
to spend three days and you're like, no, two, two days.

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
And I was like, why, what?

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,520
I said three, I didn't say 13, I kept making sure you knew I said three and not like 30.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Oh, you thought I misheard.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,800
I wasn't sure, I mean, I was, you know, cocktails were consumed, I wasn't out of my mind, but

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I just wanted to make sure.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,680
Well yeah, that's the look, a regular opinion for some reason becomes a shouted animated

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
opinion.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Sure, yeah.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,320
But you know, well, you know, and not to rehash it, but also a person who voted four days,

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Well, okay, look, it's good to have.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,880
I would four, I think four is great.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Yeah, it's good to have two days per park because you don't know what you're going to like and

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,060
then you have to cram.

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,400
If you start with one park, one day, one park each, then you're nervous.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
You got to cram everything.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
You don't know what you're going to like.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
We're nervous men.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,520
That's the risk you take anywhere you travel.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,160
That's true, but then you have that extra day for each park and one, they don't let

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
you park hop in Tokyo, right?

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
They don't let you park hop, I believe.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,040
Their ticket system works differently.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
This is what happened.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
The last memory I have of being in the hotel is there's some other friends of ours that

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,920
don't care much about this crap and there are three or four of them against the wall

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,520
and I kept yelling, it's the greatest park in the world, supposedly.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,200
Supposedly it's the greatest park in the world.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Three days isn't crazy.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,520
And they're like looking at me like, oh yeah, there's like nodding along and like, why are

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
we involved in this?

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,440
Anyway, hey, you guys over here.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Happy big three, four to our own Michael Carlson.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Hey, yeah.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,240
By the time this airs, it will have been three months ago.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I'll be 35 by the time this airs.

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Yes, yeah.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,840
Well, what a way, what a better way to spend your birthday than going to a hotel bar and

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
shouting about ticket types and itineraries.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
That's the type of thing I like to do.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
You know, hey, well, that's what I'm saying.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
It was fun.

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Legitimately.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,940
Hey, I'm glad we can hash it out.

56
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,400
As we've said on our Twitter, the podcast goes every day, all day.

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
There's many bonus episodes always being done for no one.

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,880
Yeah, sometimes just quietly muttered to ourselves.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
There'll be a Truman show kind of a situation and it'll just be us and you will see that

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
it's 80% of our lives.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,880
I was just yelling about like, yeah, when we start camming, when we start camming, yeah,

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,560
when we start camming and it's just us talking about theme parks.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Yeah, when we say, is camming the word, isn't camming just a sex cam?

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Isn't that what you say about it?

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,520
It's a webcam.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
People do difference.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,600
A Twitch streaming, I guess, is the more innocent version.

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,560
Yeah, that would have been more D rated.

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,320
But we're going to, so we're going to start doing that at some point, just all day.

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
We won't go meet each other.

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,560
We'll be on separate webcams for 14 hours, just muttering theme park opinions.

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
And if anyone gives us a tip, maybe taking off an item of clothing.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
We're open to that.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Yeah, sure.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Good way to make money.

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
I don't want to make our guest way here, but a quick question though, Scott.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,600
Are you still right now completely sober adamant that you should only spend two days at the

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,720
Tokyo Disneyland Resort?

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Is that still a strong belief?

81
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
You know, well-

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
You just riled up.

83
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Or is it fun, the party and you were enjoying yourself?

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,520
I do still, I think it's a, like I'm dying.

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,960
So we all, some of us might be going, we're talking about Tokyo Disney trips and I don't

86
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
know, it's two parks.

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,520
You do it in two days.

88
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Makes sense to me.

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I don't know.

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,960
If I do three, are you going to be like that freak?

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
I wouldn't.

92
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
That was the tone.

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Like that was sort of, it was a good natured tone, but that was the tone of like-

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
But I was oddly judgmental.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm glad we can-

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
No!

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
What?

99
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Boy, what a monster.

100
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,480
The bottle really brought it out of him.

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,840
Someone was clowning on us recently because we were talking about trying to plan just

102
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,160
a itinerary in Japan.

103
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,440
And I think I was the one who was like, well, I think you need four days for the parks and

104
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
five days for the rest of the country.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Like what are the most interesting countries in the world?

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One of the most fascinating countries.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think that's what I'm saying.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,640
If you're going to be in Japan, maybe you want to do-

109
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,840
You just add on more days to both.

110
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,000
You just add on more days to parks, add on more days to Japan.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,400
You have to, minimum you have to be in Japan for eight weeks.

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Yeah.

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
That's probably the only way everyone-

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah, that probably works out.

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah.

116
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
And you take Disney breaks.

117
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
You do, you know-

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes.

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Come back for a full week and a half.

120
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Yes.

121
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I mean-

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Well, you also, and you also got a cake in time for Puroland, the Hello Kitty thing.

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Yes, I do want to show them how Puroland-

124
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,880
And Universal in Osaka.

125
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
There's a lot.

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
The Robot Restaurant.

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
And the Ghibli Museum.

128
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
And yeah.

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
All right, well, let's bring our guest down.

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Yeah, sure.

131
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,840
Well, he's been, he's actually been, we have not.

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Oh, that's right.

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,720
And we must get you in on this.

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
And I think you're a person who's, it seems like you've got deep-seated theme park opinions

135
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,840
and arguments and things to bring to the table.

136
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,560
And I'm glad to have you.

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,440
With past guest, Evan Susser, he's a co-writer of the film Fist Fight.

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,560
And of course, the tech guru behind Van Lab's Test Podcast and Mitch.Pizza.

139
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
It's Van Roba Show.

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Thanks for joining us.

141
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Hi, guys.

142
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
It's great to be here.

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Hey.

144
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Thank you for being here.

145
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm really excited.

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm feeling, after you hear this argument about how many appropriate days it would be

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
to spend at the Tokyo Disneyland Resort.

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,640
And how many drinks is it appropriate for somebody to be viciously angry about someone's

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,520
opinion in this area?

150
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
With one day difference.

151
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,960
I want to discourage the vicious anger.

152
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Okay, good.

153
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Yeah.

154
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,600
But I think that it's a very personal thing.

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,960
I think that you guys need to be more accepting of each other's.

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
That's a good point.

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,720
I don't know that there's a one size fits all amount of time for every person.

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
That's a good point.

159
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,680
I hear Scott saying he only wants to be there for two days.

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
And some could be concerned, well, that means you're going to miss some things.

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,200
That means there's going to be some stuff you didn't get to do.

162
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,100
What if one of your things that would have been your favorite thing to do, you never

163
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,480
did it.

164
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,220
And that could be a problem for some people.

165
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,200
That anxiety could just ruin their Tokyo Disneyland trip.

166
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,640
And maybe that person should go for three days.

167
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,880
But I think Scott's the kind of guy who he's going to hit what he wants to hit in one day.

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,040
And that's going to be enough of the experience, I think, for him to understand.

169
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,600
Maybe he'll want to go back.

170
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Huh.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Very Zen, chilled out, nice, appropriate answer.

172
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,400
You had no arguments for four though.

173
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
No, that's crazy.

174
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
There you go.

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
All right, all right, fair enough.

176
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm a trailblazer.

177
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm happy to be on the bleeding edge of vacation planning thought.

178
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
You push the limits.

179
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Yeah.

180
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,120
The Hunter S. Thompson of vacationing.

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Yeah.

182
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I drove.

183
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,480
I was in a car with a bunch of people past Tokyo Disneyland on the way to the airport

184
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,720
leaving Japan.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,440
I was close enough that I saw the top of something.

186
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,500
Was it a castle?

187
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Was it the volcano?

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
I don't know.

189
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,760
It was like, oh, that's a piece of it I can kind of see.

190
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,160
That's as close as I got.

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
And that's a terrible feeling.

192
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
And that, oh, so you didn't go in.

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Oh, I didn't get to go.

194
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I didn't go in the park.

195
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
You just saw it's golden spires.

196
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Oh my God.

197
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,280
I was getting out of Japan in 36 hours.

198
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Wow.

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Wow.

200
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
That's the only time you've been to Japan.

201
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Yeah.

202
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
That's my only time.

203
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,400
So I was like within spitting distance of it, but I didn't get to go.

204
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
That's cool.

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Oh, bummer.

206
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
That's a nightmare.

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,160
That's a thing I would literally have a bad dream about.

208
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Yeah.

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
You weren't working.

210
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,560
You weren't like on some crazy like one crazy night.

211
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,920
No, I wasn't like my choice was like, you know, I'm going 36 hours.

212
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
That's how I'm going to do it.

213
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,640
That's just like the way to do it for me.

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm copying an episode of the layover with the Anthony Bourdain.

215
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,800
Well, I guess we can agree then 36 hours and not going in is the least optimal way to.

216
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah.

217
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
That's the worst way to do it.

218
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah.

219
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah.

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah.

221
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Okay.

222
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
But you're so you seem like you're you're pretty big parks guy.

223
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
We've known each other for a little bit.

224
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,000
And the fact that you it seems like you're a big Epcot.

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,360
I love Epcot.

226
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Not ironically, I want to make that clear.

227
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Yeah.

228
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,920
I mean, they're but because Epcot specifically, I think attracts some ironic love that is

229
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
genuine.

230
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,560
But like, you know, the like the you know, the Epcot Twitter account, for example, you

231
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
ever.

232
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, yeah.

233
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah.

234
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah.

235
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Yeah.

236
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah.

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah.

238
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Twitter account.

239
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
What's the tone of it?

240
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
I don't really know.

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
It doesn't it it claims to be the Twitter account for Epcot.

242
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,200
It doesn't break characters that that's a big piece of it.

243
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,720
And but it's the sort of absurdist things or sometimes just like someone lost a wallet.

244
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Yeah.

245
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,400
The bit is that it's like some dumpy park that no one wants to go to.

246
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,360
And there's like two guys that work there.

247
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
And it's like, I'm going to close up.

248
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
Not a lot of people in the park today.

249
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm closing up early, like stuff like that.

250
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,800
But yeah, I want to make it clear that while I do, I do follow that Twitter account and

251
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,200
I think I really just I'll take any Epcot content that I can.

252
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Yeah.

253
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
But it is a genuine love.

254
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Epcot was always my favorite park.

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
I went to Disney World a lot as a kid.

256
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
I lived in New Orleans.

257
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,800
And so it's not that far.

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
You would go would you go once a year?

259
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Would you go?

260
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
We would go we would go once a year.

261
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,080
We would drive a lot of the time.

262
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,360
It's one of those things where it's like close enough that to fly there takes almost as long

263
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,120
as to drive there just because airports just are such time sucking things.

264
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Yeah.

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,960
How long would it take to drive just out of curiosity?

266
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,000
Like a five hour drive.

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Not bad.

268
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, yeah, that's a Vegas.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,240
Oh, that's pretty good.

270
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,560
That's closer than any of us.

271
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,160
So yes, we would go every year for like like there was a nine year stretch where we went

272
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,960
every year.

273
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:57,760
And you and Epcot as a because I was so definitively a Disney MGM Studios kid, despite my recent

274
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,960
disparaging of it and what has what's become of the park.

275
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,440
But like I like weirdly as a kid, I think I found stuff to enjoy about Epcot, but I like

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,040
I was always in the other parks, even Magic Kingdom, kind of thinking about the next strike

277
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,880
at Disney MGM.

278
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,800
I was a big MGM fan, but I preferred Universal for my in that area theme park experience.

279
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
It felt more authentic.

280
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
You feel it.

281
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
That's really where you would ride the movies.

282
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Yeah.

283
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Faking it.

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Feel the heat.

285
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah, closer to him.

286
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,720
And yeah, no.

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,080
And I remember I remember going to the Nickelodeon studios.

288
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,520
I never got to go at Universal.

289
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I know you never did.

290
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,120
So when I went and I went on the tour, like there was a part where you could see the sound

291
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,240
stage and like, you know, at a certain point, it's like that's where all that is filmed

292
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
or whatever.

293
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,940
At this time, it was like that's where this is being rented out for the live action Mortal

294
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,520
Kombat TV show.

295
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Whoa.

296
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Really?

297
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I don't even remember what that is.

298
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:08,040
There was a like from the same like production company as the movies, I think there's a short

299
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,440
lived live action Mortal Kombat TV show.

300
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,240
It was a show on Saturday after the cartoons that was like not Mortal Kombat, but it was

301
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Ninja fights in a cage.

302
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Yeah.

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,800
It was kind of like, yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

304
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,520
I don't remember the name, but it was like a live action Street Fighter or like it was

305
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
not Mortal Kombat.

306
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,760
It was like a karate take on WWE.

307
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,720
Yes, anyway, that's the kind of real life film and television production, right?

308
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,000
Universal studios, even in Florida can bring you to close to an MGM.

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Never really had that.

310
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,920
Oh, but you, but you got the MMC, you got the Mickey mask club, which is a big, that

311
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
is true.

312
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,720
And the golden girls exterior, the house, the heart, like really quickly, they stopped

313
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
filming stuff.

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Thunder in paradise.

315
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,800
I think they, some of that stuff was down there.

316
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Oh boy.

317
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,840
And the intro of thunder thunder paradise, if you, if you don't know is a, like a Baywatch

318
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,080
ripoff that was starring Hulk Hogan.

319
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,360
Is he credited as like Terry Hulk Hogan, Balea, I think.

320
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah.

321
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,480
It's this one that was shot in the seven seas lagoon.

322
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,560
Yes, but it's supposed to be like paradise.

323
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,280
It's supposed to be what the Bahamas or the Caribbean or something.

324
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,880
And it's very clearly the grand Floridian resort in Orlando, Florida in the background.

325
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,720
There's also like a boat that changes.

326
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Like there's a.

327
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,840
There's like a sort of like a Knight Rider car kit, but a boat, it doesn't talk to you,

328
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,360
but it's like a fancy high tech vehicle in that same way.

329
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,080
With infinite room in the bottom, the scenes that are set in the, in the like interior

330
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,480
cabin of the boat.

331
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,660
There's so much space.

332
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
It's bonkers.

333
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,960
Have you and Evan Susser been approached to reboot thunder in paradise?

334
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
No, no.

335
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,760
Perhaps with a John Cena or a newer wrestler.

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,560
I don't think that was, was that a, a WWE associated production?

337
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
I don't think it was.

338
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,840
And Hulk Hogan would have stayed away from even wrestling again, if it was a hit.

339
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,880
He was, he was hoping he was done because he was hoping that was syndicated.

340
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,800
Like Baywatch, he could just ride that to a weird infinite Europe money.

341
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah, that didn't happen.

342
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,200
And he went back to WCW and he turned heel and the rest of that arc.

343
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh, okay.

344
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, interesting.

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,920
Now what became of Jack Lemmon's son who was also in the show?

346
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,440
Was that his like dinky sidekick?

347
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,600
Who's eerily Jack Lemmon looking.

349
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Like once you, once you're told it's Jack Lemmon's son, you just, you kind of can't

350
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
keep your eyes off.

351
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,240
Like, oh, it's such an optical illusion.

352
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,160
How Jack Lemmon-y he is.

353
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,080
Jack Lemmon's son also joined the NWO and turned heel after thunder in paradise.

354
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm mad about the cancellation.

355
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Damn it.

356
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Big faction.

357
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:50,760
Yeah, I would say my, my order of ranking the Disney World parks would be Epcot, then

358
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,800
MGM studios, then the magic kingdom, then animal kingdom.

359
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,260
I think most people would put animal kingdom at the bottom.

360
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Maybe not anymore.

361
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Not anymore.

362
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,640
I've heard it's gotten more popular lately.

363
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,840
I really, when they opened animal kingdom and killed all those animals, that, that is

364
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
a thing that happened.

365
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,320
The birds, they know when they opened animal kingdom, they were like not really prepared

366
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
to deal with keeping a bunch of animals alive.

367
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Oh right.

368
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Yeah.

369
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,520
And they quickly learned on their feet some about some mistakes in the way they were doing

370
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,600
things and like a lot of the animals died.

371
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeah.

372
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,720
Like a giraffe might not love the Orlando heat.

373
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,000
And that always, that, that soured the park for me.

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll be honest.

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,080
I mean, yeah, I get that.

377
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,560
I kind of scaled back on the there's real animals of it all in that park tremendously.

378
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,440
There are, I was there six months ago and there are a lot of animals there and it's,

379
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
it's still pretty crazy.

380
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,960
I mean, I know they, they used to, I think have a much more aggressive slate of animals,

381
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
maybe.

382
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah.

383
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,400
Well, that was a big thing they learned early on is that like the, the Safari where you

384
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,280
would see all the animals, if you went in the summer, they'd all be sleeping during

385
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,960
the day or like hunting for shade because it's just so ungodly hot.

386
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,360
But now do they breed like zebras who specifically are meant to be Orlando zebras?

387
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,960
I'm assuming there has been some genetic engineering going on where they've been, you know, what,

388
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
like a lizard or something.

389
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,120
They give them lizard DNA and that makes them stand up in the heat.

390
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,800
While we're going through the parks, let me just ask you guys not to take over the podcast.

391
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
No, no.

392
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Go for it.

393
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Can I ask you Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon?

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Huh?

395
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,760
Um, I, I haven't been to Typhoon Lagoon in years, but we just went to Blizzard Beach

396
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,360
like six months ago.

397
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,160
Uh, I think it's Blizzard Beach, even though Blizzard Beach is like saying Pizza Hut is

398
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,280
better pizza than like a local pizza place.

399
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,880
I think, I think Typhoon Lagoon is the classier, better choice.

400
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,640
But if you like kind of like gaudy crap, Blizzard, you can't go wrong with Blizzard Beach.

401
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,840
Kind of like, like reveling in its, uh, in its fakiness and silliness.

402
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Yes, it is.

403
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Blizzard Beach is the nineties.

404
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,920
You, they haven't changed a thing about it.

405
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
It is like that.

406
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Yeah, it's great.

407
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,560
It's teal and purple colors that Disney World.

408
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,040
And you're forgetting the lead ice skater, the mascot of Blizzard Beach.

409
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,400
Oh, the skier gator, ice gator, ice gator.

410
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Right.

411
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I like ice gator.

412
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,360
And then there's a Typhoon Lagoon gator who, I forget his name.

413
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,560
A real one that attacked a child.

414
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,600
I can't remember the Typhoon Lagoon gator's name.

415
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,240
You got that, you got that shit.

416
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,960
I thought you were lining up a joke and you're like, ah, and you like fade.

417
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
You just kept scrolling through.

418
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm trying to find it.

419
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,520
You're reading unrelated articles on CNN.com.

420
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,640
I'm just getting around to the, the Nunez.

421
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,920
Pictures of desserts on his iPad.

422
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,280
Uh, yeah, there, there are, there are gators for both parks, but, uh.

423
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,360
There's a cartoon gate, there's like a silly gator.

424
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,520
There's a cartoon gator, there's Park Stars gators for both parks.

425
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
I have those gators.

426
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Um, I will say this, as a child, we were not allowed to go to Blizzard Beach and Typhoon

427
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,080
Lagoon because my mom felt that they were too intense.

428
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
So we were a river country family.

429
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
River country.

430
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
We spent a lot of time in river country.

431
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,440
Not a lot of dangerous slides, not a lot of excitement.

432
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,880
Just Listeria, just the dangers of waterborne bacteria.

433
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,800
I did not catch that, but that was lurking at every turn.

434
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,000
There's a lot of video footage of me as it like an emaciated 12 year old, like trying

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
to climb across a rope.

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,600
Like there's a rope in the water and then it was very hard, but like it looks like my

437
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,640
arms are going to pop out of the socket.

438
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Oh, you see, I, when you say river country, isn't, uh, dangerous or exciting or whatever

439
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,920
with stuff like that, it's like a little more rough and tumble.

440
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
I feel like that's true in river country.

441
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,600
The gator is real.

442
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
There's just a real gator.

443
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah.

444
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,120
And he can also stand on his hind legs.

445
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,920
Terrifyingly gator for sure is living there now because river country has been closed

446
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,360
for many years and except for like an annoying backpack guy who finds his way in.

447
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh yeah.

448
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Of course.

449
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Sneaks in.

450
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
We are heading into actual ruins.

451
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I can't believe we're here.

452
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I can't believe we're here.

453
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Now I remember at one point they built, they were into doing like experience things and

454
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,120
they built a racetrack down there near Disney world.

455
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Is that still there?

456
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,400
Oh, we've never talked about that on the show.

457
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Was it a rich or petty?

458
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,520
Was it like, uh, it was like, it was on Disney's property.

459
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
It was like Disney controlled.

460
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Yeah, the NASCAR experience.

461
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
I think they, they teamed up with someone.

462
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,040
I don't know if that's still there.

463
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah.

464
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Was that true?

465
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I think so.

466
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Look that up so we don't know.

467
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah.

468
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
We don't start claiming deaths.

469
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Anyway, Disney's.

470
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,480
They wanted like all the whole wild, wide world of sports.

471
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
They were doing a lot of that.

472
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Yeah.

473
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
They had a lot of ambitious plans.

474
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,360
We're name checking maybe some things for the first, I don't think we've talked about

475
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,280
Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon on the podcast yet.

476
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,720
Certainly not the NASCAR track.

477
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
Have not talked about the Disney Institute.

478
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah.

479
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Sure.

480
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
And use this as a vernacular.

481
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
You speak at a mail, all of these things.

482
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
And probably a lot of hotels.

483
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,920
How about that?

484
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Any hotels?

485
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Yeah.

486
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Sure.

487
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I don't know if you stayed at the hotels or if you.

488
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,200
I've stayed at a bunch of the Disney World hotels.

489
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Highlights there?

490
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Yeah.

491
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Let's see.

492
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,800
Well, I'm a, I'm a yacht club and beach club.

493
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Agreed.

494
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,600
I, I, I prefer the beach club to the yacht club because I like the soda shop.

495
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Beaches and cream.

496
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Yeah.

497
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
But of course they're connected.

498
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
So it's easy to get back and forth.

499
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,080
You don't want to walk very far though.

500
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,800
I like, I just, I prefer it.

501
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,520
You know, if I'm going to pick between which one I'm hanging at.

502
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,640
I've never thought of the difference between the two.

503
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,120
I thought I think my knee jerk is I liked the yacht more than the beach club, but that's

504
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,160
cause I stayed there and not the other one.

505
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
So I don't know.

506
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I got nothing.

507
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,360
I ended up at, I don't know if I've talked about this on the podcast before, but the,

508
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,280
that was where I stayed my second trip and I was like nine or 10.

509
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,160
And then I ended up there when I was 14, 15, we were staying at the boardwalk, but then

510
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,360
the boardwalk was closed due to a hostage situation.

511
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Oh no.

512
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,600
A disgruntled employee barricaded another employee and their son.

513
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,960
It was a real piano duel with a SWAT team that came in.

514
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,420
It know this guy, like he, he was, he was like seeking custody of his son and was not

515
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,280
getting to see his kid.

516
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,600
And it was a, uh, yeah, he barricaded himself for, uh, uh, maybe close to 24 hours and they

517
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,720
had to relocate everybody in the hotel.

518
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,520
And Disney was very accommodating.

519
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,080
I remember they asked if there was any, I think they gave us like clothes and amenities

520
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,800
for free because it was at the arcade next to beaches and cream.

521
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:37,280
I left my wallet on top of the, uh, coin machine and someone took it.

522
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:46,600
I was about 10 years old and the Disney employees found the wallet a few weeks later or a week

523
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,000
later or so in the trash and mailed it to me back.

524
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Whoa.

525
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh yeah.

526
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Was anything left?

527
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,960
Uh, the money was gone, but I mean, a, a 10 year old's wallet has like the money your

528
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,480
mother just gave you and nothing else.

529
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Okay.

530
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Yeah.

531
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Um, and like something that had my address on it, I guess, or they knew that I had lost

532
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
it or something.

533
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Chuck E cheese tokens.

534
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,760
Perhaps, uh, that's a, that kind of great attention to a customer that you'll get at

535
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,880
the yacht and beach club.

536
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I guess so.

537
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Yeah.

538
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,400
I mean, there's examples of exasperating circumstances that the Disney employees alleviated.

539
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,760
No, but that's my favorite resort area because I like the proximity of the back Epcot entrance.

540
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,400
Oh, that's great.

541
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,880
If people don't know that, yeah.

542
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,360
Unlike Disneyland or the magic kingdom, which just has the one entrance that takes you down

543
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,840
main street Epcot added another entrance, a little secret one that's kind of only for

544
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,820
the international gateway, the international gateway that takes you.

545
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,320
It's what it's between the United Kingdom and France in the world show Paris area.

546
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,480
And it's boy, it's beautifully done.

547
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Great landscaping.

548
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,880
Those boats passing by, you know, nice at nights.

549
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Dim dim lighting.

550
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Uh, just to follow up on something earlier.

551
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Yes.

552
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,200
The Richard Petty driving experience was closed at Disney, uh, pretty much largely because

553
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,480
someone died on the track.

554
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,600
Uh, apparently the track, according to this Reuters article, uh, the track was, uh, uh,

555
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,280
meant to be cars.

556
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,760
I think we're meant to be driven counterclockwise around the track and they were running them

557
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,480
clockwise around the track and like whoever was running it did the wrong.

558
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Yeah.

559
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,720
That seems to be they hired a British guy later.

560
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I remember.

561
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Yeah.

562
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,800
I remember hearing about, and then they closed it and I think they like just bulldozed and

563
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,120
use it for like overflow parking or transportation parking and stuff.

564
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Here's this.

565
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,160
I, unless we want to talk about this horrible thing more.

566
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,640
I have a side thought.

567
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,440
We'll do a separate episode later.

568
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
This is interesting.

569
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,440
I, when we were at Blizzard beach in September and I have this same memory from years prior,

570
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,640
everyone at the water park is British.

571
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm not sure why.

572
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,360
When I say everyone, I mean maybe 90%, 80% maybe I, but like without fail, you would

573
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,520
walk by someone and hear an English accent.

574
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,040
And it was, there's a lot of English folks because they come, cause that's the proxy

575
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,440
one and they don't want to go to France cause we've heard it's bad.

576
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,920
You were there in August, right?

577
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Yeah.

578
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,720
I think that's traditionally the month for British holiday.

579
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Like, oh, is that right?

580
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,320
Everything shuts down and you're up for a month.

581
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Jolly holidays.

582
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Probably.

583
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,920
But especially the water park.

584
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
I found that interesting.

585
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,520
Maybe it's a rarity for a, for a British person.

586
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
I don't know.

587
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,480
If you know, if you're from England, please let us know.

588
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
It's not great.

589
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,040
Why do you go to water parks?

590
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Why do you go to water parks?

591
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
And do you like them?

592
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Do you love water parks?

593
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
And do you like-

594
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,160
And do you have a funny word for water park that's different than our word that you use?

595
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Yeah.

596
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Make sure you ask them that.

597
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Who I was asking.

598
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
And are you worried about-

599
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
You're asking them really.

600
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
You're saying it.

601
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
So you're asking.

602
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
That's fair.

603
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Yeah.

604
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I guess I'm asking.

605
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Yeah.

606
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,760
Well, but let's forge an international gateway here and head back to the, the wonderful land

607
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
of Africa.

608
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Yeah.

609
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,360
We've gone in that back entrance and now we've gone through World Showcase and now we're

610
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,920
going back in time.

611
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Wait to-

612
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
To some attractions that don't exist anymore.

613
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh, you mean to 1982.

614
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,320
Back in time to the future.

615
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
To the future.

616
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,080
To when the future began.

617
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:22,080
October has a shirt that I like says, October 1st, 1982, because we're talking about, well,

618
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,480
two attractions, eventually Food Rocks, but the original Kitchen Cabaret, which was an

619
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,440
opening day Epcot attraction.

620
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,800
It was part of the Land Pavilion, one of the future world attractions sponsored by Kraft

621
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Foods.

622
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,640
Van, we talked about a couple ideas for, for topics, especially in the Epcot arena and

623
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,400
the fact that you were willing to discuss, of all things, Kitchen Cabaret, Food Rocks.

624
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,240
Kitchen Cabaret was one of my favorite rides as a kid.

625
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,480
I call it a ride.

626
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
That's right.

627
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I call it a ride.

628
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,880
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's more of a show, but that's fine.

629
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,760
I like, it was on the, it was like a must do.

630
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,120
It was definitely on my Epcot must do list.

631
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Really?

632
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,880
I would, I loved it.

633
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,200
Where it, where, um, where on the list of Epcot?

634
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,920
Um, you know, the idea of Epcot, is it in the top five?

635
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Is it in the top 10?

636
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I mean, I think it always happened, but, uh, I, I would say it's in the top five.

637
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Maelstrom is my Epcot number one.

638
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Okay.

639
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Yeah.

640
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Condolences.

641
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Thank you.

642
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,200
I, and I'm, I'm, it's, I'm torn.

643
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I hear that.

644
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I haven't been on the new one.

645
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I hear it's great.

646
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
It is very good.

647
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,000
Uh, and it doesn't seem like they messed this one up.

648
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,440
Like if they were gonna, it's maybe in the ballpark.

649
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
It is cool.

650
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
And yeah, yeah.

651
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,720
The same, that same ride.

652
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,920
The idea of a ride being there in that part of Epcot is most of the, what appeals to me

653
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
about it to begin with.

654
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,320
So the changing of the theming is actually surprisingly not something that I think bothers

655
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
me that much.

656
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,720
I have a real thing about, uh, like, yeah, the, the, the rides are not big, big showy

657
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,840
buildings in Epcot, uh, including what we're talking about, Kitchen Cabaret.

658
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,680
It's kind of like down an escalator and in a little corner.

659
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,280
The idea that in Epcot, you don't know what's around what turn and that there's weird little

660
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,680
hidden rides you might miss entirely.

661
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,120
That Mexico boat ride is really deep in the back there.

662
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,680
I was not a fan of the land pavilion in general.

663
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Uh huh.

664
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,240
Cause we talked about that being the, the, the topic and then I, I've had you kind of

665
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,300
do, we, we, uh, we went back and forth.

666
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,840
We discussed that the land is probably its own thing outside of Kitchen Cabaret and Food

667
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Rocks and God help the poor guest that has to talk about the boat ride and the, uh, the

668
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
lobby.

669
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
What, what's left?

670
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,920
There's a food court.

671
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Now it's Soren.

672
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,200
Now Soren is in the land as well, which that's a separate thing.

673
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,000
We went on the boat ride, which is now called Living with the Land.

674
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah.

675
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Living with the Land.

676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And it's now an automated narrator.

677
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It used to be a guy or a girl on there giving you a spiel, giving you a little tour.

678
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,040
Uh, which I like as a kid.

679
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,800
Somebody name check for, if you don't know this ride, name check some things about this

680
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
ride about living with the land.

681
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,800
Well, uh, oh well, let's see.

682
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,000
You get to see some, uh, hydroponics, hydroponics.

683
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,480
You get to see some pictures.

684
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,720
You get to see some pictures of wheat and grain and grain being harvested and you get

685
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
to see, uh, what it looks like.

686
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,800
You get to see the facade of a farmhouse.

687
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Yeah.

688
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,400
What you also got to see in the classic Hershey chocolate world, uh, tour of the facade of

689
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
a farmhouse.

690
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Maybe I just liked rides where you saw the facade of a farmhouse.

691
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I believe that.

692
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah.

693
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,640
I felt to me like it was inexplicably a boat ride.

694
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Yeah.

695
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,880
Like, yeah.

696
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,920
What is the water element getting you?

697
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Yeah.

698
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Why are we in that?

699
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
It also, it's all you're on a boat.

700
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,240
Like, well, what, like pirates of the Caribbean, it's about pirates and pirate ships.

701
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
Right.

702
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,040
So you're on a port town and it kind of makes down a logic to, but in the land pavilion

703
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
you're on the water.

704
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah.

705
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
That's not land.

706
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Yeah.

707
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm not, I'm not really, I'm sure there's some nerd imagineer who really like bent over

708
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,760
backwards to justify why water, you know, water makes the land what it is or something.

709
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,280
We take from the water and fertilize the land you see.

710
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,040
And then also you soar over the land and that's why Soarin is in the land.

711
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,200
None of it makes any sense.

712
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yeah.

713
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
And then there's kind of a mission.

714
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,040
It doesn't make any sense what we're talking about today to be in the land.

715
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
It doesn't make sense.

716
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
You're right.

717
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah.

718
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

719
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
They're food.

720
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,240
Food comes from the land.

721
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Yeah, but it's not.

722
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,760
But then like, you know, a lot of the food you see in these shows are like processed,

723
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,520
which I guess it still comes from the land, but it's not all like, you know, farm grown.

724
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
If it was like in a farm.

725
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,960
As much as I love it is a victim of the craft food sponsorship.

726
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:05,040
More than, more than, than I think in the, the, between the universe of energy sponsorship

727
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,760
and the land, I actually think that this is the worst food did a worse, like as far as

728
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,960
like the information again, I love kitchen cover, but the nutritional information contained

729
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,960
in the ride and in food rocks is very much a craft foods propaganda.

730
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,640
Well, look, I think processed has a lot of negative connotations attached to it.

731
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
I think I would say dairy representation.

732
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,320
I would say handmade with love by our good friends at craft and later Nestle Nestle took

733
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
over sponsorship.

734
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,360
Yeah, Jason took notes during this ride and basically based his whole childhood diet.

735
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,720
I was a big cheese boy, big bread boy.

736
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,280
They missed the hot dog group though.

737
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,680
A big part of the food pyramid left out.

738
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,160
Jason, I think you said a couple of years ago that it was like 2009 when you realized

739
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
cheese wasn't good for you.

740
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Cheese and bread.

741
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Yeah.

742
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
I think like, I agree.

743
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Like I didn't know that.

744
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,640
The food pyramid that bread is the base of?

745
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
The food pyramid.

746
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
I looked into that.

747
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
That's the one that, yeah.

748
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
My notes.

749
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,120
That's why Nestle plays a big part in this.

750
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Yeah.

751
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Yes.

752
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,720
But those are themselves like from lobbying and those are propaganda for, but anyway.

753
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Yeah.

754
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Yeah.

755
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,800
I do have the food pyramid with me in case that serves any function, but this ride, so

756
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,520
the entire pavilion is sponsored by craft and this is a show where food comes to life

757
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,440
and sings to you and sort of presents what a balanced meal might be in some regard.

758
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Yeah.

759
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
The four basic foods.

760
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
The four food groups.

761
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,760
Which was the way they thought about nutrition at the time.

762
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
In 1982.

763
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,320
And this was not the case by the time 1992 rolled around, but yeah, this is originally

764
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,200
a show where the four basic food groups come to life and are sort of brought to life by

765
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,080
a host who's down on her luck and can't decide what to make for herself.

766
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,040
We don't know who it's for.

767
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,400
No families mentioned.

768
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
No.

769
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,080
It's very light on even a hint of a story or a backstory.

770
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,880
Like on Carousel of Progress, they flesh out the family.

771
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,180
This they, who knows?

772
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,960
So this character, sorry, you were probably going to say Bonnie Appetite.

773
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,760
Bonnie Appetite is the name of this character.

774
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,680
What is Bonnie Appetite?

775
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Is she a human?

776
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,080
Is she a doll?

777
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Is she a puppet?

778
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,080
She does look like-

779
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,120
She's not as big as a human.

780
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,000
She's probably three feet tall.

781
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah.

782
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,640
That's an interesting question.

783
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
She looks like one of the Thunderbirds.

784
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,160
She's a puppet.

785
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,680
I would say she is a puppet.

786
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,960
If you asked her, she would say, I am a puppet.

787
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm a puppet woman.

788
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,480
She looks related to the Spectre Man, the doll face people.

789
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,400
I would say that's not her kitchen.

790
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
You don't think so?

791
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,560
But you are in a kitchen.

792
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,040
Well, this is a cabaret show also.

793
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,800
So are we talking about her in the show or her real life?

794
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,360
Well, that's a great question.

795
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
So I mean, I think-

796
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,560
Because Bonnie Appetite is probably a stage name like Marilyn Monroe.

797
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
There's a real woman.

798
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,520
Like, I guess if we really broke it down, Carousel of Progress, I feel, is actually

799
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,280
you're seeing this man in his real life and in the different stages of progress.

800
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
This is a show.

801
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,440
This is a show and you do the lobby of the show was like a fake city.

802
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Yeah.

803
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,880
I, in my mind, and again, I'm just bringing a lot of this to it.

804
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,960
That's fair.

805
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:41,160
Kitchen cabaret is like a Toy Story-esque world where people might eat in this kitchen,

806
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,920
that food like comes to life and puts on this show.

807
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,360
Sure.

808
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,680
My theory is sort of that it's kind of a, well, let's be honest, the cabaret show is

809
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
a little bit sexy.

810
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Oh, it is.

811
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I agree.

812
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,800
And this show, for whatever reason, is like has a little bit sexy.

813
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,360
Like they're trying to do that.

814
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,840
So it seems almost like-

815
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,960
There are a few sexy characters.

816
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Yes.

817
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,720
Based on some of the most classic sex pots of all time.

818
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,600
You're Mae West's.

819
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I don't remember.

820
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
The one's kind of like a French sex kitten.

821
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Earth's kitten.

822
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Oh, there you go.

823
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Earth's the kitten.

824
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
So yeah.

825
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,840
So I mean, this seems like a show you would see at a burlesque house, but instead of women,

826
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,520
it's talking cheese or some ice cream.

827
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,080
And you've got a vaudeville comedy act in there to break up the sexy acts.

828
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
That's right.

829
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,200
And all the, I mean, this is a little outdated because all the women characters, very sexualized,

830
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,480
none of the men are.

831
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
So that's probably why.

832
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Oh yeah.

833
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,360
Nothing sexy but ham or eggs.

834
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Yeah.

835
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,120
They're also doing performances of music styles that were anachronistic in 1982.

836
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Yeah.

837
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,240
And this is why I did not like this attraction even as a child.

838
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Too much theming.

839
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Too many layers.

840
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Too many levels.

841
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,040
No, no, no.

842
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
The music actually.

843
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, you just didn't like it.

844
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,520
I will play into what probably what they were thinking when they replaced this show.

845
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,880
They probably thought kids don't know what this kind of music is, but in my case, I would

846
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,280
have said that on the survey.

847
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
They're right.

848
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,520
I don't relate to, I don't like, I don't like boogie woogie.

849
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,760
I don't like killer boogie boogie bugle boy parody.

850
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,320
So if you were six in the late eighties, which I guess they've brought that song back in

851
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
many different commercials.

852
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,800
And I think there's been revivals of that song, a different version.

853
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,080
The Andrews Sisters exist entirely as parodies now.

854
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,480
It's one of those things where nobody knows the original.

855
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
It's just a reference point.

856
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,120
But Christina Aguilera sampled it on some song.

857
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Oh yeah.

858
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Candy man.

859
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Yes, there you go.

860
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Thank you.

861
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:50,520
So do we also, just before we get too far, have we conveyed that this is, this is a robot

862
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
show.

863
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
This is an animatronic show.

864
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes.

865
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
It's not unlike Country Bears.

866
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,400
Yeah, not unlike Country Bears.

867
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,120
It's like a really, really expensive version of a showbiz pizza show.

868
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
I, I.

869
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Many more characters.

870
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
I don't know that it's that expensive.

871
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, just, I was watching it today.

872
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
More elaborate.

873
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,040
Yeah, the robots make less clanking noise as they jerk about.

874
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,440
It looks cheap.

875
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,320
It looks very cheap in a lot of ways.

876
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Well, now hold on.

877
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,760
Sorry, I don't want to offend you, but that's.

878
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,720
I don't, I think it might not hold up well on video, but I think in person.

879
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Okay, possibly.

880
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,080
I think it may be looked a little better because I think puppetry often looks much better in

881
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,480
person than on a video.

882
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I think that's fair.

883
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,120
There's less layer of removal.

884
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,440
People's recollections of both these shows.

885
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,720
The consensus seems to be that Food Rocks looked a lot cheaper.

886
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Yes.

887
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Than Kitchen Cabaret.

888
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,600
Now, I always liked the music more in Food Rocks.

889
00:36:50,600 --> 00:37:01,680
Food Rocks is a, it's, it's, you know, it's one of a long line of Disney kind of re, redo's

890
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,520
that are where they kind of just kind of half a little bit of a phoned in redo.

891
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,280
So we'll, we'll say quickly, just Food Rocks basically is a bit of a re-imagining using

892
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,880
like, I guess they're not all, they're not modern songs, but they're pop songs and rock

893
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,600
songs and more recent than like Plasmer, like the kind of sort of weird genres that they're

894
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,960
using in Kitchen Cabaret.

895
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,160
And sort of the framing device is a benefit concert, but not for any charity for just

896
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,480
eating properly.

897
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,800
Eating in moderation.

898
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,440
But they put rock music into this show and it basically was, even if you, if you like

899
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,200
Food Rocks more content wise, it clearly is on the shoulders of Kitchen Cabaret.

900
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,960
The whole section is in the same place.

901
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,980
Kitchen Cabaret within Food Rocks.

902
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,280
Like there were certain parts of the show, similar to how when they redid the Tiki Room,

903
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,000
they would play like a section of the Tiki Room.

904
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
As exactly as it used to be.

905
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,000
There were, there's some stuff in Food Rocks that are like reminiscent of.

906
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,160
Some of the same rigging, the bands are in the same spots on the stage.

907
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,880
This one comes down from the top.

908
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,000
There's a fridge in the same spot still.

909
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,880
The dairy animatronics are the main ones that came back.

910
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
The milk came back.

911
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes, the milk.

912
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,120
How do we, how do we tackle this?

913
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I think we got to go back to food.

914
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Milk was my favorite.

915
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Yeah, let's go back to Kitchen Cabaret.

916
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,280
And we'll go through the show a little bit.

917
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Okay.

918
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,720
So when you eat an Appetit, you meet a forlorn woman who is bemoaning another meal to cook.

919
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,640
And what am I going to do?

920
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,240
What a hell this modern world is trying to figure out the foods we have to prepare in

921
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
1982.

922
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,480
But her solution becomes what?

923
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,680
Like just getting some food around?

924
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,280
Like I don't think, the song she sings, the blues, does anybody have it in front of them?

925
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I have it all, yeah.

926
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
I have the whole show in front of me.

927
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,800
What does the song teach her to where she's no longer feeling down on her luck about having

928
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
to make a meal?

929
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
I mean, here, I'll just quickly breeze through this.

930
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,480
And then she says, it's time for another meal.

931
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,840
Yes, there are days when I feel downcast and get the Mealtime Blues.

932
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,480
And if I don't get a proper meal, my menu will be bad news, which I don't know if that's

933
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,520
like she's preparing it for a person or not.

934
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,200
She said, oh, the Mealtime Blues can get you every time you dine.

935
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,460
But when we, but we all can beat that rap and end up feeling fine.

936
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,200
So on those days when we feel downcast, I'll give you all some clues to work magic in our

937
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
kitchen.

938
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Mmm, yeah.

939
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,280
And chase away the Mealtime Blues.

940
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
Now the timing's right.

941
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,800
The show is prepared.

942
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,760
Let me serve it on up to you.

943
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,920
And then she says, okay, crackpots, let's get cooking.

944
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Oh yeah.

945
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
So she doesn't learn anything.

946
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Yeah.

947
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,000
She just kind of shuts up and does.

948
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,500
She remembers that all the food and utensils talk and I'll just have them prepare this

949
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
meal, I guess.

950
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,560
Or not, or they just sing and then no meal is made.

951
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,840
I mean to map on her first song to the movie, the musical cabaret, that sort of, the Mealtime

952
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Blues is kind of like Velkomen that the MC sings.

953
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,120
And then the action unfolds, then the show starts.

954
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,760
Are they similar in general?

955
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,720
Do these plots continue to map?

956
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I wouldn't pretend to know cabaret.

957
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,600
No, there's zero Nazis in kitchen cabaret.

958
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,000
I think, but oddly there are in Food Rocks.

959
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yes there are.

960
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The excess.

961
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Excess the three mean.

962
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
They're worse than the Nazis, guys.

963
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,200
I associated them more with like a kiss kind of like hard rock band.

964
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,600
What I'm saying is that they're villains in history.

965
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
We'll not judge them kindly.

966
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,240
Oh okay, you think Heavy Excess is evil.

967
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,240
The rotting food that tries to mess up Food Rapper's show.

968
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Yeah.

969
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah.

970
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,320
We'll get to, I'll save my malice for the excess for later.

971
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,840
Okay, so this, the single stage that she's on opens up and a whole, a whole world of

972
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,680
singing food in a kitchen comes out.

973
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,640
The, the band is called the crackups.

974
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
What are they?

975
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
The crackpots.

976
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
The kitchen crackpots.

977
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
The kitchen crackpots.

978
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,440
Who plays in the kitchen crackpots?

979
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
I know there's like a.

980
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Yes.

981
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
So there's.

982
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
There's a mayonnaise drummer.

983
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,640
Yeah, there's mayonnaise is playing the drums.

984
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,360
I can't make out who the, who's playing like banjo.

985
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
There's a Parmesan cheese.

986
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,040
There's a bottle of mustard.

987
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,200
There's a bottle of ketchup playing a whisk.

988
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,480
So what I think is interesting is that there's a lot of like real instruments and then ketchup

989
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,520
is just playing a whisk and he's got like a face on like he knows like he's like this

990
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
is not a real instrument.

991
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
What's a whisk?

992
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
You mean like what you cook up?

993
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Yeah like beating eggs.

994
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Like you would.

995
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Beating eggs.

996
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Oh okay.

997
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,480
But the whisk is not animatron, the whisk is not anamorphic.

999
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
The whisk is not alive.

1000
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Anthropomorphic is what you're saying.

1001
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Anthropomorphic.

1002
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
No, no, no.

1003
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
The instruments aren't alive, are they?

1004
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
No.

1005
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
No.

1006
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
No, no.

1007
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
The whisk is different than the instruments.

1008
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
I'm saying.

1009
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,480
I'm trying to figure out the, yeah, because it's a kitchen item.

1010
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Would the whisk be alive?

1011
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,640
I think the whisk is a dead anthropomorphic whisk that he's taken and he's playing a

1012
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
corpse.

1013
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Are there kitchen tools?

1014
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Am I forgetting?

1015
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Like knives aren't alive in the kitchen cabinet.

1016
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
No, no.

1017
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
But bottles are.

1018
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Yeah, bottles are.

1019
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, I think by virtue of them being food and having.

1020
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,560
I have a whole, okay, yeah, this is my question in general.

1021
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,120
I think I'm not just in a kitchen cabaret, but in many things I'm weirded out by food

1022
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,320
that's alive and food that's encouraging you to eat it.

1023
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Yeah.

1024
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I find it just odd in general.

1025
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,720
And why is that?

1026
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,440
As opposed to the toys and Toy Story come to life and they want to be played with the

1027
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,720
goal.

1028
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,840
Food convincing a human to eat you.

1029
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Kill me.

1030
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
End this.

1032
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,400
Send me to hell.

1033
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,840
All food is suicidal.

1034
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,800
But I also have some anatomical questions.

1035
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,320
For example, one of the first numbers in the show is led by a milk carton and who sings

1036
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,560
next to a big piece of cheese.

1037
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,800
And if, okay, an alive milk carton, I guess their skin is the carton.

1038
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:04,040
And the flap, obviously that you tear is the mouth and I guess the milk is its blood.

1039
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,280
But if you're in a live cheese with no outer wrapping, you just are the cheese.

1040
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,320
Then how does that work?

1041
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
There's no skin.

1042
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
You just don't have skin.

1043
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
You're one bin.

1044
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
What's your blood?

1045
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,880
I feel like there's inconsistency.

1046
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
It's different for each care.

1047
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,640
I mean, I think I feel like I know exactly the answer to this.

1048
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,840
It's different for each of them because they're all different species.

1049
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,960
So the milk, obviously the skin is the carton and inside the blood is the milk itself.

1050
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,480
So we're drinking the milk's blood.

1051
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,120
And by the way, the character's name is Mr. Dairy Goods.

1052
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,800
So we're drinking Mr. Dairy Goods' blood when we're drinking his milk.

1053
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,640
Miss Cheese you're talking about, which that's that character's name.

1054
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,440
They have a name, you know.

1055
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,940
Her skin is the cheese.

1056
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,080
And then her insides are also cheese.

1057
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
Also cheese, yes.

1058
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,720
But then this brings up a larger question.

1059
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,240
Is Bonnie closer to us humans or is Bonnie closer to the food animatron?

1060
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,720
I think she is like a, I think she's a doll.

1061
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,760
I think she reminds me of the.

1062
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
She certainly is.

1063
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,160
No one's arguing that.

1064
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,280
If you remember the parade Spectro Magic, the Night Shyam Show, there were the doll

1065
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,960
faced Spectro Men that frightened me as a child.

1066
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,520
They would ride on giant glowing light up balls.

1067
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,680
Some character's name the doll faced Spectro Men.

1068
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,960
I call them doll faced.

1069
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,400
They were just called the Spectro Men.

1070
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,320
But yeah, I did not like.

1071
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,040
They kind of look like they have the strangers mask or the purge masks that look like human

1072
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,840
faces but are clear.

1073
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,080
Bonnie reminds me of that.

1074
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,040
Bonnie has a doll like face that I still find unnerving.

1075
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,040
And she has big eyes.

1076
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,040
Let's not forget that.

1077
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,960
Like the film Big Eyes.

1078
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,760
One of the issues with these characters is that they are not a consistent scale inside

1079
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
of this kitchen.

1080
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
That's true too.

1081
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,120
They aren't the size that their food is necessarily.

1082
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,920
Relative to each other, yeah.

1083
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,560
I guess that makes sense if you think of her conundrum of preparing food as a nightmare.

1084
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,400
The dream states we all go into.

1085
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,120
Things are odd sizes and odd shapes and sing at us.

1086
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,080
As she's singing the blues, having to prepare a meal, instead of preparing a meal, she goes

1087
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,880
into this waking nightmare and that's what we're watching in Kitchen Cat, right?

1088
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,480
So in this scene, this is the second scene in the show and that we were talking about

1089
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,280
Miss Cheese is in that, Mr. Dairy Goods, Miss Yogurt, Miss Ice Cream.

1090
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,320
Now Miss Yogurt, her head is like a puff of yogurt.

1091
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Yes, that's correct.

1092
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,320
And the rest of her body, I can't think of it off the issue.

1093
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:49,480
And this is another, if a jug of milk was alive, then the jug is there.

1094
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,560
But Cheese is milk also.

1095
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,760
Cheese is hardened milk.

1096
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,400
Well I guess I understand your guys' internal logic.

1097
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,560
But what if it's a cheese that comes in a wrapper, like a brie?

1098
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,640
The wrapper is the skin.

1099
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,760
And if you take the wrapper off, then you're taking the skin off of the...

1100
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,280
You're ripping the skin off of a person, of an animal.

1101
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,760
A cheese animal.

1102
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,960
But then you aren't killing it, you aren't eating it.

1103
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,200
Right, there's more different than us.

1104
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,400
So the brie outside of the paper wouldn't regenerate new eyes or anything.

1105
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,600
No, it's eyeless from now.

1106
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,040
Michael, do you have any index cards, red yarn and thumbtacks, and we can figure this

1107
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
out?

1108
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,040
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1109
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,920
No, we'll put the podcast on hold and we'll really hunker down on this.

1110
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,080
That conspiracy wall on our Twitter.

1111
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,280
Here's what I want to talk about.

1112
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,600
How horny these women are.

1113
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,080
Miss Cheese, Miss...

1114
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
They are...

1115
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,480
Here, let me read some of the lines.

1116
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,400
So Miss Cheese says, your taste buds all appease.

1117
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,080
I know how to please.

1118
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,760
It's known that I'm too good for words.

1119
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,160
Wait, are we onto Dairy Goods and his Stars of the Milky Way?

1120
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
Yes.

1121
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Okay.

1122
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
What are you talking about?

1123
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Yeah, we fucking are, Jason.

1124
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,160
We've been talking about this for 10 minutes.

1125
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
Well, we spent a lot of time about the Kitchen Crackpots.

1126
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,160
We were talking about cheese and yogurt.

1127
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
Okay, you're right.

1128
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
The Kitchen Crackpots are great musicians.

1129
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
They play beats and tuna cans very handily.

1130
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,160
Now we've moved on to Mr. Dairy.

1131
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,160
I was distracted thinking about this horrifying Spectro Man.

1132
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,260
How many times in the therapist's office have you been to a

1133
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:24,640
phrase, doll face Spectro Man?

1134
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:33,200
Jason will be silent for half hour stretches of the rest of the podcast and then just suddenly

1135
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,000
start screaming and writhing.

1136
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,440
Doll face Spectro Man.

1137
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,320
So Miss Yogurt, here's what she's...

1138
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,600
Your palate is assured I'm really quite cultured.

1139
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,640
Make a sourd scene okay each and every day.

1140
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,240
So she's a little less thirsty.

1141
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,240
But Miss Ice Cream, I'm cool through and through and I've got a double scoop for you to be

1142
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,760
with me, baby.

1143
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,960
It's such a tasty treat.

1144
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,800
Like this is crazy.

1145
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
That's the way to my heart.

1146
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,160
This is not terribly scandalized by these lyrics.

1147
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,840
I was expecting a lot worse as you went.

1148
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,500
Van, please help me out here.

1149
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
This is crazy.

1150
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Ice Cream is a tasty treat.

1151
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
It is.

1152
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,000
And then it was just like Ice Cream, hey everybody take a big bite of me.

1153
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,720
That's what you wanted, a wholesome theme park.

1154
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,560
But you think tasty it's too...

1155
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,400
I think it was a different time.

1156
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,920
She's got the come hither look on her ice cream face.

1157
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,960
I think that it would have been perhaps inappropriate for something set contemporaneously and made

1158
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,820
in 1982 and worthy of criticism.

1159
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:42,600
But I think in 1982, I think it was still very, very okay to reference things that were

1160
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,680
maybe sexist from the past when referencing the past and then recreate them in the present.

1161
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,800
That's like too many layers of problematic.

1162
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,360
I'm just saying this is maybe PG13 material for a young person.

1163
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,920
I think it's so wrapped in innuendo and like, yeah, little nods to like...

1164
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,760
Just like the kid in Carousel of Progress who's like watching the Hoochie Coochie.

1165
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,360
And we know if it's in Carousel in Progress, it's the progress, it's perfect.

1166
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,360
Yeah, there's no other global standard to it.

1167
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,720
They're very concerned with progress.

1168
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,120
I guess they're all about.

1169
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
Yeah.

1170
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,280
I mean, I guess you also, we've said this a couple of times, this is something for dad,

1171
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
I guess as well.

1172
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Yeah.

1173
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,600
I think this is an air conditioned room.

1174
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,600
Yes.

1175
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,600
And that's also...

1176
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,600
In fact.

1177
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,720
Epcot was full of, and it still is full of air conditioned rooms.

1178
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,040
I want to point out that the room itself, if you think about the size of it, it's about

1179
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,880
the size and shape of a porno theater.

1180
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,480
You know, it doesn't quite have enough seats for a full movie theater seating.

1181
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,960
Couldn't do the full screening of Black Panther there.

1182
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,480
Couldn't fit in the giant Blockbuster audience.

1183
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,040
And shows that repeat all day on a loop.

1184
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,040
You go down to Santa Monica, so there's one or two, Santa Monica Boulevard, there's one

1185
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,960
or two that are still hanging on.

1186
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,240
You're going to see about the size of this room.

1187
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
Yeah.

1188
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,440
It's like a 50 seats, right?

1189
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Yeah.

1190
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
50 seat theater here?

1191
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,440
Something like that.

1192
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Yeah.

1193
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,840
So this is also because it's a theater show, there's not a height restriction to go on

1194
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
it.

1195
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,840
Right.

1196
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,880
So this is a ride that attracts a younger crowd for that reason.

1197
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Yes.

1198
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,720
But people of all ages, I guess, can enjoy it on different levels.

1199
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,400
I guess that is what great entertainment is.

1200
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,800
You know, if you really break it down.

1201
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Thank you.

1202
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Do we know?

1203
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Do we know?

1204
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
I don't know.

1205
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,880
I know the research on this podcast is its strong suit.

1206
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:47,200
Do we know, like, was the show itself, like, was craft involved at all in the making of

1208
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
the show?

1209
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,400
I know sometimes with the pavilions, they're more directly involved.

1210
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,960
I knew that the the land pavilion initially was insanely elaborate.

1211
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,200
It was going to be like glass spires, like essentially a functioning bio like in the

1212
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,840
early blue sky stages.

1213
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,160
And I think pretty quickly they realized, like, oh, this would be the most expensive

1214
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,160
thing.

1215
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,160
Oh, you know what?

1216
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,920
I think also might have come out of that.

1217
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,120
I think I saw that same source as you.

1218
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:18,920
And there was another sponsor that was not craft, which is why they wanted to do this

1219
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,880
big biosphere kind of vibe.

1220
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,480
But then when craft ended up being the sponsor, they didn't care about any of that because

1221
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,120
they are a food company and they wanted to do the food centric attractions and shows,

1222
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,680
which is probably where you get Kitchen Cabaret to begin with.

1223
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
Yeah.

1224
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,680
But in terms of them calling out specific items, I don't know.

1225
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:43,320
There's one thing I know, which is that though Nestle becoming the sponsor in 1982, spurred

1226
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:49,600
the change into Food Rocks, there was a brief interim period where it was Nestle, but Kitchen

1227
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,600
Cabaret was still running and there was only one change, which is that the mayonnaise jar

1228
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,600
playing the drums was repainted to become a tomato sauce jar playing the drums.

1229
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
OK.

1230
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,480
So Nestle did dictate that.

1231
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,760
So hey, send us your photos.

1232
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,400
If you were there in the rare, that's like some like Superman misprint or something.

1233
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,560
That's backwards Penny kind of a situation.

1234
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,840
You saw tomato sauce jar wailing away on those cans.

1235
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,040
I would be curious to read like an Epcot book because it's such an odd confluence of like

1236
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,280
Disney Imagineers corporate interests and then like, well, Futurist, Buckminster Fuller

1237
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,280
and Ray Bradbury.

1238
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Kitchen Cabaret specifically.

1239
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,800
There are a couple of Epcot things that remind me of this, but it feels like it kind of comes

1240
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,080
from the tradition of industrials, you know, about these.

1241
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080
Yeah.

1242
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
Oh, like the industrial musicals.

1243
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,080
That were put on by major corporations in like the 40s, 50s, 60s up really through the

1244
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
80s.

1245
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,080
Not really.

1246
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,560
But you had full Broadway casts and songwriters.

1247
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
There's a bulls out.

1248
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,760
This was like the this was branded content for like 1940.

1249
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,760
Yeah.

1250
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Yeah.

1251
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,840
What it was, was it would be four year like you would be Ford and you would have all these

1252
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,320
car dealerships that sold your Ford cars and you'd have a convention every year and all

1253
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,160
of you would ever all the car dealerships would come and that's where they'd learn about

1254
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,800
the cars they were selling for that year.

1255
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,200
And at that convention, a show would be performed and these were called industrials and these

1256
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:19,640
were custom made musicals like about Ford, like for a Ford crowd of people who like did

1257
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,840
business with Ford.

1258
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,960
And these were kind of big across industries at that time.

1259
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,560
Like produced, really like talented people writing and performing.

1260
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,760
People who would be in the like full cast, not maybe the star of a Broadway musical,

1261
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,700
but somebody who would be like in the cast of a Broadway musical, but not the star.

1262
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,120
Those are kind of people who would be taking these industrial jobs doing these performances.

1263
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
Anyway, weird.

1264
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,520
And they weren't very well, I have a book about that.

1265
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,320
It's called everything's coming up profits.

1266
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Yeah.

1267
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
That's a great book.

1268
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,040
The guy who wrote that was a Letterman writer.

1269
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Yeah.

1270
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Whoa.

1271
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,760
And it's such an odd, like he spent years researching this stuff because it wasn't preserved.

1272
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,120
Like he would just have, the people would happen to find like the scripts and file cabinets

1273
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,120
or an LP with the music.

1274
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,480
But anyway, kitchen cabaret reminds me of those.

1275
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,520
A lot of those were parody type things where it would sort of be like a.

1276
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,440
And maybe sort of like a little like inside nods to the companies that they were playing

1277
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,120
to and huh, huh.

1278
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
So it was a way.

1279
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,040
And with Epcot being a world's fair and corporate sponsorship is kind of inherent in that it's

1280
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,560
a way to have a show like that happening all day, every day.

1281
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,080
Because robots do it and not struggling Broadway stars.

1282
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,080
Weird.

1283
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,080
Interesting.

1284
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Yeah.

1285
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,640
And it seems like, because like it's ice cream, it's yogurt.

1286
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,220
Obviously it's very like specific stuff.

1287
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,220
They probably had some.

1288
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:50,600
There doesn't seem to be as much like backstory, at least from the lazy research I tried to

1289
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,880
do earlier this afternoon.

1290
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,600
Who wrote this is what I want to know.

1291
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Who wrote this music?

1292
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,200
I haven't seen a lot of names of voices or anything.

1293
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,680
I can't find a lot of the voices.

1294
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,000
Who voiced ham and eggs?

1295
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
They're great.

1296
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That's a killer comedy duo.

1297
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Ham and eggs are pretty fun.

1298
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah.

1299
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,200
And you know, that's, that is something that, you know, there's a lot of recurring voices

1300
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,280
that you recognize.

1301
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,200
You know, the Buffalo head is in country bears is somebody a voice that you've heard in pirates

1302
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,560
or whatever it is.

1303
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,560
And none of these voices are a voice you've heard anywhere else in another Disney attraction.

1304
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:26,080
There's no, and I also don't think that the, the animatronics in either show looks particularly

1305
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,200
Disney S. No, I agree with you.

1306
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,160
I think that might be a thing that holds me back from both of these attractions.

1307
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,080
They don't feel super Disney to me.

1308
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,640
These feel, um, you know, that was always, it's a small world.

1309
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,240
You could always kind of feel that about it.

1310
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,240
Right.

1311
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,240
It did.

1312
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,240
It's a little different.

1313
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
It's not the house style of animatronics.

1314
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,640
It's not in the house style of Disney animatronics.

1315
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Right.

1316
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,480
Like you would see, like you were like, they would have done this, this would look differently

1317
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,200
if it had started its life as a Disney attraction.

1318
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,360
Like the, the, just the kind of the way it's done isn't quite the way they do things.

1319
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:03,000
In food rocks, some of the people doing the parody songs are the people who did the songs.

1320
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh, absolutely.

1321
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,040
Tony Loak, Neil Zdaka, the Pointer Sisters.

1322
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,320
Oh, well, yeah, we'll give them their due.

1323
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,640
The show, I said this before, the show feels cheap.

1324
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,120
The show feels like a show.

1325
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,000
I, there, and this, maybe this is a, this is something that's, this is a side note,

1326
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,920
but it's haunted me for years now.

1327
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:25,040
Uh, there was a Little Caesars that was right where I grew up and it was a giant Chuck E.

1328
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,160
Cheese style play place.

1329
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,480
I don't know if you guys ever had these.

1330
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,480
Hold on.

1331
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,240
I've only ever known Little Caesars to be a run in counter and you get it and you leave.

1332
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,500
No, no, no, no, no.

1333
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,880
There was a place, it was called Little Caesars and eventually it was called Caesar land when

1334
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,760
they like revamped it and made it all tubes and ball pits.

1335
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
It was a big place.

1336
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
I loved it.

1337
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,040
They had rides, they had arcades, they had a place to play in and they had these little

1338
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,480
like animatronic like you would, you would hit a button and garlic bread would just laugh

1339
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
at you.

1340
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,400
And then there would be like a Little Caesar and you hit a button and he'd go, hi, I'm

1341
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,240
Little Caesar and I'm glad you could be here today.

1342
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,240
And that's it.

1343
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
And that was a giant thing.

1344
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:11,240
This is a shocking revelation.

1345
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,240
Yeah.

1346
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,240
I am trying to find documentation.

1347
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,160
This exists that many people have backed me up.

1348
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,840
I'm not crazy, but there's no documentation of it.

1349
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,840
It is gone.

1350
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,360
It's now some sort of fruit market.

1351
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,880
What's the location here?

1352
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
It's in Schaumburg.

1353
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,840
I'll give you my home address if you want, but it was a Schaumburg, Illinois.

1354
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,960
And it's, I cannot find any pictures of it.

1355
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,680
I'm just wanting to remember to see if my memory of it is exactly as it was.

1356
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,280
But that's all I'm, my point is kitchen cabaret feels like stuff I saw at this place, which

1357
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,120
was, I loved it, but obviously much cheaper when you compare it to some sort of Disney

1358
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
ride.

1359
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
Not the same quality.

1360
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,520
So I want to almost start a mutiny to make the rest of the episode about Caesar land

1361
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,800
and stop talking about kitchen cabaret.

1362
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,040
I have life in me all of a sudden.

1363
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,560
Everyone came alive when I explained there was a little Caesar's that I grew up that

1364
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,920
was like a Chuck E. Cheese and everyone was like, Holy shit.

1365
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
We all sat up.

1366
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,480
And then when you did the voice, we all stood up and now we're all marching around the room

1367
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
with vigor.

1368
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,040
Well, although I guess it's not a, it's hard to do an episode about something that I just

1369
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,080
found out about and that there are no photos of or information about.

1370
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
And may not exist.

1371
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
And may never have occurred.

1372
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
It existed.

1373
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,760
I have pictures from there, but yeah.

1374
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,880
You go back into your memory inception style and you find out it was actually the Dolphi

1375
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,600
spectrum and they planted a memory.

1376
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,360
They would be that devious.

1377
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,360
It was on.

1378
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,720
It sounds just like them.

1379
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,960
If you live in my hometown or near there, it was on Roselle road.

1380
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,960
You know the road.

1381
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,960
Oh, okay.

1382
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,400
And then I looked, well, I looked up where this other, this place called zippies used

1383
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,560
to be, which is sold beef.

1384
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,840
Let's get into that too.

1385
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
Right.

1386
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Zippies.

1387
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
Yes.

1388
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
But zippies existed.

1389
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,840
You know what else was in Schomburg?

1390
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
I just found out this week.

1391
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,280
Did you ever go to Mickey's kitchen?

1392
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,400
Yes, I did.

1393
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,200
You did go to Mickey's Mickey's kitchen was they decided on the Disney store.

1394
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,600
They decided to open up a restaurant next to the Disney store.

1395
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,040
Oh, and we ate there once.

1396
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,320
Not good.

1397
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
It was fine.

1398
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,920
I think it sounded they were trying to do and keeping with our theme and Tavi, they

1399
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,640
were trying to do healthier fast food and I think people didn't really like it.

1400
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,680
This is I don't want to derail the podcast, but I do think I have an original newspaper

1401
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,280
article about Mickey's kitchen upstairs right now in my apartment.

1402
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,280
I'm sure.

1403
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,440
Why don't you go find it and we'll all go with you and leave the microphones recording

1404
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,920
and not edit that part out.

1405
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
All right.

1406
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,920
Great.

1407
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,920
Cool.

1408
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
I hope you enjoy here in our footsteps.

1409
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Yeah.

1410
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Mickey's kitchen one in Montclair in California and one in Schomburg, Illinois.

1411
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
The second one.

1412
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,400
And then they never did any others.

1413
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,760
So you were very lucky in terms of your food entertainment in your childhood.

1414
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,200
Kind of exciting revelation.

1415
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Yeah.

1416
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,200
Sorry to derail the podcast with all this different talk here.

1417
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,680
Let's get back then to the pure raw terror.

1418
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,800
I'd like you guys to look at this lineup and you know them because you've been looking

1419
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,400
into this too, but just please stare if you will.

1420
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Oh yeah.

1421
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Sure.

1422
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,480
With wrenny rice, Mersey oats and Connie corn.

1423
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,000
Rice oats and corn.

1424
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,360
I find them very hideous.

1425
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,040
There's been a lot of doll faces and a lot of alive food, but these three to me are the

1426
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:27,240
worst combo of doll face and alive food, particularly wrenny rice, who I think is a, I guess is a

1427
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,180
bag of rice, but then as kind of like a, she looks like furry, but then with a doll face

1428
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,280
carved out, she looks almost like a, like a, like a doll, a dog toy.

1429
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,160
That's a less, she's some kind of like dog hybrid.

1430
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,840
I'm, I'm, I'm not going to sleep well cause of wrenny rice.

1431
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,560
And we, when, when Evan Susser was on and we were talking Hershey park, he was like

1432
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:54,000
talking about how he thought that the walk around, you know, Reese's pieces or the Reese's

1433
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,800
cups were scary or he didn't like them.

1434
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
And I said, no, I love these characters.

1435
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,920
I didn't know they existed until like a couple of years ago, but I love them.

1436
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,040
I feel very strongly about that.

1437
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,800
But I don't have that affection for these characters for whatever reason.

1438
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,000
I had some that I liked as a kid.

1439
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You did.

1440
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah.

1441
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And you know what?

1442
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm not going to sell it short.

1443
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I still like them.

1444
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Who were your guys?

1445
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,160
So milk.

1446
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,160
You liked milk?

1447
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
Well, milk came back.

1448
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Milk's in food rocks.

1449
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Well, sure.

1450
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,240
But we had a, I had a milk cookie jar that I got from, there's a gift shop in the land.

1451
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
Great.

1452
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,800
Called, anybody know it?

1453
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Broccoli and Company.

1454
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Broccoli and Company.

1455
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
That's right.

1456
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,000
That's where you could buy all the kitchen cabaret memorabilia you wanted.

1457
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,120
You could also bid on the film rights for the James Bond series.

1458
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,120
That's one for the insiders.

1459
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Wow.

1460
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
I love that.

1461
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,520
When you say milk, you mean Mr. Dairy Goods.

1462
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,520
Yes.

1463
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,520
Mr. Dairy Goods.

1464
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,520
Just over on the same page.

1465
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,520
Ham and eggs.

1466
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,520
Yeah.

1467
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Yeah.

1468
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
Okay.

1469
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,520
Let's talk about ham and eggs.

1470
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,720
Ham and eggs break up all this sexiness with a comedy routine.

1471
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,960
Ham's more of a straight man and egg is a funny man.

1472
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Very common in cabaret settings.

1473
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,640
They're kind of a vaudeville duo type.

1474
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,360
Who kind of, maybe the jokes are a little knowingly lame in the Fozzie Bear mode.

1475
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,360
Yeah.

1476
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,360
Yeah.

1477
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,240
But they crack each other up.

1478
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,640
Although egg has a hard time getting in with ham.

1479
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,640
Crack each other up.

1480
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,640
Oh, hey, look.

1481
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,480
Now you got me doing it.

1482
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,520
They also make sure to let you know that cheese is a good source of protein.

1483
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
Yeah.

1484
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,400
The facts are laid on thick in both of these attractions.

1485
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,520
They just suddenly, hard right turn.

1486
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:41,640
Now we say, because ham is not happy with how the act went and as the animatronics are

1487
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:47,920
descending from whence they came, he wants to pair up with another protein.

1488
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,720
So he's like, yeah, there's a ton of great proteins I could do a bit with.

1489
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,160
You know, the nuts, for example, good source of protein.

1490
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,880
It really dries up from the stage and lower in a kind of a very ominous sort of way.

1491
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
Yeah.

1492
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,680
And you can see right here, the pan emits more smoke to hide ham and eggs as they are

1493
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,560
lower down into the stove.

1494
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,480
So, I mean, that is saying they're about to die.

1495
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Yeah.

1496
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,480
They do come back for the grand finale and then die.

1497
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,240
I remember distinctly thinking when I saw the movie The Lion King for the first time,

1498
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,960
this was when it came out, that Timon and Pumbaa, I said, these guys are just ham and

1499
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,960
eggs.

1500
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,960
Really?

1501
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,120
These guys are a knock off of ham and eggs.

1502
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,400
They're stealing ham and eggs this whole thing.

1503
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,280
Pumbaa is a pig.

1504
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,600
Me looks a bit like similar color scheme.

1505
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Yeah.

1506
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
Wow.

1507
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Similar voices.

1508
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,600
Yeah.

1509
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,600
I think you're onto something.

1510
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:47,080
So, and for sure, they're all just not a parody of a hundred other.

1511
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,080
That's what's actually happened.

1512
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,080
Oh, okay.

1513
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,560
Well, Mike and I briefly toured under the name Ham and Eggs and we also broke up live

1514
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,200
on stage doing our vaudeville acts.

1515
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
Lowered into an oven.

1516
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,200
Yeah.

1517
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,680
We were lowered into a giant steaming oven.

1518
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,720
It was bad.

1519
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,320
Well, yeah, but so you like them.

1520
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:12,000
Did you like the fruits and vegetables that make up the Collender combo and Fiesta Fruit?

1521
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I liked the tune.

1522
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Veggie, veggie, fruit, fruit.

1523
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That's my favorite song.

1524
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yes.

1525
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's the best song for sure in Kitchen Cabaret.

1526
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's the best song for sure in Kitchen Cabaret.

1527
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
For sure, veggie, veggie, fruit, food.

1528
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah.

1529
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,320
You're right, but I was not immediately, I don't know, this is not on the Tiki Tiki Room

1530
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,840
short list of Disney classics.

1531
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,880
In the show, that's the best one.

1532
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
I'm not saying this has.

1533
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,440
And I think they're the most endearing characters.

1534
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,720
And there were stuffed versions of them available in that gift shop.

1535
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
Did you have them?

1536
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,120
No, I didn't, but I remember.

1537
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
Okay.

1538
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,120
I just remember seeing them.

1539
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,760
And those characters endured well after the character.

1540
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:50,400
The little merch in the, in Bronkely and Company, I think went a long way for me to selling

1541
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,640
the ride in the world of it.

1542
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Yeah.

1543
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
Right.

1544
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,920
You could get individual merch for individual kinds of food in the show.

1545
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,600
You as a kid are probably thinking, well, they wouldn't have merch for it if it wasn't

1546
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
important.

1547
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,800
And if it wasn't a world other kids care about.

1548
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Exactly.

1549
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
Yeah.

1550
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
And you, when you were on.

1551
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,040
I was just, I was always, where's the, when's the cartoon going to come out?

1552
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
And it never.

1553
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,040
Yeah.

1554
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,840
You assume they'd become part of your life when you left Epcot and they never, they never

1555
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
followed you out.

1556
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,480
There is a picture of, I've seen this a few times.

1557
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,440
I've seen the item itself pop up on eBay of like a tea towel you could buy with all the

1558
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,360
vegetables and fruits on it.

1559
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,860
And then those characters have endured beyond this show.

1560
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:37,520
They were the mascots for the food, the Epcot festival, one of the Epcot food festivals for

1561
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,520
a little while.

1562
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Define endured.

1563
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,520
I feel like they come back on retro merchandise on like pins or shirts sometimes.

1564
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
That's something.

1565
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Yeah.

1566
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,520
Yeah.

1567
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,720
I believe there are, what are those Disney, the dolls that they do, the little vinyl

1568
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,060
toys of.

1569
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,060
Vinylmations.

1570
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,060
Yes.

1571
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,060
I believe there are vinylmations of them.

1572
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,060
Yes.

1573
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,120
I just did a quick eBay search to see what we have here.

1574
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,920
And yes, there are some vinylmations.

1575
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,120
There's also a Disney's Epcot kitchen cabaret full set of five plush.

1576
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
Hey, there's those plushes.

1577
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,120
From 1982.

1578
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,120
Ooh, full set.

1579
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,120
What's that going for?

1580
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
See, those are fun.

1581
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
$295.

1582
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
$295.

1583
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,120
That seems fair.

1584
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,120
Who's in that lineup?

1585
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Can you name check them?

1586
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
Okay.

1587
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,680
We have Mr. Tomato, banana.

1588
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,480
These are all from Fruit and Veggie.

1589
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,960
They're all from the Colander combo.

1590
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,040
They're all from the Colander combo.

1591
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,960
Oh, you have, you know who I think is my favorite character in all this is the broccoli with

1592
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,960
the sunglasses.

1593
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,960
Oh, that's a good one.

1594
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
He's fun.

1595
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,960
Yes.

1596
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,760
Again, like the Hershey Park characters, no traits.

1597
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
He exists.

1598
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,920
He has sunglasses.

1599
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,920
But that's all you need.

1600
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,920
He's like a session musician.

1601
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,960
You know, he shows up, clocks in, does his job, goes home.

1602
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,040
I think that's why I like him.

1603
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,480
He's the Hal Blaine of fruits and vegetables.

1604
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
Yeah.

1605
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,600
So, so yeah, there's a plenty of this merch here.

1606
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:59,640
I, I, yeah, I don't, I don't know if we missed the land when I was a kid because so much

1607
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,880
of this is not familiar.

1608
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,520
So much of Epcot is burned in my brain is from being a kid.

1609
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,200
Did you see your parents looking at a map, seeing what was in it and going, what if we

1610
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,120
just don't tell Mike about this one?

1611
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:15,360
Because if we were going to have to like buy him all this shit and sit through these shows.

1612
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,960
Well, my family liked it because it was air conditioned and I feel like we would usually

1613
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,960
eat at the food court and it was, I think just everyone could agree on it.

1614
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,800
I remember the land and the wonders of life pavilions, you know, big enclosed, multiple

1615
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,600
attractions and I think we would all go like, all right, we're going to be in here for a

1616
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,600
little while.

1617
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,600
Yeah.

1618
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,400
I think it's why I love malls more than I should.

1619
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:45,000
I think like it gave me my, my love of atriums and not frequently updated carpets, both of

1620
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
these pavilions.

1621
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Okay.

1622
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,720
So, all right.

1623
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,720
We love the fruit and veggie song, right?

1624
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
We should agree.

1625
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,720
I think everyone's agreed.

1626
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,720
We all agree.

1627
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,720
Veggie, veggie, fruit, fruit.

1628
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,720
And then there's just kind of like a medley finale.

1629
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,720
There sure is.

1630
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,600
And she doesn't even eat a meal though, right?

1631
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
She's just kind of like, well, thanks for coming.

1632
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:07,040
Yeah, we don't watch the robot eat a bunch of food at the end.

1633
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
That's true.

1634
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,760
And they sing, like the last thing they sing is the proper foods each time you dine can

1635
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,240
keep you fit and feeling fine.

1636
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,480
Eating right's a healthy sign and feeling good makes each day shine and shine.

1637
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,920
But they really didn't give you like a real strong like diet.

1638
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,460
It wasn't a real.

1639
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:30,880
I will say in the show itself, it's not, the lyrics are not really sold.

1640
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,880
Like they're important.

1641
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,880
Uh huh.

1642
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,880
Like the, it's kind of more memorable.

1643
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:40,040
There's almost no memorable vibe of the music they're say doing at any given point.

1644
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,640
So I feel like you're really focused as you go through this on the lyrics.

1645
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,640
That's true.

1646
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,640
And I wonder if that's doing a disservice to the ride.

1647
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Right.

1648
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,640
And you're right.

1649
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,320
I mean, if you really analyze the lyrics, what do they mean?

1650
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,720
It's more about the vibe of the song.

1651
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,880
It's more about the feeling.

1652
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,120
The only reason I'm, I'm interested in this is cause Epcot is about teaching.

1653
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,180
Epcot is about enlightening people on different aspects of our world.

1654
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:05,220
So if you're going to put this in a thing called the land, I think that it's, it's fair

1655
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:08,400
for me to scrutinize what exactly the message is.

1656
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,600
If this were in magic kingdom, sure, let's just have a good fruit vegetable party who

1657
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,680
gives a shit.

1658
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,800
But since we're in Epcot, I think that we need to give it a little bit more weight.

1659
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Well, I think it reflects the thinking about nutrition at the time.

1660
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,920
Like, yeah, just get a bunch, a little of all that shit.

1661
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:30,480
Like the, the, the food rock show uses a lot of words like moderation and lean, like stuff

1662
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,480
that was very 90s.

1663
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:39,120
There's more, yes, there's more, more in food rocks as far as like maybe instruction, but

1664
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,840
it feels very notey.

1665
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:46,960
I feel the corporate hand in food rocks a lot more, despite it being more current and

1666
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,960
irreverent than kids you have array.

1667
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,280
Well, here's one thing, and I guess let's just jump right into food rocks.

1668
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,680
Food wrap that open food rocks open in 1994.

1669
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:04,560
1994 is also the year that it became mandatory to have nutrition labels on food.

1670
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,040
And you see food rapper, the host voice by tone, Luke is a giant nutrition label.

1671
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,360
Yeah, he is.

1672
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,360
It's kind of a, he is a vague animatronic.

1673
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,640
He is very, what are we looking at here?

1674
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,380
He looks like he's dimensional for what?

1675
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,560
Like the back of a Capri sun kind of be shaped.

1676
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:29,240
He's an odd shape and is a label is a nutritional label that tells you the amount of protein

1677
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,240
and carbs.

1678
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,240
Is that a rapper?

1679
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,480
I don't think it's an accurate name.

1680
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,480
Yeah.

1681
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:40,000
I mean, obviously they're going for the pun of the rapper, a lot more puns in food.

1682
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,240
Rocks and his, his name is F U D W R A P P R.

1683
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
I don't know.

1684
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,240
Is that supposed to be like tone?

1685
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Loke somehow?

1686
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,000
Well, I have a guess why.

1687
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,360
So when you're doing a character like this, you want to be careful to have it be a trademarkable

1688
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,360
name.

1689
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
Okay.

1690
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Oh, smart.

1691
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:05,000
Um, to sell the pun, you have to spell rapper normally like the word rapper.

1692
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1693
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,600
Cause otherwise you're just gonna, you're not gonna sell the pun.

1694
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,160
So you gotta change up food.

1695
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,160
Otherwise you're saying food rapper, which just is the thing.

1696
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,000
And it's not going to be trademark.

1697
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,280
That's the kind of, that's hard to Google.

1698
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,880
That's hard to like have a, put a stamp on, but you're about to go after the rapper.

1699
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
Yep.

1700
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,880
Oh, that's smart.

1701
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,720
And if they want it to be off later, yeah.

1702
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:32,360
Johnny Depp ended up playing food rapper and not a pirate from fires of the Caribbean.

1703
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,360
That would have been a big problem.

1704
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,160
Is there something subliminal to, and that F U D is one letter off from fun?

1705
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Yeah, sure.

1706
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,480
That's probably part of it.

1707
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,720
I feel it.

1708
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:47,840
Well, that seems to be the modus operandi of food rocks as opposed to kitchen cabaret.

1709
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:56,240
Why go to this austere, you know, uh, vaudeville, uh, uh, for presentation when you can go to

1710
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,760
a crazy jacked up rock concert.

1711
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,000
And that's what food rocks is.

1712
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah.

1713
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,080
Just like live aid and farm aid.

1714
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,840
I will say food rocks does, they do bring more energy.

1715
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,840
Yes.

1716
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,640
It is a higher energy show.

1717
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,720
Uh, it's a less relaxing experience for sure.

1718
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,720
The segments are shorter.

1719
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,880
The segments are shorter.

1720
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,040
It's faster music fights, air conditioning a little more.

1721
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,920
The eighties had really, uh, taken hold and changed our culture and we got MTV and then

1722
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,040
we got food rocks.

1723
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,160
This was a singing food show for the MTV generation.

1724
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,960
Uh, it's got attitude and it's got rap.

1725
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,280
I, you know, I'll say that we've, you know, we've covered the hard rock park recently.

1726
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:46,200
We, you know, anytime, um, uh, a theme park tries to get into music territory can be a

1727
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,440
little embarrassing.

1728
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,840
I don't cringe at this as much as I think I could.

1729
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,440
A lot of the music is out of date, but the fever that they're aware of Peter Gabriel,

1730
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,040
that the police are in it.

1731
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,400
It's a little hipper than you might expect.

1732
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,560
I'm not saying it is hip or it's not cringe worthy.

1733
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,000
What do the inclusion of tone?

1734
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Loke?

1735
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,080
I think that, yeah.

1736
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:14,800
And I think that food rapper was actually an early example of inclusion in the park.

1737
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Absolutely.

1738
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,440
That's a good point.

1739
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,520
And it's, it's kind of late, but that's just how it, how it went.

1740
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:26,760
Is it, it was, uh, what do you think was the first rap in a theme park in the Disney parks

1741
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,760
ever?

1742
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:34,480
This rap within like within an actual official theme park experience.

1743
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,000
Like, I'm sure someone wrapped at Epcot.

1744
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,640
And there was the, there was the rap, but, uh, I've, you know, we've talked about the

1745
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,520
splash mountain rap as this is an exhibit and we've talked about when Alan Thicke, uh,

1746
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,880
wrapped to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1747
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,880
Sure.

1748
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,880
If we didn't, we should.

1749
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
We have talked about that.

1750
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,880
But yeah, the first, the first installed rap.

1751
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,040
Now are there any others?

1752
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,480
Maybe in a Beetlejuice's graveyard review.

1753
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,480
Yeah, sure.

1754
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,600
There's gotta be a rap on that.

1755
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Yeah.

1756
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, now in the line for the Jimmy Fallon.

1757
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Exactly.

1758
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,280
You took the thought out of my head there.

1759
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,280
Yeah.

1760
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Black Thoughts.

1761
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,280
Rap.

1762
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:16,400
Wraps the safety instructions while Jimmy throws cards down like Bob Dylan.

1763
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,400
That's correct.

1764
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,400
That does happen.

1765
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,080
But yeah, there's not a lot of hip hop in the theme parks.

1766
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,040
Well, so I'm going to give Food Rocks some big points for that.

1767
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,320
And it's not, you know what?

1768
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,500
It's not super embarrassing either because you'd think the, like a theme park putting

1769
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:40,800
rap in would be a little like, you know, like, like dudes with two, it'd be a little more

1770
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
sort of like, Hey, check it out.

1771
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,360
Check what I can do.

1772
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
Mini.

1773
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,800
Oh, well you are a legacy of like Mickey Mouse with a boom box rap type stuff.

1774
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,040
This is like a little better than that tone.

1775
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:08,260
I mean, you have work as we speak, because you know, the song is gone and you're going

1776
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:11,060
back to being Lil C.

1777
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,280
That's got to be gone in the song right there.

1778
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,280
Yes.

1779
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,280
Up.

1780
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
Good point.

1781
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,820
But, you know, Anteros, like it, has a Carl Loff a good hum.

1782
01:15:17,820 --> 01:14:58,860
Oh, yeah, and homecoming are

1783
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:20,820
But if you're a fan of carrots, Spanish cab OT.

1784
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,820
Yeah.

1785
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:22,820
Cause it sounds super abysmal.

1786
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,820
Yup.

1787
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:29,000
One brings up a question for me because the there are adversaries in this

1788
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:35,460
The the band the fictional group the excess the heavy metal junk food. Yeah. Yeah

1789
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:42,260
Saying an original composition called give us junk. What do you think they tried to get?

1790
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:47,260
Do you think there was an actual because because every no see I think they wouldn't for the bad guy

1791
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:54,240
I'm question because every other every song in this isn't a song that exists and it's a parody except for that one song

1792
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,500
But they would have to kind of make those guys the bad guys

1793
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,400
So do you think there was a band they went to that were like you're gonna be the evil

1794
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,300
Yeah, I don't think people would be willing to do that. Wouldn't Gene Simmons be a

1795
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:11,960
They tried rock and roller coaster was supposed to be kiss

1796
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,720
You guys we didn't we did a rock and roller coaster episode didn't go over that part of it

1797
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,920
We'd heard that they were supposed to be rolling stones. I had not heard the kiss components. Hmm really?

1798
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,120
Well, then we have a correction to make or you need to send us an article

1799
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,720
I'll get you guys I'll back that up then we'll have them record the end. Um, you can come back

1800
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:35,560
I mean, I believe it it makes sense as if somebody that they would and they seem like a coffin

1801
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,280
well

1802
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,560
and also it makes sense that that would fall apart because

1803
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:45,200
They're right. He's notoriously difficult to negotiate with but yeah that whatever there's a miniature golf course

1804
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:50,460
As we've both golfed at in Las Vegas the kiss mini golf that yeah for some reason they were able to close a deal

1805
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,920
No problem. Yeah, I bet he gets a cut of that gate though. Yeah, I'm sure he does

1806
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,920
Oh, yeah

1807
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,080
Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a big tongue. He wants a big taste

1808
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,460
Happen with the rolling instead the Rolling Stones what I've seen about of money also a big tongue. Yeah. Yeah

1809
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,460
a lot of

1810
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:17,060
Amount of the annual income of Steven Spielberg every year comes from his cut of the game universal that he still gets

1811
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,900
He gets a cut gets a or a new buy an executive producer

1812
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:25,660
Every time you buy a ticket to Universal Studios, he gets a set percentage of that

1813
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:30,500
I don't know what the number is but it's high enough that it's millions of dollars a year for him

1814
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,980
Oh my god, and and that goes up

1815
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:38,180
Maybe that and that was a deal that was done when theme parks were not like

1816
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,980
The idea wasn't necessarily that tickets were like a hundred dollars, right?

1817
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:48,020
They they now are so very upset that that deal exists because they would make so many percentage of a different number

1818
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:51,740
Yeah, not that one that they decided to make be really high. Mm-hmm

1819
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:57,040
But you got to think people are going because of the IP he brought into the parks

1820
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,820
I mean who would go to Universal Florida if not for botanicus

1821
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,820
That's right

1822
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:07,380
He's easy to see to a 10 of the audience on the green planet. He's absolutely is. Excuse me. Zrex teacher

1823
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:12,500
That he's really proper names recs are you okay? Anyway back to food rocks?

1824
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,660
Yeah, you're right. So I'm going in its first first of all, I read this could be wrong

1825
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:23,540
The Disney owns the Queen catalog that yeah, Hollywood, right? Uh-huh when I I work for this weird

1826
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,140
Disney company

1827
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:32,860
And there was made like viral video attempted viral videos for Disney and they why I because spent a week editing

1828
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:40,500
Taking Bohemian Rhapsody and editing clips of Pinocchio to it Wow condensed the entire story of Pinocchio

1829
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:47,140
Into the length of Bohemian Rhapsody and I finished it and was like, yeah, I think I did okay that this exists

1830
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,660
I did it and then like

1831
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:56,380
Like add people were so moved by this they like I've cried synergy between these two pieces of IP

1832
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,020
We control both of

1833
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:04,540
This mashup of properties made me weep

1834
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,700
I just could people were getting in a people were putting their hand on my shoulder like Scott

1835
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,100
You don't I had a the catharsis I had because I

1836
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
Pinocchio plus

1837
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:21,460
Never came out. No, no, no never and then ultimately Queen said no, even though they did own the catalog

1838
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,220
Yeah, I think it did go up to Brian May

1839
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:29,140
Somebody who I bet also is I bet they were Jay. I wonder if they were tried for a rock and roller coaster

1840
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:34,280
That would have been a good idea too. So you're saying that they they rejected your Pinocchio video

1841
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:41,540
But they said when they sent them the food rocks the plan for food rocks and the parody song of Bohemian Rhapsody

1842
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:45,820
They were like, yes, yes, and it will be a band. That's like a parody of Queen. No, no

1843
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:50,940
They'll be called the you tinsel. All right. Sure. That seems clean to me. Absolutely

1844
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:55,220
I sign off it does that that is a very good point about all of this

1845
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:01,860
It's inconsistent in the names of the fake bands. Yep, the parody bands some are puns. Yeah, you got the peach boys

1846
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,660
Low-hanging fruit. I'll say that

1847
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:13,080
Oh God, hey, all right. All right. Look at this guy over here. I really have a problem with Neil Musaka

1848
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,700
Like what I had to look up what Musaka is

1849
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:22,380
Yeah, what is Musaka? I forget is anybody know offhand? It is a food. Is it mousse?

1850
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:28,240
Could be oh, I know what Musaka is. It's like a Greek lasagna essentially

1851
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,120
It's just essentially lasagna with other stuff. Is that right? I think so Wow, it sounds

1852
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,400
delicious

1853
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:41,480
But it's and I guess it has the aka but he then I don't believe Neil Musaka is a is a Greek

1854
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,340
Lasagna once you see him and it's all over the map and that's a pair

1855
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,300
Neil Sadaka is the parody so it does sort of line up that one

1856
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,480
You know sometimes we have to on it something like this podcast have to say oh for those of you who are younger

1857
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,280
You might not know you really might not know Neil Sadaka. Oh, yeah, that's it. I'm interested

1858
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,320
I'm very interested in like who was like we got to get Neil Sadaka. Yeah, when you're including song

1859
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,240
Someone that someone was proud of themselves about that pun

1860
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:15,060
They were like I've got the best and they force the dog upon and then like the little Richard like parody is just called Richard

1861
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,920
He's just bit they Richard it says here. They took the one bit of color out of his name

1862
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,600
Yeah, that's Richard. The best one is Peter Gabriel. Yeah

1863
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,600
I'll give it up Gabriel just to confirm Musaka is an eggplant or potato based

1864
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,640
Usually includes ground meat sometimes has a milk based sauce on top

1865
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,280
so if you can imagine like a lasagna no noodles eggplants and kind of a

1866
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:46,680
Imagine sauce on top if you can imagine that sauce singing a parody of breaking up is hard to do

1867
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,560
Yeah, if you if you can imagine that the rest would be the skin or the hair

1868
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:56,680
Thank you the plant is his blood probably the best

1869
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,780
But what's his blood let's I would need a chart of what every character's blood is ground meat is his guts Peter Gabriel

1870
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,780
blood is hummus

1871
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:12,360
Air is but his blood is air. He's empty on the inside. Yeah, what's in the end knowledge facts?

1872
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,480
numbers

1873
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
That's what he's made of

1874
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,940
Peter Gabriel is a highlight. I would agree

1875
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,000
He's the parody of sledgehammer high fiber

1876
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,440
It you know, it's sung by the guy voiced

1877
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,960
wacko on

1878
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,840
Anime the man his name is Jess Parnell. You got it. Yeah. Yeah

1879
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:39,840
Pretty good. Now. There's a voice you recognize there's better voice talent in this thing came up in the Splash Mountain episode

1880
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,920
Let me ask van

1881
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:46,560
Do you remember when you went to Epcot the first time and your beloved kitchen cabaret had been changed into food

1882
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,040
Rocks I

1883
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:55,040
Do and I actually I was excited you were I didn't know

1884
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,960
You know, this is these this is in the dark days when you didn't know what things were before you went to them

1885
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,480
Oh boy

1886
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480
we're fixing that and

1887
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,120
I

1888
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,440
went

1889
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,440
And I remember

1890
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,800
The show starting I sat down not knowing they'd updated it

1891
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,360
Like I was I missed the like theming out, you know, they put a new marquee up

1892
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,960
And I somehow missed all of the re theming and so I remember the show starting being like oh the show is different

1893
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:32,080
But I got it in my head that this was like they would up there it would ever be updated again

1894
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,120
Hmm, like I remember thinking like oh, I guess maybe they're gonna start updating it

1895
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,000
So you just thought maybe every couple years? Yeah, but I I will I did

1896
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Have that like

1897
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,360
You weren't upset I wasn't upset and I think but though maybe it was because I went in and sat down

1898
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,800
I had no expectation of yeah, how is the new one gonna compare to the old one? Oh, okay

1899
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,720
That might also just be a difference in like our culture now

1900
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:03,200
Sure, I mean like when people accepted stuff more I feel like in the old now

1901
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,680
It's very much like you have to always excited

1902
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,280
When things would change in the theme park

1903
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,280
because I like

1904
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:16,080
You know this seemed change seemed better like it's a living breathing thing. It's getting better

1905
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,560
It's the change you would feel it was good. It was good that it was changing

1906
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,080
You know, I also remember like

1907
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:29,040
Certain theme parks other theme parks. It's like, you know when they think stop changing, right? That's when they're in trouble, right?

1908
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:33,480
Absolutely. Oh, yeah, that's not that with that's counter to Walt's vision

1909
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,600
Although this was a time of some pretty bad changes

1910
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,560
Enchanted Tiki Room under new management was pretty wretched

1911
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,240
And I but I'll say you know when you compare this to the like

1912
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,320
Hippified remakes of old attractions. I think this one's not

1913
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:55,520
Not not too bad. It's not it's it isn't closer to the top of the list in terms of not being

1914
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,760
I think it's I think it is a little more energetic a little more fun than kitchen cabaret

1915
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,240
It is also though it does you know, they're not starting the kitchen cabaret's not starting from like the original

1916
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,240
Tiki Room bar. It's not

1917
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,480
That's a good point. Yes, I do like the name kitchen cabaret. Yes

1918
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:18,200
It is a good name a kitchen k cabaret. Yeah, they spell it. Yeah, that's rocks is a dumber sound

1919
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,280
Yeah, they definitely don't know they made the name dumber

1920
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not really a pun. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's like

1921
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,880
It's like it's like sort of phrased like you've made a pun, but you haven't right. Yeah. Mm-hmm

1922
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,360
I'm sure there's a pun we could think of this letter like I guess cuz it's food and then they're doing rock music

1923
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,000
Well, that's just saying yeah, the thing it is and then the thing it is

1924
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,520
It's not but it's sort of like it puts itself out there like it feels like there's a blank spot

1925
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,920
Yeah, you're waiting for something clever or like yeah, like they were trying to come up with a name

1926
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,840
And it's like what do you want to just called food rocks and it was like yeah, let's just go home

1927
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,440
Let's do that. Yeah, go home tonight

1928
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:08,280
Go home tonight. I also think this is I think the kitchen cabaret was maybe from an era when I feel like they came

1929
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:14,120
Over that idea and then that was just it. I there I bet food rocks had like 30 names. Yeah. Oh, yeah

1930
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,880
Yeah, probably very market test rent rent through Nestle

1931
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:25,300
Yeah, there were Nestle people who had to shift from one is a meeting about the the the program to get third-world women

1932
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,480
addicted to baby formula

1933
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,000
I'm sure they could keep this sending to those countries

1934
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:37,400
Into infinity and then like hang I can I grab you for the the the Epcot thing. Yeah, sure. Yeah

1935
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,440
I want to join a new funds. Let me see

1936
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,400
Great Twitter user

1937
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:50,560
Progress City wrote a book about some Disney stuff called the progress city primer

1938
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,320
linked a while back to a

1939
01:26:53,320 --> 01:27:00,560
Menu from the first restaurant at the land like an opening day menu. Okay, and there's craft logos all over it

1940
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:07,480
and I just I was really tickled by reading and also like all the food is either covered in a lemon butter or a

1941
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,240
peppercorn sauce or a cream sauce a lot of

1942
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,960
A lot of veggie veggie fruit fruit. Yeah

1943
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,520
Going on there, but there was this great

1944
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,960
I guess was the motto the corporate by but it just says craft means good food dot dot dot

1945
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,040
worldwide

1946
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,000
Like that's just said that motto is just nothing. Yeah

1947
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,800
Yeah, that's not anything either. Yeah, though. Maybe that was how they were doing

1948
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:42,760
Well, I think that general statements this was again just to put some historical perspective on this which has been my role in this podcast

1949
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,520
Yeah, sure. Thank you

1950
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:50,160
You know, this was a time when globalization was a new concept and I think that craft food was probably trying to

1951
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,060
Forefront the fact that they had brands across the world and were a global company

1952
01:27:55,240 --> 01:28:03,560
Also pictured in in this menu next to the wine list some of those brands like Cracker Barrel cheese or Velveeta or Parquet

1953
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:09,080
Or Philadelphia great cheese again on the page opposite the wine list

1954
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:13,600
Wow, you gotta pick your cream cheese before you pick your wine. Yeah

1955
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,320
I I was thinking like Epcot Center is just in general

1956
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,320
Before Walt died Walt Disney died his dream as we all know was to make a true

1957
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:30,320
Experimental city that would be a beacon of hope and change for the whole world and it would organize cities in a different way

1958
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,400
And they would be like clean cities as far as energy is concerned

1959
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,640
If he was like reanimated and he was like take he would like you the first thing you would be like is take me to

1960
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,880
Epcot because that was what he is dying wish basically was to finish Epcot Center

1961
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:48,880
And then he walked and there was just like a show where there was a talking Bill Carton

1962
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,480
And then there were all these pop songs like wouldn't he be the most disappointed man of all time

1963
01:28:54,480 --> 01:29:02,720
Like this is what you guys did what so now will you take me to where the the solar electricity is?

1964
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,760
is made and where where all the children of the world live in peace and a

1965
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:14,640
You know in a mixed-race school and well, there's just a bunch of that all drinking in the back of it

1966
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:19,540
I guess people just go country to country and just drink a different fruity color drink with I

1967
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,040
What what is that?

1968
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,920
What are those buildings with the giant swan on top? The hell is that?

1969
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:32,240
I see now. I think that he would love I think you would love the swan and dolphin

1970
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:40,240
I think he would think those were savvy business deal. Absolutely managed by bold architecture. They had managed by not

1971
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,760
Disney's like a third

1972
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,880
And they're building another hotel across from it

1973
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:52,000
Also will be managed in a partnership like now which is odd the swan and dolphin, you know

1974
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,520
Sure, did those ballrooms get used to dissect cadavers? Yeah, maybe discovered

1975
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,960
Possibly your yacht and Beach Club ballrooms. These are true. Yeah, there's this

1976
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:08,240
Ballroom floor my dad just listened to that episode and he's like we're not staying at the outer Beach Club now

1977
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:12,840
But I know that we're not saying wow we ended we have never stayed there and we talked about it

1978
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:18,160
He's like, I don't know if I would have stayed there now. He's just worried. Yeah bone will fall off the ceiling

1979
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,640
sleeping I think that these dissections are some of the

1980
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,840
some of the

1981
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,240
Happier things that happen at Disney hotels that you don't want to think about

1982
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:37,360
Enough said about that an ominous tease from guest van Robe show. We're still here on podcast the ride and

1983
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,960
Food

1984
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,520
You got the you know, it's another pun-less

1985
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:55,140
section that's a jump around too much but to the climax in a way when the excess

1986
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,360
performs their

1987
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:02,760
Evil tyrannous song of wishing to eat junk and being okay with your teeth rotting

1988
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:09,000
then kind of the song stops and then they're like what happened and

1989
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:14,120
Food rapper says no power. You just got unplugged

1990
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:19,840
Which is accurate. It's what he did. He took a plug and he unplugged it and that's not a food thing

1991
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:26,680
I guess unplugged is a reference to MTV unplugged but other than that, it's just kind of I don't know food rapper

1992
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:31,660
Just says what he did and it's I don't know. I think they're heavy metal band

1993
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:38,400
So there's so they're power reliant. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Good point. Well food rapper hit him where it hurts

1994
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,360
Yeah, and there I just described the stakes of the show

1995
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:46,200
Mm-hmm. That's yeah, that's the very exciting part of it. That's like the most exciting part

1996
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:53,840
I haven't rewatched these shows the that band the evil band. Are they what are their animatronics? They were they a

1997
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,600
Repurposing of any of the food from the previous it's unclear what they are

1998
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:06,240
I was I have that in my notes. Are they garlics? Are they rotting? Yeah, they look like garlics

1999
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:11,760
But I also they could be like hard candy maybe like a rapper of a hard trying to wear on stage

2000
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:18,200
You know anywhere where something else they pop up a stage left your stage, right? Like are we on the stage?

2001
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,880
Are we looking at the stage? Yeah, that's a good question

2002
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,680
And they pop up different places and I assume if we're looking at the stage they're towards the right

2003
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:30,560
But it'd be opposite if you're in food if you're looking out there towards the right there just below

2004
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:36,320
You know, they'd be directly below Peter Gabriel if that helps you

2005
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,440
Peach boys in the center

2006
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,200
Richard not little Richard off to the right and then

2007
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,520
everybody

2008
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,720
Then food rapper down downstage left. Yeah, he's he's where

2009
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,920
Anita food, what is there was her name Bonnie apatite Bonnie?

2010
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,920
I need a need a food is what I just guessed

2011
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:11,160
Might be better that would work if it was a more specific food you could do Anita burger or Anita

2012
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,120
slice of

2013
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:19,840
Food doesn't quite work. I need a milk. I wouldn't pass. I couldn't be on the pun staff of one of these shows

2014
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,440
Yeah here I'm showing fan right now. They're

2015
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,080
Here they are. This is the garlics

2016
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:32,480
I mean all you need to know is that they have to their food with toad and they have tattoos and their garlic

2017
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,540
They're missing wait and food rapper would be over

2018
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:44,360
He's here stage, right? Yeah, guys. The point is they are some bad guys. They are some scary evil

2019
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:52,280
Vicious musicians who are ruining the fun. Oh, yeah, they're not really junk food are they they're just kind of dirty their bags

2020
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,360
Yeah, they're like cuz he does it like foot bunions or something

2021
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:04,360
What are will ask people on Twitter what you think the excess are they just pure their manifestations of evil?

2022
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,600
They're like just

2023
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,320
shapeless nothings

2024
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,720
The vaguely the size that a food item would be they probably couldn't like

2025
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:19,360
They were somebody would get litigious if they made them look like any food. I think they're supposed to be something

2026
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:23,760
I don't I I think like onions there were left in the trash and they're fine with it

2027
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,680
They're like, let me rot like rotten. I have a death wish food

2028
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:34,080
I like if if because maybe we're getting back to food motivation if a piece of food

2029
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,720
If it's a fresh food really wants to be eaten

2030
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:41,760
Maybe the the inverse of that is for a food for food to rot and never be eaten

2031
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,160
And that's what the excess wants. That's why I hate them

2032
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,760
Yeah, cuz they don't want to be eaten when they're fresh. Yeah

2033
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:53,840
They don't want to die when they're in their prime, you know humans. I want to die when I'm a burden on society

2034
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,320
Yeah, that's I'm gonna bring up something else confusing which is the get the point sisters

2035
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,800
They sing the song respect by Aretha Franklin, which is not their song

2036
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,920
Yeah, that is the real pointer sisters singing

2037
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,080
Not a point and also the name is strange the get the point

2038
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:20,880
Sisters not one of the better names. I also it's I know that they're candy bars, but it took me a sec

2039
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,880
They're sort of just like they look like ribbons or something. They look like beautiful ribbons

2040
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:35,520
But hey kudos to the real pointer sisters for doing it and uh, it's not not a bad song

2041
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,280
Uh, I want to go backwards a little uh, they changed the like pre-show area

2042
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,640
The little lobby you would wait it used to be a very elaborate like

2043
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:52,720
City scape city facade because like you were going in a broadway theater and converted it as many 90s things are to just kind of like

2044
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:58,480
Cartoonie looking painting angles on the wall. Yes. It's very different with a lot of food facts

2045
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,520
Some of which I found very odd that they posted one

2046
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:08,480
Cashews are never sold in the shell that's because they are related to poison ivy and the shells contain an irritated

2047
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,200
Oil that's a weird thing to have painted on the wall at a theme park

2048
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,480
Take that back to your friends at your school kids

2049
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,000
Here's another one

2050
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,120
Why is there a stalk of celery in a bloody mary since ancient Rome celery has been thought of as a hangover remedy

2051
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,680
Again, a weird thing to have painted on a wall for children in the land pavilion

2052
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:38,160
This is in like you see these little cartoony paintings as you walk in to the show

2053
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:43,040
It's just it's a very strange choice very strange the 90s were a wild time

2054
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,960
People's ideas of what food facts were so out of whack

2055
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:55,120
Um, what have we missed? What well there's a lot of like actual people doing the voices

2056
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,720
Which I think is it I remember as a kid finding that neat and I thought

2057
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:04,080
I was because I read about that in my burn bombs guide on the delta flight on my way to disney world

2058
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:08,800
And I remember thinking i'm this is something i'm gonna know when i'm watching the show the other kids don't

2059
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,760
I will know that Neil sadaka is Neil Musaka. I will know that

2060
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:19,680
Uh chubby checker is chubby cheddar. Yes. He's chubby cheddar. Mm-hmm

2061
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:26,000
Um, that's pretty good. That one's a good name. Here's a here's a here's a thing about I noticed so chubby cheddar

2062
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,800
Is kind of like he's in the background. It's it's unclear to me if he's sort of a full animatronic or it's just sort of a

2063
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
Excuse me an animation like a silhouette

2064
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,280
Um, he is he's doing you know, the twist which is chubby checkers signature

2065
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:46,640
Only song but chubby cheddar looks to be holding a cheese grater above his head as he does the twist

2066
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,480
Mm-hmm, which is very dark. I mean he is

2067
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,360
He is advocating

2068
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,040
He's a cutter. Yeah, he is a cutter. I mean

2069
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,080
Slowly

2070
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,080
Well, he used to have skin

2071
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,800
That's true, right that had been ripped from him his package of skin has been ripped off now

2072
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,000
He's just the inside shade is nestle throwing shade at craft. Oh, that's interesting. Oh

2073
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,920
Wow, like craft go kill yourself kill yourself

2074
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,640
We finally unlocked the secret

2075
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:25,680
And they've been corporate message they've implicated chubby checker in this whole evil plan of theirs

2076
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,680
Hey unwittingly surely. I mean he got paid go great yourself

2077
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:37,040
I huh? Well, we figured that out, you know in keeping with the theme in this episode of punless puns

2078
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,960
I was curious about what old chubby checker is up to

2079
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,680
He is not up to being dead. He's well, he is up to being alive

2080
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:51,520
Good for him and you can not only book him for corporate events or or whatever

2081
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,400
Maybe for a podcast. In fact, if you want to book

2082
01:38:54,960 --> 01:39:01,680
Chubby checker email e evans at the last twist.com. That's a tip from me. Scott garner to you

2083
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:04,000
I saved you a trip to chubby checker.com

2084
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,560
But also he sells

2085
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:12,160
Food himself you can buy beef jerky from chubby checker

2086
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:17,440
And you know what it's called beef jerky what chubby checkers beef jerky

2087
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,720
It's not like there's no it's not a twist. It's not uh

2088
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:26,400
Now do they call it the last twist because the idea is you book him and maybe if you're lucky

2089
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:32,720
You know, I was there I hate to say i'm not proud of this but you know was a

2090
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,400
Meaningful moment in my life to get to see the last twist. Mm-hmm

2091
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:41,520
Um, and yeah, I know but to be this is the second to last twist if you shell out the money for that

2092
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:47,280
Wow found out you imagine, uh, will you be a fool? Um, they all see also as like, uh,

2093
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,440
Checker chocolate and pony punch. I guess he had a song called the pony. That was another dance. He did

2094
01:39:53,440 --> 01:40:00,240
That's a little closer, but um, that although several of those items pony punch and checker chocolate only available in bulk orders

2095
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,440
So don't buy that

2096
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:06,480
Unless you want a ton of pony punch have any of us seen chubby checker live?

2097
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,640
I want to wonder if you have a lot of like I certainly have

2098
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,400
September fest schomburg, illinois. Oh schomburg was the place to be. Oh, yeah

2099
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:21,920
Did you yell out do the do exercise to the tune of the twist rather than the twist?

2100
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,920
Yeah, do your food rock song. I was really into we went to see the food rock

2101
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:31,760
Material, but he didn't uh, he was just doing her. Yeah. He had a grader though. He didn't do any of the songs

2102
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,760
He also crazed death

2103
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
Yeah

2104
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,240
I don't want to sing this anymore

2105
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,280
Someone great me

2106
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,080
Um, yeah, come on now

2107
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,080
Come on, let me die

2108
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,880
Um, I'm gonna go ahead and do this

2109
01:40:52,880 --> 01:41:01,040
Okay, um cut to all the cut to our text conversation when he does pass away before this episode is released

2110
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,920
Okay emergency, uh

2111
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:11,120
Uh, yeah, so he's in it, you know, he's also uh, do you guys know he was on quantum leap?

2112
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:18,400
And that there is an episode where sam becket goes into the body of a he becomes a 50s dj

2113
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:24,160
And then chubby checker comes in and says, uh, hey, will you play my record?

2114
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:30,160
And he's like, oh you're chubby checker and he starts doing the twist which teaches chubby checker the twist

2115
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:37,120
So in a back to the future chuck berry kind of moment a white guy invents a black guy's thing. Yeah. Yeah

2116
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,120
Wow, this is forest gump

2117
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:44,080
Teaching alvis how to move his hips oddly. That's right. All right

2118
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:50,160
Nobody thought of anything some oddball sometime often on musical dance, you know, yeah was done by a

2119
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:57,840
Um or a magic sprite we haven't seen in a film but we can only assume the the macarena or uh, the uh,

2120
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:04,240
The dougie sure i'm suspicious of every dance now. It was always a time traveler or a leaper. Yeah

2121
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,240
Or a gump a mad manic pixie

2122
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,280
Dream boy or whatever you would call gump. That's how you regard him. I don't know. I guess

2123
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,280
Not he's kind of like he

2124
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:22,080
He is in his own way though. It's not the stereotype but he's like a muse. He's everyone's he's a magical figure

2125
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,160
Yeah, sure. So

2126
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,200
Um, I guess that's not manic pixie dream gump is not the

2127
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
phrase what's um

2128
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:36,000
What haven't we what haven't we covered? There's so much there's a lot but yeah, like what else do we care care about?

2129
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,560
Um, you know, I want to say I mean you guys might know that i'm i'm a pretty big

2130
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,800
Uh peach boys fan. Yeah, and uh, I really you know

2131
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,880
Good nutrition, I think is just such a like hallmark

2132
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:54,960
Uh a pop song it took him six months to record. I don't know if you know that it was like it's so experimental

2133
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,720
There was a lot of tension

2134
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:01,440
Uh within the band between uh, brian will sorenge and mike lunch

2135
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:08,800
Who is an apple, uh, uh, but his last name is lunch that's just what we're but uh, you know

2136
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,880
They had a lot of like inner band, uh, uh, uh struggling and infighting

2137
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:18,960
But obviously it worked out because they made so much great music together all uh culminating in the masterpiece album

2138
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,960
plate sounds

2139
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:27,040
Um, and you know, i'm sure most of our listeners know it but in case you don't I probably should read

2140
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:32,000
The entire track listing plate sounds out loud. Yeah. Yeah, just as a service. I mean you you know

2141
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,360
Most of you know it probably yeah. Okay. So, you know the album starts out with the wouldn't it be rice?

2142
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,440
Uh, uh, yeah, and then gives way to you still eat leaves with me

2143
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,000
That's not meat

2144
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,400
Don't talk put your bread in my toaster

2145
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,960
Uh, i'm i'm waiting for the dates

2146
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,840
Let's go eat way for a while

2147
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,360
Sloop john beef, of course, that's a keshe one

2148
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:02,880
Uh charred only grows which uh, I believe parah mccartney called his favorite song ever written

2149
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:08,160
Uh, I know I know there's a custard which alternatively is a hang on to your manchego

2150
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:12,240
Here's souffle. I just wasn't glazed for these bites

2151
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:18,720
The title track plate sounds obviously instrumental and then ends of the tender ballad clementines. Yes

2152
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,960
So, uh, I just wanted to remind people of that that great record and all these evocative

2153
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:32,240
Titles and uh, you know go check it out on the the the version of spotify. That's all fruit puns. What a journey

2154
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,240
That's great. Uh, yeah

2155
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,000
Band took has taken us on over these many decades. I agree

2156
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:44,400
Um, thanks for the music peach boys make that clear that that's not something you made. That's that was canon

2157
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:49,760
That's no i'm just i'm just a huge peach boys. Yeah, uh, I love everything about them

2158
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,760
I love that only one of them is a peach

2159
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,080
um

2160
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,720
There's uh

2161
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,840
The whole the whole mythology, uh, um, yeah

2162
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,880
Yeah, I I love that they you know, it was a sad time when they got involved with the charles branson

2163
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,440
um, he uh

2164
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:14,640
murdered all those uh, uh cereal boxes but or when uh that uh, the peach got was 300 pounds

2165
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:20,320
Yeah, yeah, he really uh, uh, yeah, he got he got way too way too ripe. He grew way too

2166
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:24,740
Well, he had his struggles. He got addicted to he experimented with pesticides

2167
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,120
Or when the apple just walked off his boat and sunk to the bottom of the sea

2168
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2169
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,640
Marina del del dates and his doctor doctor candy

2170
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,040
uh who was uh

2171
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,040
Treating him

2172
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:46,480
Candy. Yeah. Yes, correct. I was wrong. He uh, he the brother the apple brother. He he drowned in marina del taco

2173
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:52,800
That's what I meant to say. So again, sorry to get my facts wrong. Yeah, do great research. No more three stars

2174
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,840
That's fair. Yeah, so hey, thanks. Thanks peach boys. Thanks for the music god bless the peach boys

2175
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,840
Um, what are we what are we?

2176
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:05,440
Feel about it like I mean, I guess that's the end of this ride suck. I mean, let's be honest

2177
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:11,200
Well, this is the yeah in the arc of this, uh, one attraction was replaced by another attraction

2178
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:16,080
That was similar and if you polled everyone, but there would be no clear answer and which one is better

2179
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,000
Most people would say i've never heard of it. Yeah, and then it got replaced by

2180
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:26,000
Soren, which is a wonderful attraction everyone loves and no one ever complains that these are gone

2181
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,200
So so let's say those attractions closed on the same day 10 years apart. That is crazy. I would advocate

2182
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,280
For a retheming of soren to involve food

2183
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,240
Okay, so so would they be just uh, this it doesn't have to be this food

2184
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:48,000
It could be now look if they soared over some of these characters in just maybe one scene of it

2185
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,120
That really would be a for me a great nostalgia bump

2186
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:56,240
But yeah, I just mean I think that that I do think it's a shame to have uh,

2187
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
the food

2188
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:04,000
Theming kind of gone from this physical space that was dedicated to food for so long

2189
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:08,800
Yeah, I mean, yeah, so you want even though soren like you fly over land

2190
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,960
You still would like I want food. I I want not land. I know it's the land

2191
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:20,400
Yeah, right right that error like I like the idea that that physical space that was once occupied by the kitchen cabaret

2192
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,600
Is occupied by something else that deals with actual literal food

2193
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:31,520
You want to like fly over grease where peter gabriel and neil musaka are from you want to see the fields in which their ingredients are?

2194
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,560
Yeah, like some wheat fields. Mm-hmm

2195
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:41,120
uh, um, yeah you uh, obviously fly over uh marina del taco the

2196
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,560
There's meant so much to the peach boys growing up

2197
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:49,360
Uh, so so if you were that so that's when you're talking about our of course patented

2198
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:54,900
podcast the ride scale. Sorry, the dog just almost ripped the uh recorder off if

2199
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,500
He wants this episode to be done. Do you at home?

2200
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,820
So yeah on our patented podcast the ride scale

2201
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:07,220
You're saying you're you don't want to plus up these old rides or anything. You want to plus up the soren ride? Yeah, bring the food

2202
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:14,580
back into it, uh, um, yeah, well you could be yeah, you could be flying in a big uh in a big colander you can

2203
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:22,180
And uh, that's good. Yeah, I like that. I've also always thought that a soren could do could play with scale more and you could have something

2204
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:26,980
Macro photography and then you could feel giant like you could feel tiny right?

2205
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,980
I think that would be really fun. You could maybe sort through some food in that way

2206
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:38,660
All right. Yeah, I think maybe like a big hand could come up from the bottom of the screen with a big old sub sandwich

2207
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:40,820
Yeah

2208
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:46,980
Oh man, this is thumping over. Yeah, that's right. Jason. You haven't smiled as wide as you have the whole podcast

2209
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:55,780
Sandwich coming at you on one side of the from the bottom of the screen then to the other side of the screen

2210
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:02,980
So what yeah, how about okay? So like you maybe your dream is sort of a soren where you're flying inside someone's mouth

2211
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:09,460
Oh, yeah, you're like a tiny person inside a mouth seeing giant food smelling that food was normal

2212
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:15,460
Oh, yeah, and then they can like a subway sponsorship. You can smell that subway tuna. You know what i'm talking about

2213
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:20,980
Yeah, but then that's gonna attract all those vore freaks. So what freaks vore vore?

2214
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:26,740
Vore. Yeah, what is your keep going guys? What is this getting eating? It's a getting

2215
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:30,020
Fetish. Oh the one you have

2216
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:36,340
The alien encounter fetish you have that you were hoping to get eaten by an alien

2217
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:40,820
By the alien. Well, just that alien. Oh, okay. So you don't have a full range full

2218
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:46,500
Anything goes finish. It's just that you want to be eaten by that alien. Yeah, I don't want mac and me to eat me

2219
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,780
Okay, uh van, do you have this fetish? Oh, no, okay

2220
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:52,180
You guys just aware of it. I'm just yeah

2221
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:58,020
Allow you to experience. Yeah the ultimate fantasy of a of a big vore head

2222
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,660
Vortual reality you might call it

2223
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:09,220
Um, yeah, let's no I I agree. Let's change this. So well vorin soren is vorin

2224
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:16,420
Yeah, that's what we that's what we want. I think everyone will be pleased with this and you know to have a ride

2225
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,380
Where you get to see a big sandwich go?

2226
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,340
But a ride where you get to experience what it's like to eat

2227
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:25,940
Uh would be I think so much more satisfying than or eating

2228
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:26,420
Yeah

2229
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:29,460
Well to kind of want to feel like what it's like to be a sandwich

2230
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,460
Maybe not the eaten part, but you want to be on that scale of a sandwich, right?

2231
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:38,820
You want to appreciate the food in an up close and personal way. Yeah, what if like the soren because you know soren famously

2232
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,420
There's three levels

2233
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:43,620
Um, there's three different levels of people seated seated

2234
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:45,940
So like it's kind of you're not supposed to kind of know about that

2235
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:47,700
But like you see people's feet above you

2236
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:52,980
What if everyone is like a row of teeth or something and then they kind of close in and you're no adjacent

2237
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:57,140
Well, I I think we're we can't see the forest from the trees

2238
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:02,420
I mean there's been rumors about like imagineers skulking around the wonders of life pavilion

2239
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:05,140
I think this is a way to reignite

2240
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,780
That pavilion

2241
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:13,620
Oh in what way I mean like a getting eaten thing and you follow the full journey you get

2242
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
And then you go down the

2243
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:22,660
Throat to a stomach a digestive tract the entire that's interesting. Yeah, you get shit out is what you're saying

2244
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:25,620
Part of the ride is getting shit out. This is going to breathe

2245
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,420
You breathe life into the wonders of life

2246
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,300
And then you become you get shit out

2247
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:34,420
I was I was never a fan of the wonders of life

2248
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,420
Okay, what?

2249
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,860
That's one of my favorite boy. We had very different. Yeah. Yeah

2250
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:48,260
I I yeah, that was just uh, hmm boy next next time I have two drinks. I'm really gonna let you have it

2251
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:53,140
Yeah, watch out. Scott the monster big body wars kind of a guy

2252
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:59,460
Uh, I mean I was at the time I think I I think now I can see the hollowness of uh of body wars

2253
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,540
That's the closest thing to what we're talking about

2254
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:07,220
That's you inside the human body but not inside the part you want the part where all the delicious food is coming down

2255
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:12,180
Certainly not coming out the rectum that was now part of it not at all. But in your fantasy

2256
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:16,100
We're talking about a different park. We're talking about freak cot

2257
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:20,500
I think we what you did your plus that our plus that up here is to bill

2258
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:27,460
It's a it's an epcot in which every pavilion is a different fetish. Yeah, and then walt would be happy

2259
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:31,540
So well, I can get behind this we're not gonna make the world better

2260
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:37,060
Yeah, like at least people can enjoy their sex things. This is a future i've come to right all

2261
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:43,780
Societal norms have fallen away and it's all sex perverts now surely seems like that was what he liked when we yeah

2262
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:50,340
Yeah, after he's seen what an epcot is and he's like, well, but just tell me they still hold freak cot every year

2263
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:55,240
For one special day things get a little really experimental

2264
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:59,540
Yeah, I mean what what I would do is if this was still open now, uh

2265
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:02,340
In the dead of night, I would have a couple

2266
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:09,780
Uh college kids that I paid 20 dollars, uh sneak in throw some oily rags around it and just light it on fire

2267
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,780
Here

2268
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,100
Is this the first official burn it down for insurance I kind of said it about back to the future

2269
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:20,980
But I didn't really mean it fully but this is this is the one where I mean just burn it down. I don't know

2270
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:26,260
Yeah, fine as well. I'm with you. Yeah, like you'll get the insurance money and build a soren over

2271
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:32,260
California over the world. It's almost a little what they did. It is what they did pretty much. Yeah, pretty much

2272
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:33,140
They burned it down

2273
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,940
Although although in reality what they did was close the ride with very little announcement

2274
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:42,740
And there is very little concern about it and it was a great decision for the park

2275
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:47,700
and uh, uh, if you want the ride to live on it'll live on and uh

2276
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:53,220
Meandering podcasts. Yep. Yeah, I think the appropriate place for it. Well then

2277
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:58,340
Appropriately van you have survived podcast the ride. Thank you so much for being here

2278
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:04,260
It was great to be here putting things in uh in perspective and uh, thanks

2279
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:10,260
I'm glad to have been able to take that role. Yeah anytime uh, anytime that uh, you can

2280
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:15,940
Compare world events to the events of world showcase. I think it's important for us all to do

2281
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:19,220
Let me ask you guys just real quick. Just an apricot question. Where we go

2282
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:23,460
Favorite country in the world showcase

2283
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:26,340
That's interesting. Um

2284
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:30,500
I gotta go norway because of the ride, but is does that not count? Is that to you?

2285
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,660
Is it does it have to be the full package? No, that's a wonderful answer. Yeah, it's gotta be

2286
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:40,740
Yeah, what a ride. Yeah, yeah, and it's and I think fun theming and fun and those trolls you get trolls hanging out

2287
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:45,300
I like this is weird. I don't know if this the first thing that popped into my head was japan

2288
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,500
Uh, because I love the gift shops in japan

2289
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:54,420
Yeah, there are so many different little stores and different type and cool stuff and japanese candy

2290
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,900
Yeah, the candies are great. Like it really like you kind of like

2291
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,980
Like you feel like you're there. I mean and and as we said, we're gonna be there

2292
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:07,060
You know for two three four days. I don't know how long but how many days does it take to see all of the gift shops?

2293
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:12,900
In the tiny japan and apricot, uh, I would say two days or two days. I think you need guys

2294
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:17,060
You're out of your fucking minds poor. Oh god. I'm so sorry

2295
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:20,180
I have a problem

2296
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:22,180
Uh, I think mexico

2297
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:28,740
I always like the boat ride that that lobby you're talking like it now. Mexico is my favorite

2298
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:34,020
So we're high on this the night the night time is the reason for me the restaurant, uh,

2299
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,740
Cavaday tequila the bar where this is newer in the last few years, but they have this

2300
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:43,620
A very nice tequila bar where they will they have tons of different

2301
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,680
uh

2302
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:49,220
Margaritas made with very fresh ingredients. It's delicious

2303
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:55,460
Uh and just like the fact that it's like a starry night and there's music and it's but very

2304
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:00,740
Pleasantly air-conditioned during the day as I find beautiful. It's it's great. It's great

2305
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,500
And there's nothing like especially like usually if you're going uh clockwise

2306
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:10,500
Mexico is great because it's the first one you get that drink in your hand and you're ready to tour the world

2307
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:15,700
You're ready like there's a nice feeling like only possibility lies ahead of you from here on out

2308
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:19,700
Like it's just it's the start of a wonderful journey a tipsy journey

2309
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:25,620
That has many different stops including one where benjamin franklin and mark twain shake hands

2310
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:31,540
I also had to give credit to canada the last time I was there. I really enjoyed canada shot out to canada

2311
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:38,580
Uh great steak at lace lea wonderful restaurant. This is this is a sidetrack on a very long episode already it occurred to me

2312
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,900
uh this weekend that there are

2313
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:43,300
Do you know how many there are?

2314
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,140
four attractions

2315
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:51,940
Films in the various parks starring martin short. He's made four. Wow different wait, so canada canada ride

2316
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:54,420
Making of me and wonders of life

2317
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:58,740
Uh your burn it to the ground for richards money. There's something called the cinema

2318
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:04,180
Magique in paris and then the monster sound show with chevy chase

2319
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,620
four

2320
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:10,580
Films that are shown only in disney parks. Hey, i'm good with that also none of them

2321
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:13,380
anyone likes

2322
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:19,540
Okay, not memorable. I kind of like that sound effects show. Yeah, i'm better than anything else they they put in

2323
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:27,140
Um, and uh, I haven't seen canada 360 with martin short. Maybe it's a ball. I don't mean to uh,

2324
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:33,140
Assail it. Okay, positive affirmations. All right, so our canadian listeners will be mad

2325
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:37,860
Uh that we're disparaging martin short's work and then our japanese listeners will be mad

2326
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,620
Because we all picked the wrong numbers days to spend at the park

2327
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:44,900
I was always a little disappointed on by canada

2328
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:48,340
uh in epcot i've just always felt a little bit like

2329
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,620
I wish it were maybe somewhere more exotic every single one of them needs a boat ride

2330
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:56,020
You'd like canada fine if you're on a blog

2331
01:57:56,660 --> 01:58:02,420
Or going through them through yeah the beautiful wilderness or like going through a maple factory

2332
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:07,140
Yeah, oh boy. Yeah, that's that's what i'll dream of

2333
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:12,660
Well, if I don't we're making this longer and longer but uh west cot was going to be built out here

2334
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:15,540
And there was going to be a giant boat ride that took you through all the countries

2335
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:19,860
Yeah, really it was going to go all the way around the park. It was a 45 minute. I think boat ride

2336
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,100
You could get off at multiple stops

2337
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:27,620
You would have gotten your boat ride wish through all the countries and did we say in the american adventure there was a

2338
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:31,620
art of of the history of america told on a boat ride
