1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to podcast the ride a theme park podcast where we remember that Tommy used to sing on the

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Tommy used to sing on the boardwalk but Disney raised the rent and jelly rolls left it's tough

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So tough

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Gina worked the door all night collecting twenty two dollars the price was more than fair

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was fair

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So fair

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She says we've got to hold on to nineties Disney World stuff

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It doesn't make a difference if we like it or not Michael Eisner okayed it and that's enough

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now that jelly rolls is closed

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sure Michael is somewhere distraught

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh the world is unfair

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh I'm sending out a prayer

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey there God make it reopen somewhere

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh to make Michael Eisner not despair

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hi I'm Mike Carlson joining me as always Jason Sheridan

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well I liked it and one of our guests liked it

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay good I'm glad

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That'll be the standard division for how this is gonna go I think

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I was in such a moment I was feeling it so much I didn't even notice the reactions I just I was connected to something bigger in me

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Scott Garner is here as well hopefully he's connected

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah well you know I mean I liked the lyrics that you were doing but the main thing when you started singing I was like I know that song

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's a song I know and when I hear a song I know and I realize the people around me also know a song I know I freak out

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Cause it's like I'm alive and there's a song that everyone in the room knows and that's plenty for me and that's worth $22 to me

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well that's good I agree with you that's actually maybe not in the same tone how I believe it but that is basically a similar

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean the tone was excited

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm smiling it's an upbeat tone I don't know what you're referring to tonally

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're on zoom so sometimes the tone gets strange when you're on a zoom call I understand that so maybe I'm just sort of interpreting it wrong

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There's a false sarcasm filter that comes through

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There is we're doing stream yard now and there might be a false sarcasm filter that's what I'm interpreting

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah that's the problem when you're dealing with technology we don't always use yeah

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay yeah so well look we're coming in hot today let's bring the guests in because I think we all have we're all really riled up today

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In different ways but they're returning to podcast the ride from World Wrestling Entertainment it's Candice LeRae and Johnny Gargano

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you welcome back thank you for being here

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I felt like I should have applauded them but then I was like are we not supposed to

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey I just want to say up front Mike that performance was better than anything Jelly Rolls has ever seen

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I mean that was awesome

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Johnny I love you you're my favorite guest in one sentence you're my favorite guest in history

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We're just getting started guys

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We're just warming up

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I took notes I have a notepad of stuff here about Jelly Rolls just right up I can't see it on the camera

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You don't want them to see it you don't want them to know

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They're from me they're from my eyes only

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right yes

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Does it have just to be just so we're clear does it have the amount of pianos is it one or two

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because I'm worried we're going to lose sight of the basics here

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So everyone knows how many pianos are in that building

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So everyone knows

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah oh boy

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can't wait I'm excited guys

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm excited to dig in here

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's a great idea actually

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like tooling piano bars

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know the standard is two

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But what if there were three

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh yeah

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Or if there's like just like you know

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dozens

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Dozens

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I mean I was just a

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Civil war of

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What if everyone

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Instead of a table is sitting at a piano

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's what I cast

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Look I love that idea

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well you mean like the guests are just

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's what I thought okay I don't want to I don't want to spoil some here

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But that's what I thought

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sitting there in the moment again I've been there once

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I went there once just for this podcast

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
To be fair

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can kind of set that up there

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Never ever ever go I was

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Like I had accepted

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It will never be a place that he's ever going to experience

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In his life

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And you guys did me a solid

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So thank you guys

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're welcome

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thought process on Jelly Rolls like this is years ago

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Years before I even know what the place was

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Given my profession I have to diet a lot

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I go to

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Disney World I want like a nice treat

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And we're walking on the boardwalk and I see a sign

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That says Jelly Rolls

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And I'm like oh it's probably a bakery

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That serves fantastic delicious

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Jelly Rolls

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It is not

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Spoiler alert it's not that

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They don't got that I think that that just put a bad taste

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
In your mouth from the beginning

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I wanted a good taste in my mouth

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's false advertising

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's false advertising from the

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Gecko and by the way as we

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Get into what it is

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is one of those things I am going to require

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That somebody says the basics

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because I do think

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I still don't know

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What's happening

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah so Jelly

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Rolls is well

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Was I should say because Jelly Rolls sadly has

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Closed but it was a

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mainstay on the boardwalk

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Over 30 years

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
30 years

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
On the boardwalk

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Disney's boardwalk

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hotel that's the strip

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That has like the abracadabra

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Which we talk about a lot which is a little

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Magic theme bar there's a now

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What is it called the cake bake shop is on the boardwalk

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And there's a

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's good

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We haven't been there yet

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Jelly Rolls should have been

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It should have just sold delicious

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wasn't Jason mad at that place because

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Of prices? Sure

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I understand that

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think a lot of people were

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They did lower them at some point

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They did lower some of the menu prices

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because there was such an uproar

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Over the prices

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I would spend $150

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
For one slice of cake

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then sit there and let the Jelly Rolls

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Experience happen to me again

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Jelly Rolls and K.I. in case you haven't pieced it together

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And you don't know it was a dueling piano

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bar

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In the style of a Howl at the Moon

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If that helps if that's a place that you know

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
More well than

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Jelly Rolls but you would get you would go up

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you would tip and you would generally

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Tip and write down the suggestion for a

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Song and hopefully they would get to playing

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It on the piano there were antics

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That also happened at Jelly Rolls you know

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There was somebody would bring a saxophone out

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They would do little dances

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It was pretty it was a little more

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Aggressive than just a quiet like

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Piano bar so it would be more of a rowdy

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Party like atmosphere I would

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I would call it an aggressive

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Place that plays a lot of Muppet songs

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Aggressive is the word

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You would use you will hear

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You will hear an aggressive I'll make

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A man out of you from Mulan

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Which is an aggressive

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Look good it's about masculinity right there

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So yeah that's the kind of

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They play a little bit of some toxic stuff a little bit

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right yes that's true

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know have they ever played toxic by Britney Spears

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I would hope so

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
1000%

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Obviously

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Have they ever done a deep cut like toxic

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Toxic might be a little too

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Obscure for Jelly Rolls though that's all

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm saying

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I feel like though in the 30 years that song

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Had to be popular enough that

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Somebody would request it in that time

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Right I would think so

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You would have to yeah they would have

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
At least tried it one night to see

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But I will say this

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Personally I didn't know this

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What this really was until like two years ago

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I think we talked about it on the show

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is that we were all hanging out at Abracadabra

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I was just like looking

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I think I maybe thought it was just a facade

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I maybe thought that Jelly Rolls was just like

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh that was just a fun yeah

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Look I'm admitting my ignorance

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I didn't realize what it was

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And we went in there and of course I lit up

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I was so excited by it

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I brought everyone around

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Scott I believe did not go in that night

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In 2023

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well I did because here's how it played out

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think maybe I'd heard of it

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then we you know we didn't go in

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There's kind of like a

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There's a little bit of a lobby

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Area and a box office

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And when I learned that the

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Cover charge was 20

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Dollars for me

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And it's at the end of like a long

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very long Epcot day

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
With a lot of walking

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And a lot of food and a lot of wine

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So now

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At the end of the day

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I am

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The premise is that I'm supposed to pay

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
20 Dollars in order

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
To go listen

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
To like all

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of the most obvious songs

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In the world with a

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In a room that seems

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like it is made to hold

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
100 people and instead there are

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
900 people

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
From the little lobby

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was stressed by the lobby

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then also knowing

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That mere steps away

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Are the masterpiece hotels

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The Swan and the Dolphin

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where I could go and just walk and have some

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Peace have a moment to myself

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In the Michael Graves Causeway

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There was just there was I mean like I think if it had been

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Free possibly maybe I

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Would have popped in but when I heard that cover charge

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My jaw dropped like you're

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Kidding there's no way

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
On earth that

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That was like an insurmountable hill

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For me in that moment and then later

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When we when we returned a few years later

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah I you know I

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Said 20 Dollars oh

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's a steal I can

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I felt

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I felt

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I felt like we I walked into

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Like a time warp cause it feels

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So 90s in there and it's

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like I'm traveling to a place that I never knew

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you think?

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It doesn't feel 90s it feels like 60s

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
50s

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it's the logo that

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Feels so 90s to me that's like

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's on the wall there

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I've talked on the show

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Before I really never went to Pleasure Island

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And I'm nostalgic

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
For a life not lived in Pleasure

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Island I'm nostalgic for

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Going to mannequins

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I never did it but like

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Reading through the Facebook group of the

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Pleasure Island memories

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was like oh this would have been so much fun

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
To do if I was a young

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Adult again but

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I feel like going to jelly rolls is

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look I in general like

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Singing songs loudly with

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
People even if they're the 20 songs

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That everybody knows so but

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think there was an extra element of like oh my god

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I went into a time warp and I'm

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Back in time in Disney

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Worlds and that also felt good

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For me as well and yeah

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You have to respect that

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You have to respect that

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean Johnny you don't have to

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Johnny feel free

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Feel free not to respect that

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You are allowed to not respect it

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the logo we're having

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I respect all of that

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Obviously you see the back of

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My background I definitely respect Vinded

290
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But my

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Collect your thoughts

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Take your time

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Vastly different

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Than yours

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Again I made notes

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I can tell you what the thought

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
My first initial thought was when I walked

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In the building before I

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Before I walked in the building honestly

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The first thing before we're walking in

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Set the stage for you

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Our son

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And his nanny are over at Hollywood Studios

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Watching Phantasmag

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So we do the smart thing towards the end where we're like

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll go to Hollywood

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Studios

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
People can go into Hollywood

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Watch Phantasmag as much as he wants

310
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Especially when they're show one and two

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We can walk from Hollywood

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Over to Jelly Rolls

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So on this night

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We did the walk

315
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was a nice walk

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Great walk

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Walk from Hollywood Studios over to Jelly Rolls

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
As we're approaching Jelly Rolls

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
My first initial instinct

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The smell

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It has nothing to do with actual Jelly Rolls

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Right outside of Jelly Rolls

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I wrote, smells like poop

324
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know the opposite of a Jelly Roll

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The smell of a Jelly Roll

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think they were just replanting stuff

327
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And it was a little moist out

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And so it just smelled like manure

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It smelled bad

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It smells horrible

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The back of it

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The backside

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Horrible smell

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not coming from Jelly Rolls itself

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was a nice bakery

336
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm just saying

337
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Smell fantastic

338
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Other end of the boardwalk

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Other end of the boardwalk

340
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is the entertainment district

341
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
As they call it

342
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Put me in the head space

343
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It smells like poop

344
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That can't help

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Can I ask a question just to back it up

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Slightly here

347
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because it seems like where you guys are starting

348
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is that Candice has been trying to talk

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Johnny into doing this for a while

350
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are you

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Candice you're coming in with like

352
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Have you done this place a lot

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you a huge fan of Jelly Rolls

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When I was living in California

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There was a dueling piano bar

356
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That was in downtown Fullerton

357
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I was like

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wow this dueling piano bar is amazing

359
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I loved it

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So we moved out here

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I just never really found the time

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
To make my way over to Jelly Rolls

363
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And was like dying to go

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So for my cousin's birthday

365
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A couple of years ago

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We were with our

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It was me, my cousin, her mom and my mom

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And our moms are sisters

369
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And we're like well let's go over

370
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And check out Jelly Rolls

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because this seems like a perfect time to do this

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like our moms are here, they love music

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This will be great

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It was amazing

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It was like the funnest night

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And since it was so close to my mom's birthday

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
She was a percussionist

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So super into

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Music

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But anytime we go anywhere she's drumming on tables

381
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She's picking up random things

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And using them as like instruments

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So we'd written on the napkin

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That we would like

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We requested that for my mom's birthday

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They let her play a tambourine

387
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because she just kept talking about like

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I wish I could just have a tambourine

389
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They let her go and play a tambourine

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
She did Hey Ya

391
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In our life apparently

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Unbeknownst to me

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She killed it

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it was like the most perfect, fun, amazing night

395
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That you could possibly have

396
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At Jelly Rolls

397
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So my cousin and I went back like a few more times

398
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But Johnny would not go

399
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Which complicates me being

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A frequenter especially with a kid now

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So like

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I would have loved to have been

403
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is interesting

404
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So Johnny's against

405
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The notion of it

406
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You haven't even gotten a taste of it

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And Candice is saying it's an incredible

408
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
One of the best nights she's ever had

409
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That was not enough to

410
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What were you fearing?

411
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What was making you never want to try this?

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just the idea of it

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sounds like it's awful

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But mind you

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
His own mother, if I took his mom with us

416
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She would have loved it

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's one of my notes

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
My mom would love this

419
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Not you

420
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Now with some of that

421
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's just like the general vibe

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because you know the vibe of a dueling piano bar

423
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is any of it like me

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Where you're like

425
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't think I'm going to enjoy hearing

426
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The 20 most famous songs that exist

427
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is that a wall for you?

428
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Honestly I just think

429
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I just don't get the point of it

430
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I was there

431
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And I was sitting there

432
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And I was like

433
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nothing is happening

434
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
People are having so much fun

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What do you mean nothing is happening?

436
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What is happening?

437
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Everybody in that room is having so much fun

438
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Except you

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Who's just on your phone like I hate this

440
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It smells like poop

441
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
First note smells like poop

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Second note too loud

443
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Too loud

444
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I know what you mean

445
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll accept

446
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I want music to be loud if I'm at a concert

447
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That I'm excited about

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But if I'm not particularly thrilled

449
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
With what I'm experiencing

450
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I saw O-Town in the 90s

451
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm always down for a good concert

452
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In O-Town?

453
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Not in O-Town

454
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not in Cleveland, Ohio

455
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But Ohio, O-Town

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How was Liquid Dreams that night?

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Fantastic

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Ashley Parker Angel absolutely killed it

459
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Johnny knows what's up musically

460
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's not for sure

461
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He was there

462
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hold on now it's a different story

463
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Did you consider writing

464
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
O-Town

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
On one of the slips

466
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
With a 20

467
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Did you see if they could play that

468
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I ain't giving more money

469
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That is fair

470
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have given my fair share of money

471
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
To this cause

472
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But it's for the talent

473
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You can't tell me that the pianists aren't talented

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They are

475
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They are

476
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So think about this

477
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The second a song becomes popular

478
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
These guys have to learn

479
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This song immediately

480
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Immediately

481
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Because it is going to be requested

482
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
A thousand times

483
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And they have to play it

484
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Here's where my head goes with all this stuff

485
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Nothing's happening

486
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Everything is happening

487
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you're going there

488
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you're going to Jelly Rolls

489
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They're serving great food

490
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And you're going to sit there and eat a nice meal

491
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Eat a nice meal

492
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Sure, no food

493
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They serve popcorn

494
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Popcorn is flowing like water

495
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you're going to get a fancy drink

496
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Nothing is happening

497
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're sitting there

498
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Letting these two guys

499
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let it happen to you

500
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Playing this music

501
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I view this like almost in wrestling

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I like watching bad wrestling

503
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So my head went to

504
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To make this thing even better

505
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Take the guys

506
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Take the professionals out of it

507
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Just let two amateurs duel

508
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then we see who wins

509
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's what I would do

510
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He just wanted to see random people go up on the stage

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
One person goes up and plays a song

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Fight it out in a piano duel

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's what I think dueling pianos should be

514
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
To be a fighter at some point

515
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is like Roger Rabbit

516
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I wish

517
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Johnny

518
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What's the last concert you saw?

519
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Music concert

520
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Has it been a while?

521
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm trying to think

522
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Music concert, just to clarify

523
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It is an old town

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, it could be a

525
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Different kind of concert

526
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't think he's been to a single concert

527
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Since we've met

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We've been together for like 10 years

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's been a while

530
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's been a while

531
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I honestly can't even remember the last concert I've been to

532
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you ever stop and go

533
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Where's my headset there?

534
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't think he likes live music to be fair

535
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know that you even like

536
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I feel like if you went to a concert

537
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You would just be like

538
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Nothing's happening

539
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It would be an epic band and you'd be like

540
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Nothing is happening

541
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So this discredits you

542
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Is there a band you would like

543
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Say they were playing nearby

544
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That you would make a point to go see them?

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Even if they're dead

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Even if it's the Beatles

547
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You could go say the Beatles

548
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Any band

549
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I mean obviously that would be cool if the Beatles were back alive

550
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Limp Bizkit

551
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They have been sure done Limp Bizkit

552
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
At Jelly Rolls, right?

553
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I mean they've had to play

554
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
They've barely played Roland at least once

555
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
At Jelly Rolls

556
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If they played Roland at Jelly Rolls

557
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Would you be like whoa

558
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is an argument that Mike makes

559
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
From time to time which is

560
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They played a song you like

561
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Two guys have never heard of playing the song I like

562
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That doesn't help me

563
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's not the version I like

564
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That does not help the argument to me

565
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When we were there

566
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I feel like

567
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The Jelly Roll Gods were not on our side

568
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How long were we there for? I set a timer

569
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He set a timer because the deal was that

570
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You walked in and I set a timer

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I think we said originally

572
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What was the time that we were

573
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It was like 20-30 minutes

574
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I stayed extra

575
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I stayed longer than that

576
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Just to see are we going to play a song that I actually know

577
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We did not

578
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I wanted to request

579
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let the bodies hit the floor by drowning pool

580
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But that would have been really salt

581
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If I could request one song I can go back in history

582
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not getting any money

583
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If I can request one song

584
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It would be Let the bodies hit the floor by drowning pool

585
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Do you think it might bring the room down?

586
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you think the room might be

587
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
People would be like one nothing wrong with me

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Two nothing

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Somethings got to give

590
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If that happens

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Maybe

592
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let the bodies hit the floor

593
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He played that song to my womb

594
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know how they say you should play music

595
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
For children while they're in the womb

596
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Against the belly

597
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It will help their mind

598
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I played Let the bodies hit the floor by drowning pool

599
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Wow

600
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Is that your favorite song?

601
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It might be

602
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If anyone asks me a song

603
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's always my go to

604
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Song

605
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Any scenario

606
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I think it works in any scenario

607
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wedding first dance

608
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let the bodies hit the floor

609
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Did he play it at our wedding?

610
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't think we did play it at our wedding

611
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I did a weird L

612
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
For our first dance

613
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Which weird L?

614
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If that isn't love

615
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't know what love is

616
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I can't even remember what album it's off of

617
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's a love song

618
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If that isn't love

619
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Then I don't know what love is

620
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's an original L

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Wow

622
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That original L

623
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's just a really cute song

624
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because it's a lot of like

625
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If you ate eggs

626
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'd still

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I can't even remember all the lyrics

628
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But I hate eggs

629
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He loves to eat them

630
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'd still kiss him after he ate some eggs

631
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's in the song

632
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We just didn't really take ourselves very seriously

633
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
At our wedding I guess

634
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I came out to a piano version

635
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Of Shawn Michaels song

636
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Or I guess piano version of Macho Man song

637
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So that's where we were

638
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We're getting into that as well for a second

639
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Just as a quick aside

640
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Wedding entrances

641
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Not fun

642
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Coming from the world of wrestling

643
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He got upset because he asked me

644
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I said

645
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I was going over, I was like what do we have the wedding party

646
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Walk down the aisle to

647
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And we did a piano version of the WrestleMania theme

648
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And then he was like

649
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm walking down the aisle too

650
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And I was like I mean you just go

651
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
With the rest of the party

652
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Like you go first I think

653
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He didn't like that

654
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I said you maybe walk your mom down the aisle

655
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He goes no, I want my own entrance

656
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I should get an entrance too

657
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm trying to explain to

658
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm trying to explain to the

659
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Wedding planner

660
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm like so here's the thing

661
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Is that not only does he

662
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Require his own entrance

663
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But he wants to go right before I come out

664
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah it's our thing

665
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Which complicates it when we're hiding

666
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Each other

667
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They're trying to hide me

668
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I have to like sprint down this long

669
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because we got married at the Grand Californian

670
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Hotel in Disneyland

671
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And in that little

672
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You know where like the Monorail kind of goes over in the

673
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Courtyard by the downtown Disney

674
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So that's where we got married

675
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And I had this like

676
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Long hallway that I had to

677
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Like sprint down

678
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Just to like be there on

679
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Time because he literally had to go

680
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Right before me his own entrance

681
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
By himself and then

682
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He had a gripe about it

683
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean you think like again

684
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Coming from the world of wrestling you do entrance and people are like

685
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah they're pumped up

686
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No one makes any noise at a wedding

687
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You just walk down to silence and it's like

688
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This kind of sucks

689
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because my family and friends you think they would give me

690
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
A little something I don't know

691
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But it made my wife uncomfortable

692
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
As well like she

693
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Started walking and it was like the quiet

694
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hush of like oh the bride

695
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Is here and she kind of hated it and she said

696
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Like hey what's up everybody

697
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And then that got a huge applause

698
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then it lit the room and then it was like oh now we're cooking

699
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Which I found was wonderful

700
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I was like oh that's her personality coming through

701
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
She doesn't want to be the like delicate

702
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Maybe just kind of smarten them up next time and be like

703
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Please applaud

704
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It was a huge moment

705
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I think this should change

706
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I think you guys are onto something about like upping the entry

707
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That said it does seem very

708
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Inconvenient for Candice

709
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
To have had to

710
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know how it had to become a hallway

711
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You being bright before me was very inconvenient

712
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But we got there

713
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Scott

714
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What piano version

715
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Of a wrestler's theme did Aaron walk down the aisle

716
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
To?

717
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Undertaker

718
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well that'd be good

719
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well the entire

720
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The entire wedding

721
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Was scored to the

722
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hulkster rules album

723
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh there you go

724
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
First dance was to Hulkster in heaven

725
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
There you go

726
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's fantastic

727
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I want to check in real quick Jason Sheridan has not

728
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Done jelly rolls and he will

729
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I hate to be rubbing it in

730
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You'll never do it

731
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's over

732
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh no I'm not going to say that

733
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But

734
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
My family

735
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
My family

736
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Stayed at the boardwalk once or twice

737
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But I was like

738
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A pre-teen and this is like

739
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
One of the places at Disneyland

740
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Disney World

741
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Where there is like 21

742
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And up

743
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And it's very funny that

744
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
They have that cause right before this

745
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I watched a clip and they were playing

746
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The Mickey Mouse Club theme

747
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh so

748
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But that's for the adults

749
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's for the child inside of all of us

750
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That's true yeah

751
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You need a place where you can listen to children's music

752
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And essentially throw up while you're singing it

753
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That has happened a lot there there's no way

754
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It hasn't 30 years

755
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
How many throw ups okay that's all we don't know the answer

756
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
How many times has someone thrown up

757
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
At Jelly Rolls in 30 years

758
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
At least once a night

759
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Once a night yeah easy

760
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So it's about

761
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
200,000 pukes

762
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I mean if not

763
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In Jelly Rolls when they go outside

764
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And smell the sewage they probably like immediately

765
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Right afterwards

766
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah

767
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So Jason though do you feel

768
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You don't have to feel sad I'm not trying to make

769
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You feel sad but what do you feel about

770
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Never getting to do this

771
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah I don't know

772
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I think it probably would have been fun

773
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We did go to Hell at the Moon

774
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The one time

775
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
For the City Walk Saga

776
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And yeah

777
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It was kind of

778
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I think we went on a Wednesday or Thursday

779
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And it was

780
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I mean an experience

781
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What a review

782
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I had more

783
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Fun than Jason that night

784
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I was trying to get us all to dance and Jason was a

785
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Hard no

786
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I forgot about the dancing

787
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah you didn't want to go down there

788
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Right but we had the big

789
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We shared a big blue bucket

790
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We shared a big blue

791
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Bucket and it was

792
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Like three or four dollar

793
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Absolute vodka

794
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So everyone's drinking doubles

795
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And then we recorded

796
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
At like one

797
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
In the morning right afterwards

798
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah

799
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But yeah I mean

800
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think it's impressive

801
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That like the

802
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Not just one pianist but

803
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Two pianists can play

804
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Like in tandem

805
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And like kind of complement

806
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Each other or

807
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Race each other or something like that

808
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Jason I hate to cut you off

809
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It doesn't sound like you're that distraught

810
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Over going to Jelly Rolls

811
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I well

812
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I said the entertainment district

813
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's okay if you're not

814
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
When I was like

815
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
In 2014 I was like

816
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh that's

817
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That end of the boardwalk is for

818
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Adults and like I don't know

819
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I guess

820
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's forbidden

821
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's still off limits to you in some ways

822
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It is yeah

823
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Have you been in the dance

824
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Have you been in the dance hall

825
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No I think anytime I tried to go

826
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It wasn't open

827
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But it seems a lot more open

828
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Nowadays

829
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That I believe is all ages right

830
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Or is that 21 and 9

831
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Did we have to show

832
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We did pop in there last trip

833
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Did we have to show an ID

834
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't recall

835
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah that's another I guess if we're talking about

836
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah this district of the boardwalk hotel

837
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
There is Jelly Rolls and then right next to it is something called the Atlantic

838
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Dance hall

839
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Which when we popped in was hopping

840
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Kevin Tully our pal and

841
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Recent guest

842
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He was excited to get me in there because

843
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He's like

844
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He's like this is now this is like a locked in time

845
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I think you'll like because there's sort of

846
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Some like you know 90s by way

847
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Of 40s and neon and I was

848
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Really digging it there

849
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I and I think

850
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He was anticipating it would be weirdly

851
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Empty which I think it is a lot of the time

852
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But in this case like

853
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Really hopping I like

854
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
A ton of people out there dancing

855
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
To bye bye bye or whatever

856
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We went up on the balcony where you got

857
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
A nice view of the Epcot resorts

858
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We actually met some listeners up there

859
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Had a good chat for a second

860
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
They asked where's everybody else I said

861
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Well Mike's here but he's a he's over

862
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
At Jelly Rolls speaking of and then

863
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You texted and your text was

864
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Bad bad Leroy Brown

865
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And I

866
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Which as and this has become a recurring

867
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Thing in the several times that we've been

868
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And I have either gone and then left

869
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Immediately

870
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Or just not gone at all

871
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Some of like you are trying to like

872
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't know what you're trying that's a

873
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Question what are you trying to do

874
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
When you text me bad bad Leroy Brown

875
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Because it's not making me jealous

876
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's doing the opposite of that what is the

877
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Intent when you are when you send a

878
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Text of that nature

879
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay let me analyze

880
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Another one right after was

881
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They're going ape for

882
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
American pie

883
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And these things just make me like oh

884
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
My god I'm thrilled to be in any

885
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Room other than that room

886
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think it depends

887
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think I know that you're

888
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Probably not going to get thrilled by bad bad

889
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Leroy Brown and I think

890
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I think I'm sending that but I do think I've also

891
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Sent since more sincere

892
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Texts and I can't think of any

893
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Off the top of my head of songs I think

894
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You would like I think those

895
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Two in particular I did find it

896
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Funny I think really when that

897
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
When they start playing bad bad Leroy Brown or

898
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
American pie I do think

899
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It amuses me how angry you

900
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Would get I will I think that is what

901
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It is so I think if he was physically

902
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There yeah I think

903
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I think I think I'm like laughing

904
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
At the idea of bad bad Leroy

905
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Brown coming on and you're just being like what you

906
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Turn the table over

907
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So I think I'm like sharing

908
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It for that reason in those

909
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It is an attempted rile up

910
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I because this tradition kind of began

911
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Because a couple years ago when

912
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
A group ended up there which was

913
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Kevin and Griffin Newman

914
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And Nate Mr. Morrow

915
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And when I departed

916
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And did not join that group

917
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Then for the rest of the night everyone was

918
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Texting all of the songs

919
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That were being played and this is a

920
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Transcript this was Griffin

921
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Leading the charge on our text

922
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Thread Griffin

923
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Scott this place fucking

924
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Rocks

925
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This may have been after a video

926
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Of

927
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Of a cover of Love Shack

928
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Which was a to me

929
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
In rewatching it this morning

930
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
A nightmarish cover

931
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Of Love Shack

932
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But I guess Griffin felt differently I texted

933
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Back I'm thrilled with my choice thrilled

934
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Because at this point I'm sitting by the water

935
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Staring at the Swan

936
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Hotel I just went and sat on the grass

937
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Put them in a real moment of peace

938
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It was amazing and I'm getting

939
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
These texts what's that

940
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Nature you're having a moment yeah yeah

941
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Essentially yeah well nature combined with

942
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
80s architecture that's exactly where I

943
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Want to be yeah you got that's part of it you got to know

944
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What you want as Johnny does

945
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So then

946
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He keeps going then he then Griffin switches

947
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
To all caps Scott

948
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They're performing the Ken song

949
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Now

950
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Barbie I'm just

951
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Ken and then I what my

952
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Response was I have never been

953
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
More confident in a decision

954
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Number one this number two

955
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Marrying Aaron

956
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I put I put my decision

957
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Ahead of my

958
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Marriage

959
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sure I was I did not want to be listening to the Ken

960
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Song well now the Ken

961
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Song was only a few months old at that

962
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Point so I bet that was a big hit

963
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You know

964
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
To Candice's point

965
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They are keeping up with the with the time I feel

966
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Like they do it's like they know

967
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Eight songs from the last

968
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Year and then other than that you're going back

969
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
To pre 2003 that's

970
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Kind of the what seems like the setlist

971
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Here did any

972
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Anyone get a

973
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Fancy like the

974
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Applebee's Applebee's

975
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Date night song I feel

976
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Like that was a big hit I feel like

977
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They would do that I

978
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Don't I would be skeptical that they would

979
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Have ever played that fit song fancy

980
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Like that you and I are big fans of

981
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And that Applebee's used in a commercial

982
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
A lot of commercials

983
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Was that

984
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Was that a stump on Johnny and Candice

985
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I think I know what he's talking about

986
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And if that's the case

987
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's not getting played at Jelly Rolls

988
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Candice that's my role on

989
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The show

990
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Jason's per episode

991
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Stumping of everyone in the room

992
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Walker I shout

993
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This will help it was a song

994
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Performed by Walker Hayes

995
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh yeah

996
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah

997
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Okay so now we're all clear

998
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
On what it is so we talked about

999
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This this night that we had in 2023

1000
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
On the show

1001
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And I feel like of there were a handful

1002
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Of people reached out Candice reached out to me

1003
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
At this point and was so incredibly

1004
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Passionate about Jelly

1005
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Rolls like you were

1006
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like oh my god I love Jelly Rolls

1007
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And then we basically

1008
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Right then and there were like okay well we have to

1009
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Do an episode on Jelly Rolls eventually

1010
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I think the thought was

1011
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh we'll go there next time

1012
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And make a thing of it

1013
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And then of course in 2024

1014
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Very early in 2025 I forget now

1015
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh yeah it was it felt like it was

1016
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I felt like they were goofing on us

1017
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It happened after we were just like

1018
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
This is gonna happen we were so pumped

1019
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And then they said

1020
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And they said no we're closing

1021
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Jelly Rolls

1022
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Closer announced yeah

1023
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think it might have been even early 2025

1024
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So honestly at that point we were pretty

1025
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sure we're going to go to Epic Universe

1026
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
After it opened which now it's open

1027
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But like we'll be like it's gonna be at the end of May

1028
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
At the earliest we'll be there

1029
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It seems like Jelly Rolls is

1030
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Not gonna happen and it did make

1031
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Me sad because obviously we were gonna still do an episode

1032
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But it felt like okay that's

1033
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's gonna be a little bit of the episode that's

1034
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Just not gonna be as it's not gonna be as

1035
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Satisfying because we didn't get to go one last time

1036
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And then and it would lead to me

1037
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Never having done it

1038
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Because he never went in

1039
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But

1040
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
A miracle happened

1041
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
A miracle happened

1042
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We were invited to a preview of

1043
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Epic Universe and yes

1044
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Epic Universe was really fun to go

1045
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
To see it before it opens to the public

1046
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Getting to do that before the general

1047
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Public we were so lucky to do it we had an

1048
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Amazing Disney World Day in general

1049
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Where you know just because of the

1050
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Kindness of someone we were able to do

1051
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
A lot of rides skipping the lines

1052
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That was amazing but

1053
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I was really

1054
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Really excited to one

1055
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Last time go to Jelly Rolls

1056
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It felt like oh my god this is

1057
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Going to be the perfect trip every day

1058
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Is packed with something super fun

1059
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And satisfying and then

1060
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Just by happenstance a friend of mine

1061
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
From a long time ago was in there

1062
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Was in Disney World with her family

1063
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And she used to work at Disney World

1064
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
During like the intern like college

1065
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Intern program and she

1066
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Was like I have to go to Jelly Rolls

1067
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
One last time so I ended up

1068
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
On like a three and a half day

1069
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Trip going to Jelly Rolls two out of the three

1070
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Days which was

1071
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Unbelievable

1072
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So I got

1073
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
A short trip real estate

1074
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
To spend in that Johnny what do you

1075
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I got to get your reaction to that

1076
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Please Johnny

1077
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Johnny let me have it let me have it Johnny

1078
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Be kind

1079
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
No

1080
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So you went to Epic Universe

1081
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Fantastic new experience

1082
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Amazing rides all

1083
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Up to date technology

1084
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Just so futuristic

1085
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And then you cap

1086
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It off by going to quite possibly

1087
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The worst place

1088
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You can go to

1089
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The worst place

1090
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You can go to

1091
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You like ended the sentence

1092
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That was the end of that sentence

1093
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No qualifiers

1094
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I was there I was thinking about what

1095
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Would I rather be doing right now other than

1096
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
This and the first thing that

1097
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Popped into my head because we went on that walk

1098
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That Scott was talking about of sitting

1099
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Outside looking at the dolphins by the

1100
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Water I thought

1101
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know what would be better than this

1102
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Sitting by that water and one of those

1103
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Alligators just coming out and trying to

1104
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Attack me

1105
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That would be better than what I'm doing right now

1106
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Getting experience

1107
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I knew

1108
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Perhaps less

1109
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Annoying than that particular love shack cover

1110
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yes

1111
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So

1112
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What do you think is better

1113
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Monsters Unchained or Jelly Roll

1114
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll give you

1115
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Options here

1116
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Hang on

1117
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Monsters Unchained was down when we were there

1118
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh you didn't do it

1119
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's unfair how dare you

1120
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Which Jelly Rolls was down

1121
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It is down

1122
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's down

1123
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Old Yeller

1124
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They've been dropping like flies

1125
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The Mama Melrose

1126
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Closed one of my family's favorites

1127
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Jelly Rolls closed

1128
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Do you know

1129
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You're not going to want to talk to me about this

1130
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because I'm very much so

1131
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IP guy

1132
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Put some IP in there

1133
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Put some IP in Jelly Rolls

1134
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Do you have any ideas Johnny

1135
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Sorry

1136
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
He thinks that anything that's like

1137
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Outdated should just be demolished

1138
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Plus it up

1139
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You think that they should just be gone

1140
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
No plus it up

1141
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You're not the first

1142
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
First cast to say that

1143
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You haven't announced anything right

1144
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
There was a rumor that they're going to

1145
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The rumor that there's like a jazz club

1146
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Going in there

1147
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't like that either

1148
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
There's music so much

1149
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I like jazz

1150
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm worried about that

1151
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Of a bakery

1152
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But there's the

1153
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Cake bake shop

1154
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You can never have enough bakeries

1155
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So they're dueling bakeries now

1156
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
People are upset that the Muppets are leaving

1157
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
How about this

1158
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
How about this

1159
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Swedish Chef

1160
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Put him in there

1161
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
He's making Jelly Rolls

1162
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's not a music place

1163
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He just makes sweets

1164
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Swedish Chef

1165
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
He just wants more food

1166
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Can I pitch you an idea

1167
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
If it's a dueling piano bar

1168
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But all they do is play songs from

1169
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The 1995 Mortal Kombat soundtrack

1170
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Okay

1171
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm warming up to that idea

1172
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
If it would be a specific

1173
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Genre of song maybe

1174
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't know if you're into the Mortal Kombat soundtrack

1175
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm just saying

1176
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Or the Power Rangers

1177
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The first Power Rangers movie

1178
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You're speaking my language now

1179
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What if the Muppets are playing the piano

1180
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The Muppets are playing the piano

1181
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That might be different

1182
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
If you get the actual Muppets to play a piano

1183
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Just put some IP in there

1184
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And give him some Jelly Rolls

1185
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If you wanted to keep the

1186
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Dueling piano concept

1187
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Just make some IP people

1188
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Right

1189
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Who would you want to see

1190
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Who would you want to see play piano

1191
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
In a dueling piano bar IP based

1192
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Because that's a new question

1193
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
IP okay

1194
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So what famous fictional characters play piano

1195
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Obviously as you're saying

1196
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Dr. Teeth from

1197
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Electric Mayhem plays piano

1198
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But like what's a famous

1199
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm trying to think

1200
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I want the guy from Soul

1201
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Joe Gardner

1202
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Joe Gardner versus

1203
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Ryan Gosling La La Land

1204
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I forget if he plays piano

1205
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Done

1206
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
With Joe Gardner in there

1207
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
What if

1208
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What if he though plays

1209
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Don't Stop Believing and Living on a Prayer

1210
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Would that be still good

1211
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Like if he plays the same song

1212
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
He'll do new

1213
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
He'll find new

1214
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
He can play whatever he wants

1215
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Joe Gardner

1216
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh he's got a brother

1217
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Joe Gardner

1218
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
No it's dueling

1219
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You get Joe and you get Joe Gardner

1220
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And they're dueling against each other

1221
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I am glad

1222
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Someone had the name

1223
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Because I'm sitting here going like

1224
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What is that guy

1225
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That character is a very normal name

1226
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And I cannot think of it

1227
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And so I'm glad someone got it

1228
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I would love for them

1229
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
To like lean in

1230
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
My family

1231
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Has a lot of connections to

1232
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Atlantic City

1233
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
My grandfather grew up in Atlantic City

1234
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
A lot of my dad's family

1235
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Lived down there

1236
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
My mom's parents honeymooned

1237
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
In Atlantic City when he was on leave

1238
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
From World War II

1239
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I say

1240
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Make it like a full

1241
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Bootlegger speakeasy

1242
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But

1243
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But add Joe Gardner

1244
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Add Joe Gardner

1245
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And they play

1246
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
They play Fancy Like

1247
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
They can play the Casher remix too

1248
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You know

1249
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Switch it up

1250
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Jason's favorite song is just Fancy Like

1251
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
By Walker Hayes

1252
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
One song from this one Applebee's ad

1253
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Is the go to for

1254
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
From 2022

1255
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's 3 years old

1256
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's 3 years old but I'm telling you that would bring the house down

1257
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If there were dueling pianists

1258
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Dueling jazz pianists

1259
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Playing

1260
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah

1261
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The problem has been a lack of Fancy Like

1262
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That's been the problem

1263
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah for me

1264
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
NIP apparently

1265
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
NIP

1266
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They played Why Should I Worry

1267
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
When we were there that Saturday night

1268
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And I don't know that anyone there knew what it was

1269
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So I'm not sure that Fancy Like

1270
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Is going to light up the audience

1271
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm just a reality check

1272
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Sorry

1273
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I admittedly would have freaked out

1274
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
If they played Why Should I Worry

1275
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You could have requested it

1276
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Maybe they would have known

1277
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
If you were there you could have requested it

1278
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Do they know the Dear Radigan

1279
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Song from the Great Mouse Detective

1280
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't think

1281
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I know that

1282
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't think I knew there was a song

1283
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Jason would you sing a little bit of it for us

1284
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I can only remember

1285
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Dear Radigan

1286
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Dear Radigan

1287
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's a drinking song

1288
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yes it is

1289
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
All the little mice are drinking

1290
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
To the Vincent Price

1291
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Villain

1292
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
First of all

1293
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I don't think anyone in that room would have known that song

1294
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I would have known it

1295
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I would have known it

1296
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
They would have taken it

1297
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Right off the setlist after one play

1298
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I think

1299
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because it wouldn't have gotten a huge crowd

1300
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I always wonder too

1301
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Because when we were there

1302
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We were watching all the napkins

1303
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Go up on the table

1304
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm trying to understand because there's two sides

1305
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
If there was a napkin

1306
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
They'd wad it up and throw it to the other guy

1307
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
The other guy would open it

1308
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Who's deciding this setlist

1309
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Because there were so many moving parts

1310
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
On the napkins

1311
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
On top of the pianos

1312
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Each side had a list of them

1313
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
How do they

1314
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
How do they make their playlists while they're going

1315
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They do a switch at one point

1316
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You kept hyping up this switch

1317
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
She kept hyping up

1318
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Every time I've been there

1319
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
They've done a switch

1320
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's been like a boy band song

1321
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Or like

1322
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Bohemian Rhapsody

1323
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You're getting these

1324
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Songs that are

1325
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A hit every party that you ever go to

1326
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That did not happen

1327
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
On the night that we were there

1328
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
They didn't even

1329
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Actually switch

1330
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
They usually do

1331
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I just feel like Jelly Rolls really did me dirty

1332
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Or Jelly Rolls showed

1333
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What it really is

1334
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I went three different times

1335
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Three different times prior to that

1336
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That were very closely

1337
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Before that

1338
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Great

1339
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Performers were great, crowd not great

1340
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But still a good night

1341
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Then phenomenal

1342
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And then that night happened

1343
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I did write in my notes that

1344
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Some of these people's personalities

1345
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
In real life

1346
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
This is their whole

1347
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Personalities coming to this place

1348
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm worried about where they're going to go

1349
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Now in the future

1350
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
What this means to their life

1351
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You're talking to one of them

1352
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
One of them is in a box in this window

1353
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We're doing right now

1354
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Their whole personality is Jelly Roll

1355
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I feel like you found

1356
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yourself there

1357
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
In a matter of two nights

1358
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The first one a year and a half ago

1359
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Really set it up

1360
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
By the end of those two

1361
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You know what I realized? It's your pink pony club

1362
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
This was your

1363
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Where you discovered yourself

1364
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
A place where you can be who you are

1365
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
That's true

1366
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And Mike said they played that

1367
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh

1368
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You're right

1369
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You're right about that

1370
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm gonna keep on singing

1371
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
At the dual piano club

1372
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Pointing at songs I've heard of

1373
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Down in Walt Disney World

1374
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm gonna keep

1375
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm a Jelly Rolls boy

1376
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Singing rap songs

1377
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Without the N words

1378
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Whatever

1379
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Let me ask

1380
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
A question

1381
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I think I know the answer

1382
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Did they play

1383
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Power Line when everyone went?

1384
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
No

1385
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I would have loved it

1386
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I would have been great if they did not play it

1387
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It is a frequent that they like to play

1388
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Do they do

1389
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Do they do both of the power lines

1390
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Or just eye to eye?

1391
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm trying to think if I heard both

1392
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Or if it was just

1393
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
What the hell is the other power line?

1394
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Stand out?

1395
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Stand out?

1396
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Stand out a very underrated song

1397
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It is

1398
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Power Line Deep Cut

1399
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah, there's only two

1400
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
There's the hit and then there's the deep cut

1401
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So you know what we should

1402
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
In terms of weaving this tale

1403
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I think something that we haven't officially laid out

1404
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Is that, okay, so Mike goes

1405
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
You get to go

1406
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Your plan was that there was gonna be one with Candace

1407
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But you ended up getting a bonus one the night before

1408
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Do not change your plans

1409
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'm gonna go back

1410
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm gonna keep on dancing

1411
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
At the Jelly Rolls Club

1412
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We do it the next night

1413
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And the whole day there's the discussion of am I doing it or not

1414
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Now the biggest thing

1415
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Luring me into doing it

1416
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I was very charmed and honored that

1417
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Candace was interested in getting me

1418
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
In there

1419
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I think there was even the offer of the cover being

1420
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Taken care of

1421
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I believe Mike ended up doing it

1422
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Unless I'm confused about the

1423
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Because this was admittedly I was like

1424
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I will not

1425
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That is not worth it to me

1426
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Can we all agree that is an

1427
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Awkward amount of money

1428
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That's a strange amount of money

1429
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I will say that Johnny and my last time going

1430
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Was the first discovery for me

1431
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That pass holders got a discount

1432
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So we did not pay the full $22

1433
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We did get a discount

1434
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I can't, it was like

1435
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I can't even remember

1436
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't know

1437
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Maybe

1438
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Inflation

1439
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You're definitely

1440
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You're definitely paying Disney World tax

1441
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
At Jelly Rolls

1442
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Because I don't think any other place

1443
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Like this is gonna charge that much of a

1444
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Cover

1445
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's a weird amount of money for a

1446
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Concert that does not have name performers

1447
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You know what I mean

1448
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But people pay it

1449
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
That room was packed

1450
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It was absolutely packed

1451
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Which is the thing that turned me off

1452
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But I was really

1453
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Happy that you wanted to get me in there

1454
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And I wanted to prove that I could

1455
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Do it for more than 20 minutes

1456
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
You said three songs

1457
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Oh that's right yes

1458
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And I made it past the three

1459
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And I was proud that I made it past the three

1460
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And also I want to say thank you

1461
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
For the jello shots

1462
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I think that was a spirit

1463
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Lifter across the board

1464
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Alright I'll stick around a little longer

1465
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I literally went to the bar and I was like

1466
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I didn't even know these still existed places

1467
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm gonna get this all

1468
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't think I've done it

1469
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I think over 10 years since

1470
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
My last jello shot

1471
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I feel like I'm at confession

1472
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It felt

1473
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Jello shots just that also I think maybe

1474
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Part of it and that really was the perfect

1475
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Choice because I do

1476
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
This does feel like I'm in college too

1477
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It does feel like I went to college in Norman, Illinois

1478
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And it's not that they had a dueling piano bar

1479
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But definitely we went to like

1480
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
A bunch of places where like

1481
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Jello shots were heavily advertised

1482
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's not something you're generally

1483
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Getting anymore when you're in your 30s

1484
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And 40s

1485
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So much so that we all looked

1486
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
At them and went does anybody remember how

1487
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
To take these jello shots

1488
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yes it was really awkward

1489
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Only my sister in law knew

1490
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
She's very nice I like meeting her

1491
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah I was like

1492
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Because it comes in a little like

1493
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Immediately disintegrating

1494
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Little tiny cup

1495
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And I guess I just mush it

1496
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And I didn't get it all

1497
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I did not

1498
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It kind of defeated me I definitely did not

1499
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Shoot the entire thing

1500
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You kind of just pinch the bottom

1501
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And like

1502
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Make out with it

1503
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I got very lippy

1504
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
For sure

1505
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The dogs eat like a frosty paw

1506
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Which is like a little ice cream cup for dogs

1507
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Where they have to like their tongue goes around

1508
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And they're really trying to get all the pieces

1509
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That's what it feels like trying to get all the jello

1510
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Out of that thing

1511
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Like a

1512
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Like a pup cup or a

1513
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Kong with peanut butter in it

1514
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yes it definitely felt like we were

1515
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Having a kong with peanut butter in it

1516
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A big

1517
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Rubber kong and trying to get all the last

1518
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's so weird

1519
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes

1520
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So it was definitely like I was honestly

1521
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The whole day I was like

1522
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It was a process getting you to

1523
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Go even like Scott I was like

1524
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It was really

1525
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm like every

1526
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I didn't do this like it wasn't so well

1527
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Timed but I was like every 45 minutes

1528
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Or every hour and 45 minutes I'll bring up you know

1529
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
We should probably go

1530
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I think like casually

1531
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Is this a good time should I bring it up now

1532
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
We went on a garage

1533
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
He's happy

1534
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Hungry

1535
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I could really go for

1536
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Some popcorn right now

1537
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh you know

1538
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Oh Jelly Rolls has good popcorn

1539
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Actually if you're feeling hungry

1540
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm like really

1541
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
In the mood for free popcorn

1542
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And like some shoe leather reporting

1543
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Like

1544
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Really getting on the ground

1545
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Like Christian I'm a poor

1546
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Kind of reporting you know

1547
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And I would yeah I was trying

1548
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I was hitting from all the different angles I was trying to make sure

1549
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And then you did get to Scott

1550
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Scott was he got a musical

1551
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
High that day because he saw

1552
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
One of his guys at Epcot

1553
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh yes

1554
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The second singer of Chicago

1555
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Jason Schiff

1556
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Who replaced Peter Cetera in the band

1557
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So yeah I got enough I got a bunch of songs

1558
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That I'm very fond of which kind of

1559
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Cushion the blow of Jelly Rolls

1560
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I would say I mean by the time

1561
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Once Jelly Shots

1562
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Enter the picture

1563
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And then it's just like okay well now it's like

1564
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Now it's a bar and we're hanging and we're talking

1565
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And we can sort of ignore

1566
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The show we didn't get seats

1567
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Which was actually good for me because

1568
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm like I'd rather mill around the corner

1569
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
If you get a table now you're stuck in there

1570
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Now you're committed to it's like literally hard to leave

1571
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It definitely happened to us right after you left

1572
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah we sat at a table

1573
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah

1574
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay

1575
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So you got out of there while

1576
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You were safe

1577
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
While I could roam free

1578
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah absolutely

1579
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
The crowdedness does that is definitely

1580
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
A turn off

1581
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Doesn't it seem insane like that

1582
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Is too many people I can't believe

1583
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The demand for this play and if

1584
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That's what they were doing for 30 years

1585
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I don't really understand why

1586
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
It's going away

1587
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It was so hot in there

1588
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And I like didn't sweat

1589
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I wasn't sweating at all the whole weekend

1590
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And I felt like I was in a zone

1591
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
That was 105 degrees

1592
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
While we were by the

1593
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Once we sat at the table it was better

1594
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But I was like oh my god I'm not

1595
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Really a big sweater in general but I was like

1596
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Whatever is going on I guess

1597
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's just the human bodies in there

1598
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And they were not like the air

1599
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Was not working or it was not blasting

1600
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Anywhere near cold enough

1601
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
The night before it was not

1602
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
As crowded so it was not as bad

1603
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And we were standing over in the same exact

1604
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Area which is like to the left

1605
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
But yeah

1606
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It was it was crazy

1607
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Hot and it's not

1608
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Not my ideal way to experience

1609
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Jelly rolls

1610
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You also can tell me cause we went right

1611
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
When it opened ish

1612
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So that was the thing that also didn't help us

1613
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
We went very like it was what

1614
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
The last week of operation

1615
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We had to go

1616
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Early because we told our son

1617
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That we would make it in time for

1618
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Fantasmic 2 cause he went to see Fantasmic

1619
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
One without us so we said we'd be back for Fantasmic

1620
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
2

1621
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Cause I was convinced

1622
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Once that like timer went off

1623
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
He was gonna be like alright let's go

1624
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I let it ride out I let it ride out

1625
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But because we got there so early

1626
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It was like I think the

1627
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Doors open at like 7 and then they don't even

1628
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Start performing till 8

1629
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So when we got there

1630
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It was still like maybe a half hour into them

1631
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Even playing anything

1632
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And there were a lot like the crowd

1633
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Was a lot

1634
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Like I don't even know how to put like they were

1635
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Like usually

1636
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
When you're in there the age

1637
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Ranges all over the place

1638
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
The average age was about 65

1639
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
About 65

1640
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Was the average age

1641
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
For people in there

1642
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I think what kind of did us in with some of the

1643
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Musical choices

1644
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Was that they were

1645
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Appeasing like the

1646
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Sure. Yeah. So like

1647
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
What did it? What pushed

1648
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Johnny's buttons? That's what I'm curious of

1649
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I wanna know what songs were

1650
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Propelled. I can't

1651
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I didn't even know what songs they were

1652
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Like they were playing songs I've never heard before

1653
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
In my entire life. They were making up music

1654
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
While I was singing

1655
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
They did play

1656
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So they played

1657
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
The feeling 22

1658
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
The feeling 22 song

1659
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That was our first song

1660
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Because it was someone's

1661
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Lady's birthday. She was turning 20 something

1662
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So they played the Taylor Swift song

1663
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Again I just wanna say for the record

1664
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
If you're 20 something and you're spending your birthday

1665
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
At Jelly Rolls then you gotta

1666
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Reassess what you're doing with your life

1667
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's still early enough

1668
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You can change

1669
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
They have jello shots

1670
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
That feels very 22

1671
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Sure, sure

1672
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Other than that I don't

1673
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I can't name another song they play

1674
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
They play the usual

1675
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Brown Eyed Girl

1676
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Did they play that one? Yeah they did

1677
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
They played Brown Eyed Girl

1678
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Sweet Caroline

1679
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
They didn't give us Sweet Caroline

1680
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That's never gonna help me

1681
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Can I say something that maybe illustrates where I'm at

1682
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
In terms of like

1683
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Some listeners will hear this and go

1684
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
They did play Brown Eyed Girl

1685
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Because I have it in my notes

1686
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Brown Eyed Girl got people excited for 7 seconds

1687
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Okay

1688
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And then it settled

1689
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And then we don't actually want to hear the verses

1690
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's what you interrupted and told us

1691
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Make sure everyone knows that

1692
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
This might illustrate

1693
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What I'm about to say

1694
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
This might not be a good thing

1695
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Maybe I would have more joy in my life

1696
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
If I was the kind of person who liked

1697
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
What I'm about to describe

1698
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But I have to admit that in something like this

1699
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
In an arena

1700
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
At a karaoke bar

1701
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Wherever it is

1702
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
When I am somewhere and Sweet Caroline plays

1703
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
And everybody does the thing

1704
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So good, so good

1705
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I feel so bad, so bad

1706
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So annoyed

1707
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It's one of those

1708
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm like on the outside of humanity

1709
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'm looking at people and I'm like

1710
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I don't know why everyone likes yelling so good

1711
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
In that part of the song

1712
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Mike can you explain what's good about that

1713
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Or why it's fun

1714
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So good, so good

1715
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I will admit to you

1716
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It's not that I'm

1717
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Here's the situation

1718
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It's not that I totally disagree

1719
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
With the take that I've heard all these songs

1720
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
A thousand times

1721
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And then the Sweet Caroline, So Good

1722
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Which I don't even know where it came from

1723
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I don't love that

1724
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I don't

1725
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't love saying so good

1726
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
There's other songs where

1727
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I'm much more on board with it

1728
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Even though I've heard a million times

1729
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And I am with So Good, So Good

1730
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But are people, if you like yelling

1731
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So good, so good, is that one of life's great joys

1732
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Is it like orgasming

1733
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Am I missing out on one of the finest

1734
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Maybe you should try it sometime

1735
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Next time you're somewhere

1736
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
You should just try it

1737
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So I know from experience

1738
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I performed it

1739
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Sweet Caroline is like a famous

1740
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Boston Red Sox sort of thing

1741
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So they do that at the Boston Red Sox team

1742
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We had an NXT live event, you weren't on this one

1743
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
We had an NXT live event in Boston

1744
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And one of the performers

1745
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He's from Boston, his name was Oney Lorcan

1746
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And

1747
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
We were like, we need to send the people home happy tonight

1748
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We need to end the show on a great note

1749
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Like all the good guys were going to do something at the end

1750
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Like vanquish the bad guys

1751
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And we're all going to send the people home happy

1752
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
What can we do? They're like, oh you want to

1753
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Perform Sweet Caroline?

1754
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And I was like, sure, we can try it

1755
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So the whole show

1756
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
We had a guy in the face who's from

1757
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Boston, Oney Lorcan

1758
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Was on his phone, learning the lyrics

1759
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
To Sweet Caroline

1760
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So we're like, oh it's a big Boston thing

1761
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
They're going to love it

1762
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We vanquish the bad guys

1763
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Oney Lorcan grabs the microphone

1764
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
He's like, there's only one way to end this show

1765
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
The song starts playing

1766
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
He immediately forgets the lyrics

1767
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
People start booing

1768
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You're immediately

1769
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Very upset

1770
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
He's standing there like, forgot the lyrics, he was practicing all night

1771
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And yeah, so

1772
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Having been on the end of

1773
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Kind of performing in the ring

1774
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Sweet Caroline

1775
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
What did you do while this was happening?

1776
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I just laughed at him

1777
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You're bad, wow

1778
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Why didn't you just tell somebody that you didn't know?

1779
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
He blew it

1780
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
He blew it

1781
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I'd love to see

1782
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
A giant fumbled, Sweet Caroline

1783
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Sweet Caroline, So Good, So Good

1784
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Is similar to the salt part of

1785
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Margaritaville

1786
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I love the song

1787
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Margaritaville

1788
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But I don't get so excited to yell

1789
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Salt, salt, salt

1790
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But in the right context

1791
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
With a bunch of people who are excited

1792
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I think this is maybe the difference

1793
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I like being in a crowd of excited people

1794
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And sometimes it doesn't necessarily

1795
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Matter what it is

1796
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I can chuckle to myself that they're very

1797
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Excited

1798
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Like that, oh that's funny that they

1799
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Like want to

1800
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Live on a prayer, like they've never heard this before

1801
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This is so exciting

1802
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But once that goes away, I go, well

1803
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Now we're all part of this, now I'm living on a prayer

1804
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
As well, I'm with them, we're all one

1805
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We're a team

1806
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
It's a communal experience

1807
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It's a communal experience

1808
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
This is what I would say, so yes

1809
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
When I hear Bad Bad Leroy Brown

1810
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Which is not, I mean I guess at this point

1811
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I feel like I heard it a million times growing up on the Oldies

1812
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Station, I don't hear it quite as much anymore

1813
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's not my favorite song in the world

1814
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But I do, like it does, I kind of chuckle at it

1815
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
A little bit, because it's like

1816
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
One of the 20 songs you would hear on Oldies 104.3

1817
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Growing up in the

1818
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Chicago area

1819
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But

1820
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's maybe the difference

1821
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So I agree with you that I don't like

1822
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
To necessarily sing the

1823
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Sweet Caroline part

1824
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But then I can get on board

1825
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I can get on board after a few seconds

1826
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
The group that the magic of a crowd

1827
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Just can sweep you up and pull you in

1828
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
You just want to be part of a happening

1829
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I want to be part of the crowd

1830
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Whether it's at Jelly Rolls

1831
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You don't want to stand out

1832
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You want to be a part of the crowd

1833
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You don't want to stand out

1834
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I don't want to stand out

1835
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm trying

1836
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
If they announce

1837
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Whether it's the song

1838
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Or whether it's them announcing

1839
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
The new Blade at Hall H

1840
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I want to be excited

1841
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
With everybody

1842
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
That's a good way to put it

1843
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I get it

1844
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Even though intellectually I'm like

1845
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Some of these Marvel movies aren't going to come out

1846
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Most of them will be

1847
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
B minuses

1848
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But like, hey

1849
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Somebody came out and put a hat on

1850
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
A Black Widow hat

1851
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I got so excited in 2019

1852
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And here's what

1853
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I will say this

1854
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I was kind of shocked

1855
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
That once we went to Jelly Rolls

1856
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And I started mentioning Jelly Rolls to people

1857
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The love for Jelly Rolls

1858
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Is so common

1859
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I was not aware

1860
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That it was such a thing

1861
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
There are so many people I've texted

1862
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And when I say so many people I just mean

1863
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Of people I text with

1864
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Memories of Jelly Rolls

1865
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Somebody I know

1866
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Went to a wedding at Jelly Rolls

1867
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Whoa!

1868
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
How does that happen?

1869
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I think maybe the ceremony itself

1870
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Was at the dance hall

1871
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
But then the reception was at Jelly Rolls

1872
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Did they like rank it out?

1873
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Or did they all just go there and get it?

1874
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I believe so

1875
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I had an idea yesterday

1876
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And there wasn't enough time

1877
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
To put this together

1878
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'll just stick this at the end of this episode

1879
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Is that I'm gathering

1880
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
People's memories

1881
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Of Jelly Rolls

1882
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And I will collect them

1883
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And place them under a bed of music

1884
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I was shocked to learn

1885
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That my friend Noel

1886
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
From high school and junior high

1887
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Was like oh yeah we went there

1888
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And then she was like my mom loves Jelly Rolls

1889
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
She's usually the one that tries to get us to go there

1890
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
When we're on vacation

1891
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And there's new Jelly Rolls fans we've talked about

1892
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And then Mike Mitchell

1893
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
A friend of the show, Mike Mitchell

1894
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Loves Jelly Rolls and he goes

1895
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
They played Lionel Richie's All Night Long

1896
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And it was awesome

1897
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Mitch has done Jelly Rolls

1898
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm kind of shocked by that one

1899
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
He said he just really liked Jelly Rolls

1900
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And that was his one memory

1901
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Is that they played that song specifically

1902
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm texting like

1903
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Seven different people

1904
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Who all have Jelly Rolls

1905
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Memories

1906
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So I was like shocked

1907
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That this was even such a thing

1908
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Like I really was surprised

1909
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Because even going once I wasn't expecting

1910
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I was expecting most people not to even know this was here

1911
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But apparently everyone knew it was here

1912
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And they were having a ball

1913
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
In 2023

1914
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Esquire Magazine named Jelly Rolls

1915
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
One of the best bars in America

1916
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
No

1917
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
That did not happen

1918
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There's no way that's real

1919
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I got the link right here

1920
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
What else is on the list?

1921
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I was skeptical

1922
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But I went on the Jelly Rolls website

1923
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And they were touting it and I went

1924
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Is that true?

1925
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And I found the Esquire article

1926
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And they have different bars in different towns

1927
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That they really liked

1928
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And there's a paragraph here

1929
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
The single best night I've spent in a bar

1930
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Since the start of the pandemic

1931
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Was at a spot called Jelly Rolls

1932
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Located squarely inside Disney World

1933
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's a proper real boy

1934
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Joint to get a drink in after

1935
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I don't know, it's Michael Theodore Mouse Week

1936
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
There's some flourishes

1937
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
There's some flourishes

1938
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
There's some flourishes in here

1939
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That sounds like a British affectation

1940
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It's a Pinocchio

1941
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's a Pinocchio reference

1942
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
No wonder I don't like this

1943
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's a place for real boys

1944
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's a great real boy bar

1945
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's a bar for boys

1946
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I've peppered with Disney references this paragraph

1947
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
But it says

1948
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You can hear a man who could be Billy Joel's doppelganger

1949
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Sing The Bare Necessities

1950
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And you hear that man just go ahead and sing Piano Man

1951
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
As if he wrote it

1952
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So this person had a fantastic time

1953
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And you really

1954
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Right

1955
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And this is the best night in a bar

1956
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Since the start of the pandemic

1957
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
2023, so that's a couple years

1958
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So I was blown away

1959
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
By how much love

1960
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Jelly Rolls has accumulated over its 30 years

1961
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And there's more

1962
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But yes, I was just

1963
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So hopefully unless this is all cut out

1964
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And you won't hear this listener

1965
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
There will be a fond

1966
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Maybe 10 minutes plus

1967
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Long

1968
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Jelly Rolls memory segment

1969
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
To hear just

1970
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Send this place off in style

1971
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That's remarkable

1972
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I discovered this was happening

1973
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because I texted Kevin Tully

1974
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And he said

1975
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Well, I'm preparing a voice memo

1976
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
For a collage that Mike is doing

1977
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, really?

1978
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So I don't want to step on anything he's going to say

1979
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
If we hear him later

1980
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But he did text this while we were recording

1981
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And I feel like I have to say it

1982
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I will say, I have only known Mike for a couple years

1983
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But I've never seen him more emotive

1984
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And happy than in Jelly Rolls

1985
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You are like another

1986
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Person in there

1987
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Just wait for the Mad Tea Party episode

1988
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
We did a Mad Tea Party

1989
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's another thing

1990
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
We've been debating about that

1991
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
For years

1992
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
We haven't done Electronica

1993
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Because I feel like they're the same

1994
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But also not the same

1995
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Very different vibes

1996
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Maybe Jason

1997
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Jason brought the idea up of bringing

1998
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Electronica back when the Leto

1999
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Tron comes out, which I think is a great idea

2000
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
They could do it

2001
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
There is that stage

2002
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Well, I guess they won't have the bar

2003
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But there is a stage here

2004
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
In Orlando, in Tomorrowland

2005
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Where they just pop the band over there

2006
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Our dog is trying to break into this room

2007
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That's okay

2008
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
He wants to do the

2009
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Bop bop bop part of

2010
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Sweet Caroline

2011
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Rough rough rough

2012
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Bark bark bark

2013
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
This is another thing

2014
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I wonder if like

2015
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Is a big barrier to me

2016
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Connecting with more people on the planet Earth

2017
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That I don't have strong feelings about

2018
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Billy Joel

2019
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Would everything change for me

2020
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
If one day I wake up and Piano Man

2021
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Hits me

2022
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Am I a different man

2023
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Do I suddenly

2024
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm one with all of humanity

2025
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And every person I see

2026
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
The room smiles

2027
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think it's a thing that's holding me back

2028
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And has for nearly 40 years

2029
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There is

2030
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
No place I

2031
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
More enjoy Billy Joel than

2032
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Jelly Rolls

2033
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'm not listening to a lot of

2034
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Billy Joel during the day

2035
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
During my life

2036
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But at Jelly Rolls

2037
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I enjoy hearing it

2038
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Now did anyone look up what the first and last

2039
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Song they ever played at Jelly Rolls was

2040
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
No did someone

2041
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Did someone keep a note of it

2042
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
They sure did

2043
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Did they come full circle and play the same

2044
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
First and the same last

2045
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
They sure did

2046
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
My life by Billy Joel

2047
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So

2048
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah

2049
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So that

2050
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So the place closed but I didn't see

2051
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I saw no

2052
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Footprint online

2053
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Again you were talking about all these people

2054
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Who loved Jelly Rolls

2055
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
There was nothing

2056
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
But would you say it was harder to find

2057
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
People who loved Jelly Rolls

2058
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Or was it harder to find people who hate Jelly Rolls

2059
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Like when Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy closed

2060
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
There was like a big hoopla

2061
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
That's because you were looking at

2062
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That was all because

2063
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The internet was just showing you

2064
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
What you wanted to see

2065
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You don't go to Jelly Rolls

2066
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
The algorithm was not

2067
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Your algorithm was full of Jelly Rolls

2068
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
My algorithm and my inbox

2069
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
With Mike over here we were

2070
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
In an uproar

2071
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Johnny maybe you're not on DisneyDining.com

2072
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Because they had a nice

2073
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Well then you must not be

2074
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
You didn't see it

2075
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I think your algorithm

2076
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Disney Dining

2077
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Covered this

2078
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
DisneyDining.com

2079
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
They have to as journalists

2080
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
They have popcorn

2081
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Popcorn

2082
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Popcorn

2083
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Jello shot kind of a food

2084
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Maraschino cherries

2085
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
They cover the general beat as well of Orlando

2086
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I will say that like food and drink

2087
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Or at least

2088
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Drinks in this place

2089
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Not the best

2090
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I think they could have done better

2091
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So it's one of the best bars in America

2092
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But the drinks aren't so good

2093
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Listen

2094
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Here's the thing

2095
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's great for the college age girls

2096
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Who are like give me all the sugar in the world

2097
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But some of us don't want all the sugar

2098
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Or for the north of 40 year old men

2099
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Who are like give me all the sugar in the world

2100
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Give me all the sugar

2101
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Beer and all the sugar

2102
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
So for those of us

2103
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Would prefer just like straight whiskey

2104
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
This was not the place for us

2105
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah

2106
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I mean they had like a well

2107
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Whiskey or something there

2108
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I would argue if I was making a decision

2109
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I would say like if they said Mike

2110
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Should we make the drinks better at Jelly Rolls

2111
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
They would have said no that would ruin the vibe

2112
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh okay

2113
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Okay that's fair

2114
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's shitty college town

2115
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Vibes in there

2116
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I think that's just an excuse

2117
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You're making

2118
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
No

2119
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Come back every episode

2120
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
There's a lot of episodes that we could do

2121
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Where we would be very combative

2122
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Mike and Kayden are both just making excuses

2123
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
After excuses for Jelly Rolls

2124
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
We're making valid points

2125
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Look the music's supposed to be bad

2126
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
The drinks are supposed to be bad

2127
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Wait till

2128
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Neither one of us ever said the music was bad

2129
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
When you went

2130
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Neither one of us said the music was bad

2131
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You said the music was bad

2132
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
It's better later at night

2133
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You were at the wrong time

2134
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
There was no switch

2135
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
We didn't get a switch

2136
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Wait for the switch

2137
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Oh that wasn't the right switch

2138
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm just saying

2139
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You can get a good night

2140
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Where they do hit like six songs in a row

2141
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Or something that you like

2142
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It will take you

2143
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It will take you from an A- experience

2144
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
To an A-

2145
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So it can change

2146
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So A- is the floor

2147
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
A- is the floor

2148
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's as low as it's ever gone

2149
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Jelly Rolls never went below A-

2150
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And I think like Scott when you left

2151
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It was not the greatest stretch

2152
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
When we were sitting Candace

2153
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
You see this Johnny just randomly

2154
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
When you were there it wasn't the best

2155
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Randomly when I was there it wasn't the best

2156
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It was pretty good when you were there

2157
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It was better when you were there

2158
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Because I wrote down some of the

2159
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Set that I got to experience

2160
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And just like

2161
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Can you maybe understand

2162
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Why I was not particularly drawn in

2163
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
We got

2164
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Four Seasons Oh What A Night

2165
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We got

2166
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Lose Yourself

2167
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
We got

2168
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Gold Digger

2169
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
With a certain word not used

2170
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
By the white male

2171
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Piano performers

2172
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And the entire audience

2173
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
All like consciously singing along

2174
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But making sure to say broke

2175
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Twice instead of saying

2176
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Another thing

2177
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And then you got

2178
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
A tradition for them because there was like a

2179
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
There were props involved there was a

2180
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Puppet involved because it was man

2181
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I didn't get no puppet so

2182
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Okay I mean I respect I guess the production value

2183
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Of that a puppet came in but yeah Man or Muppet from

2184
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
From the Jason Stigl Muppet movie

2185
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
We got a Muppet song

2186
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
He didn't even bring a Muppet for me

2187
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You really got the shit out of the deal Johnny

2188
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
They phoned it in

2189
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Maybe the right musician wasn't there

2190
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You needed to be there for at least three hours

2191
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah

2192
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I just honestly think

2193
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
We were there too soon after it opened

2194
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
That's what it was

2195
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
They were too fresh

2196
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
But you can't stay 20 minutes

2197
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
When you get there like they just started

2198
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Playing and people are barely coming

2199
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
In it's all your

2200
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Whatever you said the age range

2201
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
65

2202
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
65 and 122 year old

2203
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Let them cook

2204
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Let the piano people cook and

2205
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
At that heat level the 65 year olds

2206
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Are definitely cooking

2207
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
But Mike how do you fit that set list

2208
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Can you understand why that

2209
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Group of songs and how do you

2210
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Put that or would you

2211
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Are you not going to tell me well no that wasn't the best

2212
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And as soon as you left it became very good

2213
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
With Bad Badly Roy Brown

2214
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Well Bad Badly Roy Brown is better

2215
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Than Lose Yourself Now Lose Yourself was going

2216
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Around especially those

2217
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Weeks I don't know why there was somebody performing Lose

2218
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yourself at Disney Springs I feel like

2219
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Somebody posted a video of a different

2220
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Performer doing Lose Yourself I don't know why

2221
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Lose Yourself was

2222
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So big maybe that's just been a big song for

2223
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Decades

2224
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I

2225
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I feel like Lose Yourself just doesn't get

2226
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Me in like a groove I mean

2227
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Oh What A Night is like I can enjoy

2228
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It Oh What A Night is like fun

2229
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And upbeat Lose Yourself is a little

2230
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Too I don't know intense for the

2231
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
For the

2232
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah

2233
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Yeah it's just too edgy

2234
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I was scared of it honestly

2235
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like I gotta get out of here this is an

2236
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Uncomfortable place now yeah

2237
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So it's not my it was not my

2238
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Favorite I do think that Set List

2239
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
The night before was better

2240
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Now what

2241
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Would they play the night before Michael

2242
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Well that was the Chapel Roan that was

2243
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
The Mulan song and then

2244
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I did get their like greatest

2245
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Hits stretch I think I was there

2246
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
A little later because we were doing

2247
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Epic she said like I would have stayed

2248
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Later that Saturday night when we were there

2249
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
But we were doing epic that Sunday morning I was trying to be

2250
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Responsible so I think I kept

2251
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Saying to Candice I think I kept saying

2252
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
All right I gotta go out on a big song

2253
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
One more song and I think it happened four

2254
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Times and I

2255
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
They kept playing a

2256
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Better song a cooler song after the good song

2257
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And then you're like you gotta go out on like a good

2258
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Song yeah

2259
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
You remember what your last song was there well I had a really

2260
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Good last song but then I went back with you and then I was

2261
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Like oh no because

2262
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
We hit the time and I didn't get to choose

2263
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
What was the last song

2264
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
What was your last song

2265
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So my good last song was hooked on

2266
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
A feeling and I was like this is the universe

2267
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Telling me because it's

2268
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Guardians of the galaxy vibes

2269
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Our son's name is Quill I was like

2270
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
This is what I have to leave on I have to

2271
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Leave on this song and then

2272
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We went back and I don't I have no idea what the last

2273
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Song was

2274
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
He looked at me and he was like because I was like we just got

2275
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
We have to leave on a good song and then it was like

2276
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
A few not so great songs

2277
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
In a row or just songs that we don't really know

2278
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And then he looked at me

2279
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And he was like we gotta go and it was good we

2280
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Left when we did because we had to make it for

2281
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Fantasmic number two

2282
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You guys are both for you guys the

2283
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Converted for Mike and

2284
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Candice that you're both like

2285
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
God I would stay at Jelly Rolls forever if

2286
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I didn't have a preview

2287
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Of the amazing new theme park

2288
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
The first thing in the morning I could stay forever

2289
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
If I didn't have to go get my son

2290
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Like without these killers

2291
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You would just be in

2292
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Jelly Rolls for seemingly

2293
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Seven hours in a row

2294
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
There is something

2295
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah we would be there

2296
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We would just live if I could live

2297
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Multiple lives at once one of the

2298
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Multiple lives would be just a guy

2299
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Who like

2300
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Stays in Orlando I mean it is

2301
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Orlando we talked about him on the Patreon

2302
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So it's Orlando Mike

2303
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
You know he's just a guy who like sort of

2304
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Lives his name is Outlaw he works at

2305
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The American Gladiators Theater

2306
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And he just goes to Jelly Rolls

2307
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah we believe that if there's ever

2308
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
A world where Mike ends up moving

2309
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
To Orlando we think very quickly not only

2310
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Will his lifestyle change in little ways just

2311
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
By going to parks all the time we also think

2312
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
He's gonna start like juicing

2313
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Taking every bit of like de-aging

2314
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Drug or

2315
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Weird process that he's ever

2316
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Wanted to try he'll be bathing in red light

2317
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Every night and it's gonna slowly turn him into

2318
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
A guy named Outlaw what's going on brother

2319
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Yeah it's really like if I

2320
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
If I abandon my family

2321
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Completely

2322
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And I just sort of on my own I'm going to

2323
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Just try a completely different lifestyle

2324
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And that would be a guy I think

2325
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Who would be at Jelly Rolls every night

2326
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And I was about to say too that

2327
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I do think part of the

2328
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Jelly Rolls experience is being there

2329
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
For a long time

2330
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Like you want that like you've been there

2331
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
For two and a two hours two and a half hours

2332
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
You're a little tired you're probably

2333
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
More dehydrated than drunk

2334
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
At that point

2335
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
You get it you gotta be tired

2336
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's kind of weird

2337
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
There's this kind of thing

2338
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
You wanna be a bar fly

2339
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
You wanna be like nursing

2340
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Your tonic and gin like

2341
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
In piano

2342
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Like the man in piano man

2343
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Maybe we just are fans of that like

2344
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
That vibe

2345
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
The kind of cover music

2346
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Cause they're kind of pulling from everything

2347
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Like you get a little bit little mix of

2348
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
All different kinds of music and you don't know what's coming

2349
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Next and like everybody's there

2350
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
They're happy they're having fun they're singing

2351
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
They're dancing like it's like

2352
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Being at a party but I don't have to go talk to anybody

2353
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Else like I could just enjoy myself

2354
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
In a corner in my little

2355
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Corner with my little group and

2356
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I'm happy

2357
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yes and I think that like

2358
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
John I'm making baffled faces

2359
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Everything that's being said by the way

2360
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You just like you find a new type of baffled face

2361
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
He doesn't like live music hates live music

2362
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Doesn't want to be at the party

2363
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I just said so many things that are happening

2364
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Again I was there for like 45 minutes

2365
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think I think 45 minutes

2366
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I thought you took a stopwatch

2367
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yeah but then I just I just stopped

2368
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I gave up on it

2369
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That's what I made it to as well I was right around 45

2370
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Aren't you proud of both of us Candice

2371
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Both of the people you've tried to coax

2372
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
In this place

2373
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
An adequate amount of time

2374
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Over an adequate amount of time of being there

2375
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You hate live music so

2376
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
But I can't imagine like oh once you're there

2377
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Once you hit that three hour mark that's when the sweet spot

2378
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Really is like I can't imagine that

2379
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
If you are

2380
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There long enough they will eventually

2381
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Play pony by genuine

2382
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Oh

2383
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I bet they do do that

2384
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Right they have to do that

2385
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Maybe I've heard them do that I'm trying to remember

2386
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I don't want these dorks up there playing

2387
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Pony that's not going to be a good pony

2388
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That's not going to be a sexy pony

2389
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Scott did you ever have

2390
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Like a Richard Cheese phase

2391
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
In college or me first in

2392
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The gimme gimme's

2393
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I downloaded some Richard Cheese you're talking about the guy who

2394
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
He did lounge covers of kind of

2395
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Madden Dunn bodies at the floor

2396
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah he did yeah he did

2397
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
That's in the genre

2398
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Do you guys

2399
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Like Scott and Johnny do you guys

2400
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Feel like

2401
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You would prefer

2402
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
And you have to pick one you prefer a

2403
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Karaoke bar over jelly rolls

2404
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yes yes

2405
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
We have a no and a yes

2406
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Because you maybe get

2407
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Like you get all the different like personalities

2408
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Coming through and what I really like

2409
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Is a private karaoke room with

2410
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
A group and we're like

2411
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Where you're getting up there

2412
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
A lot and kind of like group mania

2413
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Of the small room is fun

2414
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Yeah I'll definitely do you know

2415
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
A karaoke bar

2416
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah yeah you know cause like

2417
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah first of all then I'm

2418
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Part of the show and I can pick a song

2419
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That I enjoy and maybe my friends

2420
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Wait so you'd prefer yourself be

2421
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
The musician and

2422
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That helps and that there's like

2423
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
The building up of the nerves

2424
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And like okay I gotta stay in it I can't get like

2425
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I can't get too sloppy here

2426
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Or maybe do get a little sloppy and then it's a

2427
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Funny sloppy but I wanna like

2428
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
No some of the greatest moments of my life

2429
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Literally have been singing

2430
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Debarge's rhythm of the night in front of

2431
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
A group of people a transcendent

2432
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Moments that's my

2433
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Jelly rolls were actually a karaoke bar

2434
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You would prefer jelly rolls

2435
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And that like everything else

2436
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Everything else is the same

2437
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But now it's a karaoke bar

2438
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But that also transitioned to my idea as well

2439
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So I mean I'm with him here

2440
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I think that the infusion of different personalities

2441
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And that like possibly I might go up

2442
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And possibly my friends might go up

2443
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And then there might just be some weird funny characters

2444
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Who you get to enjoy and then somebody

2445
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Who's like wow that person's really good and this person thinks

2446
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
They're really good but they're terrible

2447
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I think that like you know it feels more like

2448
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Like a sketch show or something where there's

2449
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Like a there's a variety and you don't know what's

2450
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
What's coming around the bend whereas

2451
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I think I get tired of the

2452
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No matter how good the piano players

2453
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Are I get tired

2454
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Of kind of the

2455
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Same deal over and over

2456
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Again again I said

2457
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Let civilians go up there

2458
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Just let civilians go up there and duel it out

2459
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm all about it

2460
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Let them try

2461
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Isn't like children going on stage

2462
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Now I will say now we covered this during

2463
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Our City Walk Orlando Saga that Mike

2464
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And I ended up being among the only people

2465
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
By the end the only people at Pat O'Brien's

2466
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
At City Walk Orlando

2467
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And that too I guess I

2468
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Look I just like what I like I don't

2469
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Respond to Sweet Caroline or Piano Man

2470
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
For whatever reason but if I can throw out

2471
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The shit I like which that was

2472
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Wonderful for both Mike and I we were both just like

2473
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Let's let's just we have we

2474
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
We these guys have to play what we

2475
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Want to hear because we're the only people in there

2476
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And that was Peridot getting to like

2477
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
All right yeah let's say let's see if these

2478
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Guys can knock out Steely Dan

2479
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Deacon Blues let's uh

2480
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You know like you got a ton of Springsteen

2481
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You were very happy Mike you know you're

2482
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Very naked ladies and we all got

2483
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
To explore our little things you know I made the guy

2484
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
There play an eight minute Springsteen

2485
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Song a jungle land I was like

2486
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Let's see if he can do jungle and he

2487
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Goes yeah I think I know it and he did a really good

2488
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Job of it you know so

2489
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I think also I think

2490
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
At my core also and I've said

2491
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
This before probably on the show

2492
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I think like you know

2493
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I'm a normie guy at my core

2494
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Whether I want to be that or not

2495
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I feel like I grew up

2496
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
In a very normie place I went

2497
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
To college in a very normie place

2498
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So I maybe going to jellyrolls

2499
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I feel like I'm back

2500
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Among the normies

2501
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And I mean that in a good way I don't mean that in a

2502
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Derogatory way I think there is something

2503
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
To that that I feel like

2504
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Oh yeah okay this is where

2505
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I live this is where

2506
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
This is where I actually belong I don't belong in Hollywood

2507
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I don't belong at

2508
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
The Largo in Hollywood with its

2509
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Snooty music and

2510
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Comedy I belong to

2511
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Jellyrolls performances and incredible

2512
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Talents and well curated

2513
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
No thanks

2514
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
No I've had good times at Largo but I

2515
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Jellyrolls is maybe where I was born

2516
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And where I should have always been

2517
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
That's maybe at the heart maybe that's

2518
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
That's tapping into something

2519
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
In me when I go there

2520
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
As much as I don't get at uncertain

2521
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Level it's you know you're my friend

2522
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I want to see you in your element

2523
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And isn't it crazy to that we're like

2524
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's what I'm saying I'm saying it's your

2525
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Pony Club Kevin separately just

2526
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Texted I've never seen Mike happier

2527
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Than in this play like there really is

2528
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Something I you know it's

2529
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Like I guess it's like

2530
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
How I'd have to be happy for somebody

2531
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Who you know like converted

2532
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
To some deep Baptist kind of

2533
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Religion and I'm like it's not for me

2534
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And I'll never convert but they seem

2535
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
At peace and I so I have to

2536
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I gotta support you know

2537
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Yeah and multiple people that I'm texting

2538
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
With are from Schomburg Illinois as well that

2539
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Like Jelly Rolls too so maybe there is

2540
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Something there is something and not that we had a Jelly Rolls

2541
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
In town but maybe there's

2542
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Something there was something in the water of Schomburg Illinois

2543
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Yeah I mean I'm from

2544
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Cleveland Ohio and I don't

2545
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Maybe it wasn't in Cleveland

2546
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I'm from Riverside California

2547
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And I too

2548
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I loved it

2549
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I loved it

2550
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Well I guess there's no common

2551
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Element it's just either it

2552
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Hits you or it doesn't hit you I don't know it's

2553
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Strange I also think there is something

2554
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
There's some I feel like some people were posting an article

2555
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And I forget the name of this there was a term of

2556
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Like when music itself

2557
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Like gives you like goosebumps

2558
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Maybe there is a biological thing

2559
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I have that just hearing

2560
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Live music like stimulates

2561
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Parts of my brain cause

2562
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Like my wife cause Lindsay will say like

2563
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I think she likes music a lot but she

2564
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Generally listens to stuff that she liked

2565
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
When she was younger and doesn't listen

2566
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
To newer stuff as much she's like I wonder if

2567
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You're just like it's doing something in your

2568
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Brain that's different and I do think

2569
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Maybe there's something to that

2570
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Because I do have my cover band great

2571
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
A real cool band that's

2572
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Like cool and then I appreciate the production

2573
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
On the album and I'm like oh

2574
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Shit this is like such a subtle way to

2575
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Produce like I like all that stuff

2576
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But you can just throw me anywhere

2577
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
At a state fair or some like

2578
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Band in the park playing covers of

2579
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Beatles songs and I'm like pretty good

2580
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Like it's any version of it

2581
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I don't understand this thing to me I'm like

2582
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
The more music you like wouldn't you end up more like

2583
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Discerning and pickier and you have just become

2584
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Like if music is being played

2585
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
If a drum is being hit I'm happy

2586
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And it doesn't matter by you

2587
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Or for what

2588
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
You're just you love any music

2589
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's interesting it's probably better

2590
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I kind of

2591
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Understand that cause I have that for

2592
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Movies like even like

2593
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
A movie that was just like oh it was

2594
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Okay it's like well I think I just like

2595
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Going to the movies

2596
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Like sitting down with a movie

2597
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Except for country bears

2598
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yes counterpoint country bears

2599
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I didn't love country bears

2600
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
But

2601
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
For the most part

2602
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Every other movie in existence

2603
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
All movies

2604
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Country bears

2605
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
The other thing is

2606
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
To a lot of people reminiscing

2607
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
That you're talking to Mike

2608
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Probably experienced this

2609
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Like on

2610
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
When they were on vacation

2611
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You know

2612
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
So if the vibes are good

2613
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Like you know

2614
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
They might already be prepared

2615
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
For that sort of thing

2616
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Well they had to be 21 on vacation

2617
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
We should remember that

2618
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It's not like they're attached to it

2619
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
This is full adult

2620
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Your brain is fully developed

2621
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And you made a choice

2622
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I do think there is something to

2623
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And you can say this about movies

2624
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
You can say this about a lot of different things

2625
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
If you go into it

2626
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Not wanting to like it

2627
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
You're going to find reasons not to like it

2628
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So if you're going to it

2629
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Wanting to absolutely love it

2630
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
No matter how bad it is

2631
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
No matter the situation

2632
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
No matter the garbage food

2633
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But to be fair they walked by

2634
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And were like whoa

2635
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
He thought it was a facade

2636
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
He thought it wasn't real

2637
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
So he walked by going I love this

2638
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
This is going to be the worst day of my life

2639
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Then you already kind of polluted the brain

2640
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
You said it smells like poop out here

2641
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You went into it hating it

2642
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You went into it thinking it was a facade

2643
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And went what is this magical

2644
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Joy and excitement coming out of this door

2645
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Right now

2646
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And I walked up to the door

2647
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I sensed that there were 500 people

2648
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
In the room

2649
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I heard two piano guys playing

2650
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
American Girl

2651
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
That caused Griffin and Kevin to go

2652
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Holy shit I can't get my 20 dollar bills out fast enough

2653
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It caused me to run away

2654
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I don't know what

2655
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I was not coming in with any bias

2656
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I didn't know anything about

2657
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
That lobby room I think it's really

2658
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
That's a key spot

2659
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
If you get a sense of it

2660
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
The little pre-room

2661
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It really is

2662
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It did break me but it helped

2663
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Knowing that my fee

2664
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Would be covered and the jello shots

2665
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Helped once I was in there

2666
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Getting to chat with you Candace was all great

2667
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I will say it all

2668
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And I stayed longer than I thought

2669
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I would say it all exceeded my expectations

2670
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Though my expectations after the first time

2671
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Around were

2672
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Hovering around Johnny's

2673
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Poo pipe zone

2674
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
What he walked in with

2675
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But it was better

2676
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It was better than I expected

2677
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Barely

2678
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
We should say

2679
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
They claimed that this

2680
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Is going to reopen somewhere in Orlando

2681
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I was looking and trying to find any

2682
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Information about it

2683
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It doesn't seem to be any further information

2684
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I remember seeing speculation online

2685
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That they were lying about that

2686
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So the performers wouldn't quit

2687
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I don't know

2688
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
If that's true or not

2689
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I saw a video

2690
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I know this is a weird thing

2691
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
That I just happened to notice

2692
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I saw a video when they were

2693
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Previewing a lounge

2694
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
For the Disney cruise line

2695
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
They were doing a

2696
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Preview thing and one of the pianists was

2697
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Playing piano at that

2698
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Preview

2699
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I think they're good

2700
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I think they're going to be okay

2701
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Wait until they find out they're going to get replaced by

2702
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Joe Gardner

2703
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Or Muppets

2704
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Muppets

2705
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Easy fixed

2706
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Jelly rolls

2707
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Block out the RO

2708
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah block out the ROL

2709
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Jelly souls

2710
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
There you go

2711
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Don't even need a new sign

2712
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Just block out

2713
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I hope so

2714
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And then you say hey we have a special

2715
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Guest tonight he just dropped in

2716
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Everyone please welcome

2717
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Rolf

2718
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Oh from Muppets

2719
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Rolf doesn't

2720
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
He doesn't get enough

2721
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Play in modern Muppets stuff I feel like

2722
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
This is true

2723
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
He's not as appreciated

2724
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
He'd like to see him for sure

2725
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Fingers crossed if anyone has

2726
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Any information out there let us know

2727
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
If there's any hope

2728
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Mike and I have questions

2729
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
We need answers

2730
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I will offer $5,000

2731
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
If anyone has information about

2732
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Jelly rolls opening anywhere in the Orlando

2733
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Area

2734
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
That's too realistic of a number

2735
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Should I say

2736
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Parody

2737
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I will offer $5,000

2738
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
For anyone

2739
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
To give me information

2740
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
About the opening of jelly rolls

2741
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Or can I

2742
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I'm not going to be the one to reopen it I don't think

2743
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Maybe that's part of your Orlando

2744
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Move

2745
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Maybe that's what this is all about

2746
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Your life

2747
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
My life's work

2748
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
You're just at like a moment right now

2749
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I don't know anything about opening the Dueling Piano Bar

2750
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But I had to do it

2751
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I lost something that day

2752
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And I'll be damned if I was going to let it go forever

2753
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So I'm here

2754
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'm fucking outlawed

2755
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I got my piano duelers at my side

2756
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yeah I lived a lifetime

2757
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
When you brought that up

2758
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I lived a lifetime in that moment

2759
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
In my mind

2760
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
In my memory

2761
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Outlaw Mike's is a Dueling Piano Bar

2762
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Located in Orlando, Florida

2763
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I think this whole episode is just

2764
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
To watch you

2765
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Yeah

2766
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I could see it, it's how I felt looking at the Pleasure Island

2767
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Memories, I lived a life

2768
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Every time I read someone's account

2769
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Of their teen

2770
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Early twenties

2771
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Now maybe this is it for me

2772
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
This is all about

2773
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
All of Mike's variants

2774
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Are just at Pleasure Island

2775
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Or working the box office

2776
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
At Jelly Rolls

2777
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
There's only one

2778
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Multiverse universe

2779
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Where I'm living in Los Angeles

2780
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
All the others, I'm in Orlando

2781
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Doing a variety of things

2782
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
So many things

2783
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Working at different piano bars

2784
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Probably different Dueling Piano Bars

2785
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
One's like a Medieval Times play

2786
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
One's like a battle arena

2787
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
One is a Dueling Piano Bar

2788
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
One is just like a

2789
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
All jello shots

2790
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
100% jello shot factory

2791
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You're inventing new flavors

2792
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
You're the jello shot scientist

2793
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
In Orlando in another reality

2794
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
When you bring the magic party out here

2795
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
So that I can have it back

2796
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Oh yeah

2797
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
The other I'm working is a bartender

2798
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
At Taffer's Tavern in Orlando

2799
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
By the way, do we know

2800
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I emailed Taffer's Tavern about opening

2801
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Because we're coming out there in a few weeks

2802
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Week and a half

2803
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And we don't have an opening date

2804
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And I was so hoping that that would be open

2805
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I don't know if you two have visited

2806
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
The site of Taffer's Tavern on iDrive

2807
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Unfortunately the local news have not

2808
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Covered it whatsoever

2809
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Oh really?

2810
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Candice's lives don't revolve around the actions

2811
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Of John Taffer the way that are

2812
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Haha

2813
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Yeah I guess

2814
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
We walked out

2815
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
We did a little video in front of Taffer's Tavern

2816
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
When we were there a month and a half or two months ago

2817
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So fingers crossed

2818
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
From having been in front, do you think it's opening

2819
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
In the next week and a half?

2820
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I don't

2821
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Sadly

2822
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
It makes me hard to say it

2823
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
No

2824
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
What scares me most about it not opening

2825
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Is that I'm positive

2826
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It will be closed by the time we come back

2827
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I'm positive

2828
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
That it will be open

2829
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
And closed within like 6 months

2830
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So we won't ever get to experience it

2831
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That's my worry

2832
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
It's iDrive

2833
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's cut through

2834
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It's kill or be killed on iDrive

2835
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Businesses

2836
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
It's open and out

2837
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You don't know what's going to last

2838
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Luckily Tin Roof where we're doing our shows is still there

2839
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Hopefully it doesn't close by the time we're there

2840
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
During the shows

2841
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
That would be a big problem

2842
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Everything you're really excited about

2843
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And gives you the most joy in life

2844
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Just keeps shutting down

2845
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I don't know

2846
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I don't know what that says

2847
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
If I'm willing that somehow to happen

2848
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Including the bodies of 90 year old actors

2849
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Who you're obsessed with

2850
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
What are you doing man

2851
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Most of them are still around

2852
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I don't want to say them out loud

2853
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Because I'll jinx it

2854
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Don't say them out loud

2855
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm thinking

2856
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Maybe you shouldn't even do that

2857
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Don't think about it

2858
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
It's too late

2859
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I touched my head like

2860
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Professor X

2861
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Whoever it was

2862
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
The next time you read about

2863
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
An old celebrity who died

2864
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
It was who Mike was thinking about

2865
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't want to force an ending to this

2866
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But now I'm aware that we have to carve out

2867
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Approximately 20 minutes of space

2868
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
For people's fond

2869
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
For voice memos

2870
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Jelly Roll's memories

2871
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Anything else that we

2872
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I don't know how you want to place that

2873
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
In there Mike

2874
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I don't know if that's after we do all our business

2875
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I think after all the business

2876
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And now we send it to the memories

2877
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'll do a real

2878
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Casey Kasem style

2879
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Talk up

2880
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
He's already dead right

2881
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
You didn't kill him by mentioning him

2882
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Remember his wife

2883
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Was carrying his corpse

2884
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Around for a while

2885
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Remember that

2886
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That's a whole

2887
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Too dark sorry I apologize

2888
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Luckily

2889
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
We'll find out if the corpse

2890
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Of Jelly Rolls is being carried around

2891
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Or if it'll find a new permanent location

2892
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Somewhere in the Orlando area

2893
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Candice and Michael

2894
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
How fast are you there once it is reestablished

2895
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Do you take

2896
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Our Epic Universe trip just to take a trip

2897
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
To be there opening night

2898
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
God I mean it sounds fun

2899
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
To do that right

2900
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
To go opening night

2901
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I want to present you

2902
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
With a question

2903
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Epic Universe just opened right

2904
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
So you saw all the open introduction

2905
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Ceremonies the opening live streams all that stuff

2906
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Like that in your perfect world

2907
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
What does an opening

2908
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Ceremony for the new

2909
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Jelly Rolls look like

2910
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
That's a great question

2911
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Great question

2912
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I mean outside of something like every

2913
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Table has a piano

2914
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Which I think is unrealistic

2915
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I would like it to

2916
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I think it needs to look even older

2917
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I think it needs to look

2918
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Have that retro vibe

2919
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I guess I'm not talking about the opening ceremony

2920
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I'm talking about the new location

2921
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I'm making a building in my mind

2922
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But that has to be part of it for me

2923
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Mike is imagining

2924
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
A dive bar

2925
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And rotating it in his mind

2926
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
But I think

2927
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I think they have to invite

2928
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Every theme park piano

2929
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Performer in the Orlando area

2930
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
To come up and do their

2931
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Like three best songs

2932
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Of all dozens and dozens

2933
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Of pianos at the entrance

2934
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Of Jelly Rolls and all of them

2935
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Will be playing the most

2936
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
It will be just like a medley

2937
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Of all these different songs

2938
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
May what if it's

2939
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Like dozens

2940
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Of the Disney Springs

2941
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Piano on a bicycle

2942
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Yeah

2943
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Okay, yeah, I mean

2944
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
What if Jelly Rolls

2945
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Wasn't even a place

2946
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I know Jelly Rolls is an idea

2947
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It's a concept too, but hear me out

2948
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
You know those long

2949
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Bikes where somebody's pedaling

2950
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
But we're all sitting at a bar

2951
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
What if Jelly Rolls was mobile

2952
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I like this

2953
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Jelly Rolls cause it's

2954
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Rolling

2955
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Now I don't know if it's

2956
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't know if the person pedaling

2957
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Could also play the piano and sing

2958
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
If that's too much

2959
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I would like to see him try as well

2960
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Maybe you'd have to have a piano player on the back of it

2961
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
But I would like to see the person

2962
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Cause we're dueling

2963
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Or are the two sides

2964
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Like the bars

2965
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
The two sides are pedaling and they're dueling

2966
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And you guys get the best of all the worlds

2967
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That we discussed

2968
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
What if

2969
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Yeah, like if you and I are on this piano bar

2970
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
We're sitting opposite sides

2971
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
We're dueling each other

2972
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Yeah, that's my initial concept

2973
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But it's all the ideas

2974
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Everyone has a piano?

2975
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It's one big piano

2976
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Now it's a game

2977
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Now we've created a game

2978
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
What if it's a bike

2979
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It's a long bike

2980
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
There's two piano players on the long bike

2981
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And there's a piano on each side

2982
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
One starts pedaling

2983
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And the other one is playing this way

2984
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And then as soon as the next song

2985
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
The other one starts pedaling

2986
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And they go the other way

2987
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So people switch off pedaling and playing

2988
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So they're dueling on the long bike

2989
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
And there's like eight people

2990
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Six people maybe on each side

2991
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I feel like you can afford this

2992
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I feel like this is something that you can afford

2993
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So maybe you are going to reopen

2994
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Jelly Rolls

2995
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
If you can find

2996
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
A roundabout way of surface streets

2997
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
From Disney World to Universal Studios

2998
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And you just

2999
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Establish a route

3000
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
So you're saying you would take

3001
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Like a four hour bike ride

3002
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
From Universal to Disney World

3003
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Well

3004
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Because you're not going to be able to take this

3005
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Pedaled monstrosity on I-4

3006
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
So you're going to have to

3007
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Take surface streets

3008
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But you can go back and forth

3009
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And by the time

3010
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Unfortunately by the time

3011
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Number three is rolling around

3012
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
You will have arrived at your destination

3013
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
But you will be

3014
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Equally as dehydrated as you would have

3015
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
At the original Jelly Rolls

3016
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
But you will have

3017
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Tired as part of it

3018
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Tired as we learned

3019
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Little dehydrated

3020
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
You did it

3021
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You get the full experience

3022
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
You'll be so pumped up from hearing we didn't start the fire though

3023
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
You'll be so

3024
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Revved up from hearing it

3025
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And doing the parts

3026
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And you'll probably have heard it like three times in three hours

3027
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
And then you could play

3028
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Limp biscuits, keep rolling

3029
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And it would be perfect

3030
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Rolling, yeah

3031
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Jelly rolling at the New York Jelly Rolls

3032
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Well this is beautiful

3033
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
This seems like a viable business

3034
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
To get the piano

3035
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
To get mobile pianos and a bunch of

3036
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Like all the keys all out on the road

3037
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Really excited for you Mike

3038
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Put that

3039
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
$5,000 to work

3040
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
You got a little seed money to start

3041
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, don't give that away

3042
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Because that could be the $5,000 that started

3043
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Jelly Rollers

3044
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I hope you guys don't mind that the Patreon money

3045
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
This month is going to go just to this

3046
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Idea

3047
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I did think the numbers

3048
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Seemed a little off when I looked at it

3049
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
But okay

3050
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You thought zero seemed off for you this month?

3051
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah

3052
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Well

3053
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
It's going to a good cause

3054
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
If it makes you happy, clearly it does

3055
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And it's been nice to hear the reports

3056
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Of somebody who this place made very happy

3057
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
And somebody who it did not

3058
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Whatsoever

3059
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It takes all kinds and it made for a fun time

3060
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Candice and Johnny, you survived podcast

3061
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
The Ride, thanks for

3062
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Zooming in this year, stream yarding with us

3063
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And being here

3064
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Truly fascinating, there can be that

3065
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Degree of difference

3066
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Even tight

3067
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Co-hosts disagree

3068
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
But you're in a marriage

3069
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And yet you make it work, despite your Jelly Rolls

3070
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Conflicts

3071
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Let's exit through the gift shop

3072
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3073
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Go ahead, plug your stuff away

3074
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
You want me to plug your stuff for you?

3075
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
My stuff?

3076
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Follow her on Instagram

3077
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
CandiceTheRay

3078
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Follow me on Instagram and X

3079
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And YouTube and all that good stuff

3080
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I feel like you have more to plug than I do

3081
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I'm just a mom hanging out

3082
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
We do a travel vlog sometimes, you want to see what it's like to be a wrestler

3083
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Watch that, it's on YouTube

3084
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
We're on SmackDown

3085
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
We're on SmackDown too, yeah, I guess we're on TV

3086
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Every Friday night, USA Networks

3087
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
There's a lot of plugs out there

3088
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
You did some Epic Universe

3089
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Did you do more?

3090
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
We did, yeah, just recently

3091
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
We've been to Epic Universe four times now at this point

3092
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
We love it, fantastic

3093
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Way better than Jelly Rolls

3094
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I'd love to check out your

3095
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
That heresy

3096
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
That the new theme park is better than Jelly Rolls

3097
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Could be

3098
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Hey, as for us

3103
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Slash Podcast The Ride

3104
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
And just on the subject of music

3105
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I was referring to just maybe not liking a lot of the run-of-the-mill stuff

3106
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
That you end up hearing at this place

3107
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I just want to say

3108
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
In terms of the kind of music you like

3109
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
And if you want to hear some real music

3110
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Some gritty music that makes you feel

3111
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And that's emotional and honest

3112
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
There's a friend of the show

3113
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Named Kyle M

3114
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And some of you listeners might be familiar with his album

3115
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
That he put out, The Real Me

3116
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
You might be familiar with his former

3117
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Name that he's not going by as much anymore

3118
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Which is Kyle Mooney, because he sort of moved on from the comedy

3119
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Stuff that he used to do

3120
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Let's get into the music stuff

3121
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
If I'm pointing to the music that I love

3122
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
That I'd rather be hearing than Jelly Rolls

3123
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
It's Kyle M, it's The Real Me

3124
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I just want to say he's going out on the Real Me

3125
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Fake Me Tour

3126
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
His first big music tour

3127
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
There'll be a little bit of comedy in there

3128
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
But hopefully he gets through it quickly

3129
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And moves on to the music

3130
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Because it's very artistic and very creative stuff

3131
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And I was lucky enough to get to do some artistic stuff with him

3132
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I directed the videos for the tour

3133
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So if you end up

3134
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
The Real Me

3135
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Is going to your town

3136
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
With his unflinchingly honest show

3137
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I made some unflinchingly honest videos for him

3138
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
And it was great to do that

3139
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
So go to KyleMooneyLive.com if you want to see what he's cooking up

3140
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
And what I got to do with him

3141
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So just a little extra plug there

3142
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Mike, now do we go into the

3143
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I think now

3144
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Now if you will

3145
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Go out to the store

3146
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Buy the cheapest beer you can possibly find

3147
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Pour it in a

3148
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Plastic cup

3149
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Buy some Jell-O

3150
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Put vodka in the Jell-O

3151
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Find a whiskey

3152
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
That is so well that it doesn't even have a name

3153
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Unlabeled whiskey

3154
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Well it's labeled

3155
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
It's just got three X's on it

3156
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Oh sure

3157
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
It's name is XXX

3158
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Right

3159
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And I want you to sit

3160
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And tell anyone in your family to hush

3161
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
To be quiet while you now

3162
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Listen to many

3163
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Many, many people

3164
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Share their fond memories

3165
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Of one of the greatest places

3166
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Disney World ever offered

3167
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Jelly Rolls

3168
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Please no laughing

3169
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
This is very serious

3170
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Take it away

3171
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Take it away everyone

3172
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Who loved Jelly Rolls

3173
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Back in 2010 my friend

3174
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Had her wedding after party at Jelly Rolls

3175
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
It was unofficial and there were none when

3176
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
There were no guests there but her guests were

3177
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Basically running the place

3178
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
My friend the bride kept running up on stage with the pianos

3179
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And the security guards kept scolding her

3180
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And chasing her off

3181
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Tuesday nights were free for cast members

3182
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
You'd walk in and the place would be packed with all of your friends

3183
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
It truly was like

3184
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Cheers for all of us that worked at Disney

3185
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
You had to be at least 21 to get in

3186
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
So that was where I spent my 21st birthday

3187
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And my friends got me on the piano for Uptown Girl

3188
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And you lost that love and feeling

3189
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
So many amazing memories from Jelly Rolls

3190
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
2020

3191
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
We go to Jelly Rolls with a friend of ours in town

3192
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
From Pennsylvania

3193
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
And we Jelly Roll pretty hard

3194
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And

3195
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Our friend Alex in particular

3196
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The next morning was like

3197
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Oh my gosh I'm so hungover

3198
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
To get on an airplane this is crazy

3199
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
He ended up being the sickest he's ever been

3200
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And I am 99% sure

3201
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
That he got COVID

3202
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Before COVID was a thing

3203
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So I'm willing to go on repair to say

3204
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
That Jelly Rolls may have been the site of patient zero

3205
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
For

3206
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
COVID-19 in the United States

3207
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
The last two times I went into Jelly Rolls

3208
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I was actually with the BTR boys

3209
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Mike Carlson paid

3210
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
My cover fee both times

3211
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Very generously

3212
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
$20 each time

3213
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And the man is very generous

3214
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Don't let anybody tell you he's not

3215
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Jelly Rolls really brings out the good

3216
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
In people I think because I return

3217
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The favor by buying a round

3218
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Of four Dos Equis beers

3219
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
For me and Mike and

3220
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Mr. Morrow and Griff and Newman

3221
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And it's a beer I never drink

3222
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
But I drank it that night because Jelly Rolls

3223
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Is all about diverting expectations

3224
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Really you never know what to

3225
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Expect and I'm really going to miss

3226
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
That place I'm fighting back tears right now

3227
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So I better go over and out

3228
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I recently had the pleasure

3229
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Of spending two long nights in a

3230
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Row at Jelly

3231
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Rolls just last month right before it closed

3232
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And I really can't think of a better way

3233
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
To end a day of park hopping there

3234
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
You know especially with the Skyliner

3235
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
When that was put in

3236
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I feel like Trader Sam's takes up a lot of space

3237
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
In the hearts of theme park bands

3238
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
And the Hoop to Do review has a lot of

3239
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Nostalgia that looms large

3240
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
In the lore

3241
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
But this may have actually been the true hidden gem

3242
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Of the after hours resort scene

3243
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And these pianists could banter really

3244
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Well with the guests and they have their standards

3245
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
But they also were really willing to go

3246
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
For it to give people like a special

3247
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Customer experience

3248
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
For me though the real standout of those

3249
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Guys was this guy Michael

3250
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
We saw a few different folks but he was there

3251
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Both nights we were just there and

3252
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
And he owned that stage

3253
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
He had all these great bits and enthusiasm

3254
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
And like just a genuine stage

3255
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Presence and at one point on

3256
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
One of the nights he decided

3257
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
On a whim it seemed to do the entirety

3258
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Of the Main Street Electrical Parade

3259
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I do not know how else to describe it

3260
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Except as thrilling

3261
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
In trying to think of a good

3262
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Memory about Jelly Rolls

3263
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I think the only appropriate

3264
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Response for me is

3265
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
That my favorite memory

3266
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Was when it used to be free

3267
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
For cast members

3268
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
The day they got rid of free entry

3269
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It closed

3270
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
To me that day

3271
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
RIP Jelly Rolls

3272
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Home of probably

3273
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
One of the best nights of my life

3274
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Let me say definitely

3275
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
One of the best nights of my life

3276
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
A great night with a great group of friends

3277
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But notably absent

3278
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
One Scott Garrett

3279
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Went with Mike

3280
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Friends of the Pod

3281
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Mr. Morrow

3282
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And Kevin Tully of Telethon

3283
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
We had a great time

3284
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
We were all walking down

3285
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
The boardwalk together and Scott bailed

3286
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
When he found out there was a $20

3287
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Cover charge

3288
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
We had an exchange here once we got inside

3289
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Mike very casually

3290
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Lowercase

3291
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Just texts American Pie

3292
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And Scott texts a photo

3293
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Of a $20 bill

3294
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
In his hand

3295
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I believe looking up

3296
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
At the

3297
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Ceiling of his hotel room

3298
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
And Scott wrote

3299
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Underneath it just admiring

3300
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
This $20 I still have

3301
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Mike texted

3302
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
They're doing can you picture that

3303
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
From Muppet Movie and Griffin is going wild

3304
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I can confirm

3305
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I gave it a thumbs up stamp even

3306
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I was indeed going wild

3307
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I was losing my god damn mind

3308
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And Scott said okay that's a good one

3309
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I'll give them that

3310
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And I wrote all caps

3311
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
He did all the different voices Scott

3312
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I will say if any other PTR listeners

3313
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Cliffords

3314
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Are similarly mourning

3315
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
The lack of available
