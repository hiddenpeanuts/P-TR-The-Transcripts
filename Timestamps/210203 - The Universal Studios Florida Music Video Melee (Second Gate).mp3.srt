1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,680
Welcome to what is now the most important election

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,520
of our lifetimes.

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,600
Today on Podcast The Ride, we will be determining

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,960
once and for all what is the greatest music video

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,080
filmed at Universal Studios Florida.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm Scott Gardner, joined for this momentous occasion

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,280
by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,200
I am here and I am in a very serious mood.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,880
And I'm also in a philosophical mood

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,080
because of what I'll be discussing today

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,000
because there's so much wisdom also

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
in what I will be talking about.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
Yeah, I'd say so.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,960
That's a song that goes there that addresses a lot.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,320
Boy, boy does it.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,480
We'll save it.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Jason Sheridan also here for this weighty occasion.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,960
Yes, thank you so much, Scott.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,440
And I just wanna say hello again to my fellow hosts

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,360
and our second gate listeners,

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,080
our wonderful second gate listeners.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,600
But most importantly, say hello to myself.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Because that's what I'm gonna be talking about a lot today.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,480
Okay, very good vague hints.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,360
That's so vague.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,760
Now, we may have given away some of what these music videos

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,560
are in a tweet or something or other,

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,320
but if you don't know, we'll splay them out slowly.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,360
But I thought this would be a fun topic.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,600
Many things have been filmed at Universal Studios Florida,

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,160
many feature films, many wrestling events,

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,160
maybe many bizarre Crayola-sponsored VHSs,

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
if you know that one.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
Lots of great film productions.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,320
But I think three of the greatest are for music videos

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
that happen to be for,

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,920
I think three of the greatest songs ever made.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
I think, yeah, indisputably.

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,440
I think all three of the things that we're gonna talk about

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,040
reflect the Orlando culture in specific ways.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,440
So they're all representative of different Orlando facets,

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
which I think is great.

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,360
They aren't just random.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,000
And I can't wait to talk about them.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, we're gonna, there's definitely, of course,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
overlap in all of the videos.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,320
I mean, I guess you're always gonna find overlap

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,040
in popular music.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,000
But I think that you're dealing with three

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
stylistically different pieces here, musically and visually.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
Yeah, yeah, indeed.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,480
But now there's something that I don't think

55
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
you guys know about, which is that I did like a little,

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
I did a little switch out of mine.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Maybe I didn't address this with you guys

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,320
because this episode idea was inspired by

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,920
a 90s Beach Boys video that I saw,

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,480
that I saw, I mean, look, I know it.

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I just re-saw it for the song Hot Fun in the Summertime.

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
It re-imagines the Sly and the Family Stone,

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,000
Hot Fun in the Summertime, but with a twist.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,560
What if it was done by very white people?

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
It's a fun video.

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,560
The Beach Boys jam out with child versions of themselves,

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,960
and I recommend to anyone to watch it.

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
But I was thinking like, oh, it reminded me

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
of these other music videos and like,

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
what about Universal Studios thing?

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,520
But technically that one is Universal Hollywood.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
So I think it does not count.

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,440
So I had to think of a new music video

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,640
from Universal Florida.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,040
And luckily there was one, which I can reveal to you now.

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,960
If you don't mind me kicking it off.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,320
Go ahead, yes, please.

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,960
We're all kind of representing one.

79
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,680
Yeah, if you go first, I'll go second,

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
and we'll end on Mike.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Cause I know once we get to Mike,

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
we're not gonna be able to,

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,640
once that ball starts rolling downhill,

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
it's not gonna be able to stop.

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,640
Right, it's not gonna be possible.

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
I will say, I'm glad you actually

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
thrown that Beach Boys video out

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,520
because I found it a bit racy.

89
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,760
Well, now remind me why.

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,680
I know that this is a video, again,

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,280
to take a black art and do it very white.

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,480
It was like the vibe of do the right thing a little bit

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,640
where it's a sweltering day on the street corner.

94
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,680
And we're letting the fire hydrants loose and all that.

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,920
And does that end up where like hosing girls down?

96
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,400
Is that what goes on?

97
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,560
I mean, Mike Love is not hosing girls down directly,

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,560
but there's a lot of long like male gaze woman

99
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,880
taking her shirt off close up on her body,

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,640
like very long closeups on it.

101
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Which for a Beach Boys video,

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,480
I go, that's a little too much.

103
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,320
Sure.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
And then there's a lot,

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,000
and then you of course cut back to a bunch of 60 year olds.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Yeah, then in the 90s.

107
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,320
And you're like, that's a little,

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,200
and look, my video has women in bathing suits,

109
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,360
but they're much, it's quicker shots.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,560
They're much more tasteful, I believe.

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,960
So thank you, Scott, for taking care of the problem

112
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,000
I already had with the potential video.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Not forcing you to go down this avenue.

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah, there's a whiplash that comes from the combo

115
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,160
of bikini babes and very old men in neon hats

116
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,480
that cover that they are very much bald.

117
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Right.

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm disappointed to not talk about it,

119
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,480
but I'm also, I'm happy to talk about this other one.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,920
There's this music video that's been burned in my brain

121
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
for a long time.

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,600
When I say that the three videos

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,480
we're gonna talk about today reflect the Orlando culture.

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
Well, when you think of Orlando and you think about music,

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
you of course think about the big trend

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
that came from Orlando, it was born in Orlando,

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
and that's boy bands.

128
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Orlando's the home of the Backstreet Boys in sync.

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,120
And of course, we all know it,

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,640
the most popular best boy band of all.

131
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,880
Everybody say it with me, Natural.

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
You know, Natural, right?

133
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,800
Of course.

134
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Natural.

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Natural was the final boy band attempted by Lou Pearlman.

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,520
And you know, last time's the charm.

137
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,760
I think he hit it out of the park with this one.

138
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,040
Natural put out an album in 2002 called Keep It Natural.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,200
And why the name Natural?

140
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,680
Well, because the gimmick of Natural

141
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,560
is that they also played their own instruments.

142
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,880
They don't just dance.

143
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,200
By this point, it had been, you know,

144
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,800
the prefab nature of the boy bands had been called out.

145
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,920
We want people who actually have some musical talent.

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,000
So that's why these guys actually played their instruments.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Let me familiarize you guys with Natural a little bit.

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,280
So here is the gang.

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,400
Let me share the screen.

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
I mean, you know I'm just reacquainting you,

151
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
but hey, here they are, the five guys.

152
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,080
All with varying degrees of spiky, Dane Cook-esque hair.

153
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,480
And of course, in the middle is Big Papa himself, Lou,

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,480
in just like a blue collared businessman shirt,

155
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,120
just like dressed for his banker job

156
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,040
around all these leopard print bowling shirt guys.

157
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
It's like they're all smiling

158
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
because they're about to like handcuff him and arrest him.

159
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,440
Citizens arrest.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,040
It looks like five people are holding back this monster.

161
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,640
If they weren't, yeah, if they weren't smiling,

162
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,200
you would think, oh, they're trying to detain this man.

163
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,680
This is finally, we're putting him away.

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,760
We're reading him his race.

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,240
It's funny that you mentioned that

166
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,680
because in looking for this photo,

167
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,160
I found another picture of Lou Perlman

168
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,440
and this one's with Joey Fatone, I believe,

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,760
and it's Lou smiling just this big

170
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,200
and he's putting handcuffs on Joey Fatone.

171
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
Oh my God.

172
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,720
It's a very disturbing photograph,

173
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,720
I believe taken at one of his NYPD themed pizza parlors.

174
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Was there a conversation with all the boy bands

175
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,880
where they went, all right, we need to get handcuffs.

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Let's just try to get, like, let's just try to arrest him,

177
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,840
do a citizens arrest.

178
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,320
And they're like, I don't know, is it gonna work?

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,240
All right, we know he has this pizza place.

180
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,120
There's probably some handcuffs hanging around.

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,440
If we can just do a little flip on him, then that's it.

182
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,360
This goes away.

183
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
Would have been a good plan.

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Maybe they're trying it.

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
One of these guys might have handcuffs right now,

186
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,840
but it's not working.

187
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,320
These are especially disturbing photos

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,760
in social distancing time, watching these boys

189
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,200
forced hanging out with Lou.

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Here they are on a staircase.

191
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,280
Why is he in all these photos?

192
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
I mean, don't answer the question.

193
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,480
I mean, I don't have an answer.

194
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Honestly, it was hard to find a photo of them without Lou.

195
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
Was he in the band?

196
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Did Lou put himself in this one?

197
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,680
I mean, technically, I mean, his contract within Sync

198
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
was that he is the sixth member,

199
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,880
something that he neglected to tell them

200
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640
until deep into the process,

201
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,320
that he was when the money was doled out every month,

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
that he would, he'd take money off the top

203
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
and then get paid as member number six.

204
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
Jesus Christ.

205
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
Wow.

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,200
Crazy guy.

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Crazy man.

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
No longer with us.

209
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,680
He also, by the way, wrote a song on this band's album.

210
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,600
I believe the first ever songwriting credit

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,040
attributed to Lou Pearlman.

212
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I need to hear that.

213
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,280
Just imagine the boring song you've ever heard.

214
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Imagine a song you would have written

215
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
when you learned your first two guitar chords.

216
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,400
You know, for a girlfriend who you didn't do anything with.

217
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,400
Okay, got it.

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,080
And here he is, a planet Hollywood with the guys.

219
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,880
So Lou, Lou constantly around.

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,720
The guys, by the way, let's just call them out by name.

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Hey, Ben, Mark, Michael, other Michael and Patrick.

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,240
So that's natural.

223
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,520
And they, like I said, they shot a video at Universal Florida.

224
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Why do I know any of this?

225
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Because I was studying abroad in Germany in 2005

226
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
and watching whatever MTV equivalent out there.

227
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
And at some point this music video came on

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,400
and it caught my eye because it was clearly

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,440
Universal Florida and it made me homesick for America

230
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,000
and the best place in America, Universal Florida.

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And mainly I was like, wait, still boy bands in 2005.

232
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,600
I guess in Germany it's still passed, I don't know.

233
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,800
But let's just skim through this video a little bit.

234
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,400
And I guess, okay, so I don't know what our criteria are

235
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,120
other than just like general quality and is it a good song?

236
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,800
But I guess like, do we think like back lot coverage

237
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,880
or like creativity of reappropriation

238
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,520
of universal environments?

239
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,160
I, yes, I completely, that was gonna be one of my criteria

240
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,600
because Beach Boys Hot Fun in the summertime

241
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
is very limited in its scope of what it's showing

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
of the actual park.

243
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,080
And I was gonna dock at points for that

244
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,800
because my video is a lot more of the actual area

245
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
and I think that's good.

246
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,040
We wanna see more of Universal Florida.

247
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,200
Yours is kind of one to beat, I would say in that area.

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,320
It definitely makes its way around

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,720
and uses a lot of the themed environments creatively.

250
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,280
But here, let me show you around the natural song,

251
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,800
Put Your Arms Around Me.

252
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
We're in the entrance plaza a lot.

253
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,920
We're hanging out by the dock.

254
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,960
I think we're in sort of like the Jaws zone.

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,640
Here's the boys and they are practicing instruments

256
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,640
a little bit and banging on the dock, but maybe they work.

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Maybe they're like boatsmen, I'm not sure,

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,080
dreaming of musical stardom.

259
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
They see some girls.

260
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Maybe a way to get the girls' attention

261
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,880
is a battle of the bands, which is,

262
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,480
wait, they're already on the flyer though,

263
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,880
so I guess this isn't them hearing about the battle

264
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,680
of the bands for the first time.

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
Does that say they're playing at Ugly Burger?

266
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,640
Yeah, or is that a band?

267
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Is that another band that they're playing against?

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
Perhaps, yeah.

269
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,960
Fictitious Chickens is one.

270
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,000
Right, yeah, you're right, that might be another band.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,400
Great fonts all around on here.

272
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
So we cover Jaws zone, like Cape Cod zone.

273
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,080
It's nice to see that.

274
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
Mainly we're in this entrance plaza,

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,640
which I remember was the thing that I liked

276
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,240
when I saw it many years ago.

277
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,680
I really like that entrance plaza.

278
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,360
It's kind of like, I don't know why to explain

279
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,720
to you anything that's good about it,

280
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,040
but that big gate, just any time I'm in there,

281
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,120
I have so much anticipation for the day

282
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,840
and the adventures I'll be going on

283
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,160
and the friends I'll be seeing.

284
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,400
So it's nice to be in there.

285
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,720
So you know, there's shirtless and stuff.

286
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Let me try to find the chorus

287
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,800
and give you a taste of what natural's all about.

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm standing still.

289
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,600
Come back and say that you will.

290
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,920
Put your arms around me.

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
You're the one and only.

292
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,760
I'll be here if you let your heart show the way.

293
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Always be beside me.

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,880
Put your arms around me.

295
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I'll be here when the dawn is the same.

296
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,120
You tell me.

297
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
How you feel about that?

298
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,200
This guy has a shirt that looks like a Pope caught,

299
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,000
like a Catholic priest collar.

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,840
Yeah, you see tuxedo t-shirts,

301
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,200
but you don't usually see a Catholic priest garb as shirts.

302
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,760
This sounds like a B-side of the fray or something.

303
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
That's a good band to call.

304
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,000
I was thinking about,

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,400
I don't really know what this band is too much,

306
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,520
but the calling, is this what the calling is like?

307
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,120
Yeah, what does the calling do?

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,440
I know the calling.

309
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't know.

310
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,160
I just know the name and that they're pretty, right?

311
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,560
Is the calling pretty?

312
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,640
The calling does, oh yeah, wherever you will go,

313
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
but I could, if I would, I'll go wherever you will go.

314
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,200
Way up high, I can keep going.

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Or down low.

316
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Jason and I know it.

317
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,640
These songs just remind me of being worried

318
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,840
that if I started dating somebody and that's what they liked

319
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,400
that I would have to pretend to like it.

320
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
You mean then or now?

321
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,200
It doesn't seem likely now so much.

322
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Could there be anyone who loves,

323
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,240
their favorite music is still the calling,

324
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Lifehouse, the fray, and natural.

325
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
My girlfriend at the time was a big Lifehouse

326
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,280
and Vertical Horizon.

327
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, Vertical, right, yeah, yeah.

328
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,800
Lifehouse has Hanging By A Moment, which I like,

329
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,640
but is in this genre, I feel.

330
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Unlike Lifehouse, Natural was not played every other

331
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,800
song block on top 40 stations.

332
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,640
Oh God.

333
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah, they wore that one out.

334
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,960
Vertical Horizon, there's like three hits from them

335
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,440
that just feel like they've been lost to time.

336
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,040
You pretty never hear those songs again.

337
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,320
Yeah, there's no radio station that is like,

338
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,320
only 2000s spiked collar, hookah shell kind of bands.

339
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Yeah.

340
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,200
Is Fuel in this category or they're a little harder,

341
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,040
I guess.

342
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,880
I think they're a little harder.

343
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,280
They're a little harder, but it is around

344
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,360
a couple years prior to this.

345
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
Yellow Card.

346
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,840
That's more punk, that's more a little SoCal punk though.

347
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Yeah, I think so.

348
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah, this song has no genre, pretty much.

349
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
It's not hard enough in any rock category

350
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
to force it to be a genre.

351
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,640
10 Half-Lifes after Matchbox 20.

352
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
There's nothing even resembling the goodness

353
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,360
of Matchbox 20 left.

354
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes, the spark, the hard thrust of Matchbox 20.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, Natural does not hold a candle to Bent.

356
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,960
No, oh my God, Bent is a masterpiece compared to this.

357
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,320
Yeah, I will say though, this video,

358
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,160
this shot in the entryway, this kind of bluish gray,

359
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,360
if you read about early 2000s design choices,

360
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,760
this and the era of Blobjects,

361
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,800
I think we've talked about before,

362
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,720
the kind of liquidy metal, the plastic,

363
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,880
the blue and gray color schemes like this

364
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,440
come up a lot in design histories.

365
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Well, music videos around this time were so tinty.

366
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,120
Let's just make the colors really crazy

367
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,480
and this will come up again, I think, with Jason,

368
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,320
the one that Jason was forced to associate with,

369
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
which all these videos were shot on film,

370
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,280
but then down-res for TV and there's no way

371
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,880
to get them back.

372
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,960
So they just, the quality is such garbage.

373
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
Right.

374
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,320
Also just the jib on this thing is too steep.

375
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
It makes me dizzy as if I'm going on Hollywood

376
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,120
rip ride rocket soon to be built just feet

377
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
from this location.

378
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
Forgive me, what is the name of the song?

379
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Oh, Put Your Arms Around Me.

380
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm just gonna put it into Apple Music

381
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,800
and see what it says is around that time.

382
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,000
And it appears natural is not in Apple Music.

383
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,840
Not even in it at all?

384
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,040
The US Marshalls still have the masters impounded.

385
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,320
It's evidence, yes.

386
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,040
At this point, they have like everything on here.

387
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
Yeah, I know it's weird when music slips through the crowd,

388
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
when there's an album that is not on Spotify

389
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,440
or any of them, it's very bizarre.

390
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,560
I would say skip past natural entirely

391
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,680
and go to another pseudo boy band

392
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,800
that also played instruments called Soul Decision.

393
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,400
I don't know if you remember Soul Decision.

394
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm a big, I stand for Soul Decision.

395
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
The song faded.

396
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,320
Kinda faded, but I feel all right.

397
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
Think about making my move tonight.

398
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,120
It's a good one.

399
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
I remember that.

400
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
That's a catchy one, that one holds up.

402
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,600
Anyway, see we go through carnival games.

403
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,720
We're in that Jaws zone now.

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
We're still in entrance plaza.

405
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,760
We got a purple hair goatee guy.

406
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,200
I think really the thing that you have to dock this video

407
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,880
points for is that its best sequence

408
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,040
happens not in the parks.

409
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,600
Clearly the best part of the video,

410
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,080
which I'll play for you now.

411
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Ah, would you come to round me?

412
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,560
Whoa.

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,920
Now, this seems to reference a film

414
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,280
and I don't know if you know the film,

415
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,480
but there's a, the filmmakers are the Wachowskis.

416
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,040
It's called The Matrix.

417
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
I think that's what it's nodding to.

418
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,400
It's an obscure film from the era.

419
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
They're like in a canyon environment.

420
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,520
There's lightning, digital lightning.

421
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,400
They're doing, there is the matrix effect.

422
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
They're in trench coats.

423
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,680
Maybe it's, yeah.

424
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,040
Or it's like an unsalvageable earth is where they are.

425
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,160
Or it's where Christopher Lambert takes some of the

426
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,400
combatants in Mortal Kombat, maybe.

427
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,520
Yeah, it's a Mortal Kombat level.

428
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,200
It's like a Mortal Kombat world.

429
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,040
The freeze jump.

430
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah.

431
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,400
Wow, this was good.

432
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
This is good, I like this part.

433
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,440
This is pretty good.

434
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,400
I think that the verses are pretty toothless

435
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
and I like this kind of more like

436
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,800
in sync breakdown-ish part.

437
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,440
I think maybe they should have leaned into Boy Band more.

438
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
But we come out of here and then here's where,

439
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,840
I think the only, I don't think Natural has a shot

440
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,440
at winning the tournament, but the only thing going for it

441
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,520
is that they are, they finished the thing at City Walk.

442
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
The big battle of the bands, I'll play it quietly.

443
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,560
Remember that big fountain?

444
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,120
I love that weird fountain.

445
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
It's kind of this double decker area.

446
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,560
All the Natural fans have gathered.

447
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,440
The steep jib continues.

448
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,200
So just nice to see City Walk at such a peak.

449
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,720
I mean, it's pretty new still at that point.

450
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,240
This is still City Walk Orlando Prime.

451
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,560
Not that it ever isn't, but you know what I mean.

452
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, I like that it's at City Walk.

453
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,640
That's great.

454
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,040
Yeah, because it's, when did City Walk open in Orlando?

455
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,080
Do we know the date?

456
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Yes, around 1999, same year as, I think end of 98 maybe?

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,800
They were projected early 99 at the latest

458
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,440
because then Islands of Adventure opens

459
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,800
at the start of the summer.

460
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
Well, I'll have to know it when we do it.

461
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,240
When we do the East Coast Saga.

462
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,520
Just say it, do it, yeah, do it.

463
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,680
I'll say it, okay, okay, I'll say no more.

464
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,680
Anyway, I mean, that gives you the gist of it.

465
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,200
There's not too much to speak of there,

466
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
but I just wanted to shout out Natural

467
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,360
for giving me a little shot of Orlando comfort.

468
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,760
I'd also like to say that them being a,

469
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,600
let's prove that we're not prefabricated band,

470
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,640
they were paired up with the original one of those,

471
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
The Monkeys.

472
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,400
They were the touring opener for The Monkeys

473
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,280
on a 2001 tour, which ended with Peter Tork being fired

474
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
due to excessive alcohol use.

475
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,520
Oh no, Peter.

476
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,720
We ended that tour with only two monkeys.

477
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,760
Replay, The Monkeys, there was that,

478
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,720
well, no, they didn't.

479
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,800
The Monkeys, the whole thing,

480
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,040
because they, Mike Nesmith would not tour with them

481
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,440
for the longest time.

482
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,000
And then he agreed to tour with them.

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,040
And then Peter Tork was back in the band.

484
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,400
And then Davey just dropped dead.

485
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,040
Oh, so they were finally together all again.

486
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,400
And then, hmm.

487
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,760
Yes, so then, yeah, so then it was just the three monkeys

488
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,440
without Davey Jones.

489
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
And then now it's weird,

490
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,160
like Mickey Dolan's and Mike Nesmith's monkey shows together.

491
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,960
It's very strange, like the configuration.

492
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
They apparently, in this time, went into the studio

493
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,560
and re-recorded the three big songs with Natural.

494
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,880
They were tricked into thinking

495
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,160
that Natural was gonna be something.

496
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,000
Wow.

497
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
Wow.

498
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,080
I have to hear this.

499
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,280
Well, you can't, it was never released.

500
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,040
They recorded it, but never did anything with it.

501
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,280
Not like the, oh, sorry, go ahead.

502
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,800
I was just gonna, I know someone

503
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,120
who might be able to get their hands on this.

504
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I knew, has the keys to Michael Nesmith's vault.

505
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,840
Yes, actually, yes.

506
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,600
Oh, hmm, friends in high places.

507
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,560
Yeah, yes.

508
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,360
Not like the album, Keep It Natural,

509
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,200
which was, while it did not chart in America,

510
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
it still did get around,

511
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,480
because it was a giveaway if you bought more than $12

512
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,400
worth of jewelry at Claire's.

513
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,960
So there might be some girls who were, you know,

514
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,920
buying some charms or something,

515
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,080
and ended up accidentally with a Natural in their bag.

516
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,000
Wow.

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,840
That's difficult.

518
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,400
That's like a garbage bag worth of jewelry from Claire's,

519
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,000
if memory serves their price points.

520
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Oh, that's true, yes.

521
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,600
You're spending a lot of like 79 cent items.

522
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah, a lot of, I mean, and the person piercing your ears

523
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,720
is only gonna be a year or two older than you.

524
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Like, you're really, really rolling the dice, Claire's.

525
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,600
So that's Natural, but I know it probably doesn't have

526
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,800
what it takes to go all the way,

527
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,520
but the next one very well might,

528
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,960
and I thank Jason for taking the lead on it.

529
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
Tell us about it.

530
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,920
Sure, well, you know, the Natural album, like you said,

531
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,840
didn't really chart, but let's go in the other direction

532
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,840
to with a song that came from an album at the time

533
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,760
viewed as kind of a dud,

534
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,960
because it only sold 6 million copies,

535
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
as opposed to the previous record by this band,

536
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,040
which sold 12 million copies.

537
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,400
And folks, you probably already know

538
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,360
who I'm talking about.

539
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm talking about Creed and the music video

540
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,600
for My Sacrifice.

541
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Now- Yeah, man, big song.

542
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,960
As opposed to Natural, a quiet one,

543
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
people don't really know that one.

544
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,760
My Sacrifice, major hit.

545
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,440
You could not, when you think about like Top 40 radio

546
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,280
in the early 2000s, like if you turned on a Top 40 station,

547
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,720
you were probably hearing this song or With Arms Wide Open,

548
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,480
you're probably hearing some Creed.

549
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,600
Unavoidable. Yes.

550
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,680
Yeah, and, you know, mixed feelings,

551
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,800
mixed feelings on Creed, because at the time,

552
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,680
I think we all kind of were like,

553
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
well, these songs are kind of earworms

554
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,360
and that's complicated because they suck.

555
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,920
Like this sucks, I hate this, but I can't avoid it.

556
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,960
And I somehow have learned all the words

557
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
because I have heard it so many times.

558
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,000
But I feel bad- I know the words,

559
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
but I also will fudge it because the way he sings is like,

560
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,320
yes.

561
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,200
Hello, my friend, meet you there.

562
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,800
A tale of bitter, silly, bitterly.

563
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,760
Like that's, as far as I know, that's what it is.

564
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,920
Yes. Yeah.

565
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,960
And I feel kind of bad for dumping on Creed

566
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,120
so much in the early 2000s,

567
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,440
because the more I read about poor Scott Stapp,

568
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
the man had a lot of substance abuse issues

569
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,320
was eventually diagnosed bipolar, thank God,

570
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,560
because yeah, he tried to kill himself in some crazy ways.

571
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,880
So that said, this music video-

572
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,640
Well, let's pin it on the other guys then

573
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,840
so we can make fun of them,

574
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
because this band sucks.

575
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,440
And I also just, right before you get into it,

576
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,040
what you brought up the album,

577
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,760
the album is called Weathered.

578
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,280
Yes, Weathered, that's correct.

579
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Yeah, Weathered, the album Weathered.

580
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,920
And yeah, 6 million people own Weathered,

581
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,480
and this is the cover of Weathered.

582
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,080
This is this album 6 million people bought,

583
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,640
and this is the cover.

584
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
You can barely read the word weathered

585
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,720
with its pale spaced out font.

586
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,040
There's like an asymmetrical tree,

587
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,600
like it can't decide if it's all the way on the left

588
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,360
or in the middle,

589
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,680
and a man is chiseling the faces of the members into it,

590
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,400
but then it's just like the crappiest

591
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,680
Photoshop overlay you've ever-

592
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,160
Like, I don't-

593
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,160
If your younger cousin's band had this as the cover,

594
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,560
you'd find it hard to compliment,

595
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,480
like let alone the biggest band in America.

596
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
And what is the sun here?

597
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,520
The sun is like-

598
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,360
Sun's peeking out.

599
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,600
It's a blood orange.

600
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,440
Yeah.

601
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,280
Very strange.

602
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,080
It is some of the worst graphic design of all time.

603
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,680
I guess there's, it does kind of look like it's of its time,

604
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,800
but it looks like it's a bad version of it for its time too.

605
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,960
Yeah, there's better graphic design than this.

606
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
There's better awful graphic design

607
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,840
from the late 90s, early 2000s for sure.

608
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,200
I'd much rather look at any of the No Limit album covers.

609
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
I mean, that's bad graphic design,

610
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,280
but in the most delightful loopy way,

611
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,560
this is just-

612
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,520
It's so serious.

613
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,360
Yeah.

614
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
I look here, I have a, just real quick,

615
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,200
my, I didn't get a taste of music snobbishness until college.

616
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,320
So when Hire came out,

617
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,800
which sounds a lot like my sacrifice.

618
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,680
Yes.

619
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,360
Which do you think is better though?

620
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Cause I'm torn on this.

621
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,680
I know, I know I have an answer.

622
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
It's my sacrifice.

623
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Yeah, I think so.

624
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,280
And I also have, there's a reason,

625
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,920
there's also a special reason I feel like that as well.

626
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,240
But Hire came out and I was like, oh, okay.

627
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,160
And then I think it was like a couple of months,

628
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,680
and this is the same, my same relationship with Nickelback

629
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,040
when How You Remind Me came out,

630
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,600
where you're like, yeah, rock and roll man.

631
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
And then after a couple of months,

632
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,400
you're like, maybe this is bad, huh?

633
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,720
And then I was like, I don't know if I would've said

634
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
like it was bad, but then like a year or two later,

635
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I was probably like, this sucks.

636
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,080
But then my sacrifice came out and I was like,

637
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,680
I think Creed was already like, ah, Creed.

638
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,680
But then the WWE used my sacrifice

639
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,360
on one of the greatest promo packages of all time.

640
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,600
And then on top of that, my friend Luke edited

641
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,360
a highlight reel of our backyard wrestling set

642
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,200
to my sacrifice.

643
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
Ah!

644
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,120
Perfect.

645
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
Which I know I needed to have today, but I will produce it

646
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
and we will look at it.

647
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,040
Yeah, please do.

648
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,600
What age are you?

649
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,400
17, 16, 17, 18.

650
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,240
Were there graphic design,

651
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,800
was there graphic design or like filters along with it?

652
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah, whatever the video editing software of the day was.

653
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,280
Would it cut to like, now it looks,

654
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,200
now it's like black and white and all shaky sometimes?

655
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,800
I don't think like, maybe black and white for sure,

656
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
I think, unless I'm misremembering,

657
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,680
but whatever effect you could do, I think is in the video.

658
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,520
Wow.

659
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,720
Set to my sacrifice.

660
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,520
So I do have an affection for my sacrifice

661
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,000
that I don't for hire or Arms Wide Open or anything else.

662
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
And I never owned the albums,

663
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,000
but I won't act like I was always above it

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
because I liked a lot of normie garbage in high school.

665
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Well, and I think one of the reasons why this song

666
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,960
in particular, I need to contextualize this in its time

667
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,400
because my sacrifice, the single was released

668
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,920
in October of 2001.

669
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,600
So that's where we're at.

670
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
That's where everyone's head's at.

671
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
I feel like you're always contextualizing things

672
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,840
having to do with late 2001 for some reason.

673
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,680
This is true.

674
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,200
It's happened at least 10 times.

675
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,800
If a listener knows better,

676
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,120
how many times has Jason contextualized something

677
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
post 9-11?

678
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,920
I was like, by the way, guess when this one came out?

679
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,320
Yeah.

680
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, it did cause this to get swept up into the tide of,

681
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
this was not written about 9-11

682
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,600
and Ricky Iglesias hero was not written about 9-11,

683
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,560
but they got to be the YouTube song,

684
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,840
all the YouTube songs of that.

685
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,520
It all got swallowed by 9-11.

686
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,600
Oh yeah.

687
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,480
And I know there was some NFL promos with my sacrifice.

688
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,520
I'm sure there was some troop promos,

689
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,560
some troop commercials with my sacrifice.

690
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,400
So my sacrifice, I think mine is the only one

691
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,640
that has an MTV making the video about it.

692
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,880
So I learned a lot about my sacrifice.

693
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,040
For example, it was shot over the days of October 23rd

694
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,760
through October 25th, 2001.

695
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,760
And boy, they really use a lot of Universal Studios Florida.

696
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,840
And I wondered, how did they,

697
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,400
like one of the things about your guys' videos

698
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,400
is you can kind of tell that the sun is very high in the sky

699
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,440
as if they're like, all right,

700
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,560
let's try and wrap this up by 10 a.m.

701
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,800
Let's wrap up this filming by 10 a.m.

702
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,360
Kind of less so,

703
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,560
hard to tell with the Creed video itself,

704
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,720
but you can tell in the making the video

705
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,160
because they timestamp like, all right, it's like 1 p.m.

706
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,640
and I'm getting in a rowboat next to a tiger.

707
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,680
And I was wondering,

708
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,600
how did they shut down a large part of the park to do this?

709
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,120
And then I learned that it was filmed again, October 2001,

710
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,080
tourism way in the toilet in Orlando at the time,

711
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,960
probably got the location fee for a steal.

712
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,280
I believe Universal Music,

713
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,280
hard to tell Creed has a lot of music companies,

714
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,320
like annotate it in the notes for these videos.

715
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,880
Everybody wanted a piece of Creed.

716
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,720
Oh yeah.

717
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
We gotta get in on this.

718
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,520
This big rule. They were big business.

719
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,280
That's why it's so weird that cover is so bad.

720
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
Like they had the money.

721
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
And they'd already made,

722
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,280
this wasn't even their first album.

723
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,200
You could like,

724
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
if like if they didn't know they were gonna be so big

725
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
and they had a weird crappy cover,

726
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,880
but well, yeah, money was spent on this.

727
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Cover probably cost like a half a million dollars.

728
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,040
Yes. That was what I was about to say.

729
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,720
I would love to know how much they paid the graphic designer

730
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,480
and I bet we would faint.

731
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
Yeah.

732
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,160
I've looked through that making the video

733
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,160
and what you're saying about the time makes sense

734
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,240
because my takeaway from it was like,

735
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,520
God, this shoot seems miserable.

736
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,840
Just when you're, when you have to think,

737
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,280
like you're thinking about like blasting water and trash

738
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,200
in the face of this anonymous guitarist

739
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,360
and all the PAs who were sweating it

740
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,160
and being treated mean by everybody.

741
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,720
Well, and that's a strike against this,

742
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,560
but in my favor,

743
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,840
it seems like mine was a lot of fun for everyone involved.

744
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,200
Well, yours seems like a lot of fun,

745
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,280
but I mean, I wrote down a number of quotes from this,

746
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,680
making the video and probably the best is

747
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,160
when the guitarist, bass guitar,

748
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,080
I think he took over after the bassist left,

749
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,320
he also started playing bass guitar.

750
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,320
He says literally, videos so far have been pretty tedious.

751
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
And you know what?

752
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,640
That's a fair assessment of shooting anything.

753
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,840
But what are some other great quotes?

754
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,680
Creed videos aim to have more substance.

755
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,520
If you listen to the words,

756
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,520
it's like Scott is reuniting with himself,

757
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,280
Scott's staff, not Scott character.

758
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,320
But I'm sure Scott, you've had moments where you,

759
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,760
you imagine yourself an old man

760
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,320
and you zoom into your own CGI brain

761
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,600
and you can see a metaphorical representation

762
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,880
of a flooded town.

763
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,960
Right.

764
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,800
Absolutely.

765
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,680
When I look at my son, this is what happened.

766
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,240
My son who has my exact same eyes.

767
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,480
So if you did a zoom and then a zoom into me

768
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,240
and then out of him, it would be seamless.

769
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,360
And you gotta be careful,

770
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,880
cause your son could go blind,

771
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
but you could get your vision back as an old man,

772
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
which happens in this video.

773
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
Thank God there's hope.

774
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,920
And also, I mean, so many in this stressful year

775
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,160
of the pandemic and child rearing,

776
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,240
I've often felt as though I am drowning

777
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,040
and imagining if only I had a lifeboat

778
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
with which to pick up myself,

779
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,360
a second version of myself and save him.

780
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,840
Yes, as if you were reuniting with yourself.

781
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,600
And I mean, I'm burying the lead here.

782
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,840
The big set piece of this video

783
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,040
is they flooded the New York streets over by like Kong,

784
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,920
Kong mummy area.

785
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,520
And Scott's staff's in a rowboat.

786
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,960
The other two band members are playing guitar

787
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,360
and drums in waist deep water.

788
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,520
I will, actually here, I will,

789
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,320
can one of you, I texted you the video,

790
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,800
can one of you play it who records sound?

791
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,080
Yeah, I have them all pulled.

792
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,600
Would you like to go to a specific part or just?

793
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,080
Yeah, go, share the screen,

794
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,960
go to like two minutes, five seconds.

795
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,480
I think that's kind of the best representation.

796
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,320
I mean, it's nice to,

797
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,280
there's so much that's nice to see here.

798
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,200
There's a tiger, there's a baseball being thrown.

799
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,800
There's kids, you know, it's really.

800
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,280
Flying over a rowboat.

801
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,080
Digital baseball.

802
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,920
Digital sky.

803
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,120
Is this around where you want me to play?

804
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,000
Where was it again?

805
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
Yeah, yeah, this is good.

806
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Okay, American flag, just a game of stick ball,

807
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,680
but the streets are flooded.

808
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
There's a lot of powerful imagery here.

809
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,120
Okay, I'm gonna keep it a little quiet so it doesn't blast.

810
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,960
Oh yeah.

811
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,920
Because when you are with me

812
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,200
I'm afraid

813
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm careless

814
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,240
I believe

815
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,200
Okay, you can cut it, you can cut it.

816
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
That's enough, okay?

817
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,400
That's enough.

818
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
This one is successful enough.

819
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,400
I don't want to get DMC.

820
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,680
So you can see.

821
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,200
Oh sorry, go ahead, go ahead.

822
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,760
Well, you can see like Scott and the Rowboat,

823
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,840
you can see the other band members.

824
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,480
Playing instruments.

825
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,120
And it, yeah.

826
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,320
And it's good filmmaking impossible architecture

827
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,120
because Scott is clearly on the main drag

828
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,600
and the other guys. Scott.

829
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,160
Scott Stapp, yeah, is on the main drag.

830
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,880
And then the drummer and the guitarist,

831
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,000
there's a video on YouTube where a guy goes,

832
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,840
and I'll pull up the name in a second,

833
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,040
but a guy goes to the park.

834
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
It's the world of Micah.

835
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
He goes to the park and he goes like,

836
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,440
okay, so they would have been shooting here for Scott Stapp

837
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,840
and then the drummer was here across from the Irish store

838
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,960
and the guitarist was next to the Irish store

839
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,040
and you can see, because the plaque is,

840
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,920
the arcade movie theater plaque is still on the wall.

841
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,040
And that was pretty neat.

842
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,560
So, and then when you watch them making the video,

843
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,400
it's like, okay, they did this set up

844
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,040
and then they did this set up.

845
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,440
Then they broke the window at Mel's diner the next day.

846
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,240
This is a very complicated shoot.

847
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
Boy, the magic of the movies, huh?

848
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,040
Yeah.

849
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,680
Do we know how much this cost?

850
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,520
It seems very expensive.

851
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,200
I guess what, $10 million?

852
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,840
Something like that,

853
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,480
because that's a real tiger too.

854
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
They walk through dealing with the tiger.

855
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,160
In the water, the tiger is in the water?

856
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,480
The tiger is in the water.

857
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,880
They talk about how tigers like to swim.

858
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,720
What?

859
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,800
Oh, sure they do.

860
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,080
So says the tiger guy.

861
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,680
The shoot appeared to be momentarily delayed

862
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,680
because the tiger was not cooperating with the swimming.

863
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,040
The tiger got loose in ET.

864
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
Yeah.

865
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,600
So, but this is a big part of the park to take over

866
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,120
and fill with water, you know?

867
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,960
That is insane.

868
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,240
I mean, like, when I was looking at it,

869
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,560
I was actually trying to figure out

870
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,520
if some of it was digital effects with the wall.

871
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
I was looking at it, trying to figure out,

872
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,280
because it is incredibly impressive

873
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,440
that they would do something like that.

874
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280
Covers a lot of space.

875
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,120
That plane cut, you can see they go from the drummer

876
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,800
and then a tiny airplane flies by.

877
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,560
And this is like a episode, a prequel edit

878
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,160
where like the plane flies by and that cuts to,

879
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,600
that's right, a school bus full of candles,

880
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,040
wipes to candle bus.

881
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,640
School bus full of candles.

882
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,840
Candle bus, another big band of the time.

883
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,560
Candle bus.

884
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,640
Candle bus.

885
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,760
And this shot is funny because Scott Stapp's

886
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,600
in the very back singing, the guitarist is playing the guitar

887
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,240
and the drummer's just kind of twirling his stick

888
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
sitting on the bus.

889
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,360
That's a prod, that happened with Natural too.

890
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,800
What do you do when you're a drummer who can't,

891
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,440
where they won't bring the full drum kit to the set?

892
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,280
Yeah, you can like have a tambourine.

893
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,040
You can kind of have one of those like boxes,

894
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,760
one of those wooden boxes you hit.

895
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,200
Just kind of bang your hands on your knees, I guess.

896
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,040
It's awkward.

897
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,520
Poor drummers.

898
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,360
Poor guitarist who had to get pelted with garbage

899
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,560
in front of Mel's drive-in.

900
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,520
Yeah, he was not happy about that.

901
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,760
And again, we could probably do a whole episode

902
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,440
about this making the video episode

903
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,920
because it's just, I don't know, it's very funny.

904
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,720
The color aesthetic too feels very like

905
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,760
in the wake of the, not wake of the,

906
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,880
when the Matrix 99, first Matrix 99.

907
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,080
Yeah, yeah.

908
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,400
Still hanging on.

909
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,120
It does look like, I don't know if a Matrix starts

910
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,000
this like color aesthetic, this dreary thing.

911
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,880
But it's of its time.

912
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,040
Fake letterboxing, why this,

913
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,560
like this is only gonna be on four by three TV.

914
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,800
Why do we put the bars in?

915
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
Which again, you can only find it in the worst,

916
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,400
the lowest res, this $10 million video.

917
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,240
Yes.

918
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,160
And then there's a, oh, we mentioned the mailman earlier.

919
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,800
I mean, there's all sorts of people in the water.

920
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
There's a beautiful woman in the water,

921
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,760
kids from the old neighborhood,

922
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,840
bunch of monks, some lizard people.

923
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,600
Stan here.

924
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,440
Yeah, Stan.

925
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,200
There's still a bunch of Stans.

926
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,440
Many Stans.

927
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,520
The mailman, they make a point to point out like,

928
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,040
and then we thought like the mail, mail in the water,

929
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
cause even if the world floods, you know,

930
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,360
the mail will still go on.

931
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
And of course the America,

932
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,800
the American flags were already there.

933
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,080
And of course America standing tall.

934
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,920
You could tell Scott's that trying out like,

935
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,120
and of course, you know, we're all in this together,

936
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,040
America right now.

937
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,880
What's the story of the video?

938
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Has there been an apocalypse?

939
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,960
Is this a global warm?

940
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,880
Is this a flooding of a city?

941
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,400
Do they, do we even know?

942
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
Have terrorists attacked us with water?

943
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,160
I think they really go into like, you know,

944
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,920
Scott is very, he's had some troubles

945
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,480
and this is really, you know,

946
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,760
it's really him reuniting, finding himself again,

947
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
getting back on level.

948
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,440
So they don't know, they have no idea.

949
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,680
They kind of, they don't know.

950
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,360
But in terms of Bonafides,

951
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,360
the director, David Myers, would go on to direct

952
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,200
just an insane amount of music videos

953
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,960
and like big music videos.

954
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,680
Yeah, we all know C. Eliot's.

955
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,240
Yeah, Pass That Dutch, Bombs Over Baghdad,

956
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,440
more recently, Katy Perry's Firework

957
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,040
and Ariana Grande's Positions.

958
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,440
It's crazy.

959
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,240
Oh, the Sicko Mode music video,

960
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,080
which you know I love that Sicko Mode.

961
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,640
That's a very funny music video

962
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,080
because it starts with a bunch of shots

963
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,120
of children running in terror and like hiding in houses.

964
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,040
And then it cuts to a hard, hard cut to a shot of Drake.

965
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,000
And you know, I don't know,

966
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,680
maybe that was a wording, you know.

967
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,560
Oh, right.

968
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,880
Knowing what we know.

969
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,440
Yeah, you know, Dave Myers was a graduate

970
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,360
of my film school, Loyola Marymount,

971
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,080
and he came and spoke one time,

972
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,200
but he was only there for like 10 minutes.

973
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
And I swear he like walked on stage,

974
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,280
finishing up a cell phone call,

975
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,880
then got to the mic and like,

976
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,640
yeah, sorry, I can't stay for long

977
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,560
because I'm doing a bust of video in the morning.

978
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,760
So I just gonna take like three questions, okay.

979
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,400
And then like, okay, I gotta go.

980
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,880
And then immediately got back on the phone and walked away.

981
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,120
But when you, if you look at, I mean, this wasn't 2001,

982
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
but like in 2001, he seems to have directed

983
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,360
like 70 music videos and you've heard of all of them.

984
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,440
So I guess it adds up that he was so busy.

985
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,920
I wish he had more time for questions

986
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,880
so you could have asked him what was the meaning of this.

987
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,360
What was it like to flood the iconic New York sets

988
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,000
of Universal Orlando?

989
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,200
This music video would be great for like an eighth grade

990
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,080
or ninth grade English class to go like,

991
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,480
all right, let's talk about symbolism.

992
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,360
Let's talk about metaphors, right?

993
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,600
So the old man was Scott Stapp

994
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,760
and the young boy was also Scott, okay.

995
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,800
And don't know what the fish lizard people represent.

996
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,560
The song itself is about Jesus, right?

997
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,920
My sacrifice.

998
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,160
You should be able to interpret this

999
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,360
because you had more religious schooling than we did.

1000
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,800
Religious, yeah.

1001
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,480
When you were with me, I'm free.

1002
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah, is it about, is this Jesus's feelings

1003
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,560
about Mary Magdalene?

1004
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,280
Okay, that seems like it could be right.

1005
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,160
Could be, or it's the sacrifice of today's Christ,

1006
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,200
Scott Stapp.

1007
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,360
That's sort of a funny thing about him

1008
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,680
is the Jesus-y nature of him and his hair

1009
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,080
that was off putting.

1010
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,880
Creed pushed back against the Christian rock

1011
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,880
labeled more than say POD, payable on death.

1012
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,960
They were a little more obvious.

1013
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,320
Mm-hmm, yeah, they were, yeah, they were a Christian rock.

1014
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,640
I remember, I mean, this, my sacrifice,

1015
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,520
this is very Jesus-y.

1016
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,040
So I don't know if they were just trying to like

1017
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,080
make sure people didn't like pigeonhole them.

1018
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,880
Yeah, and I mean, if you have a metal bracelet

1019
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,320
like he's wearing, you probably got some thoughts

1020
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,120
on Jesus in 2001, you know?

1021
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,960
Mm-hmm.

1022
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,080
We just got to, oh, no, go ahead, Mike.

1023
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,640
I'm trying to think, wasn't there like a voltage

1024
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,240
I'm trying to think, wasn't there like a vertical

1025
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,600
Ryzen song called You're a God?

1026
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,440
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,680
I'm not sure.

1028
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,800
Yes, the answer is yes.

1029
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,640
I guess if you felt it.

1030
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,720
You're a God and I am God

1031
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,960
and I just want to let you know, I believe.

1032
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,760
I think my parents would have found that pretty sacrilegious.

1033
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,920
Yeah, so they don't like Kanye's I am a God from Yeezus,

1034
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,760
I bet.

1035
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,920
I wouldn't imagine, probably just Yeezus would be too,

1036
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,480
like he, he thought of a name for himself

1037
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,320
that rhymes with Jesus, very disrespectful.

1038
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Mm, that's a good point.

1039
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,440
But then they'd like his political leanings.

1040
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,280
Yeah.

1041
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,640
Let's just watch without sound the end of this scenario.

1042
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,240
Well, we see, we've alluded to it a little bit,

1043
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,760
but that like he, yeah, we saw an old man at the beginning

1044
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,040
and then Scott survives the onslaught of trash

1045
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,440
at Mel's drive-in and then hugs an overhauled boy

1046
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,080
who turns to us and his eyes glow white.

1047
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,080
Like, is he the devil?

1048
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,960
No, wait, that indicates that he's blind

1049
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,760
and then Scott's to have morphs, he grows a digital beard

1050
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,760
and turns into the old man at the beginning.

1051
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,440
The old man from the beginning.

1052
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,920
Moses, he turns into Moses.

1053
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,760
Moses, but we'll pay attention, this classic end,

1054
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,160
he's got a leather duster on, also Matrix,

1055
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,720
CGI pigeon coming right at you.

1056
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,160
The religion from the John Woo of the day.

1057
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,440
The John Woo move of the day.

1058
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,600
This is our second big trench coat appearance

1059
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,240
in one of the, I mean, when you get two music videos

1060
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,800
from 2001, you end up with big black trench coats.

1061
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,360
Trench coat Moses.

1062
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,200
Trench coat Moses.

1063
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,480
Another band I loved at the time.

1064
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,680
Yeah.

1065
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,960
I got the lyrics to, I got the lyrics wrong, by the way,

1066
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,600
to Vertical Horizons, You're a God, I apologize.

1067
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,520
It's You're a God and I am not.

1068
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,200
Okay.

1069
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,080
So my parents are a little more on board then,

1070
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,720
so they like Vertical Horizons.

1071
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,920
So we think maybe this thing gets points

1072
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,360
because it is a very creative use of the backlight.

1073
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,040
It really takes it over more.

1074
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,720
You're not just looking at empty backlight streets.

1075
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,800
We've populated it with monks and sheds and flooded it.

1076
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,560
I mean, this is a very ambitious use of the hallowed area

1077
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,400
in front of confrontation.

1078
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,040
And they're using, they shoot at Mel's diner,

1079
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,080
they shoot outside of that,

1080
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,000
they shoot under the pavilion next to Mel's diner.

1081
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,640
This is like three day, four day shoot, 12 hour date.

1082
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,480
Like they were there all day.

1083
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,400
And like, I'm assuming the park was open.

1084
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm assuming they were just working around it.

1085
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,840
We should also say that this is the, according to Wikipedia,

1086
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,240
this was the first video over which Creed

1087
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,680
had complete creative control.

1088
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,520
Yes, thank you.

1089
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,560
I forgot to mention that.

1090
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,920
I had that note.

1091
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,880
So all of these metaphor and the,

1092
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,240
and Stapp morphing into trench coat Moses,

1093
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
every bit of it Stapp's idea.

1094
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
Yeah, it is, look, there's a lot,

1095
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,760
there is a lot to like about this video.

1096
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,720
There certainly is.

1097
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,960
And I have some affection for the song as well.

1098
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,600
So I'm not trying to put this down.

1099
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,160
It's coming in pretty hot.

1100
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,960
And I think we're moving on to the next one,

1101
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,560
but I can't allow Creed to come up

1102
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,520
without bringing up one of my favorite things in the world.

1103
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,360
Well, there's two things and I won't show the clip,

1104
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,440
but this was going around Twitter recently.

1105
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,960
And it was nice to say I had a vague memory of it.

1106
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,760
But I don't know if you guys saw this going around,

1107
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,760
that they played at some football halftime show

1108
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,600
where they did hire and then right on hire.

1109
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,360
He's, first of all, he's in a football jersey

1110
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,680
that says Stapp.

1111
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,000
And then right as the chorus kicks in,

1112
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,040
like a shirtless Adonis with a big drape on him,

1113
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,240
like flies up into the air,

1114
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,120
much like what we saw at the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1115
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,960
Maybe you do just need to see a quick taste of this.

1116
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,880
Hang on. Yeah, please.

1117
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,040
This is so great.

1118
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,440
Two great correlations of Creed and sports.

1119
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,040
Let me get to this.

1120
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,480
But there's a ton of like bright red,

1121
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,160
unitarded dancers. Devils?

1122
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,840
Yeah, where maybe they're being fought.

1123
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,000
They're fighting off the temptations of these she devils.

1124
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,120
And then, and forgive the bad quality,

1125
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,080
but let's see if we can get it here.

1126
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,480
["She Devils"]

1127
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,200
So we got shirtless acrobat.

1128
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,480
Wait, but let me get to the chorus

1129
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,080
because it's the takeoff that's the funniest thing.

1130
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,920
Oh wait, that was my sacrifice, wasn't it?

1131
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah, yeah. That was my sacrifice.

1132
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,560
Also, it should be pointed out, Scott Stapp is like,

1133
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,200
he's not in like Jersey and cool rock pit.

1134
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,200
He looks like he's in like business casual Friday

1135
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,120
and it's Jersey Day,

1136
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,120
so you can wear your team's jersey in the office.

1137
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,000
It's not fitted. Yeah, it's a bizarre size.

1138
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,040
Meant to be worn at home on the couch only.

1139
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,600
All right, here's the takeoff.

1140
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,160
["She Devils"]

1141
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,000
Whoa!

1142
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,240
["She Devils"]

1143
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,240
Old shirtless drape flyer.

1144
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,160
They're really getting air too.

1145
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,160
He spins around to readjust the drapes.

1146
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,120
I mean, this is inspiring stuff.

1147
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,040
Wow, he's like a ribbon, not a ribbon dancer,

1148
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,880
but like what do you call those?

1149
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,000
The ribbon answering is like, yeah,

1150
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,560
but the people that like get tangled up

1151
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,000
in the long piece of cloth that hangs from the ceiling.

1152
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,840
Yeah, yeah.

1153
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,400
The drape acrobat, Imhotep lives, that's what I'll say.

1154
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,360
It's very Imhotep-y, yes.

1155
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,600
He's very, yeah.

1156
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,800
The other one, and do you guys both know this offhand

1157
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,760
and I don't know, is this the most obvious thing

1158
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,440
I'm bringing up or do people not know this?

1159
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,360
The song that Scott Stapp, an Orlando native by the way,

1160
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,400
did for his beloved sports team, the Florida Marlins.

1161
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,640
Oh, I don't think I know this.

1162
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,200
Oh, sweet, okay.

1163
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,960
This is so good.

1164
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
This is an unbelievable song.

1165
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,400
He just voluntarily made a song for the Florida Marlins,

1166
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,400
the baseball team, and the lyrics are pretty baseball forward.

1167
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,560
I'll just let it speak for itself.

1168
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,240
["She Devils"]

1169
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,240
Let's play ball, it's game day

1170
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,240
We want strikeouts, base hits, double plays

1171
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,240
Take the field, hear the roar of the crowd

1172
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,240
Come on Marlins, make your frown

1173
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Come on Marlins, make your frown

1174
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,240
Keep hoping and dreaming and you will soar

1175
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,360
The song is called Marlins Will Soar,

1176
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,360
which itself to say that a fish will soar.

1177
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,560
And then also, like a lot of sports,

1178
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,600
you could talk about flying.

1179
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,640
You could talk about Michael Jordan's soaring,

1180
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,120
but baseball, I don't really think of soaring

1181
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,920
as part of the activities.

1182
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,200
The ball soars.

1183
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,040
Yeah.

1184
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,360
Yes, that counts, sure, sure.

1185
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,480
The Marlins keep hoping and dreaming the ball will soar.

1186
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,840
Just a quick head of the second verse too,

1187
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,320
which is where like I'm, all right,

1188
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm wavering a little.

1189
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,600
The fact that they use a baseball hit

1190
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,760
as a percussive element, but then here is,

1191
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,160
here's the zone where I started thinking perhaps

1192
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,840
Marlins Will Soar is the worst song ever made.

1193
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,080
A perfect game, a triple play,

1194
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,240
another play of rage, yes.

1195
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,880
Well, series champs will

1196
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,720
bang!

1197
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,480
Keep hoping and dreaming and

1198
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Series champs!

1199
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,320
Chimps!

1200
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,360
Chimps!

1201
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,720
Just the ultra serious, like I'd say

1202
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,560
the biggest baseball song up until this point

1203
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,160
has been Take Me Out to the Ball Game,

1204
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,800
which is a pretty good natured song.

1205
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,240
So now to hear such a humorless triple play.

1206
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,960
I like that he's trying to get as many baseball things,

1207
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,320
like terms in there as possible.

1208
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,880
Triple double,

1209
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,400
ground rule double.

1210
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Bounces off the outfield into the stands.

1211
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,880
We'll pause the game if there is rain.

1212
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,840
Extra innings we will queue.

1213
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,080
I, what a song.

1214
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,320
I just couldn't let this moment pass.

1215
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,800
Wow, I did not know, thank you.

1216
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,960
Yeah, I did not know that.

1217
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,080
That one's pretty good.

1218
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,880
Marlins Will Soar, I need to listen to Marlins Will Soar

1219
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,560
every six months at least.

1220
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,040
Sure, do you think there are other members of Creed

1221
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,000
who famously when Creed broke up

1222
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,120
and then they've gotten back together once or twice,

1223
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,240
but like, Stapp did solo records

1224
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,120
but the other members of Creed formed a band

1225
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,560
with another guy called Altered Bridge?

1226
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,720
Alter Bridge.

1227
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,080
Alter Bridge?

1228
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,400
Alter Bridge.

1229
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,640
See, I didn't sound right in my head.

1230
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,760
Okay, Alter Bridge.

1231
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,680
Alter, like at the altar.

1232
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,040
Okay, here we go now.

1233
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,360
Wait, but I would also buy a band at this time

1234
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,320
being called Altered Bridge.

1235
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,880
I mean, that's stupid.

1236
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,000
I know Alter Bridge so well.

1237
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,840
Well, sure.

1238
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,080
And why I jumped in.

1239
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,920
But do you think they were-

1240
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,840
I don't know if it's spelled Alter though.

1241
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,240
It might be spelled,

1242
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,360
Alter is spelled, the religious one is with a two A's, right?

1243
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,280
It is Alter Bridge, but I would certainly buy,

1244
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,280
of course, their album,

1245
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,200
their album, Walk the Sky just came out.

1246
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Oh, we've all been jamming on Walk the Sky all year.

1247
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,560
Yeah.

1248
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,680
Do you think they were all on their Alter Bridge bus

1249
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,720
and were like, did you hear Stapp's Marlin song?

1250
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,240
We fucked up.

1251
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,200
We blew it.

1252
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,440
He's putting out gold for baseball teams.

1253
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,600
What are we doing?

1254
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,280
I think that's, yeah, that happened.

1255
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,120
Yeah.

1256
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,160
Stapp is gonna help those guys ride all the way

1257
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,000
to the World Series title.

1258
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,720
And who are we helping?

1259
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,840
God.

1260
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,280
I guess that, yeah.

1261
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,560
Well, even if they do win, really it was God's doing.

1262
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,000
So Scott didn't do shit.

1263
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,960
Hey, the Marlins did win World Series in 97 in 2003.

1264
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,000
So I don't know if it was buoyed by that Scott Stapp song

1265
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,840
or if it came later,

1266
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,680
he's trying to get him back in contention.

1267
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,120
I don't know when he did Marlins will sort.

1268
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,440
I think 2010, 11.

1269
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,800
So do they play it also?

1270
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,040
Like, do they use it at the games?

1271
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,600
That's a good question.

1272
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,440
Did he do it on spec?

1273
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,960
That's my guess for some reason.

1274
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,040
That's based on nothing.

1275
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,360
Maybe they paid him a handsome amount.

1276
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,800
Do they no longer play Take Me Out to the Ball Game?

1277
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,720
They fired the organist.

1278
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,920
Don't need you anymore.

1279
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,120
And Scott plays it from the booth every single game.

1280
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,520
Here we go, everyone.

1281
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,360
Sing along.

1282
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,640
There's like some Eddie Vedder baseball song too, right?

1283
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,400
And Eddie Vedder, I know Scott Stapp got compared

1284
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,480
to Eddie Vedder a lot with the voice.

1285
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,800
Which I haven't, no offense to anyone who likes them.

1286
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,160
I've never really understood.

1287
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,520
I don't really like Pearl Jam or Eddie Vedder.

1288
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,720
Just not my thing.

1289
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,640
So imagine me with, if I don't like the real deal,

1290
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
then like imagine me hearing,

1291
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,760
Dab a dog a loo.

1292
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,600
Yikes.

1293
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,200
I'm trying to think.

1294
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,880
Oh yeah, all the way he did a Cubs tribute.

1295
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, really?

1296
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,360
Did that give him the idea?

1297
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,640
Did he steal this idea?

1298
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,000
That's what I'm wondering if Scott Stapp stole his voice

1299
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,960
from Eddie Vedder and then stole the baseball song idea

1300
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,800
from him.

1301
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,480
It's possible.

1302
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,120
Ah, someone needs to look into this.

1303
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,160
We're gonna investigate this.

1304
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,040
Giuliani's on it.

1305
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,880
Yeah.

1306
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,640
All right, well, if that closes out the Creed chapter,

1307
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,920
then that brings us to number three.

1308
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,520
And what can I say?

1309
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,040
This is, it's coming in heavy, it's coming in hot.

1310
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,520
It's the one to beat, certainly.

1311
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,800
Yes, okay.

1312
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,160
So most people probably know this already.

1313
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,360
With all the teases, but this last one is the video

1314
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,280
for the song by Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

1315
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,000
And the song is called Fruit Cakes.

1316
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,200
And I think I've said on the show before,

1317
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,560
maybe I've said it in real life,

1318
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,720
I kind of feel like Fruit Cakes is the perfect encapsulation

1319
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,960
of Jimmy Buffett.

1320
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,200
It's kind of his best song.

1321
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,160
People say Margaritaville is his best song,

1322
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,720
and I get it, because it's the catchiest one,

1323
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,960
and most people know it.

1324
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,600
But Fruit Cakes, I feel like you get the whole picture

1325
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,480
of the man's philosophy, his unified philosophy

1326
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,640
about everything.

1327
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,960
Musically, it's all in there.

1328
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,840
It's the conga, not conga, it's the steel drums.

1329
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,480
It's the calypso rhythms.

1330
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,600
It's the very like, kind of like,

1331
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,240
it kind of limps around for eight minutes.

1332
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,040
It's like energetic, kind of, but not so energetic.

1333
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,920
You wouldn't call it rockin', you wouldn't call it a jam.

1334
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,680
Yeah, but he talks things in it a lot,

1335
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,480
so you get his voice.

1336
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,000
You get like a little hint of like his banter at concerts.

1337
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,440
It's like you kind of can just listen to this song,

1338
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,120
and you know all you need to know about him.

1339
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,480
As a person, as a businessman, as a philosopher king,

1340
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,440
all of it is in Jimmy Buffett's Fruit Cakes.

1341
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,600
It's a long song, it's like eight minutes.

1342
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,640
This one was, I think, the biggest culture shock to me

1343
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,400
as you were acquainting me with the Buffett body of work,

1344
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
the rabbit hole that you had gone down.

1345
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,760
Being that it is a 90s one, it's like 93 or 94.

1346
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,280
Yes, I think he's like 49 here.

1347
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,240
Okay, okay.

1348
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,960
It's shot in 94, came out in 94.

1349
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,040
Cause, you know, my Buffett awareness

1350
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,720
is pretty like on the sidelines, right?

1351
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,840
Like I guess I knew there was this guy,

1352
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,280
and he sort of has his roots

1353
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,240
in kind of legit eagle style country rock,

1354
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,360
and then got sort of goofy,

1355
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,960
and everybody wears bright colors to his concerts.

1356
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,560
But I don't think I knew the vibe of the music

1357
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,480
he was continuing to make for so many years.

1358
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,600
And yeah, this one does encapsulate it.

1359
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,600
It is like tropical, but also not genuinely the genre.

1360
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,200
Yeah, it's like fake, it's all a little fake.

1361
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,920
It's like fake music, kind of.

1362
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,520
The way that, you know, like guys of his era and age

1363
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,000
would still put out albums, and like Marin would go,

1364
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,920
man, that guy can play, you know, that, yeah, god.

1365
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,800
He's the hell of a player.

1366
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,800
No one says that about anything on Buffett's album.

1367
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,640
There's no like outstanding musicianship,

1368
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,840
I wouldn't say anywhere.

1369
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,280
No, there's great, there's a guy who's played in his band

1370
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,520
for a long time, Mack McAnally, who has own songwriter,

1371
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,240
who I do think is a really good musician.

1372
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,200
I think a lot, there are really good musicians,

1373
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,000
but Jimmy Buffett never calls upon them to do anything

1374
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,480
to really showcase their actual chops as far as musicians.

1375
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,840
I'm sure there's a couple examples people would cite,

1376
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,240
but in general, it's much more about the lyrics,

1377
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,640
it's about the vibe, it's about the lifestyle.

1378
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,480
Yes, Jason.

1379
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,840
Well, when we saw him live though,

1380
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,760
when Jimmy wanted to take a break, he had a glass of wine,

1381
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,920
he let Mack on stage, and Mack played

1382
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,440
some very impressive music.

1383
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,480
Mack did a lot of, yeah, Jimmy had like a five minute break,

1384
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,960
and he's like, all right, Mack, you go do whatever you want.

1385
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,720
Like Mack played a very impressive little piece

1386
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,540
where he like showed off that he knows his scales real well,

1387
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,620
and that diminishes it,

1388
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,900
but it was a very impressive like guitar piece.

1389
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,020
Mack wrote Back Where I Come From,

1390
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,100
which was a big hit country song.

1391
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,940
Yeah.

1392
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,740
Jason loves Back Where I Come From.

1393
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,420
I do like it, but they, you know what they would do

1394
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,660
when they play it at the concerts,

1395
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,180
they have a video package that's different in every city,

1396
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,620
and I don't know, some of the ones in some parts

1397
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,020
of the country, there's some imagery that you're like,

1398
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,260
oh, I don't know if you wanna put that flag up there.

1399
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

1400
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,700
What was it in the LA one?

1401
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,300
Was it like a picture of like Spielberg making ET?

1402
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,860
Hollywood.

1403
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,860
We went to, I wanna just real fill the listener in,

1404
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,460
we went to a Jimmy Buffa concert,

1405
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,500
is it five years ago already?

1406
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,180
Yeah. Yes.

1407
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,660
With a couple, Weiger was there, Nick Weiger was there.

1408
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,260
Stone face sitting, staring intently ahead,

1409
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,020
no smile on his face the entire time.

1410
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,900
I think he was watching it very seriously

1411
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
to where you're thinking, is he enjoying this at all?

1412
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,740
And then at the end of the night,

1413
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,780
he's like, this is the best night of my life.

1414
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,660
Yeah, I think I slid over and I was like,

1415
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,500
hey, you enjoying this?

1416
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
Yeah, best night of my fucking life.

1417
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,500
Anthony Gio also at this concert as well.

1418
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Yeah.

1419
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,500
Who should become a better, a more frequent guest?

1420
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,940
A better guest, I'm calling him on to be better.

1421
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:46,780
Oh.

1422
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:48,860
He's done a bad job.

1423
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,540
A better man.

1424
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,860
A better man like Pearl Jam.

1425
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,500
You know that song?

1426
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,820
You know that song.

1427
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,660
Can't find a better man.

1428
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,860
I'm singing a lot today.

1429
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,580
Can't find a better man.

1430
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,860
Now do it as Buffa.

1431
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,500
Can't find a better man.

1432
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,380
He toxin's it.

1433
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,180
Yeah, so we went to the concert and I thought it was funny.

1434
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,220
I don't remember those video packages,

1435
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,260
but I did think it was funny

1436
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,980
because he would say stuff like,

1437
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,580
for no reason during the concert,

1438
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,460
he would be playing one of his regular songs

1439
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,940
and then he would just yell like,

1440
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,380
In-N-Out Burger.

1441
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,060
He would shout references to Los Angeles

1442
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,700
that didn't really see,

1443
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,820
maybe he said that in Cheeseburger Paradise,

1444
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,060
that which would make sense,

1445
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,460
but I swear he would be like,

1446
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,180
he would do like a Brody Stevens,

1447
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,820
like 405 Freeway.

1448
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,700
Supreme store.

1449
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,540
Yeah.

1450
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,820
So I enjoyed that a lot.

1451
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,300
Shitty mayor.

1452
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,420
Bad mayor.

1453
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,020
Confusing.

1454
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,500
Crossroads of the world.

1455
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,580
What is that little strip ball?

1456
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,900
Can't decide what you,

1457
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,820
there's no genuine attractions.

1458
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,220
UCB Franklin.

1459
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,940
Asscat, Matt Besser.

1460
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,820
Unbuilt target.

1461
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,340
Everyone nodded.

1462
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,940
We all melted down for that.

1463
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,380
So I don't know,

1464
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,540
I've lost my train of thought already.

1465
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,380
I'm in Buffett.

1466
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,220
Talking about the concert.

1467
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,060
I mean that.

1468
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,380
But now he didn't play Fruit Cakes,

1469
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,220
I believe.

1470
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,180
Did not do Fruit Cakes and did not do,

1471
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,700
and Lindsay pointed this out to me not long ago.

1472
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,060
The last concert we saw was Jimmy Buffett

1473
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,420
before this all went to hell.

1474
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,260
Perfect.

1475
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,860
We went to see him in Anaheim

1476
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,820
and I had a really good time at the Hollywood Bowl.

1477
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,660
I had a great time in Anaheim seeing him.

1478
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,460
And Lindsay who is very much more like,

1479
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,780
oh God,

1480
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,620
has still,

1481
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,460
had to give it up like,

1482
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,820
yeah this is fun.

1483
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,020
We're having a fun time.

1484
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,260
Well you guys ended up on the Jumbotron.

1485
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,540
Yes we did.

1486
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,380
And there's footage,

1487
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,740
there's viewable footage of that.

1488
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:00,580
Yes.

1489
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,700
And yeah, Lindsay's very genuinely into it.

1490
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,540
Yeah.

1491
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,860
There's documented proof.

1492
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,940
So,

1493
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,780
right,

1494
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,600
so yeah,

1495
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,440
and he did not do Fruit Cakes there,

1496
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,280
which I obviously,

1497
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,100
that's what I wanted him to play.

1498
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,500
I also want,

1499
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,340
I have yet to,

1500
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,420
I've only seen him a couple times at this point,

1501
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,100
but there's songs I want him to play,

1502
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,020
I wish lunch would last forever.

1503
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,900
And of course the song Math Sucks.

1504
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,740
This is the song I want him to play more than anything.

1505
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,500
But Math Sucks certainly has his like,

1506
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,320
lazy wisdom in it as well.

1507
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,140
But Fruit Cakes has a more wide range picture

1508
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,980
about the top,

1509
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,480
his philosophy on different topics.

1510
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,500
Not just math.

1511
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,020
Not just lunch lasting forever.

1512
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,160
Explain the thesis of the song Fruit Cakes.

1513
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,440
If I had to sum it up,

1514
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,120
now I believe he's using the term Fruit Cakes to mean crazy,

1515
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:51,960
silly,

1516
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,480
like unusual person.

1517
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,840
I don't think he's using it in the term,

1518
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,040
like as a slur against gay people.

1519
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,880
Oh, no, no,

1520
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,120
I don't take it like that at all.

1521
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:00,960
Yeah.

1522
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,780
But I mean,

1523
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,620
I think you could ensure that's what some people

1524
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,120
would use that.

1525
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,680
So he's using Fruit Cakes as a term,

1526
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,880
I think to say.

1527
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,080
And also not as a mentally ill slam,

1528
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,240
but rather a,

1529
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,520
to summarize the people who just have a screw loose

1530
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
and we love them for it.

1531
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,360
Right.

1532
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,280
And we're all Fruit Cakes is what,

1533
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,360
also what he's saying too.

1534
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,040
There's a little bit of Fruit Cake in every one of us,

1535
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,860
he says,

1536
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,000
like we're all a little crazy.

1537
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,480
But if I had to sum it up,

1538
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,800
I would say,

1539
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,400
everything's crazy.

1540
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,840
We're all crazy,

1541
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,200
would be the sum up of it.

1542
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,160
We're all crazy.

1543
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,600
Life's crazy.

1544
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,440
We're just,

1545
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,280
you know, there's problems,

1546
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,760
but we're just all on the ride.

1547
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,640
This crazy journey called life.

1548
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,400
Maybe it's just like buckle up.

1549
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,560
Buckle up.

1550
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,400
Street,

1551
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,560
street preachers,

1552
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,480
your create your coworker who believes

1553
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,280
in conspiracy theories.

1554
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,440
We're all in it together.

1555
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,280
Well,

1556
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,280
he has done Fruit Cakes with updated lyrics

1557
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,460
in the last decade,

1558
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,720
but not recently.

1559
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,040
Cause I always,

1560
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,880
I was looking.

1561
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,720
Like,

1562
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,540
QAnon.

1563
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,780
Stephen Miller.

1564
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,760
Stephen Miller is just a Fruit Cake.

1565
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,920
Audit the vote.

1566
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,720
It's the lefty and you.

1567
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,200
It's the Q and me.

1568
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,040
It's the centrist in him.

1569
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,720
Maybe he needs to update this.

1570
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,000
Maybe an updated Fruit Cakes is what it will take

1571
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,480
to unite this divided nation.

1572
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,880
I will say,

1573
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,920
to Buffett's credit,

1574
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,780
he is not a Trump guy.

1575
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,880
Unlike your beloved Mike Love.

1576
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,000
Well, my beloved,

1577
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,080
there's some levels to the belovedness.

1578
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,000
Okay, fair enough.

1579
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,840
Fair enough.

1580
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,780
You know, it'll get more genuine when I'm in the band,

1581
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,620
you know,

1582
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,600
when I'm talking to him on the daily

1583
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,000
and complimenting him.

1584
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,960
Boy, you really nailed this top of be true

1585
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,800
to your school tonight, Mike.

1586
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,640
And he just like kind of goes,

1587
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,160
oh, thank you.

1588
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,840
Cause he's 90 years old and you know,

1589
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,400
still a good vibrations.

1590
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,240
Still, you know,

1591
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,000
started in harmonizing with my brothers

1592
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,240
and still doing it.

1593
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,400
Anytime he talks to anybody,

1594
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,520
he tells that story.

1595
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,360
He hasn't had a new story since 1969.

1596
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,600
So look,

1597
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,840
I could talk about that stuff forever.

1598
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,360
We're here to talk about the video.

1599
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,200
And we are.

1600
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,480
Well, you know what might be worth,

1601
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,680
and this might dovetail into the video,

1602
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,180
but when you talk about how he's updated it

1603
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,760
for modern times,

1604
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,160
the reason that's important is that this song

1605
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,640
has these stretches that feel very topic,

1606
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,440
like especially the zone about going to LA

1607
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,120
or being out in California.

1608
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,960
That's really the part that feels like,

1609
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,600
this is like the 94 perspective

1610
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,040
because everything was going mad in LA.

1611
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,640
There's earthquakes and there's Menendez's

1612
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,480
and OJ's and riots.

1613
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,000
And so there's this odd verse

1614
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,200
that says all that stuff.

1615
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,040
Right.

1616
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,880
And you know,

1617
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,680
feel free to play the man himself.

1618
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,600
Yeah, let me just,

1619
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,120
and we don't have to play the whole thing

1620
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,040
because this is the full fruitcake song,

1621
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,560
as I said, like eight minutes or seven minutes

1622
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,480
or something.

1623
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,760
This is obviously shorter,

1624
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,840
but I'm gonna just give like,

1625
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,760
play a little of this start,

1626
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,400
just so you know while we're talking

1627
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,520
what the vibe is in case you don't know the song.

1628
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,400
So here he's-

1629
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,240
In case.

1630
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,200
In case, yeah.

1631
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,040
Yeah.

1632
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,860
["In Case"]

1633
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,880
You know, I was talking to my friend, Des Demolter.

1634
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,040
The other day she runs the space station

1635
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,440
and bake shop down near Boone Town.

1636
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,280
She told me that human beings are flawed individuals.

1637
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,720
But the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven

1638
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,160
a little too early.

1639
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,840
And that's the reason we're as crazy as we are.

1640
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,960
And I believe it.

1641
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,700
["In Case"]

1642
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,120
Fruitcakes in the kitchen.

1643
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,440
All right, so that's, yeah,

1644
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,680
that gives you an idea sort of,

1645
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,120
is talk singing or talking really.

1646
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,920
And then a little bit of the musical vibe there.

1647
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,200
You can get anything you wanted, Alice's Restaurant.

1648
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,080
Yeah, so it's a very, you know,

1649
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,920
it's homespun wisdom, some philosophy.

1650
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,760
The line there, you know,

1651
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,880
I was talking to my friend Des Demona.

1652
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,640
Which is like a person he references

1653
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,960
in other songs as well.

1654
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,860
She's in the, Des Demona is in the Buffett verse.

1655
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,360
There is a Buffett verse that contains

1656
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,360
from characters from his books, like Tully Mars.

1657
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,620
Who's also in the Escape to Margaritaville musical.

1658
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:38,880
Which.

1659
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,520
Which was one of the other last things we did.

1660
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,400
That's the very last thing we did.

1661
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,240
The very last thing we did.

1662
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,640
We went to Escape to Margaritaville.

1663
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,760
It's crazy we haven't actually done a full episode.

1664
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,100
We went with Eva too.

1665
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,400
Yeah.

1666
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,560
So that is kind of got,

1667
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,920
I think because of the craziness of that time,

1668
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,140
we neglected to talk about it,

1669
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,980
but we saw it.

1670
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,860
The biggest tragedy of the era.

1671
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,380
So yeah, so anyway, there's so much,

1672
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,940
I can be derailed very easily during this.

1673
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,780
So.

1674
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:16,780
Well, I kind of want to hear the LA or the California.

1675
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,620
Yeah, let's go to that.

1676
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,740
And that is, hold on.

1677
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,620
Paradise.

1678
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,020
The hair is really something.

1679
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,380
So yeah, let's say, let's set up a little bit of a look.

1680
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,780
So Jimmy has on his like his white sport coat,

1681
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,460
which is a reference I think to,

1682
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,700
well, it's a sport coat pink,

1683
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,380
white sport coat pink crustacean, which is an album.

1684
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,340
So he's wearing white pants.

1685
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,180
God.

1686
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,580
White sport coat pink crustacean.

1687
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,860
You've not heard of that one, Scott?

1688
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,280
No, no.

1689
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,260
He put the white.

1690
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,380
How many albums does he have?

1691
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,860
150.

1692
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:56,860
He just released a new one this year.

1693
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,740
Yes.

1694
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,140
Songs you don't know by heart.

1695
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:00,980
Okay.

1696
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:01,980
Well, actually that's a,

1697
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,860
he's released like a couple of compilations.

1698
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,060
He's released a full new album though, this year,

1699
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,720
which has a song on it called Cussin Island,

1700
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,300
which is maybe my favorite of all the new ones.

1701
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
But the first song was down at the La-Di-Da,

1702
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,260
which is about drinking a margarita

1703
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,880
at a bar near the water.

1704
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,060
Yeah.

1705
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,260
You guys have covered that already?

1706
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,340
He had a few more.

1707
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,860
It's a different bar, Scott.

1708
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,980
This bar is called the La-Di-Da.

1709
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,580
It's a different, it's a new bar he made up

1710
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,540
in the Buffett verse.

1711
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,660
I can respect that.

1712
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,580
I think we were talking about that with Eva

1713
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,340
around the time of the musical.

1714
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:38,460
And she was like, yes, we're all kind of like, it's okay.

1715
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,140
And she's like, it feels like Margaritaville

1716
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,980
without any teeth.

1717
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,100
I believe it's our salvation.

1718
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,180
It looks like.

1719
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,300
I really should have the marker down

1720
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,940
for where the California.

1721
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:50,780
It's before this, right?

1722
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,300
Yeah, cause yeah, you're in religion.

1723
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,020
Each verse kind of covers a different thing

1724
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,900
that's crazy about our world.

1725
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,820
This one seems to be about out of the kooky lifestyle

1726
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,620
we live in California.

1727
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,180
There's a stint about religion and then, oh boy,

1728
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:11,180
relationships buckle up, ladies and fellas.

1729
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,620
All right, so this.

1730
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,540
In the middle of the week, I've been.

1731
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,020
Oh, I'm in a bad spot.

1732
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,140
It's fine, it's fine.

1733
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,980
I don't want to edit it cause it's so good, you know.

1734
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,820
You can just play it.

1735
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,820
Fruitcake left in every one of us.

1736
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,300
Religion.

1737
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,260
Way knows religion.

1738
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,380
Way knows religion.

1739
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,220
Religion.

1740
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,740
All over the place.

1741
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,260
This is religion.

1742
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,100
That's it, that's it.

1743
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,660
It's a Hollywood.

1744
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,900
Cause it uses the fake Pantages Theater

1745
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,500
at Universal Florida with the weird.

1746
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,420
There was a photo op where you could like take a picture

1747
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,340
and then it looks like the Hollywood Hills

1748
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:54,900
are matted into a photo that you could take,

1749
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,820
which is like a thing.

1750
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:56,900
Like put your camera here

1751
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,460
and then it'll look like the Hollywood Hills are up.

1752
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,060
And they did that effect in this video.

1753
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,260
This might be the only thing that did this little

1754
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,460
like fun photo op that was available at Universal Florida.

1755
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,740
Let's try again.

1756
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:10,020
I'm also, I realized I'm looking at the lyrics

1757
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,860
for the full version, which has an extra chunk of dialogue

1758
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,420
at the start about paying for junior mints

1759
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,340
and large sodas at the movie theater

1760
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,100
that is not included.

1761
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,900
Which is, it's demented.

1762
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,100
He's screaming.

1763
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,740
He gets hysterical.

1764
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,420
He's like, I want my junior mints.

1765
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,240
And then he said like,

1766
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,380
I don't want to pay for this much organization.

1767
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,820
It doesn't make any sense.

1768
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,700
You're going to hear this so many times.

1769
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,780
You're welcome by the way.

1770
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:49,780
I mean, look, that's what I, they got a bunch of serious things.

1771
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,780
They got sushi in the malls.

1772
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,020
Which I guess in 93.

1773
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,340
This is before sushi at gas stations kind of time.

1774
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,060
So what is this?

1775
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,500
I mean, this was just a lot of info for me to get this video

1776
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,580
whenever I first saw it.

1777
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:34,780
And maybe we can start talking about what's happening in it,

1778
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,180
which is he's in that intro that we played about Des Damona.

1779
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,940
He's driving his car around in which we get, you know,

1780
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:46,260
we cover so much ground of the universal lagoon.

1781
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:52,100
And then he ends up almost crashing his car into a young skateboarding

1782
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,540
jean shorted woman.

1783
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,580
And we don't see the collision.

1784
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:00,220
It just cuts to a fire hydrant spraying water.

1785
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:05,740
And then this music video starts in earnest

1786
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:10,140
where he's joined by just a parade of colorful folks.

1787
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,420
Would you call them like Zydeco dancers

1788
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,020
and then just like regular people who work in the building and then,

1789
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,540
you know, hunks, you don't just got fruitcakes, you got beefcakes.

1790
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:27,940
And then, of course, a big line of actual suits of of fruitcakes.

1791
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,500
There's like at least four of them, maybe more.

1792
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,060
You know, they look like, you know, what would be dancers

1793
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,340
in a sponsored portion of a 1950s live broadcast

1794
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,540
where it's just the legs sticking out.

1795
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,980
It's hard to convey what a fruitcake is.

1796
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,180
It's just kind of a big brown mass with weird, little sticky items poking out.

1797
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,420
Yeah, it looks like a big piece of shit.

1798
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,100
Yeah, I would think pretty much.

1799
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,340
Yeah, a slightly molded piece of shit with like stuff in it that didn't get digested.

1800
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,860
Mm hmm. But now we're you know, we're marching down Hollywood Boulevard here,

1801
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:06,580
you know, by Schwab's and the palm lined streets.

1802
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,060
I mean, so many people have joined to be in a party like this.

1803
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,300
This is what I hope it will be like when the vaccines get out,

1804
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:20,340
that we're just dancing down the street with the side of people and people from all walks of life.

1805
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,900
I mean, this party, this is this is a blast.

1806
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:26,860
He yeah, he first of all, he's got like kind of a striped shirt on.

1807
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:32,380
Jimmy does. There's an older man move, which I like is a tucked in shirt

1808
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:39,220
with a bit of a belly going on that I think is we guess we know what you'll look like at 49.

1809
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,020
Oh, I'm I'm working on it now.

1810
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,660
And he's got like crazy.

1811
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,580
He's he's he's a bald gentleman, but he's got like crazy hair in the back.

1812
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,340
And this is just this look is I feel like maybe the best Buffett look

1813
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:57,820
other than maybe when he was young and had like the big mustache and stuff.

1814
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:04,060
It's the most, you know, a a bald guy with crazy scraggly hair

1815
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,540
who has ideas that are a little unorthodox, you know, I guess in that way, Mr.

1816
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,500
Buffett reminds us of Senator Bernie Sanders.

1817
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:17,580
Could Buffett have taken it all the way is Buffett electable?

1818
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,460
I say yes.

1819
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,220
Buffett would have definitely been hit by that tax.

1820
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,580
We'll say that.

1821
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,100
Yeah, they'd be I don't like he's not a Trumper,

1822
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,500
but I don't know if he'd get along with Bernie.

1823
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,540
Oh, no. Yeah, no.

1824
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:36,300
He seems like nice guy, but I don't know about those cookie ideas.

1825
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,940
Health care for everyone.

1826
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,500
Huh? This is a fruitcake I can't get behind. Yeah.

1827
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,980
My my I see you can buy a Walmart that's mostly cord syrup

1828
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,980
has been labeled a carcinogen.

1829
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,420
Can't have him looking into that.

1830
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,100
So I don't know. I'm sure.

1831
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,380
Yeah. Looks what look wise, they they they share a lot.

1832
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,980
Mm hmm. But then we get joined by some of the most colorful

1833
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,900
the costumes of the you know, you think they've shown all their cards,

1834
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,980
that it's all these Key West partiers.

1835
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:17,140
But then he's got a couple of thoughts about the crazy world of religion.

1836
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:22,700
And I like the big wind up here, which is very it's like how a stand up

1837
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:27,220
would do it like, OK, folks, stay in your seats, remain calm.

1838
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,780
We're going to go there.

1839
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:34,620
And I just want to point out equal opportunity skin showing here.

1840
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,820
I mean, there's three women, but there's, you know, topless men.

1841
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,860
There's women in bathing suits.

1842
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,580
Not like that.

1843
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:45,020
Hopless men on rollerblades that hedonistic Beach Boys video.

1844
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,820
I agree. That's a very that's that should be rated X.

1845
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,860
That's inappropriate.

1846
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,380
I bet that's why they never played it on MTV.

1847
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,220
The only reason has to be the reason.

1848
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,900
OK, give us a little taste of religion.

1849
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,140
Oh, there's a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning.

1850
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,260
Amen, brother.

1851
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,980
Here we go now.

1852
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:13,700
Mayor, mayor, mayor, mayor, Maxima, mayor, mayor, mayor, mayor, Maxima.

1853
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,860
Where is the church who took the secret religions

1854
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:22,380
in the hands of some crazy ass people, television preachers with bad hair

1855
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,860
and dimples, the god's honest truth is it's not that simple.

1856
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,540
It's the Buddhist in you.

1857
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,060
It's the pagan in me.

1858
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,340
It's the Muslim in him.

1859
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,300
She's Catholic.

1860
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,020
It's that born again.

1861
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,980
Look, it's the wife with the Jews.

1862
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,460
Tell me what's going on.

1863
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,900
I ain't got a clue.

1864
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,820
I mean, what what isn't he saying there?

1865
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,220
What is he not trying to make a point about?

1866
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,660
Like, OK, buckle up.

1867
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,660
We're going to talk about religion, folks.

1868
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,300
So here's here's how I see it.

1869
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,980
You got all these different things.

1870
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,180
What are we going to do about it?

1871
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,620
I'll find out.

1872
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:00,140
That that that that that that.

1873
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,460
All right. You're twisted.

1874
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:04,180
And every by the way, in those in those lyrics,

1875
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,020
everything that he referenced was cut to.

1876
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,820
We cut to a televangelist with fake hair.

1877
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,740
We cut to a sexy Catholic schoolgirl.

1878
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,740
He says, Wasp and the Jew.

1879
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,740
And then it cuts to a rabbi going like, yeah, I don't know.

1880
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,460
Yeah. What could I tell you?

1881
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:24,740
His yeah, if you could sum up what he what his view on religion is,

1882
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,700
what would you say?

1883
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:33,100
90s HBO stand up half hour.

1884
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,740
I think too many words.

1885
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,780
I think it's like, I don't know.

1886
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,100
Yeah, it's weird.

1887
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,740
Go go fish.

1888
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,380
Rather be fishing.

1889
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,340
Dave Barry book.

1890
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:53,500
Yeah, he's he's got he's got nothing to say.

1891
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,700
Nothing to say, but a lot of costumes.

1892
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:01,660
And then you see him in like a in like a choir uniform

1893
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:07,100
with a bunch of altar boys, not altered, not alter.

1894
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,460
What was the bridge?

1895
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,140
But then we are on the street.

1896
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,500
We are on the street, you know.

1897
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,460
Yes. Yeah, we're covering kind of the same neck of the woods.

1898
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,500
We're hovering around a confrontation.

1899
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,580
And what's the other?

1900
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,860
What else are we near?

1901
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,180
I mean, mainly that.

1902
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:27,980
Yeah, it's a lot of the New York neck of the woods.

1903
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,060
Transformers.

1904
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,100
Yeah, Transformers down the line.

1905
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,460
But we covered some Hollywood, too.

1906
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,460
And, you know, and as I said, we're all around that lagoon.

1907
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:41,820
So in terms of full just universal coverage, we're getting it.

1908
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:46,300
There's a big there's a big bus and there's fruitcakes dancing on top of it.

1909
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,900
I mean, they're really taking us.

1910
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,420
They're taking us on a tour of the lot.

1911
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:55,300
And for me, not having been able to go there recently, you know,

1912
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,700
it's it's it's making me homesick.

1913
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:02,220
It's nice to see all these places in their 94 prime.

1914
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,580
Yes, there's also I also watched Jason reference the YouTube channel

1915
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,060
called the World of Micah.

1916
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:12,940
Yeah, which I also watched because he did the same thing for the fruitcake.

1917
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:17,180
I also watched because he did the same thing for the fruitcakes video

1918
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,580
that he did for my sacrifice.

1919
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,340
He also has a video, which I really like, where he goes and sees

1920
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,460
what's left of a closed down shownies.

1921
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,940
World of Micah really doing it, really living his best life.

1922
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:34,500
There's a there's one there's also one where he does a Kokomo video

1923
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,700
at the Grand Floridian.

1924
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,740
Oh, no kidding.

1925
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,660
So he shows all of the angles.

1926
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,580
Right. Wow. Wow.

1927
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,220
He also like kind of gets into a weird space where he's trying

1928
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,100
to like starting to like hypothesize how much fun it would have been

1929
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,020
to party with the Beach Boys and like the cheerleaders at the Grand Floridian.

1930
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,860
What's wrong with that?

1931
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,220
Because he's right. The answer is very much fun.

1932
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,940
It's not going to be the same cheerleaders, obviously.

1933
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:03,380
But when I'm with the band, I'm going to find out how fun it is.

1934
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,820
We're we're all hanging at Mike's pad in Lake Tahoe.

1935
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,180
I'm going to be in the jacuzzi.

1936
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,980
I really want to earnestly work on this.

1937
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,460
Getting you. Yeah, I'm not really.

1938
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,900
I'm not sure the in can you tweet your way into a band?

1939
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,340
I don't know. It seems like a tall order. Yeah.

1940
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,180
We just need to get you like some fake credentials

1941
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,020
and get you on stage in the right outfit.

1942
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:29,020
And then you just sort of go city to city and no one notices.

1943
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:34,820
I'm just there. Well, it's you know, the way that in lots of great movies that

1944
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:39,820
if characters are trying to hide from mobsters

1945
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:43,860
or somebody wants to kill them, that they end up on stage

1946
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,660
dressed as showgirls or something like that.

1947
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,780
Like I'll just put on the headdress and then this happens in the

1948
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:53,900
Saved by the Bell, the wedding movie and many other great films.

1949
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,740
I think that's that kind of thing.

1950
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:59,460
Like that nobody the other showgirls don't question it because they don't have time.

1951
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,020
They're getting ready for the show.

1952
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:05,060
And there's about as many beach boys as there are showgirls in a typical

1953
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,380
showgirl show.

1954
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,140
So I think if I just sneak in as if I'm avoiding the mob, right,

1955
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:12,980
then I'll probably just end up doing the show and end up on the bus. Yeah.

1956
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,620
I think we are as soon as as soon as Covid is over.

1957
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:21,100
Oh, did the beach boys play that that parking show, the parking lot show?

1958
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,500
Yeah, I've heard audio of it.

1959
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:26,460
It's something else.

1960
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:32,020
They they do their 20 20 song about being socially distant.

1961
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,020
It's called The This Too Shall Pass.

1962
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:40,780
And I heard a recording where because it's a song that is newer than 1972

1963
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:49,060
and Mike doesn't have it as sense memory for many decades in his brain,

1964
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:51,020
he blows the song so hard.

1965
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:56,700
He just like and you hear band members go, no, it and they do the part for him.

1966
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,900
Oh, no. This is cues.

1967
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,580
Now I forget the lyrics.

1968
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,620
If you haven't heard this song, you heard the social distance.

1969
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,180
Oh, yeah.

1970
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,500
Like, do what the CDC says.

1971
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:12,180
And this do this will be over before we know it.

1972
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,300
I'd like to hear the song you would write now about it.

1973
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:18,860
All right. It's

1974
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,220
where we're catching a third wave, but that's OK.

1975
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,220
Keep the businesses open, man.

1976
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,620
Was the Chinese government that made it this way?

1977
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,140
Then we're now we're getting into Clapton and Morrison territory.

1978
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,500
That's true, too.

1979
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,940
They should all team up.

1980
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,540
That's how bad Mike Love has it.

1981
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,340
He didn't even get invited to be part of that.

1982
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,980
Oh, Mike Love's calling.

1983
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,340
Don't pick up.

1984
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,700
That guy's crazy.

1985
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,860
A reference.

1986
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,420
Well, on the Dick Tracy episode, we were talking a lot about.

1987
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:00,100
Eva was talking about how it seemed like the creator of Dick Tracy

1988
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,020
had it in for NASA.

1989
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,940
But Jimmy Buffett in not in the music video, in the song,

1990
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:10,060
the long song fruitcakes seems to have some gripes with the space program.

1991
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:11,860
Hmm.

1992
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:17,060
Ah, and this this actually to me seems like its most coherent thought.

1993
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:20,460
Yeah, he the lyrics are we lost our Martian rocket ship,

1994
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,660
the high paid spokesman said, looks like that silly rocket ship

1995
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:26,900
has lost its cone shaped head.

1996
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:30,620
We spent 90 jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars.

1997
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,340
I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars.

1998
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,940
That's the most like I understand what he thinks.

1999
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,980
That's dumb. That's a waste of money.

2000
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:42,180
But that's the closest thing to any thought.

2001
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,700
That's the closest thing to a maybe the space program.

2002
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,180
Yeah. Yeah.

2003
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,180
He wouldn't be into Space Force. Right.

2004
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,660
And then he's then the quote, there's a chorus that's specific

2005
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:55,700
to that version as well. That's fruitcakes in the galaxy.

2006
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,220
So instead of fruitcakes.

2007
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,020
Well, now I wish they'd done that.

2008
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:04,100
They'd film that verse and they could have gone and filmed it in the E.T. ride.

2009
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,260
Yeah, that's the only way to make this better.

2010
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,260
And he's like playing percussion on the shells or whatever,

2011
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:14,580
on the magic mushrooms with with E.T. in the gang.

2012
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,980
I mean, God, that would be next level.

2013
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,540
We haven't even gotten to the part yet where he's like, my old lady's mad at me.

2014
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,460
Oh, well, that's that's coming now, right?

2015
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,140
He's got it right.

2016
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,460
Yeah, I think it's I mean, this is yeah, it's right here.

2017
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,860
He's hanging out in the front yard. Right.

2018
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:32,980
So it's yeah, there's another big wind up here.

2019
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,500
Let's see if I can catch it in the right spot

2020
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,540
where he goes like, here comes the big ones.

2021
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,860
Relationships.

2022
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,940
Another one like, I'm going there.

2023
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:51,860
Ah, here comes the big ones.

2024
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,540
Relationships.

2025
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,020
We all got them.

2026
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,620
We all want them.

2027
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,140
What do we do with them?

2028
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,020
Here we go, I'll tell you.

2029
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,500
Sounds like a box worthy.

2030
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,260
She said you've got to do your fair share.

2031
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,820
Now, on top of Hathoran,

2032
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,100
I treat my body like a temple.

2033
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,860
You treat yours like a tent.

2034
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,260
But the right word at the right time.

2035
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:21,100
His wife is beautiful, dressed in 90s aerobics clothes, and he looks like trash.

2036
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,100
But you know what? They're making it work.

2037
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:30,580
What did the marquee of the theater say back there?

2038
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:34,700
Because you see that marquee in the Creed video as well, and it says sacrifice.

2039
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:35,740
Sacrifice, yes.

2040
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,020
What does it say?

2041
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,060
Wait, did I go by it?

2042
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,020
You missed, you missed. Go way ahead.

2043
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,100
It's past the close up of he and his wife

2044
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:47,580
realizing that they do have common ground.

2045
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,940
Also, you still got to take care of a tent.

2046
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,020
Tents are done.

2047
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:56,340
Where is where is Joe Merchant?

2048
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,380
I think that's his book, right?

2049
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,460
That's one of his novels.

2050
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,780
You know, I didn't even notice that we got to.

2051
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,500
Yeah. What is that the name of the book?

2052
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:08,540
Well, I think totally Mars is trying to find Joe Merchant.

2053
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,580
Wow, that's a great little Easter egg.

2054
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,340
Where he's written a lot of stuff,

2055
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,540
these written books about that involve the word Mars.

2056
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,460
He might like all the Dick Tracy and Moon Maid.

2057
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:27,340
He likes he references Star Trek here and there in songs as well.

2058
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:29,500
So I think he has some affection for it.

2059
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,020
Yeah. Where is Joe Merchant? Yeah, that is the name of the book.

2060
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,700
I have not read this one.

2061
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:38,900
I have read his book Swine Not about a pig named Rumpy, I believe. Yes.

2062
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:44,260
And I've read some of A Pirate Looks at 50, but not all of it.

2063
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:48,020
I'm sorry, it. Rumpy.

2064
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,860
All right. Is Rumpy cute?

2065
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,940
I'll ask. I haven't seen Rumpy.

2066
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,140
I don't know if you see Rumpy.

2067
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,340
Well, you see in any of the materials.

2068
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:59,580
OK, so here's the here's the cover of Swine Not.

2069
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:02,380
Hold on. Let me stop.

2070
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,140
The title is not cute.

2071
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,660
I'm voting on that one.

2072
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,740
That pun is not cute.

2073
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,860
Swine Not.

2074
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,700
A novel pig tale.

2075
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:16,220
There's illustrations in it.

2076
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,780
I don't think this pig is necessarily Rumpy.

2077
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,900
Yeah, that's true. I got to go get the book then.

2078
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,900
Yeah. We'll have to choose.

2079
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,660
Well, put in wait, put in Rumpy.

2080
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:29,980
Yeah. I mean, I bet you have no Google image results for that, but.

2081
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,900
No, nothing.

2082
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:38,460
All right. Well, somebody find Rumpy and we'll find out if

2083
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,620
if there's a listener who already owns the book Swine Not.

2084
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,300
I think good for you.

2085
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,380
You're living your best life, just like Micah.

2086
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,940
I have to apologize.

2087
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,340
Where is Joe Merchant and follows the character Frank Bama

2088
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,380
looking for Joe Frank Bama, the character that Jimmy Buffett plays on Hawaii.

2089
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,860
Five. Oh, that's right.

2090
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,420
Yes. A little in the Buffett verse.

2091
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:03,700
He has books about Frank Bama and he plays him in the new Hawaii.

2092
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,260
Five. Oh, and the old one as well, I believe.

2093
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,740
I don't know about the original.

2094
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,700
Definitely the new one.

2095
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,820
He's been on the new one a couple of times.

2096
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,460
Yes. Frank Bama show up as if you're going to know who Frank Bama is.

2097
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:19,340
He's certainly they presented like that, I think.

2098
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:23,260
Frank Bama and his girl ex-girlfriend, hemorrhoid, ointment,

2099
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:25,580
Harris, Trevor Kane.

2100
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:29,300
This is so much like that dog patch shit.

2101
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,500
There's a whole Joan.

2102
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:37,260
There's a full opus maybe next year where we go through the full Buffett verse.

2103
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:38,780
Oh, man. Man.

2104
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,940
That's it. I'll like I'll go leave and have like a leisurely lunch

2105
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:46,420
and come back in the episode will be not even halfway through.

2106
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,780
We have to like I have to do.

2107
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:51,660
There are much bigger parrot heads and Buffett files than me.

2108
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:54,260
And I'd have to do a lot of work.

2109
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:58,580
But there are so many books and ancillary material in the Buffett verse.

2110
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,660
And we would try to piece it all together.

2111
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:05,300
He is. Look, the man has been just churning out crap for 50 years.

2112
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,620
This is what I don't understand.

2113
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:12,300
I mean, I have look, I think my I've made my Beach Boys level

2114
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,780
confusing, probably to some extent.

2115
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:19,500
But I like is it like it's crap, but I love it.

2116
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,660
Is this a Six Flags situation?

2117
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:26,140
Well, I would think that 95 percent of all the people at that Buffett concert

2118
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:29,620
or any Buffett concert have no clue about most of like

2119
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:31,900
they don't know about Rumpy and Swine Not.

2120
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,180
It's only the hard course. Yes.

2121
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:39,260
Yeah, you're there to hear the hits and to get very drunk.

2122
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:45,260
And then, yeah, they get hammered drunk and to yell salt, salt.

2123
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,580
And they love it.

2124
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,260
I mean, they love the people.

2125
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:51,260
100 percent of the people are 95 percent of people there love

2126
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,700
Margaritaville more than anyone loves anything.

2127
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,780
Some of the happiest people I've ever seen in my life.

2128
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,300
Oh, my God.

2129
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,740
And maybe it's better. Maybe their way is better.

2130
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,900
We were like we when we went to that Anaheim show

2131
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:09,420
and Hollywood Bowl crowd was pretty well behaved, not the Anaheim crowd.

2132
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,860
Because you can tailgate at the Honda Center.

2133
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,540
Yeah. Yes, that is the difference.

2134
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:19,620
And the baby boomers were like yelling and cutting in front of each other

2135
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,020
and like kind of getting in arguments before the show.

2136
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:26,140
And just like everyone we were like we had just gotten there

2137
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:27,300
right before showtime.

2138
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,940
And and we were like the we were like the parents.

2139
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,860
And all these baby boomers were like just so drunk.

2140
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,180
They were threatening each other with sharp pineapples.

2141
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,420
I'll cut you.

2142
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,260
Throwing coconuts at each other.

2143
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:51,180
Yeah. So there's another world of Micah.

2144
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,260
He points out that and I miss now I'm forgetting where it is.

2145
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:57,380
Jimmy Buffett goes by the Lew Wasserman statue.

2146
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,100
In the universe.

2147
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,340
No, there was such a thing.

2148
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:05,780
There's a statue of Lew and Universal Executive of the past.

2149
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:07,060
Yes. Lew Wasserman.

2150
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,940
So this is a thing.

2151
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,700
This is probably an episode about this statue, because I don't think we've ever

2152
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:14,460
talked about this, nor did I really realize that this was there.

2153
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,140
There is a Lew Wasserman statue in Universal Florida.

2154
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:23,580
And let me show it to you and you will be maybe as shocked as I was to find this.

2155
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,940
Jason, did you know about this?

2156
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:27,180
Yeah, it's over by the 30 Rock building, right?

2157
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,020
It's been the park. Exposing himself.

2158
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:32,660
Oh, my God.

2159
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:36,140
He's like a he's like a crying clown.

2160
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,260
Well, he doesn't always have the bird on his head.

2161
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,260
I see you.

2162
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,140
So I thought the bird was part of the statue.

2163
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:48,660
Wait, they gave this executive a constant bird on his head, like a silent film star.

2164
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:49,940
No, no, no. All right.

2165
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,780
He's just a very thin man.

2166
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,780
He looks like John Kerry.

2167
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,940
They've they've built this very sad.

2168
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:01,340
They built a statue to make him look like he's like John Quincy Adams or Ben Franklin.

2169
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,060
He looks like Fred Gwynn.

2170
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:08,260
He also does look like he looks like an emaciated Fred Gwynn, Herman Monster.

2171
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:12,140
Here there's the plaque here.

2172
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:16,180
Lew Wasserman was one of the most highly regarded figures in the entertainment

2173
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:18,660
industry for decades. He had guided the course of film, television, music

2174
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,660
and recreation, as well as the world of politics and philanthropy.

2175
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,900
During his career, he built MCA, later renamed Universal Studios

2176
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,860
into a preeminent entertainment company and simultaneously transformed the industry

2177
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:32,820
through his innovation, creativity and vision.

2178
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:36,420
I never knew that I did not know this.

2179
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,860
Everybody's favorite attraction at Universal, Florida.

2180
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,100
There he is. There's the man himself.

2181
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:46,180
I just read an article talking about like the the the chaos at HBO

2182
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:53,500
and AT&T running Warner now, and they compared it to like in the 90s.

2183
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:58,460
This sort of happened when like Japanese technology companies like Sony

2184
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:04,300
started buying either movie studios or like taking big shares of them.

2185
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:09,980
And Lew Wasserman's attitude was, I'm not going to teach you how to do this.

2186
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,300
You're on your own.

2187
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:16,140
And a lot of those companies, Japanese and European, got into the business

2188
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,220
and then got out very quickly.

2189
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:21,780
Sony was the only one that really stuck around.

2190
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:26,420
But like, yeah, Lew Wasserman, very pissed off that people were coming in

2191
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:29,460
and trying to teach Hollywood how to make movies and stuff.

2192
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:33,460
Mm hmm. Well, we'll do a full Lew episode.

2193
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:38,540
Well, this Wikipedia says that his statue is decorated for Halloween horror nights.

2194
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:41,300
Oh, yeah. Well, what did you I think that's hold on.

2195
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:44,180
I think I found that picture.

2196
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:46,100
They make him a scary clown or something.

2197
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,980
No, here look at Lew like defaced.

2198
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,660
Yeah, here it is. I think.

2199
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,500
Oh, he's covered in thorns.

2200
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:59,180
Oh, so he, I guess, is Jesus ish as well.

2201
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:01,460
I know that Jesus wasn't wrapped in thorns like this, but.

2202
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:04,380
You should you should have a crown.

2203
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:06,060
And suffered for.

2204
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:10,700
Um, OK, so credit for that, they used a very obscure detail of the park.

2205
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:14,900
I mean, you know, this is they really used a lot.

2206
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:20,260
I mean, I think it's hard to it's hard to top this.

2207
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:26,660
Yeah, you get like you get as you get all the different like signage.

2208
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:29,700
Obviously, you get some of that in the

2209
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,580
Creed video as well, but like you really get a good view of the park

2210
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,860
as it existed in this year.

2211
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,580
It looks like the most fun place you could ever go.

2212
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:46,140
And in the video you get, it's just some of the one of the great philosophers

2213
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,820
of the 20th century.

2214
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:53,380
Some very coherent thoughts that really make you think.

2215
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:59,260
And yeah, hey, you know, all this stuff in the world,

2216
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,420
who knows what's going on? I ain't got a clue.

2217
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:05,660
The thing that I have a clue about, I'll I'll cast my vote

2218
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,620
that I believe that Fruitcakes is the best music video

2219
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,940
film that Universal Studios Florida.

2220
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:15,020
Yeah, I mean, needless to say, I also I'm going to cast that vote.

2221
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:18,020
I realize now that World of Micah also told me that the place

2222
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:20,460
where Buffett and his wife here in the little scene,

2223
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:23,180
it's now a Puss in Boots meet and greet.

2224
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,660
So like a how like a kind of a Spanish villa house

2225
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:34,900
and synergy got to make sure that looks like a modern

2226
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:39,420
Puss in Boots lives in like a 1940 house.

2227
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,780
Yeah, just yeah. He just bought it.

2228
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,860
My bungalow. It's a bungalow.

2229
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:47,300
They make the cartoon characters live in the old starlit bungalows

2230
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,900
where they would make them have curfews and sign moral pledges.

2231
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:55,860
Jason, do you have a vote to cast?

2232
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,700
Ah. I mean, you know, I.

2233
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:05,740
I feel like somehow the message of Fruitcakes is clearer than my sacrifice.

2234
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,860
I'd say so.

2235
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:14,020
Well, while technically less impressive, this is probably more fun because

2236
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:17,660
yeah, my sacrifice is is kind of a bummer.

2237
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:24,380
Mm hmm. So yeah, if I had to watch one of the three again, it would be this.

2238
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:29,780
Yeah. With a break, as we've been staring at the frames of this for some time.

2239
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:33,100
And maybe I'd skip the mea culpa mea maxima culpa part.

2240
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:38,740
But besides that, I well need to declare it.

2241
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:43,220
I think that. It's kind of an important part.

2242
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:47,300
Not cuttable. You can cut the junior men's part, but not the mea culpa.

2243
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,700
Movie theater is different than religion.

2244
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:54,140
I'm declaring it Fruitcakes, the winner of the Universal Studios

2245
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:56,260
Florida music video melee.

2246
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:00,260
Congratulations. Since 1994, nothing has topped.

2247
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,580
Not even some strong entries in 2001.

2248
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:09,180
Some great tints of the early 2000s couldn't dethrone the king,

2249
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,460
the king of the fruitcakes, Jimmy himself.

2250
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,900
Congratulations, Jimmy, you did it.

2251
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:17,900
I bet he feels like he's in paradise.

2252
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,260
Yes, he had a view or hear.

2253
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,980
He would say, thanks a lot.

2254
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:27,660
Ah. I have to say the,

2255
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:33,860
you know, just that this music video for fruitcakes being filmed at Universal

2256
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:38,220
Florida, I think this is the most interesting trivia and the most interesting story

2257
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:41,660
involving Jimmy Buffett and the Universal Resort.

2258
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:46,220
Hmm. I can I can think of no story

2259
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:50,580
that is more fascinating that involves both of these parties.

2260
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:55,060
Yeah, you know, I think that what you're saying is 100% true.

2261
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:58,500
So like I think by everybody, thank you so much for listening.

2262
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,460
I'm going to.

2263
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,580
We hold hold on.

2264
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,180
Oh, I found a story on Google.

2265
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:08,460
Oh, oh, the monster's rising.

2266
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,900
Did you find Mike?

2267
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,180
Mike's building something.

2268
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,020
Wait. Oh, no, I better.

2269
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,060
OK, you survived.

2270
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:15,820
I guess the ride. You survived it.

2271
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,620
There's a you can't go back once you survived.

2272
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,620
It's been said you survived.

2273
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:19,740
I guess the ride is a good game.

2274
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:22,340
Jimmy Hemisphere dancer.

2275
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,460
What we do stay subscribed three bonus episodes every month.

2276
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,740
Wondered where that plane came from.

2277
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,060
Jamaica, Mistaka.

2278
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:31,980
No. OK. All right.

2279
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,980
OK, that's it. I'm I'm stopping my space bar.

2280
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,140
If you guys want to keep going, it's up to you.

2281
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,100
But I say you survive.

2282
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:41,660
I guess the ride find the story elsewhere.
