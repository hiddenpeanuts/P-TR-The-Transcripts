00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,160
Grab your 100% polyester pullover shirts and one size fit all elastic waist pants.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
It's a very special, hot cast the fright, the cemetery gate.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm Rick Zombieberg joined by General Trag and Dr. Murderhog.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
General Trag from Dimension X, yes, this is me.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,960
Hey, Dr. Murderhog, checking in from your primary care office.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,600
In hell.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,600
In hell.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
Yeah, and I'm Rick Zombieberg.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,040
Am I like a, I'm a real estate agent.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm an underworld real estate agent, it sounds like maybe.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
You also work in hell.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,880
I like, I flip properties.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
I update that like, you know, if people would rather,

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,320
if Satan wants more skulls of the damned instead of, you know,

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
if he wants human skulls to line the walls instead of

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
boar's skulls or hellhound skulls, you know, you got, you got to keep updated with the,

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
with the trends in hell.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,840
Right.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
And that's what Rick Zombieberg does.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,960
Just kind of a, yeah, a contractor, you know, and try to get reasonable prices,

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
but you know, you got to stay competitive.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,640
That makes sense.

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,120
People, you have a card and a phone number now.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,320
And like a smiling real estate agent kind of photo, but with like teeth rotting and

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Mitch McConnell's hands giving a thumbs up with rich Mitch Rick McConnell's rotting hands.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,360
Yeah.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, it's been a recurring thing all month specifically, I think all of October

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
and so far it hasn't come to pass, but we've certainly been done with all of the,

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,560
all of the villains of the world.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,960
I feel like throughout October we've had to say, well, we'll edit that out in case these people die.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
Yeah, that is a comment.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm not COVID and, uh, and I will add it here.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
We may have to edit this out if someone is dead by the time this is released.

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,600
If Mitch McConnell's hands fall clean off, if he like turns into scarabs, I'll love mummy.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,760
But if the scarabs, okay.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,440
So is maybe his final plan that he turns into scarabs and then the scarabs each get a,

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
uh, like a vote in the Senate.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,600
So if he turns into 300 scarabs, then that's 300 Republican votes.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,040
And this is his final plan to beat the court packing that everyone is so worried about.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,240
Here's why that's different than the Democrats out in new States.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,920
So here's why that's different.

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
Is that the scarab talking or is that Mitch before the scarab?

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
It's hard to tell.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
Like it's, he's kind of flashing.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,880
He's mid faces like half Mitch, half scarab.

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,400
It's like an old holograph.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,360
It's transformation.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,920
I'll speak on behalf of everyone else.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,160
Yes.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Look, when you have a Republican president and the mandate to turn into scarabs,

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,360
you all get individual votes is clear.

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,320
Do you truly somebody, somebody texts you and goes, Hey, did you see Mitch McConnell

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,440
turned into a bunch of scarabs?

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,160
And you go, huh?

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,480
2020 boy.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
What a dumpster fire of a year.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,320
Could things get any crazier?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,240
Yeah.

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,960
You barely it dominates the news cycle for like five hours and then a new Trump tweets.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah.

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
Well, we'll edit this.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh no.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,440
If he turns into scarabs, we'll leave this in because it makes, you know, us look like geniuses.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,920
Yeah.

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah.

72
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Yeah.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
If we called it, I mean, it'll be within the week.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,640
Yeah.

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
If it happens before Wednesday, when this comes out, then we're really ahead of it.

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
But you know what?

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Were that to happen?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,840
I mean, what a perfect thing to package and turn into a bagged Halloween costume.

80
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,680
The topic of today's episode.

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
This is obviously outside of the theme park thing, but I think bagged Halloween

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,160
costumes are one of the primary ways that we get silly theming into the world,

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
you know, outside of theme parks.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:46,640
And, you know, it's one of the best ways to make the world a silly cartoon place.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,200
I think obviously everyone has some experience with these things for your Halloween

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,960
activities.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,320
I think that if I'm talking about me personally, my mom would always insist on making the costumes

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
and I wanted the bagged costumes, but probably didn't get them.

89
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,680
I think maybe later when I got older, I got some, but it's interesting because it's

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
where I mean, the ones I think I want to talk about are the funnier ones, but you know,

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
there would be, there would be some elaborate ones I think kids would have, and I would be

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
very jealous of them sometimes.

93
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,320
Yeah.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,080
It's kind of the more like standardized way you felt like to really look like the guy.

95
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
And I feel like, you know, the bigger characters get some pretty good ones.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,840
And I still feel like you'll see, you'll see like really good kid, you know, Marvel characters

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
and DC characters and stuff.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,960
But I, you know, in what this topic is, I like that we, I think I texted this to you guys a

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,200
while ago and everybody was really on board, but it seemed it's kind of like a litmus test.

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,760
Like what does, what does this topic mean to you?

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
And I'm excited to find out.

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,320
Yeah.

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Cause I think there's probably like individual weird things to fixate on within this crazy

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
genre of product.

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
I think I'm in the zone of what you were thinking, but I was like, I was doing a little

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
research last night and I went, I don't actually know what we're supposed to be doing here.

107
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
I think I know.

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
I kind of feel the same way.

109
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
I was like, I think I know what we're doing.

110
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,200
I like, I knew exactly what I would do, but I'm interested to see if that's right.

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,360
Scott, I think this is one where you are the maestro.

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,760
Like this might be one of your opus since, cause I know this has been an obsession for a while,

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,960
but like I, I, I do want to take some credit by inadvertently summoning this demon

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
because I made a joke very early on in COVID times.

115
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,920
There was an article about like, what does this mean for the Halloween shops?

116
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,320
And I was like, yeah, so when someone think about the shadiest business, second only to

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
fireworks stores.

118
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,960
And you were like, please do not disrespect these at listed.

119
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Some of the great copyright free, copyright skirting Halloween costumes.

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
I was like, oh, I didn't even, I forgot all about this.

121
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
I feel like it's a thing you forget about until you see it and you're like, oh, I know

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
this better than some family members.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,560
Of course we all have a good laugh about these.

124
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
This is good, wholesome fun.

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,200
I think that's sort of what delights me and that, you know, not this year cause shopping

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,800
in person is tough, but like when that season rolls around and the myriad of businesses

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,360
close to turn into temporary Halloween stores, particularly, particularly spirit Halloween,

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,320
which has become so notorious in the recent past.

129
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,680
And you get to do the little path around this.

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,640
Let's like walk around.

131
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
I rarely ever buy anything.

132
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,240
I just love walking up and seeing the cheapest, worst, most breakable, most flammable fabrics

133
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
in the world.

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,440
Like how do we turn a dollar 50 of raw material into a $70 costume that in some cases, in

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,160
the best cases avoids the license of the actual intellectual property that it is supposed

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,880
to represent.

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Yeah, it is.

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,760
This is one of those words like to the companies like that, like to, would sue, do they just

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,440
go, it's not even worth it.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
It's not like, God bless.

141
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,920
If you want to take a bunch of rags, charge $80 for it and call it Ironman.

142
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,560
God bless.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Yeah.

144
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,080
And maybe we have red rags.

146
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,640
I think they all like probably all these companies kind of like appear for one year and then

147
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,560
scatter like roaches or scarabs, if you will.

148
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
And just like, nevermind.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
That was never a company.

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,760
We weren't a company.

151
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
And then they go reform in like a different country, call themselves something different.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,640
Right.

153
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,800
Like, you know, Joy Town Inc becomes Spooky Time LLC.

154
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,040
There's no way to set like they're in mid collapse, I think.

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,360
And you know, like you wouldn't sue a house of cards because it's on its way to falling anyway.

156
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Of course.

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,320
Yeah, that's I'm sure like there should be a lot of investigation.

158
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,440
You know, I'd like to get the laptop of the owners of these companies to see what they've

159
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
been up to.

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
I'd like Rudy Giuliani to do a little of that for us, you know, because there's, I bet

161
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
there's something on those hard drives.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah, obviously, you know, a lot of visits to childtrafficking.com.

163
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,400
This is what Rudy is sitting on.

164
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
He won't show us.

165
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,160
He's keeping the information to himself.

166
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,840
He's doling it out because he has the unique gatekeepers.

167
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,920
You can't just flood us with this info.

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah.

169
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,800
But yeah, all of these Halloween company bastards are all, you know, looking for like

170
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
discount children.com.

171
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
Yeah, I think that's right.

172
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,080
Yeah.

173
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,400
Yeah.

174
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,640
But just gum bags and it'll all come out.

175
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
We'll all very soon.

176
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,640
Very soon.

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,600
It'll all be clear.

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,360
Very soon.

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
It'll be beautiful and it'll be clear.

180
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,040
But yeah, I think that that I think is the best.

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,880
Like, I just like it makes me so happy.

182
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:38,400
Anytime I look at the most generic model you've ever seen in a heavily smile and real big with

183
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,320
the fakest white teeth in the most photoshopped version of a costume that you know it will not

184
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,880
look like just the bags themselves.

185
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,640
I feel like create permacrees in costumes.

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
They will never go like this is folded forever.

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Even if you wear it 100 times and wash it 100 times, which doesn't happen.

188
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't think anyone washes a Halloween costume.

189
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,800
No, I can't imagine.

190
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,760
Yeah.

191
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,280
I can't imagine that material that material would fall apart in a washing machine.

192
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
It would destroy the washing machine.

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,240
Destroy the washing machine.

194
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Yeah, I was going to say if you want to get a insurance write off for that washing machine.

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:30,560
I put my costume for alien investigator black suit man in the washing machine.

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,840
And now it's just permanently there's just like black tar around.

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
My washing machine was silver.

198
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
Not anymore.

199
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,480
It stains all my clothes, but the stain doesn't go away itself.

200
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,520
I was trying to find Mitch McConnell Halloween costume, but I don't think it exists.

201
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
Nobody's doing it.

202
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,880
Yeah.

203
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,520
Nobody like either on one side, the side that likes him doesn't like him enough to dress

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,320
up like him.

205
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
And then we like the other side does not want to hear about him anymore than we have to.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
Right.

207
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Yeah.

208
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Anyways, I don't know.

209
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,840
It's open ended.

210
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,720
It's a free for all.

211
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,320
It's really just when you think about this topic, what makes you happy?

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,760
I have a big pile of photos we can look at and maybe some little mental challenges that

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
we can play as well.

214
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,320
Jason, I'm curious though, because you were saying you were looking into the venerable

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
institution Spirit Halloween a little bit and some of their history.

216
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, I found out it was like local to like the my neck of the woods where I grew up.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
It is based out of Egg Harbor Township.

218
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
So a couple things.

219
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
One Spirit Halloween.

220
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
Yes, they kind of like pop up everywhere.

221
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,040
Like when it's Halloween season, which usually starts around August, goes to like just past

222
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,520
Halloween, they have like 1400 locations across the country.

223
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,400
And it's one of those things where like once Halloween is over, they start looking for

224
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,560
empty storefronts start of November for the following year.

225
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,680
Oh, just instantly.

226
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:17,920
Wow.

227
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,240
Wow.

228
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,280
Yeah, because it can take a while to negotiate the leases, especially like we want to lease

229
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
it, but we want to lease it for four or five months.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,200
So my favorite discovery and Spirit Halloween started by a guy who this was my favorite

231
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,840
discovery.

232
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,680
I think he started it as a Spirit Women's Discount Apparel.

233
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,200
It was a women's clothing store.

234
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,960
And then he noticed how much the costume store next door was raking in the customers come

235
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Halloween time.

236
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,440
So for he tried a limited run of like, well, what if I sell costumes and he made 100 grand

237
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,240
in a month?

238
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
And this is like 1983.

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
So 100 grand went a lot farther.

240
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,120
And I love that corny instinct of just like, what are the kids like now?

241
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Oxygen bars, fidget spinners.

242
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,560
Let's try it.

243
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,120
Let's do it.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,320
And the more I had thought about that, I realized, you know, I know I keep talking about

245
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
like the death of culture of like everything just keep there's no new stuff.

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
Everything just keeps getting remade.

247
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,440
But I think if you are having trouble processing the insane acceleration, it's news nowadays.

248
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,120
If you just imagine like an aging carnival barker, like an aging carnivore or chomping

249
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,920
a cigar and you say any news story like that, it just makes sense.

250
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
Like, yeah, everyone's mad at Chris Pratt.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
See, he didn't go to the fundraiser.

252
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Yeah, there's a pedophile ring under a pizza place.

253
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
See, I don't care if the lion killed someone last night.

254
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,840
I want it under the big top now.

255
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
It just helps.

256
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,320
You think spirit Halloween esque people are kind of behind everything, like fueling many

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,280
things in this world.

258
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Yeah.

259
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,360
Even though spirit Halloween just kind of the online store is pretty much year round.

260
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,640
But even though spirit Halloween pops up and goes away, it's like, oh, well, if everything

261
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,120
is carny shit, if everything is spirit Halloween, it makes the world.

262
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,280
It's not good, but it makes it make a little more sense.

263
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,960
Every thing is hypothesis that everything is carny shit.

264
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,640
Yeah.

265
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,680
I mean, yeah, the president, he's talking about the big man.

266
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
He's got this big man.

267
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,320
We got a big man, too.

268
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
He's the biggest man you ever see.

269
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
You know, I got that.

270
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
This is I like that this is a little Burgess Meredith, too.

271
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah.

272
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,880
Well, you know, I I'm afraid if I go to James Cagney, it'll summon Bugsy Bones.

273
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
You know, so I gotta be careful.

274
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,640
That's a fine example of a Halloween of a bagged Halloween costume.

275
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
The garb hornbite.

276
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,480
Pinstripe gangster skeleton.

277
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,280
Which has come back in several projects.

278
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,280
And I can say I've never washed those pinstripes.

279
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,640
Don't that this particular person has to wear every couple of years.

280
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah, like the Borat suit.

281
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,080
You don't wash it.

282
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
I was like, oh, go ahead, Jason.

283
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
Oh, I was going to say another fact about spirit Halloween.

284
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,800
OK, so to give them some credit, in around 2006, 2007, they launched a charity called

285
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,880
Spirit of Children, where they donate money to pediatric hospitals.

286
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,080
And they Halloween time, they give a lot of toys and games and costumes and

287
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
pay for pet therapy and stuff.

288
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,640
And that is a nice thing that they do.

289
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,880
I will say on their website, like about us page, they're like, and it's all about the children.

290
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,360
And it's like, you opened in 1983.

291
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,240
You this charity is less than 20 years old.

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,120
It's been all about the children for like 14 years.

293
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,440
Like, let's be careful.

294
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
As of recently.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
As of recently.

296
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,840
The other thing I discovered about Spirit Halloween is the parent company now,

297
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,520
as of like the 90s, is Spencer's Gifts.

298
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,800
Wow, really?

299
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,280
The mall's standby, yes.

300
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,720
That's interesting.

301
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
And I had not been in a Spencer's Gift in years.

302
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
And then I went like last year in the it's in the Galleria.

303
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
And I didn't realize they sell a lot of sex toys in there.

304
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah.

305
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,760
In the in a mall, really?

306
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,080
Yeah.

307
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,160
It's tucked away in the back of it's in that like addendum to the Galleria.

308
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
You know what I'm talking about?

309
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
That kind of connects over the street.

310
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
And I was in there with friend of the show, Andrew Grissom.

311
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,640
And I think we were walking around and I went, this is a wall of sex toys on a Spencer's Gifts.

312
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,720
Now, just to be clear, Mike, you aren't qualifying a candy thong as a sex toy.

313
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm not.

314
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
No, I'm not doing that.

315
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Yeah, that would be if it was like, it's like I saw some Rick and Morty underwear.

316
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,840
That's a sex toy.

317
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
That's a fun thing.

318
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
That's a fun thing you do.

319
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
It's a Harley Quinn wig.

320
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
That's a sex toy.

321
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,840
Sex toy.

322
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
It's designed to titillate.

323
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,440
Well, they always had what I always heard called novelties,

324
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
like penis pasta.

325
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,240
Yeah, candy thong.

326
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,160
But I did keep coming up with like coming across articles where they're like the store

327
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,120
that sells like, you know, dirty shot glasses and sex toys.

328
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,040
And I was like, oh, they expanded.

329
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Yeah, they really did.

330
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,920
I mean, I knew them because I had been in one years ago and there was a greeting card

331
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
with Santa taking a shit down a chimney.

332
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,200
Yes.

333
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,520
And I was like, that's the perfect Spencer's gift.

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,920
Oh, at 1213, when you went to the mall with your friends, it was a must stop.

335
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
No one ever bought anything.

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,840
Maybe someone bought a Simpsons poster that looked like the Sopranos logo or,

337
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,200
I don't know, a poster of a bunch of license plates that spell something out.

338
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,920
But like, I don't think anyone really ever dropped real money.

339
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,040
So I was thinking and I had this thought when I could not sleep at 5 a.m. this morning.

340
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Hey, how are Spencer's gifts doing during the pandemic?

341
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,120
And the answer was not great.

342
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,920
So there's a ProPublica article with the headline.

343
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,120
It's from March 18th.

344
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,960
Spencer's pressured employees to come to work selling gag gifts and sex toys until we called.

345
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,680
So Spencer's is one of those companies that was like pushing their luck and staying open,

346
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,480
like after the state of emergency, as employees are like, you got to shut down.

347
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,840
We don't want to. You got to.

348
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
So once the press started poking around, they did shut down.

349
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,480
And then there was another article on chain storage I found that said as a March 30th,

350
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
Spencer's furloughs all their employees.

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,400
So they got around to that.

352
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
And to continue, the hits just keep coming.

353
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,920
This is from April, the National Law Review.

354
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:37,680
Spencer's gifts LLC to pay 90,000 to Seattle to settle disability discrimination lawsuit.

355
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,400
That's a funny mispronounciation.

356
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,280
He's been up to five.

357
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,240
He's been up since five.

358
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,680
I've been upset.

359
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,600
Yeah, I did get back to 90,000.

360
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Not much, though.

361
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
Not much, though.

362
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,520
It was basically an employee was diagnosed with Marfan's, which is a joint, I believe,

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,040
a joint disorder.

364
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,240
It can be difficult to walk.

365
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
And they were asking for reasonable accommodations.

366
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,680
Spencer's laid them off at the first chance they could get after their disability claim ran out.

367
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,560
And so they sued and won.

368
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,840
They have a bad attitude, much like many of the products they sell.

369
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,120
They're Brian from Family Guy Vibrator.

370
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,360
By the way, I've been kind of stuck on penis pasta since you brought it up.

371
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
I've certainly been aware of penis pasta, but never really meditated on it.

372
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,040
Is it to be laughed at?

373
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,080
Is it to be...

374
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,280
You wouldn't be turned on by penis pasta.

375
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:01,360
Is anyone who might eat penis pasta so obsessed with penises that just each bite would make them quiver?

376
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,800
Just seeing a plate of it, like, oh my, oh, this is too sexy to eat.

377
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
Excuse me a minute.

378
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,200
My guess is, and I haven't seen the particular penis pasta we're talking about,

379
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
because my guess is it's sort of like a macaroni.

380
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,480
It's the size of a macaroni.

381
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,600
And I would agree with your hypothesis there that that's not anything that people are getting

382
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,320
turned on with.

383
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:32,080
But if there's sort of like penis ravioli, maybe larger pieces of pasta that potentially

384
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,000
are the size of a real penis, perhaps then what you're talking about could be true.

385
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
You're saying like taking five raviolis for that amount of...

386
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
I mean, really, we're getting into lasagna territory.

387
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,600
Penis lasagna is what I'm talking about.

388
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes.

389
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,280
If it was a penis lasagna now, that is maybe erotic for someone.

390
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,800
Not me, but someone.

391
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,040
Which, like, if you can sort of manufacture it to where, like,

392
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,840
as if you place pressure on the right area, then like ricotta.

393
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Oh, I know where you're going with this.

394
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't think it would be that hard to make that happen, quite frankly.

395
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,560
If you pack it really tight, like...

396
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
This would be a really good challenge on one of these Netflix cooking shows

397
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,880
to see if you could make that happen.

398
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,560
Well, yeah, because the host would say, you know, if you're not hand making your own

399
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,720
penis pasta, why even bother?

400
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,240
You know, why buy in the box?

401
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,480
Right.

402
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,760
This is maybe a good business idea, like the buca di beppo of eroticism,

403
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,120
where each...

404
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,840
Like, you get giant plates of food that are also meant to be very sexy.

405
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,640
I think you could get Robert Earl on board with this.

406
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,920
I think this might be his most desired business.

407
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,240
Oh, I love penis-shaped food.

408
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,960
You do a better one.

409
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
You can do what you do with it.

410
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
Yeah, you can.

411
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
You do the better Robert Earl.

412
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,400
And here, a platter of the most scrumptious ricotta dicks that you've ever seen.

413
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
I can't wait to sample them myself.

414
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
I mean, he's also in that...

415
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,800
Did he go in with one of the real housewives on something?

416
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,360
Like, he's...

417
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,800
Like, I feel like he'll invest in stuff.

418
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Yeah, maybe we should get a plan together.

419
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,280
Yeah.

420
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,520
Yeah.

421
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,400
Do you just spin it off from buca di beppo and make that words?

422
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
Is it just buca di beppo xxx?

423
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,800
I think it's good to, yeah, take the existing brand, so people recognize it

424
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
and then they understand what it is.

425
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah.

426
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,400
Well, I think you got to do a collab.

427
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
As they say, the kids love collabs.

428
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,240
So I think it's got to be buca di beppo x Spencer's Gifts.

429
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
You got two powerhouses together.

430
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,040
Sure, sure, sure.

431
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,040
And this is the way to maybe say if Spencer's Gifts are in trouble,

432
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,920
you just start turning them into sit-down restaurants as soon as all this is over.

433
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,960
I feel like it's...

434
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
Yeah, it's a store that is experiential.

435
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,600
You need to go to...

436
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
No one's ordering Spencer's Gifts off online.

437
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,080
But if the management's thinking is like,

438
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
okay, we got this employee, they have Marfan syndrome,

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,680
they're having knee surgery, this is a thing that...

440
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,880
It wasn't joints, it affects connective tissue.

441
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,600
They asked...

442
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,000
The accommodations were light, no heavy lifting, light activity,

443
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
and I need to use a crutch or a cane.

444
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
And you're like, ah, we can't do it.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,440
It's like, what are your priorities?

446
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,160
What do you do?

447
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
What is the store?

448
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,920
I don't know.

449
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,720
I can't get into the head of Spencer's Gifts.

450
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,960
I think their priority is Rick and Morty socks.

451
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,560
That seems to be a priority for them other than that.

452
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
Well, and that's been a real epic win for them, that skew.

453
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
That's really worked out.

454
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,560
As for their Spirit Halloween franchise,

455
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
this isn't like a Twitter meme.

456
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
I don't ever get tired of this.

457
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,000
There are Twitter things that I think have worn out their welcome.

458
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,640
I would never ever like to see anyone remind any sirs that this is a Wendy's.

459
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
That can go away forever and die, please.

460
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,040
But things that are things that close and are vacant,

461
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,400
becoming Spirit Halloween's, I enjoy so much.

462
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,760
I like when it's affected theme park worlds,

463
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,280
like things that, you know, that if during this time

464
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,160
all of Epcot Center is a Spirit Halloween.

465
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,840
I thought in my memory, the very funny Twitter account,

466
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
Americana, brand memes, like, oh, they've done some,

467
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,160
he's done some Spirit Halloween stuff.

468
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,200
And I found one where he said for this year,

469
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,080
since Los Angeles is canceling Halloween,

470
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,880
Spirit Halloween is becoming a Spirit Halloween.

471
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
And then there was a second sign of one side of the other.

472
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
That's kind of the ultimate one that you could do.

473
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,160
But if you, I mean, like just Google it,

474
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,120
seeing a bunch of like, you know, like I'm looking at,

475
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,560
you know, what was clearly a babies are us.

476
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,480
And they put up the Spirit Halloween banner and it doesn't quite cover the,

477
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
you can still see the B and the us.

478
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,000
I feel like circuit cities are made for like so much of America

479
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,520
is like buildings that have a big cube for no reason

480
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,560
that are closed for eight months and then Spirit Halloween's for four months.

481
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,280
Uh, what is the nearest one to everyone?

482
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
Sorry, Jason, I cut you off.

483
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,640
The nearest Spirit Halloween.

484
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,840
And what did it used to be?

485
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,960
I don't know, cause I don't go outside anymore.

486
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,600
Oh, good point.

487
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,840
I will answer the question.

488
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,600
It is very close to here and it used to be a Kmart.

489
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
Oh, I did see that.

490
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
I took a drive.

491
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
I saw the yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Yeah, that's an interesting.

493
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,280
Is Kmart done or just that Kmart?

494
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,000
What happened to Kmart?

495
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,680
I think Kmart is done and that Kmart's been done for a few years now.

496
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,040
It was always like, it felt like it had not changed since 1969.

497
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
That was like an extremely old school.

498
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,000
That Kmart I went into a decade ago and it felt like,

499
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,640
it felt like like a tornado had hit the store and no one ever cleaned up.

500
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,040
Like it was just bizarre.

501
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
It was like so surreal.

502
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,840
It was scarier than seeing the crown books in West Hills or wherever that is.

503
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,240
It was like so creepy and yeah, nothing had been touched.

504
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,600
Nothing had been updated since the heyday of Kmart, you know, what, 30 years ago?

505
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,100
Yeah.

506
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
I'm sure there's one in Studio City.

507
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,680
I can't tell.

508
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,520
I think it was a Pier one potentially.

509
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,200
Okay, that makes sense.

510
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,440
Office Max or Office Depot, I think is another Valley one.

511
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,040
I'll say this, the flagship Spirit Halloween,

512
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,360
Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, located in an old circuit city.

513
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,640
Wow.

514
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
Wow.

515
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,000
Nailed it.

516
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,680
It seems like people are, we're all as a nation fighting against this, but I feel like if things

517
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,400
have gone another way that we would have seen just like most of the US post offices become

518
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,520
Spirit Halloweens.

519
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,840
Hey, I think that's still on the table depending on who wins.

520
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,640
Oh yes, true.

521
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:04,240
I think, well, depending on who wins, I think like 95% of businesses may become Spirit Halloween.

522
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,740
Yeah.

523
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,640
Well, so, but you know, but we're not entirely here to talk about Spirit Halloween, although I

524
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,320
realized in looking at it and just Google imaging it, you know, it would be a great costume and I

525
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,760
don't have time to pull it off, but being the Spirit Halloween Spirit.

526
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Oh yeah.

527
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,720
Does that character have a name?

528
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,320
Hmm.

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
I don't know.

530
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
Not that I'm seeing.

531
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,360
Let me just share screen so we're all looking at the same thing.

532
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,520
I mean, that's a boy.

533
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,240
Now I want to do that.

534
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,440
If you just got like a yellow, like a big yellow sun made out of poster board or something you

535
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,280
could burst out of, I mean, just like any ghoul costume would do.

536
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:50,400
You just need the one red eye, but maybe that and then like with the logo of another business,

537
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,280
with like some of the soup plantation logo.

538
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
Coming out from behind it.

539
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
That's a good costume.

540
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm looking at this.

541
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,840
What if we make a Spirit Sector Keeper Halloween shirt?

542
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,600
Oh yeah.

543
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,640
That's a good idea.

544
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,280
Sector Keeper.

545
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,520
Yeah.

546
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,480
And a similar.

547
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,360
That's cool.

548
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,160
I would do that.

549
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,560
Maybe next year.

550
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,320
We're going to be right up against Halloween here.

551
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah, that's true.

552
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,200
Yeah.

553
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah.

554
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,880
We're heading right for it.

555
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,760
Barreling to it.

556
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,440
I mean, it'd be very funny to put that shirt out November 1st.

557
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,160
That's a good point.

558
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,960
We're all busy.

559
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,080
Much like Spirit Halloween getting right to it.

560
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,600
Right.

561
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
Soon as the season's over.

562
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
Sorry, Jason, go ahead.

563
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,680
I keep doing it.

565
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,200
I forgot about our tenuous connection to Spirit Halloween.

566
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,160
Shortly after the That's From Disneyland exhibit wrapped up,

567
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,920
that old Models that became an exhibit and performance space became Spirit Halloween.

568
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,200
Oh, of course.

569
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,000
Of course it did.

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Of course.

571
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,160
I think it was so refreshing to see with that exhibit to see a place like that not be a Spirit

572
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Halloween briefly.

573
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,520
But it had to.

574
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,200
It took it, it finally accepted its fate.

575
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,480
I also like that all of the Spirit Halloween's, that's a two-story space.

576
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,600
They will often take over this hulking mammoth space, but then have to put these fake facade

577
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,480
walls because they don't have enough costumes to fill an entire former Sears.

578
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,680
So they just have to section off like 20% of it.

579
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,800
And then they have just like infinite storage space.

580
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,240
They could hold enough costumes for everyone in California in a single one of these.

581
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,400
Yeah, I remember, and this actually segs into what I was about to say.

582
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Last year over in the former Toys R Us over here, they put not a Spirit Halloween,

583
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,880
but a Halloween city.

584
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,520
Covering up Toys R Us.

585
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,080
Very good.

586
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,760
Next to a toy city.

587
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,520
And if you went inside, they were utilizing about 50% of the space in the Toys R, the

588
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,560
former Toys R Us.

589
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
And it, it's odd.

590
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,200
It feels kind of like when you'd have like a nightmare about a place you've been,

591
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
but it's not quite right.

592
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,320
Like this was certainly the case.

593
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,800
There was like just a little section of like toys.

594
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,520
And then all the bagged Halloween costumes that we are about to get to.

595
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,080
Yeah.

596
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,480
Yeah.

597
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,400
Boy, that sign is so awful too.

598
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
And then still the exit only from Toys R Us.

599
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,320
I don't know.

600
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm like, there's something depressing about all of these places, but then like so fun.

601
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,640
I mean, I like getting to take the little trip is so great.

602
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,200
So I, yeah.

603
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,040
Do you want to talk about like costumes that we've run into?

604
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,920
Like what are examples of some of the things that have delighted us?

605
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,640
Yes, I think so.

606
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
I have a folder here on my desktop.

607
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,440
Well, I have it sectioned into different areas, but I feel like the primary thing,

608
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
we might have some crossover.

609
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,920
I don't know, but I think we might as well kick off with the most fun thing, which is

610
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,200
the not getting the IP correctly of writing.

611
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,920
Now there's plenty of real licensing going on and plenty of ways to get real.

612
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,760
This is Disney.

613
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,120
This is Marvel.

614
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,240
This is David S.

615
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,880
Pumpkins.

616
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
I've noticed a lot of that.

617
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,360
There's like still a ton of David S.

618
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:27,680
Pumpkins around, but to me it is so fun when they have to like word soup a phrase

619
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,760
that reminds you of the character, but is not the character.

620
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,560
And if you don't feel free to jump around, if you have other ones of these,

621
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,240
there's been like slide shows that you can see that give you some of the,

622
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,080
but feel free to start or I'll track some of mine down.

623
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,800
Oh, sure.

624
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,920
Okay.

625
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:55,120
So I think, and I'm not sure if these are all, but there's a company called Leg Avenue.

626
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
Did you find this, Scott?

627
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,920
That's the one I was trying to, that's the sexy company.

628
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,840
Yes, that's the sexy company.

629
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Avenue.

630
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
What does that phrase mean?

631
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,320
Yeah, I don't know.

632
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm not sure exactly.

633
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Is leg Avenue like, is if those are sexy, is the implication that leg Avenue is the way you get

634
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
to the genitals.

635
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,960
That's the street that leads you to, uh, I suppose you could think of it like that for, yes,

636
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
I think that's correct.

637
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,840
To, uh, to penis place.

638
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,960
Penis, gotta rock down to the leg Avenue.

639
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,480
Um, these actually though, the ones here, I think I'm going to pull up are not from leg Avenue,

640
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
though they do have a big selection.

641
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Let me see how the best way to do this.

642
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,200
Okay.

643
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,160
So this first one, I like a lot.

644
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,280
And these are actually, all of these are female costumes of the sexy variety.

645
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,760
This first one is, uh, a punisher analog.

646
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,800
It's a called the punishing one.

647
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,600
And it's kind of like a one piece bathing suit with a skull on the front.

648
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,360
That's not quite the Punisher skull.

649
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,580
Yeah.

650
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,160
Um, and then from star line, I'll let like still like weird brands within all of these.

651
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,220
Yeah.

652
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,760
The other thing, can you, can you bring that back up?

653
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,040
Because the other thing I really like is, um, how, you know, there's some, like, there's some

654
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
fun to the name, right?

655
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
And you can get excited, like, oh, look at that sexy girl and look at the, and then you

656
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,640
look at that sexy girl and look at the, and it's a fun logo in it.

657
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,520
But then they always have to include the dull, like, um, costume industry, internal phrase

658
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,080
ology.

659
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,520
So the punishing one package includes romper, waist belt, leg, what does that say?

660
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Leg belt and gloves.

661
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
Um, I, like, I, I get addicted to those kinds of things.

662
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,120
Like with over wrapping lace bodice, one size fits most.

663
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,160
Um, why would you follow the Instagram or the Facebook of the company that makes the ripoff

664
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
costumes?

665
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,840
Like follow star line LA on Instagram.

666
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,000
I think we're all going to follow it.

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,480
Yeah.

668
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
Yeah, I think so.

669
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,240
Um, I mean, one of my favorite things about this neck of the woods is that there are a

670
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,040
million, like you said, like slideshows, listicles, Twitter threads, YouTube, you know,

671
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
countdown video.

672
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,240
They all like cannibalize each other.

673
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,640
Like it is like he costumes themselves.

674
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,880
Like, well, no, it's impossible to pinpoint who's the first one to do this.

675
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,520
Everyone is cribbing off everyone else.

676
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,240
It's beautiful and poetic in a way.

677
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,280
I would love to know what it's like to work with them.

678
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,920
Like, yeah.

679
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,960
Do you, if you work at leg Avenue, are you angry at star line?

680
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,880
Are they all trying to destroy each other?

681
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,680
Mm hmm.

682
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
Uh, I have a few more star line.

683
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm realizing that a lot of these are star line.

684
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,160
In this category here, I like, uh, this is not Cruella de Vil.

685
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,720
It's cruel, love villain.

686
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,280
With an E cruel.

687
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,000
Cruella.

688
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,720
Yeah, you're right.

689
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,920
Cruella villain.

690
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,240
Wait, I also have a Cruella de Vil.

691
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, it's just, it's a little less.

692
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,240
It's just cruel villain costume.

693
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,040
Okay.

694
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,680
Are you?

695
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Are you like some of these, um, are you like surprised that there's like, I don't feel

696
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,160
like I've really felt like people are like into Cruella de Vil.

697
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:31,680
Right.

698
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,040
Like, is it, is that a common?

699
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,000
I think people are into Cruella de Vil actually.

700
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,480
Hmm.

701
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
Yeah, I think so.

702
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,920
I guess so.

703
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,000
She's got a whole thing.

704
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
Because she's bad.

705
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,920
She's I'm a good boy and she's bad.

706
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
Why would you be into a bad girl?

707
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,400
I think she's got a whole, she's got the code and yes, maybe it's made of puppies,

708
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
but it's glamour and, uh, you know, you can appreciate that she is who she is.

709
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,720
All of these actual costumes there are made of puppies as well.

710
00:38:59,520 --> 00:38:59,760
That's.

711
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
They're cheaper.

712
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,880
Well, they like work in tandem with a puppy killing company.

713
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,000
It's all on the laptop.

714
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Uh, okay.

715
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
So this is, uh, not wonder woman.

716
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,120
It's wonderful babe.

717
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,400
Party, women's wonderful babe costume.

718
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,600
You end up with all these real, oh, that also, that Mike is from nasty.com.

719
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Yes, it is.

720
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
From nasty.com.

721
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,040
I left that in there for you.

722
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Your homepage.

723
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,840
That in itself is like a weird word soup of it's kind of got.

724
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,640
Ass in it and it's kind of nasty.

725
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,200
Like I guess it in general recalls, um, sexiness, but is like a disgusting phrase.

726
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Oh yeah.

727
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,560
Yeah.

728
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,800
Yeah.

729
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Um, so that's a wonderful babe, which would be funny if wonder woman's name was a wonderful babe.

730
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,960
But yeah, that's kind of fun to like imagine the entire franchise and the film and the poster

731
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,760
and then, and you know, WB 84.

732
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,320
Pride.

733
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
Wonderful babe 84.

734
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,840
Uh, yeah.

735
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,640
I mean, that's, I don't actually have two, there's a, let's see here.

736
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,280
I have one more.

737
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,720
It's not as good as wonderful babe.

738
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,480
It's just riddle girl, riddle girl, riddle.

739
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
It's like the Riddler, but he's, she's got stockings and yeah, I guess it's, it's,

740
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
I got to be assuming it's the Riddler that she's an analog for.

741
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,640
There's no precedent really for a female Riddler.

742
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,280
Is there a female Riddler ever Jason?

743
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,120
I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.

744
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,360
There probably was in one, one issue.

745
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,320
Yeah.

746
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,200
They're, they're starting to get to that point of like,

747
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
every character's had multiple versions.

748
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,080
Yeah.

749
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,520
The anti-joker or like a bad, what if Joker was bad, like eventually you just run out

750
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,320
of combinations and twisting.

751
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,560
Right.

752
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
Here's, here's actually, here's one more.

753
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Uh, and here's a question.

754
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,280
This is a, this is an example of them using the name of a character, but I am almost positive

755
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
they don't have the license.

756
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,720
Judy Jetson.

757
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,000
Judy Jetson.

758
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,960
And it's a very sexy Judy Jetson costume, but I don't see the Jetson's logo.

759
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,400
I don't see Joe Hanna or William Barbera's name anywhere here.

760
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,880
We didn't approve this.

761
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,000
We sure didn't.

762
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
So I wonder what about this.

763
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,400
This is a company called secret wishes.

764
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,240
Jesus.

765
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,320
So I'm not sure here.

766
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,400
Are they all one company also?

767
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,120
Is that possible?

768
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,160
They throw people off the train.

769
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,080
It's like the, the, the ghost kitchens, like they all like the socks.

770
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,560
Yeah.

771
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,120
Socks are the, um, the flip-flop companies.

772
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,680
Yeah.

773
00:41:59,680 --> 00:41:59,920
Yeah.

774
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,080
So I'm, I have a lot of questions about this because yes, it's not licensed, but it's,

775
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
it's the character's name for sure.

776
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,240
Unless there's a, maybe there's enough Judy Jetsons in the phone book,

777
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
rendering it usable as a name.

778
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,080
Oh yeah.

779
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,560
If there's a real Judy Jetson in the world.

780
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
Which there probably is.

781
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,600
I think so.

782
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,880
Yeah.

783
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
So maybe that's how they got around this.

784
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,120
They couldn't make a Elroy Jetson unless there's a bunch of Elroys.

785
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Maybe there are.

786
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,480
That one's more of a stretch.

787
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,360
If you were a male, sexy Elroy Jetson.

788
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
I, there's gotta be a picture of that online.

789
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
Let me put it off shirt.

790
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,240
Well, they did do grownup Bam Bam and Pebbles cartoon at some point.

791
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,240
There are a child and everything.

792
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,480
Yeah.

793
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,360
I certainly just found an adult Elroy costume, but I don't know that I would call it sexy.

794
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,760
Probably it was just kind of a onesie.

795
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,520
Here it is.

796
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know.

797
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,840
That's very, I mean, the hat is very like Peter Pan meets Robin Hood meets space.

798
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,800
Yeah.

799
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,440
Kind of a brown doily on top of his overalls.

800
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,360
You could sexy this up pretty quick, I think.

801
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,040
Yeah, it's up to you to do just like cut some holes selectively.

802
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,320
Yeah.

803
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,360
In all of these pictures, you always have like,

804
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,280
it's usually the same type of girl in it.

805
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,880
I feel like it's a lot of sort of Megan Fox lookalikes.

806
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
That's the, you know, the kind of like brooding babe essentially.

807
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,360
And then the guys just always, they're always like beefcakes.

808
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,480
They're always Chip and Dale style.

809
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Just like, you know, big dumb super cut guy.

810
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,520
And they always seem humiliated.

811
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,200
Like seeing these kinds of guys in like a diaper or chaps or whatever,

812
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,880
like it seems like the most, like you're probably,

813
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,880
you're happy to get any like modeling gig, but you're probably worried.

814
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,200
Like is one of my friends going to find this in 13 years or is like

815
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,960
my child's going to be shopping somewhere and find me as, you know,

816
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,240
sexy venom or whatever it is.

817
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,800
Hunky venom.

818
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,920
Um, uh, let me, let me pull up some of my, uh, some of my ripoffs.

819
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,240
Um, so, uh, let's see.

820
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,920
We got, uh, I like brave warrior America.

821
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,880
Um, this guy, I don't understand his pose.

822
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,720
He has kind of just a, a bent arm.

823
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,640
I can't even tell which way it's turning.

824
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,160
He seems to be like, kind of like twiddling with his nails or something.

825
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,000
I wouldn't call that like a power pose.

826
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,720
This is looks completely Photoshop.

827
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,840
That looks like a fake arm.

828
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
It does all of it.

829
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Like Bagdol in costume, uh, worlds across the board is just some of the poorest

830
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,720
Photoshop work you've ever seen, particularly when we, when we get to the babies,

831
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,600
which is a whole other category and we'll try to tweet a bunch of these babies are

832
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,720
definitely some of the best.

833
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,760
Uh, uh, let's see.

834
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
We got, uh, juice demon.

835
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,720
Hold on a second.

836
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,520
Hold on a second.

837
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm sorry.

838
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,920
Before we move on, I know we have to dedicate some time to juice team.

839
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,760
And can you go back to brave warrior America?

840
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,160
Certainly.

841
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,840
Um, if you notice towards the bottom right of the picture, there is a union Jack flag.

842
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,360
Oh, yes.

843
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,760
Well, that guy on a website English will be indicated by the union Jack rather than

844
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,280
the American flag.

845
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,320
That is very jarring.

846
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,120
That is close to the captain America fake shield as it could possibly be as a union

847
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,160
Jack calling all British.

848
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,360
Do you want to play brave warrior America?

849
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,560
Look at also like the off center, like the weird serif font and it's way up in the

850
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:12,960
corner.

851
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,560
There's so much dead space.

852
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,600
Is this sad, like, uh, like floppy captain America and then just the same image smaller

853
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,520
in the bottom, but the other way.

854
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,560
And the stripes don't line up either.

855
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,200
Oh yeah.

856
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,160
He's a red and white is attached to a belt with just black that isn't on the other.

857
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,520
It's very clashy and that they call what he's wearing a romper like a, like a baby.

858
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:39,760
Yeah.

859
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,160
Um, like this man is humiliated.

860
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,400
If we, if he found out, he was just hoping these would only be sold regionally.

861
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,120
Like, all right, you're only going to sell these in South Carolina, right?

862
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,440
Okay.

863
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,080
Thank you.

864
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,200
We're talking about brave warrior America on a podcast.

865
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,400
There's, you know, the one thing we can take, uh, we can take comfort in the fact that

866
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,960
there's possible all of like his eyes, nose and mouth all come from different people and

867
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,280
they Photoshop them all onto this face.

868
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
So he might not be actually one man.

869
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,200
He might be a combination of 10.

870
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,840
I think, I think you're correct.

871
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,360
And that definitely happens with, with babies and children.

872
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,640
You actually, why don't I just say that, uh, I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a

873
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,800
Actually, why don't I just, why don't I jump around a little because I, there's a good,

874
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,960
there was a good, um, not a baby, but like a slightly older kid.

875
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,200
And I'm, I am like this, there is no such child.

876
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,680
This does not look like a real human being.

877
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,640
There's something incredibly wrong with this.

878
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,480
He is a Batman.

879
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,200
Look at this.

880
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,920
What is this?

881
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,560
This is like a, um, a composite for a crime scene.

882
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,720
This baby stole a car and

883
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,960
We think he looks like this blonde hair, uh, very thin eyebrows.

884
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,280
A painted on face, like skin painted skin.

885
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah.

886
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,720
It looks like a weird, like, like, yeah, it's pulled off of a mug or something.

887
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,360
Um, I showed this to Aaron who said like, he's wearing like, felt like a flipper.

888
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,200
Like what they, I was, I wasn't aware of this that like on pageant kids that they

889
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,880
put fake teeth on them on like on top of a retainer.

890
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,960
He looks like he's wearing a flipper and his mouth is in a perfect thin triangle.

891
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,120
This is a very disturbing photo.

892
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,800
Yeah, really.

893
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,440
I'm glad there's definitely no such child.

894
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
This is pulled from 12 children.

895
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,000
Right.

896
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,840
Um, anyway, uh, uh, all right, let's go, let's go back to the, uh, the other one.

897
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,640
Um, so we got, uh, yeah, as I was saying, juice demon, who is, uh, who is a,

898
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,160
kind of a Cadillac, Cadillac of fake.

899
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,200
Kind of a what?

900
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,240
Cadillac of fake.

901
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,520
I was going to say kind of the Cadillac, I think of a bagged Halloween costume,

902
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,480
copyright skirting juice demon.

903
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,240
Well, it, because like, um, brave warrior America is not appealing in and of itself.

904
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,960
You couldn't make a franchise called that, but juice demon could definitely be his own movie.

905
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,660
Yeah.

906
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,880
Juice demon.

907
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,120
Yeah.

908
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,160
I would be like a good, um, asylum.

909
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,400
I get no asylum does do parodies really, but like one of those Roger Corman style

910
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,360
places that just shits out.

911
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,880
Don't wait.

912
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
Doesn't asylum though, are they, are they the people behind trans morphers?

913
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,280
Are they?

914
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,760
Oh, are they?

915
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,000
Okay.

916
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,480
Then I'm wrong.

917
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,720
They are.

918
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,200
I apologize.

919
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,760
I thought they were just doing like original IP schlock, but they do.

920
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,480
Okay.

921
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:30,960
I was wrong.

922
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,080
I apologize to asylum.

923
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,720
I didn't know what schlock you guys did.

924
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,160
Uh, um, which speaking of trans morphers is a really unfortunately named one up at the top here.

925
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,880
Uh, they have reprised this company has represented trends,

926
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,520
formers with this costume trans boy.

927
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,140
Wow.

928
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,640
Seems a tad, uh, insensitive perhaps to just be shortening, uh, on that beer.

929
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,120
Oh yes.

930
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,600
Good.

931
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,400
I was just gonna say, I feel like maybe the company doesn't know maybe the one person that

932
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,320
works at these companies and names these things.

933
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,080
Isn't maybe aware.

934
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,400
Well, and being that it was, it, you know, it's, it's, it's these are all made in a country we've

935
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,480
never heard of, uh, and we're all done like 20 years ago.

936
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,440
So it's a good point.

937
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,840
They may, they may be art, uh, with the times so much, uh, on the happier end of things,

938
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm really fond of biscuit beast.

939
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:33,520
This is both a knockoff name and a sexy, um, this is a, a purple version of the cookie monster.

940
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:40,160
So she's got kind of like a fuzzy, uh, like head drape with big cookie monster eyes and

941
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,520
then little gloves, which contain little cookies.

942
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,160
And then inexplicably a purse that is a cookie that looks like a bite was taken out of it.

943
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,040
Wow.

944
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,480
So this, and this is also has to be like, what an English costume because of the use

945
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,560
of the word biscuit instead of cookie.

946
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,600
Oh, I guess so.

947
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,840
And do they call cookies biscuits there?

948
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,800
I feel like that Jason, come on, help us out here.

949
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,240
Yes.

950
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,400
Chips are crisps and cookies are biscuits.

951
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,720
Yeah.

952
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,480
So you were, you're a biscuit beast when you go to the UK.

953
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,680
Oh yeah.

954
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,360
But I was a confused boy when I saw this picture, uh, the other day, cause I was like,

955
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,040
is this grimace?

956
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,160
And then I saw the cookie purse and I was like, ah, I see now.

957
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, right.

958
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,160
The color and the eyes are extremely grimace, but clearly it's a,

959
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
oh, it's a cookie monster.

960
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,600
But also like who, like I just kind of, you know, sometimes I wish my girlfriend

961
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
would dress up for me like the cookie monster.

962
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,240
Yeah.

963
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,320
Well, I didn't put two and two together to begin with, cause I was initially very hot

964
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,160
under the collar when I saw the sheer eroticism of biscuit piece.

965
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,480
Oh, to get into the bedroom and have a hand laid on you that, that is, has a fuzzy

966
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,320
cookie laden fingerless glove.

967
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,880
Oh, cool.

968
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,040
The Palm is rough and crispy.

969
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,440
Great.

970
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,280
Why do these chocolate chips smell?

971
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,200
They smell metallic.

972
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,920
Am I going to get cancer from this biscuit?

973
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,560
Let's see.

974
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,280
This one's very popular on listicles and stuff.

975
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,040
Cyberman or Padre.

976
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,840
This is clearly an attempt at a, at a matrix costume, but then they can give you the choice

977
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,000
that it could also be with the addition of a big hat and a cross and a Bible.

978
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,760
Now you can be a Padre.

979
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,440
This costume does not come with a hat, a big cross or a Bible.

980
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,200
Or it's a common thing that Richard Lewis wears.

981
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:58,800
So to play that exercise, how do you, how do you public domain generic Richard Lewis?

982
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,120
Neurotic, neurotic, neurotic, funny adult.

983
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,760
Yes.

984
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,240
Great.

985
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,600
Neurotic, funny, juice demon.

986
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,640
Cause he sold the Boku.

987
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,040
He sold us the wonderful Boku boxes.

988
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,080
Wait, I don't remember.

989
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,640
I don't remember.

990
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,440
I don't remember.

991
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,240
I don't remember.

992
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,400
He sold us the wonderful Boku boxes.

993
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,520
Wait, I don't remember this.

994
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:21,760
What is this?

995
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,800
I don't know what you're talking about either.

996
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,160
Boku.

997
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,800
You don't remember Boku, the juice box for adults.

998
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,400
What?

999
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,840
Richard Lewis was the spokesman for-

1000
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,640
Yeah, Richard Lewis was the spokesman for Boku.

1001
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,760
This is blowing my mind that you guys don't know Boku.

1002
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,880
This wasn't the scheme with the bag that you put a needle in to make juice at home,

1003
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,520
but you don't need the machine to get the juice.

1004
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,000
Not a Juicero.

1005
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,280
No, that's Juicero.

1006
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,920
Yeah.

1007
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,560
That was-

1008
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:46,880
Wow.

1009
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,680
No, Boku was-

1010
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,160
I see it.

1011
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,360
Juiced vegan in the 90s.

1012
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,160
Yeah, it was like an upscale version of a juice box.

1013
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,440
Still mostly corn syrup, but we would get them.

1014
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,440
They were too, like my mom would never buy that for daily school lunches,

1015
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
but for class trips, well, you get a little treat when you go on a class trip.

1016
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,240
You got the adult juice.

1017
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,440
You got the upscale juice.

1018
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,640
You loved Boku.

1019
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,120
I loved Boku, yeah.

1020
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,000
Because you got, you know, if you're brown bagging it for a class trip,

1021
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,680
you just pick up a hoagie in the morning.

1022
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,520
You pick up a Boku to go with it.

1023
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,120
It's a party.

1024
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,160
More lore that I didn't know is that you loved a juice box

1025
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,640
that I think I've never heard of called Boku

1026
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,160
that was advertised by Richard Lewis in the early 90s.

1027
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,920
Okay, listeners, this is my ask for this episode.

1028
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,160
On the Twitter post announcing this episode, reply, I know Boku.

1029
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,680
Back me up here.

1030
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,280
I just, I just need to know that I'm not denying it exists.

1031
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,360
I just love this bit of lore about this adult juice box that you loved as a kid.

1032
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,280
You get a hoagie Boku.

1033
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,400
Are you guys seeing my money?

1034
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,880
Are you guys seeing my screen with Boku with the Google results?

1035
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah, this is there.

1036
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,280
I mean, I was looking up Richard Lewis, but then there's a weird ad

1037
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,560
that says exclusive cutting edge music offer.

1038
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,360
Wow.

1039
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,680
And then the Boku boxes, which are very upscale,

1040
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,160
are then surrounded by a bunch of CDs.

1041
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,120
And then there's like a zigzag shape that says

1042
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,680
a sampler of the hottest new alternative rock artists.

1043
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,520
And then the frame is like a bunch of clip art guitars and music notes and CDs.

1044
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,400
This is one of the best pieces of art I've ever seen.

1045
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,000
We got to get these Boku CDs.

1046
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,560
What was on the Boku?

1047
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,360
Can I find this?

1048
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,800
What?

1049
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,760
Google.

1050
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,360
What was on the Boku rock sampler?

1051
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,440
The picture looks familiar.

1052
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,880
Maybe we had Boku once or twice, but it did not loom large in my child brain like it did to you.

1053
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,160
I love this Boku.

1054
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,760
I don't know at the risk of getting too caught on Boku,

1055
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,800
but it'll only take a second.

1056
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,880
Should we watch a Richard Lewis Boku drink commercial?

1057
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,000
I think we probably should.

1058
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,960
You got to see this.

1059
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,320
You got to see this.

1060
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,760
One second, queuing it up and take it away, Richard.

1061
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,120
So I go to a party and I got my choice of Coke or Pepsi.

1062
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,000
This isn't right.

1063
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,200
I want a Boku, a seven fruit blend Boku.

1064
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,600
I mean, all this carbonation is very unsettling.

1065
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,640
I don't want to belch anymore.

1066
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,080
Belching is for babies.

1067
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,800
I want to be refreshed naturally, calmly.

1068
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,720
I mean, it's my undeniable right as a man of the 90s to clench my thirst in my own way.

1069
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,680
I want a Boku.

1070
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,120
I've had it.

1071
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,560
People invite me to a party.

1072
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,840
I'm bringing my own Boku.

1073
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,800
Boku fruit juice cooler from McCain.

1074
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,840
Is that too much to ask?

1075
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:48,800
Whoa.

1076
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,760
Whoa.

1077
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,240
No, that was good.

1078
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,840
And there's a bunch more of them too.

1079
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,320
Do you think that if assuming that they go back and were friends for a long time,

1080
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,400
was there some incident like curb-esque incident where Larry David like,

1081
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,600
what's this?

1082
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,720
What do you, they're like, it's a Boku.

1083
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,280
I brought a Boku.

1084
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,160
I brought my own Boku.

1085
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,520
It's a Boku.

1086
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,360
That's not, nobody's drinking Boku.

1087
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,040
So much is still, haven't you having enough of carbonation?

1088
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,280
It's an insult to the people hosting the party to not have their drinks and to bring your own Boku.

1089
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,520
It's a full pot of bring a Boku.

1090
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,880
I think we could maybe pass this idea along at the very least.

1091
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,560
We have a way to do it.

1092
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
So Richard, do we know who's part of curving?

1093
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,040
Sorry, Jason.

1094
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,560
I was going to say Richard, the setup for the episode is they go to Richard's house

1095
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,760
and there's a garage full of Boku palettes.

1096
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,160
Like he's still going through it 30 years later.

1097
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,960
That's a great story.

1098
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,760
Yes.

1099
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,800
To reference the Boku, the Boku phenomenon of, wow, wow, boy, this is a big derail.

1100
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,600
You really, okay.

1101
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,280
So we have to change the costume then to, were you saying this already?

1102
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,400
It's stressed out, it's neurotic Boku pitchman.

1103
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,280
Wow.

1104
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,920
All right then.

1105
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,280
Okay.

1106
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,680
And then we'll find out what was on the Boku rock sampler, that info to come.

1107
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:18,960
Okay.

1108
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,560
Back to the various knockoffs.

1109
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,920
Let's see, we got Hermony Grinder, the top student at Chog Borts.

1110
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,240
That's fantastic.

1111
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,680
Which then says at the bottom, no licensing fees.

1112
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
So I think there's a strand of these ripoffs that are designed to troll.

1113
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,240
Like they are, you know, they know they're being a little cheeky and getting away with

1114
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,440
skirting the copyright.

1115
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,920
That might also get true.

1116
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,400
They get so much more like, how can we incorporate words from the title in a bizarre

1117
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,240
like roundabout way, which is kind of what happens with Hungry Rebel Girl,

1118
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,920
who is, if you aren't looking at it with us, this is Jennifer Lawrence clearly with a bow

1119
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,600
and arrow and she is a hungry rebel girl.

1120
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,200
I like, I guess this is a Gomez Adams, but they frame him as creepy husband.

1121
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,560
I guess so.

1122
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
And oh, and there's that lurking spirit down there.

1123
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,760
That's an official spirit one.

1124
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
Video game guy.

1125
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
That's a Mario.

1126
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Forget stranger things.

1127
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,040
We got to get into unusual events.

1128
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,080
That's fun.

1129
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:39,680
And then I'm also, I'm a fan of Don McDreadful, who is like an undead Ronald McDonald, I suppose.

1130
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,880
That's good.

1131
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,360
I mean, that's almost in the same biscuit beast where you're like, you've almost created

1132
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:45,840
it.

1133
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,520
You've kind of created something else.

1134
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,120
So I give a kudos.

1135
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,680
Yeah, I guess that's the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1136
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,800
the ultimate if you can create your own desirable IP.

1137
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,600
Cause I'd watch a Don McDreadful movie.

1138
00:59:59,600 --> 00:59:59,920
Sure.

1139
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,680
And I'd love to, yeah, meet the biscuit beast and Jason would love to marry the biscuit beast.

1140
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,200
Yeah.

1141
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,680
Now you've also got the, I categorize these as comedy.

1142
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,560
This is the comedy file, which is pretty dominated by Mike Myers because I mean, Austin

1143
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,600
Powers costumes.

1144
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,520
I really hope they never die.

1145
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,720
And it's so fun to think about somebody showing up somewhere in an Austin Powers costume and

1146
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,920
expecting a reaction.

1147
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,400
So here we got a men's sixties movie, Jigalow, man of mystery.

1148
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:47,120
We got a sixties groovy man who doesn't have glasses.

1149
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,360
I mean, he's basically just in a, like a George Washington costume without the, the powdered

1150
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:53,680
wig.

1151
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,480
And then 60s swinger costume, Halloween groovy man, funny spy suit.

1152
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,160
And wait, I forgot one.

1153
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,240
I, well, I think of the rest of mine in this file were just the fact that there, I think

1154
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,120
there was a real flood of love guru costumes.

1155
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,320
Oh, wow.

1156
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,440
They, I think like they, they were anticipating this, like, well, we got to get ahead of it

1157
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,400
this time.

1158
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,040
And there was not much to get ahead of, perhaps similar to a general aladean.

1159
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,480
I found some results for the dictator general aladean costume, which did not go quite as

1160
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,560
well as Borat in the Halloween world.

1161
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,080
So that's, that's some comedy in terms of things that you should not be this year.

1162
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,120
And especially that a little child should not be.

1163
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,680
I take you to the category cops.

1164
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,480
So I guess we're getting into baby stuff at this point.

1165
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,640
You know, here we have a little cop baby, little, little police bunting.

1166
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,200
And this is a thing I'm obsessed with is the really mundane word bunting, which is

1167
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:11,120
basically if you're, you know, your baby can't like wear pants yet, like, and, and has

1168
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,800
to just be in a bag.

1169
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,920
So within bagged Halloween costumes, if you're buying your baby, a baby bag, the official

1170
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,600
phrase for that is a bunting.

1171
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,440
That's your vocabulary for the day.

1172
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,680
So this is a police bunting.

1173
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,760
And there's a little catchphrase that goes with it.

1174
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,160
Just hand over the milk and no one gets hurt.

1175
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,600
So the baby is the.

1176
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:32,720
Crimin?

1177
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,040
No, no, no, no, the baby is the milk has been stolen from someone else and the baby is

1178
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,560
trying to get it back unrelated to the fact that it's a baby.

1179
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,040
That baby's just doing its job.

1180
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,760
Yeah, I guess so.

1181
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,160
Unless this baby only investigates milk based crime.

1182
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,480
This baby has its gun trained on Serpico.

1183
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,080
Like you got, we told you to back off Serpico.

1184
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,240
You just couldn't mind your business.

1185
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:11,840
I'm also imagining a, a scar face with just giant piles of like bags of milk sticking

1186
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,640
his face in it.

1187
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,360
Baby scarface.

1188
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,200
I mean, that's a good costume.

1189
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,840
Maybe that is maybe that's the idea is there are everyone's babies in this universe.

1190
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,120
I mean, that's a cool, like, I mean, I have, I have one baby, so that's a start.

1191
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,320
And if I could find other people with babies who wish to make of the full film, baby scarface.

1192
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,880
And I'm sorry, but my baby is going to be cast as baby scarface because we had the idea.

1193
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,960
Other roles are up for grabs.

1194
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,160
Baby Michelle Pfeiffer.

1195
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,080
We're open.

1196
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,800
I'll start casting.

1197
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:58,960
We got this, this guy who's wearing like a, like a floppy fisherman's hat with a police badge.

1198
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,320
On it.

1199
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,960
Kind of like if Gilligan was a police officer.

1200
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,840
This one says you're never too young for the force.

1201
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,560
Followed by outfit closes with snaps for easy diaper changing.

1202
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,040
I don't mean to give you more ideas here, but what do you think about a reboot of Gilligan's

1203
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,720
Island where he's a police officer?

1204
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,480
Would you do it?

1205
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,320
Sounds good to me.

1206
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,920
Is it just that he like, it's the same thing.

1207
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,000
They land on an Island, but he decides to be the law and order.

1208
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,480
Shipmate.

1209
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,000
It doesn't, he doesn't have a boat.

1210
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,600
There's nothing to do with an Island.

1211
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,520
It's just the Gilligan is a cop.

1212
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,560
Yeah, it's Gilligan is a cop.

1213
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,520
His name is Gilligan.

1214
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,960
They call him Gil though.

1215
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,460
Okay.

1216
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,560
And are the other characters in it or is this like, we keep saying like a Gotham kind of thing,

1217
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,160
where they're all spread out.

1218
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,360
It's an origin story.

1219
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,200
Yeah, it's just hell.

1220
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:51,840
Yeah.

1221
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,480
All right.

1222
01:04:52,480 --> 01:05:00,080
So like brief, like we get to maybe see the skipper get his boat license and we get to

1223
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,920
see a young Mr. Howell like doing all the scamming that gets him his riches.

1224
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:06,800
Right.

1225
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:12,240
And like, you're gonna see a movie in season three and the movie star is in it.

1226
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,600
Oh yeah.

1227
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,320
Oh, that's good.

1228
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,460
Yeah.

1229
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,760
Like, like boy, wouldn't it wouldn't mind being stranded somewhere with her.

1230
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,200
Right.

1231
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:27,520
That's the voice of a British playing American, a British playing Brooklyn voice guy who is

1232
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,800
Gilligan in this.

1233
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,720
And Gilligan is hot.

1234
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,200
And by the series finale, he has planted a gun on all the castaways.

1235
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,360
And when once they're all being transported, he's like, all right,

1236
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,400
we're getting on this boat to Rikers Island.

1237
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,800
And that's when they wash up.

1238
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,240
Oh, they're all, they've all been rounded up by crooked cop Gilligan.

1239
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,440
Yeah.

1240
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:53,840
Wow.

1241
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,760
And then as opposed to the theme song where the shipwreck is handled in about two seconds,

1242
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,840
this is like a full episodes worth of CGI tossing and turning digital storms.

1243
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,360
We have to finally render the storm the way it was meant to be seen.

1244
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,400
I'm in this.

1245
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,240
We should all get together and make the extremely serious.

1246
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,080
Is it just called Gilligan?

1247
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,880
Does Gilligan wait?

1248
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,640
We've talked about this to Gilligan have a first name.

1249
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,440
Well, we looked it up and I've already forgot.

1250
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,680
We knew this came up in fact every six months, we forget everything.

1251
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,040
We forget what skipper means versus captain.

1252
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,000
We forget all of it.

1253
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,360
I know we've done all this.

1254
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,880
What's Gilligan's first name?

1255
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,360
Damn it.

1256
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,440
Skipper steers.

1257
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,520
Skipper does the pushing and the steering.

1258
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,040
But skipper outranks Gilligan is what I'm saying.

1259
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:44,640
Yeah.

1260
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,140
Yeah.

1261
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,820
You're still not sure.

1262
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,660
I don't know if he does have a name.

1263
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,060
So is it just the show just called Minnow?

1264
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,820
Minnow is good.

1265
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,060
Yeah.

1266
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,300
Yeah.

1267
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:55,620
Yeah.

1268
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:59,220
That's a good even though we don't get to the Minnow until season eight.

1269
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,380
Oh, what about calling it three hour tour?

1270
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,460
That's a little half, but it's such a slow build.

1271
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:08,740
It's not bad.

1272
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,740
Three hour tour is what you can call a lot of our episodes as well.

1273
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:13,620
Yeah.

1274
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,900
I mean, the best actually though, we wanted to be afraid to run Gilligan,

1275
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,540
but calling it because we remember we went through all this.

1276
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,860
The skipper's real name is Jonas Grumby.

1277
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,340
Yes.

1278
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:24,740
Yes.

1279
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,180
Of course, it's Jonas Grumby.

1280
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:30,820
So the show being well, maybe the skipper centric spinoff is called Grumby.

1281
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,100
Oh yeah, for sure.

1282
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,540
Not Gumby, Grumby.

1283
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,780
You know, I was in the baby territory.

1284
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,260
Do we want to look at some more baby buntings?

1285
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,260
Yeah, sure.

1286
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:42,900
Go for it.

1287
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,140
Great.

1288
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,460
Great.

1289
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,580
And if you have babies, toss them in the mix.

1290
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,460
I have like, they're a little older than babies.

1291
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,180
Is that okay?

1292
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,220
I think that's okay.

1293
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,060
Well, we'll close out babies because once you can wear pants more comfortably,

1294
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,700
then you graduate from the buntings, but it limits you.

1295
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,940
What can you be that's a bag?

1296
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,420
Well, a bag can be a burrito.

1297
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,620
This is officially licensed.

1298
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:10,420
This is a Taco Bell shredded chicken seven layer burrito.

1299
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,500
And again, when you talk about that Photoshoppery,

1300
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,020
this is a position that I've been with a baby and I know this is true.

1301
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,420
No baby could hold this position.

1302
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,740
This is not a way that a baby can physically be.

1303
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:24,500
Yeah.

1304
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,780
And the head is not.

1305
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,660
The head is cut off by this burrito.

1306
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,820
Where's the rest of his skull?

1307
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,580
Yeah, it's gone.

1308
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,140
It's missing.

1309
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,700
They chopped off this baby's head.

1310
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,580
This is by the way, a good costume if it looks like this in real life.

1311
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,580
It's just, I feel like assembled, this can't look this good,

1312
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,220
because especially because the baby cannot stand like this.

1313
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:51,540
We're looking at basically like a printed out version of the layers.

1314
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:56,180
Like there's the bean part and the rice part and the shredded lettuce part.

1315
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:00,340
But like that's got to be full of scan lines.

1316
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,740
That's going to be the worst printing quality.

1317
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,060
Yeah.

1318
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,180
Doing this cheaply, there's no way that's going to look good.

1319
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:10,340
And also it's going to get puked on and this costume is going to be off in eight minutes.

1320
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:19,140
This Spock, this Star Trek Spock is one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.

1321
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,220
So he's in a bag.

1322
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:26,900
He's in a bag that is meant to recall the uniforms.

1323
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:34,420
But then like he's in a wig, like a headpiece with the big Spock ears,

1324
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:40,340
but then they drew eyebrows on him, which doesn't seem right.

1325
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,060
And then I was talking to Erin about this, like you can't put eyebrows on a baby.

1326
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,820
She said, actually makeup is safe.

1327
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,700
I think we could, like we could put fake eyebrows on our boy if we wanted to.

1328
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,540
And of course that did make me want to.

1329
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:58,180
Just for normal times, not even Halloween.

1330
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:58,820
Oh yeah.

1331
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,780
Just like one day.

1332
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:01,700
All right.

1333
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,060
It's Eyebrow Thursday.

1334
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,500
Stop squirming.

1335
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,020
Erin, look who's mad at you.

1336
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,700
Look who's mad at what you've been doing.

1337
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:20,020
Well, if you give him kind of like frazzled, stressed out eyebrows and put a wig on him,

1338
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,340
it's like fuzzy long hair, then he could be baby Richard Lewis.

1339
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,020
That's the idea, I think.

1340
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,500
Not enough for Richard Lewis costumes.

1341
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,820
We already saw this Batman.

1342
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,860
This little rocket ship is pretty genuinely adorable.

1343
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,620
That's just good.

1344
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,060
With no arms poking out.

1345
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,740
I guess this is like a swaddle.

1346
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,180
I'm through this phase already, but yeah, if you need to just wrap them up.

1347
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,180
Yes, we've trapped our baby in this rocket ship.

1348
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,580
I like this original IP.

1349
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,300
Baby Derek the Dinosaur.

1350
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,420
Is that Barney?

1351
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,780
No, it's Derek.

1352
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,300
No, oh, it's Derek.

1353
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,620
No, Jason, come on.

1354
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,500
Oh, original.

1355
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:04,820
Okay.

1356
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,580
He's got spikes.

1357
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,860
Barney doesn't have spikes.

1358
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,660
This one's very confusing.

1359
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,580
Bunting home run costume.

1360
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,940
Jesus.

1361
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:17,460
What we're looking at here is a baby in a backwards cap and then a baseball

1362
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,220
uniform, but then the bottom half of him is just a big floppy baseball.

1363
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,660
What's the scenario that leads to this?

1364
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:34,180
Is the baseball very big or is it regular sized and the baseball player is very small?

1365
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,100
I think this is what happens when a big baseball fan gets his wish.

1366
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:44,420
He, his wife gives birth to half baby, half baseball.

1367
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,820
I think this is a dream come true.

1368
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:58,980
Or if you had intercourse with a woman who is dressed like a sexy baseball player or umpire,

1369
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,180
this could be the results in a perfect way in a world where magic is possible.

1370
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:05,700
That's right.

1371
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,300
This is what the monkey Paul, we like, oh man, I wanna

1372
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,860
I want to have sex with that woman.

1373
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,060
She's dressed like a sexy baseball player.

1374
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,460
I love, I just love baseball so much and I'm so scared to have a kid.

1375
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,820
I don't know if I could do it.

1376
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,900
I don't know if I'm a responsibility.

1377
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:28,100
If only a kid was as simple as a beautiful little baseball.

1378
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,660
One finger goes down.

1379
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,940
One finger goes down.

1380
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,700
That's a monkey.

1381
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,900
That's a monkey's mitt.

1382
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,100
We, it's a baseball themed.

1383
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,660
Now my son and I, we don't play catch.

1384
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,860
He is the catch.

1385
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,580
What a beautiful thing.

1386
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:56,900
Being at the ultrasound and like, all right, I guess I'm scared.

1387
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,620
I don't know.

1388
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,900
I'm scared to be a dad, but I'll go find out if it's a boy or a girl.

1389
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,740
And then the doctor like, wait a minute.

1390
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,620
I, what's that?

1391
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,060
I see stitching.

1392
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:07,780
Home run.

1393
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:17,380
And then like the disappointment if it's like we see a racquetball.

1394
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,980
I'll still love you.

1395
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,140
Is there like a surgery we could do?

1396
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,100
Please doc, help me.

1397
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,340
Poor sports fan, man.

1398
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,700
This is nice.

1399
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,940
This is an episode of a really lame, slightly sports tinge Twilight Zone.

1400
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,340
Twilight Zone sports edition.

1401
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,460
So I don't even remember what this is.

1402
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,340
Is he a worm?

1403
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,500
Yeah, that's a flesh nightmare.

1404
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,140
That's a, yeah, this is, that's rough.

1405
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,220
Yeah, this is what happens if you have a child in within incest.

1406
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,060
You get weird floppy flesh being.

1407
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,260
Is it a turd?

1408
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,300
Oh my God.

1409
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,860
It kind of looks like a, yeah, it's kind of like a skin colored piece of poop.

1410
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:16,360
Yes.

1411
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,320
Yeah.

1412
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,060
You.

1413
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:19,540
All right.

1414
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,700
Well, let's try to erase this forever.

1415
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,460
Here's a baby that's a, a turkey on a platter.

1416
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:26,900
That's cute.

1417
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,180
This I think, no.

1418
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:28,680
What?

1419
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,260
No, it's not.

1420
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:35,220
You just see turkey on a table and you start watering from the mouth.

1421
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,660
Ding, ding, ding.

1422
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,620
Ring the dinner bell.

1423
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,180
That's cute.

1424
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:39,620
All right.

1425
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,300
I guess we got to do the poll on this one.

1426
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,180
Is this cute?

1427
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,300
I don't think it's cute.

1428
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,500
Babies are to be eaten.

1429
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:49,140
Look, I'm not Tom Hanks or Hillary Clinton.

1430
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,220
I don't believe that babies are to be eaten.

1431
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,820
They put the babies on the silver platter.

1432
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:57,940
They eat them.

1433
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:02,180
What's the thing that makes you boy like, oh boy, eating a turkey,

1434
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:05,460
it just makes me so tired because it's full of all that Adrena chrome.

1435
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,700
I just nap the whole rest of Thanksgiving.

1436
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,940
Also that this one has like little like lace, like it's a, what are the belts?

1437
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:23,860
The thing that you at stupid weddings do the like the man takes the belt off the woman's leg.

1438
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,740
The garter belt.

1439
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,780
The garter belt.

1440
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,660
The thing we definitely did not do with like the, where the band blow.

1441
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,060
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1442
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,060
I mean, look, sorry if you're listening to this and you had a wedding where that happened,

1443
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,340
but like that's the thing, at least with Aaron that comes up.

1444
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:43,380
And then are you guys going to do the belt and the fuck?

1445
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:43,620
No.

1446
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,900
Did you do that at your prom?

1447
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:48,900
Did you guys?

1448
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,380
Yes.

1449
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,020
Yes.

1450
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,500
Did you?

1451
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:55,380
My prom date senior year had the flu and she's like, I'm not doing it here.

1452
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,140
Like just handed it to me.

1453
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,380
Wait, did you, you're not talking, you didn't do a ceremony where it's removed from her leg.

1454
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:02,340
Yes.

1455
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,980
Oh, the room, the whole class.

1456
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,220
Yes.

1457
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,180
We had to do that.

1458
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,460
What are you talking about?

1459
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:07,780
What?

1460
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:08,740
Yeah.

1461
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,220
Yeah.

1462
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:09,860
Yes.

1463
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,940
That's, that's very inappropriate.

1464
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:12,980
I agree with you.

1465
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:14,100
Yeah.

1466
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,460
A lot of people went with friends and acquaintances, no romance involved.

1467
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,300
So it was like super weird.

1468
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,300
A lot of people were like, nah, I'm sitting this out.

1469
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:21,700
Oh yeah.

1470
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,060
If you go with a friend and then you got to take off her garter belt.

1471
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:25,700
Wait, what do you mean?

1472
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,900
Do they all like line up?

1473
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,820
I didn't go to prom full disclosure.

1474
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,340
So I wouldn't know.

1475
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,940
My memory of it is like hazy and like, like I was nervous.

1476
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:36,980
It is.

1477
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,380
Yeah.

1478
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,060
It's a good choice of words.

1479
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,660
It is like a hazing.

1480
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:47,940
I don't know who the hazer is because everyone is being hazed, but like there's like a handful

1481
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:53,300
of actual serious 18 year old couple or it's like we've been dating since we were 13 and

1482
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,540
it's like, they're really into it.

1483
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:58,340
And it's just like everyone else is just like, oh God.

1484
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,580
Is that still for the younger listeners?

1485
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,860
Is that still happening?

1486
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,580
Cause it does.

1487
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,380
Honestly, you just jogged the memory that I've completely forgot.

1488
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:11,700
It's also like, you know, then you get into like same sex couple territory.

1489
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,740
Like everybody has to do this garter belt exercise.

1490
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,940
What are you talking about?

1491
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:21,380
This is, does everybody just like line up in a, like on it, like, is it just a bunch

1492
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,220
of chairs and then everybody's gotta get down?

1493
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:23,940
Kind of.

1494
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:28,740
Hey, usually we try to make little edits seamless.

1495
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,540
We had to step away because Mike got a phone call, but in this case, I have to say that

1496
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:40,500
amid that discussion of the garter belts at prom, I stepped out and I said hi to Aaron,

1497
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,820
my wife, and I said that we're in there talking about how I like it.

1498
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,540
Prom, you would take off your dates garter belt.

1499
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,060
Did you do that at prom?

1500
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:51,780
And much like she said when it came up about our wedding, she said, fuck no.

1501
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:57,780
And then followed that by that's some Midwest bullshit in California.

1502
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,340
That shit didn't fly even in the nineties.

1503
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,380
Quote Aaron.

1504
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:06,500
She also apologized if she alienated any Midwest listeners.

1505
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:10,980
But yeah, we did it in the Northeast too.

1506
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,420
Thank you very much.

1507
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:18,420
After we took the expensive limo that was well stocked with soda, but the TV was broken.

1508
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,900
I'm remembering this now.

1509
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:28,260
And I think if I'm correct, my, when I went to junior prom, my date ran away.

1510
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:30,500
What?

1511
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,820
Instead of having this happen.

1512
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,420
Oh, no, not from you from this horrible show.

1513
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,460
Well, from me in this instance.

1514
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:43,140
I mean, but you, you weren't part of this barbaric, uh, like, no, I wasn't like auction.

1515
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,180
You get besked here.

1516
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:49,700
This is, I think I might've been like a little bit like embarrassed by that.

1517
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,820
Even though in hindsight, of course, yeah, like, I don't know.

1518
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,860
What are we 16?

1519
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,940
Like, this is everyone's underage.

1520
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,740
It sucks.

1521
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,180
It's really weird.

1522
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:59,540
Everyone's under age.

1523
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,100
Sex was like in the media.

1524
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,700
It was 24 seven in the media, but also very shameful.

1525
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,180
I mean, in the fashion of the time, it's like women, they're like, yeah, wear a nice dress

1526
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,780
and put a pair of jeans under it.

1527
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,540
It's just like, this was a crazy time to grow up and come of age.

1528
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,540
Nowadays kids got only fans.

1529
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,740
Kids got only fans.

1530
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,540
They got porn.

1531
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,340
Kids.

1532
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,060
You know, gender's fluid.

1533
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,620
Everything.

1534
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:28,100
Everyone seems like they're having either everyone's having sex or no one's having sex.

1535
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,980
What is this?

1536
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,460
I don't know.

1537
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,180
It's just, I'm saying it seems better.

1538
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:36,180
It seemed you don't know how good you have.

1539
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,260
Like you can just look up stuff on your phone.

1540
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,340
If you have a question, you can answer it in seconds.

1541
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,420
Find a supportive community.

1542
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,380
Yes.

1543
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:47,380
If you have like a fascination or a curiosity about something, you can look it up and find

1544
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:52,340
probably some results that don't say you are a freak for feeling this way.

1545
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:57,140
Here is a Baptist group that will beat this desire out of you.

1546
01:19:59,300 --> 01:19:59,700
Yes.

1547
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,180
No, no, no.

1548
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,340
In that regard, things are much better.

1549
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:09,460
I hope that in 2020, underage people are not made to line up in some bizarre burlesque show.

1550
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:17,380
It's not a phrase I use very often, but this prom thing is far too

1551
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,180
body.

1552
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:21,620
This is too body to stand.

1553
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,940
I hope this is criminalized.

1554
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,100
I agree.

1555
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,060
This is weird.

1556
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,100
God, that's bizarre.

1557
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,620
I really have blocked that out and probably because of the junior prom incident where

1558
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,140
I felt like shame, shamed.

1559
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:40,820
Everyone should feel this is like I felt too awkward to like put my hands on somebody's hips.

1560
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:45,540
Now, several years later, like after like a middle school day, you have to like,

1561
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,980
all right, now, well, now we've stepped it up.

1562
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,300
And now what you have to do is like take a little like lazy thing off of a girl.

1563
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,100
This is awful.

1564
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,860
This is these big we're too young here.

1565
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:00,420
People should not be wearing leg Avenue type wardrobe.

1566
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:05,860
Yeah, I am curious though, if if people other people did this.

1567
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:13,940
Yeah, well, let us know if you did unless that triggers severe trauma to remember having done.

1568
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,180
Yes.

1569
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,940
Good point.

1570
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:22,420
This entire episode will make some people just like, like go to a bad place and convulse.

1571
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:24,420
Yick.

1572
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,540
Okay.

1573
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:25,780
Yeah.

1574
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,780
Just Godspeed.

1575
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,620
If you're coming to me, if you're an adolescent coming of age in the era of like

1576
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:36,740
iPhones and social media and Donald Trump, like Godspeed.

1577
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,380
God bless.

1578
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,460
I it's a lot.

1579
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:43,380
I it's yeah, it's it's it's too much coming.

1580
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:48,100
Being in high school around 9 11 war on terror was already a fucking nightmare.

1581
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:53,700
Like I well into anyone, if you're hearing this and that message,

1582
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,700
and that means that not only are you dealing with that kind of thing and the climate that we're in,

1583
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:05,380
but also you are as a under 18 person interested in a podcast, a theme park podcast

1584
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:11,700
where people do extended runs about young Grundy the grumber grumpy,

1585
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,580
which is the real name of the skipper on killing.

1586
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:19,460
Like you're completely socially screwed if you're, if you're hearing this right now.

1587
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,900
Sorry.

1588
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:21,540
Apologies.

1589
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,100
We were you once.

1590
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,020
The little one finds an excuse.

1591
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:27,780
The little one finds an excuse to talk like a carny every other episode.

1592
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,340
It's great.

1593
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:33,060
It's so what do you think you want to get a subscription to it's the second gate.

1594
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,820
They call it the cemetery gate for Halloween.

1595
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:35,540
It's pretty fun.

1596
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,620
This is a conversation that is not happening.

1597
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:39,780
No.

1598
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,100
There are no 15 year olds.

1599
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,660
Also, I like that we've been having this discussion about this bizarre proms ritual

1600
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:54,580
while looking at a cloth to Turkey on top of a baby on a banquet table.

1601
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,300
It's just been on my desktop for 15 minutes.

1602
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:01,220
We got to get out of here, but well, not before looking at this little boy

1603
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:07,620
in a, in a popcorn bag bunting, which has an old timey movie camera on it.

1604
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,220
And then he's wearing like a fuzzy hat wig that is popcorn.

1605
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,460
Yeah, that's just cute.

1606
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,340
I think that's cute.

1607
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,660
The hat, the helmet is weird.

1608
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,420
It doesn't really look like popcorn.

1609
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:25,060
It mean it looks like, um, uh, which, um, stooge curly, I guess.

1610
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,340
It looked a bit curly.

1611
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:26,500
Yes.

1612
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,500
Oh wait, am I thinking of no, no, no, not curled?

1613
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:28,660
No.

1614
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,460
And Mark's brothers.

1615
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,220
I, uh, I get the whole heart.

1616
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:31,940
Are you talking about Harpo?

1617
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,380
I'm talking about Harpo.

1618
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:33,620
Yeah.

1619
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,380
Um, I don't feel that bad that I get those confused.

1620
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,260
That's probably for the best that I'm not huge on any of this.

1621
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,220
Mark's brother's better than these dudes.

1622
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:43,940
Yeah, I think that's great.

1623
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:44,020
Yeah.

1624
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,260
Yeah.

1625
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:44,340
Yeah.

1626
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:44,580
Yeah.

1627
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,220
Uh, speaking of old timey stuff, look at this baby.

1628
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,940
Hey, hey, it's baby bugs.

1629
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:50,420
He is.

1630
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:54,740
See, I'm going to sing sing juvie division.

1631
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:59,220
See, that is the most Photoshop thing I've ever seen.

1632
01:23:59,220 --> 01:23:59,540
Yes.

1633
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,820
And there's no such baby.

1634
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,500
Not impossible way to sit up.

1635
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:10,260
I I'm too young for a gun, but I'm pointing my hand in a gun as question.

1636
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:15,700
See that might be a doll that they Photoshopped to make more realistic.

1637
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,020
Hey, I'm I'm teething.

1638
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,460
Hey, would you mind if I, uh, sucked on some jewels?

1639
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,580
Doesn't let me stop them.

1640
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,260
Baby bugs.

1641
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,580
He is now appeared on the podcast.

1642
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,300
Little baby bugsy animated show coming soon.

1643
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,020
Um, okay.

1644
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:39,220
What, uh, I do, I do, I've been talking, I've been leading the, this horrifying photo

1645
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:39,940
slideshow for a while.

1646
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,460
Is there anything else you guys are?

1647
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,380
Let me just give you a grab bag here.

1648
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:43,860
Sure.

1649
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,900
Some things.

1650
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:49,620
Uh, yeah, this is a brand that I like, and I didn't see if there were many more, but

1651
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:55,780
I like this branding of the, so this is like encompasses a whole line, perhaps of items.

1652
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,180
Uh, this is the beatnik scene brand.

1653
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,300
Speaking of unrelatable things.

1654
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,500
The beatnik scene and it's a beret.

1655
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:08,260
So I assume beatnik scene exists and you can be all different types of beatniks.

1656
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,700
Uh, I don't know who wants that.

1657
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,980
Beatnik scene.

1658
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,580
Now, if we're, if we're really going to appeal to the younger kids, I want everyone to know

1659
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:26,020
that Gilligan before was on, uh, a show called Dobie Gillis and he played a beatnik.

1660
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,260
Hopefully Maynard G Krebs is his character's name.

1661
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,220
That's the thing my parents talked about for sure.

1662
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:33,700
Yes.

1663
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,260
Yeah.

1664
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:39,700
That's, uh, my mom talks about that a couple of times a week still that looms large, uh,

1665
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,580
in her mind.

1666
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,060
Oh, you know, I missed, well, yeah, let me do this.

1667
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,420
I missed this one.

1668
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,660
Uh, this is not the mad hatter.

1669
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,340
This is the delightful hatter.

1670
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,860
Oh, there's a leg Avenue from leg Avenue.

1671
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,780
The delightful hatter, not mad.

1672
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,780
That's a better thing to be.

1673
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,460
Your head together.

1674
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:09,940
Let's do, uh, yeah, let me just do a couple of kid costumes and then I think I'm good.

1675
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:16,500
Uh, let's start with this, which is just, uh, just cute, honestly.

1676
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:24,820
And we, it's a child, Mr. Mailman, an official USP license.

1677
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,900
USPS costume.

1678
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,460
Wow.

1679
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:31,620
Save our democracy by buying this Mr. Postman costume.

1680
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:32,500
Yes.

1681
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,940
Your toddler.

1682
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,780
And then let's, this is probably the, my favorite thing that I found.

1683
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:44,420
And you tell me, I think, I think you will agree.

1684
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:46,020
This is Dr. Littles.

1685
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,580
The child doctor, Dr. Littles.

1686
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,820
Again, original IP.

1687
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:55,700
Yes.

1688
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,540
This is not Doogie Howser.

1689
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,740
It's Dr. Littles.

1690
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,460
That's my favorite thing I found.

1691
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:07,780
Um, oh, what a, yeah.

1692
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,060
Cute kid too.

1693
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:09,540
Wow.

1694
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,940
Good for Dr. Littles and he's younger than Doogie.

1695
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:16,100
He made it through, made it through little metal medical school even faster.

1696
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,980
That's right.

1697
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:17,620
Wow.

1698
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:18,580
Oh yeah.

1699
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,980
Dr. Littles is king is my king.

1700
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,460
Yeah.

1701
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:21,960
Yeah.

1702
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,720
Uh, um, let's see.

1703
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:29,640
I had some more in the, uh, in the, uh, sexy category.

1704
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:36,280
Um, I don't have to go through all of these, but, uh, um, I like that's a good off-brand,

1705
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:42,120
uh, uh, naughty napping princess, which I guess is, uh, Mario.

1706
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,120
Um, Harley, wait.

1707
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,600
No, it's Sleeping Beauty.

1708
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,200
Oh, yeah.

1709
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,000
Oh, wait, you're right.

1710
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,520
Oh, yeah.

1711
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,240
Napping.

1712
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:55,560
I guess I just, it's very like Daisy, uh, or Pete.

1713
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,240
I get them confused too.

1714
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:02,360
It's a good, um, uh, you've also got a sexy Beetlejuice who has got the juice.

1715
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,560
Um, Harley Quinn is presented as daddy's little disaster.

1716
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,360
Um, let's see.

1717
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,880
Spooky family daughter.

1718
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:18,840
We saw cruel villain, a couple of, a couple of rays, galaxy rebel and human space scavenger.

1719
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:28,040
Um, but the weirdest one, uh, despicable human costume, which is, uh, like overall,

1720
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,680
it's, I mean, it's clearly like mini you're a sexy minion.

1721
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,200
Um, which why, right?

1722
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,760
I don't, I'm, I don't know the psychological profile of being interested in a sexy minion.

1723
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:48,520
Um, well, we'd have to, you might leap to that assumption, but I don't want to, um,

1724
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,360
we should, we'll, we'll discuss it.

1725
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:50,920
Okay.

1726
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,880
We'll ask him.

1727
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,200
Uh, and then this is pretty inexplicable.

1728
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,480
A sexy tariff.

1729
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,480
Mr. Trump.

1730
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,280
Mr. Sir.

1731
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,840
Uh, a distant trade war is upon us.

1732
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,440
Will you resist it?

1733
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:15,960
Show off your assets and be the hottest import in town with this exclusive sexy tariff costume.

1734
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,040
Um, made in the USA.

1735
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,680
No way.

1736
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,200
Absolute lies.

1737
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:22,680
No way.

1738
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,200
No way at all.

1739
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,800
None of these are made at the US.

1740
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:31,720
Because if this was an imported good, not made in the USA, that's kind of odd.

1741
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:38,280
Um, I also found the same company Yandy makes a, uh, a sexy mail-in ballot.

1742
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,080
So they're there with the 2020 topical.

1743
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,480
Oh, well, here, well, maybe that, that takes us into

1744
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,360
2020 topical.

1745
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,360
Um, because.

1746
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,480
Oh, oh, yes.

1747
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,840
Oh, I was going to say I have some grabby points.

1748
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,280
Let's grab baguette too.

1750
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,080
But go, do you want me to do it now?

1751
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,240
Um, I, it's up to you.

1752
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:04,520
I, I, well, I might, I might take it into a topical direction after this.

1753
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,680
So do you want to, you want to grab baguette?

1754
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,320
Yeah, let me just, I just have three real quick.

1755
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,360
Um, so I will share the screen.

1756
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,280
Um, this one is very poetic, Mike.

1757
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,840
I'm surprised you didn't have this one, uh, pubescent frog of silent war,

1758
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,720
which is this is a TV.

1759
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,840
That seems fake.

1760
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,800
That seems fake.

1761
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,960
That's a troll.

1762
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:31,480
I think that's of that variety of, uh, uh, her, her main, uh, grinder.

1763
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,080
Right.

1764
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,120
Yeah.

1765
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:34,840
That's insane.

1766
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:42,920
This one I am thinking of, uh, doing a lawsuit because it's a title that I also hold.

1767
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,120
Uh, governor of taste.

1768
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,720
That's sky Fieri.

1769
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,520
Oh, a bagged guy Fieri.

1770
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,400
That's incredible.

1771
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:53,880
Yeah.

1772
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,000
The mayor of flavor town.

1773
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,440
Now the governor of taste.

1774
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,040
And then this one kind of circles back around to one from earlier,

1775
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,080
but it asks a lot more questions than it answers.

1776
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,840
So this is deluxe blue 60 swinger costume from then.

1777
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,000
So it seems like a copyright free Austin powers, right?

1778
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,440
But it's under the header Austin powers costumes.

1779
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,720
The other thing about it.

1780
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:22,360
And I thought the appeal of bagged Halloween costumes is you get everything in one bag,

1781
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,280
but this is just the suit.

1782
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,920
You have to buy the wig and the glasses separately.

1783
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:27,880
Boo.

1784
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,920
Also a common element of all these things.

1785
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:35,720
You so often do not get every item depicted on that bag.

1786
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:35,960
Right.

1787
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,480
There is the scam.

1788
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,440
That is what these leg avenues are pulling on us.

1789
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:40,680
Right.

1790
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,120
Hmm.

1791
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:46,200
And then the final, maybe the most perplexing part of this one,

1792
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,160
items out of stock until October 30th.

1793
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:55,320
Now you're really playing with fire if you're trying to get it by October 30th.

1794
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,040
You know, I need it for my zoom Halloween.

1795
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,600
Yeah.

1796
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,080
Maybe I'll get everyone to delay their zoom Halloween until November.

1797
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,760
We have to hold it till after the election.

1798
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,600
Everybody's too stressed out for Halloween.

1799
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:10,680
For sure.

1800
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:11,800
Oh, wait.

1801
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,200
Well, which takes us right into the election related things.

1802
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:22,200
We are barreling towards it and they can't always use the candidates names.

1803
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,600
So that leaves us with comb over candidate,

1804
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,400
which I just realized says under it, similar to human hair.

1805
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,720
Kind of like the real guy.

1806
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,040
Right.

1807
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,480
Close, but no cigar.

1808
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:42,680
In that category, here's billionaire presidential candidate mask.

1809
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,320
We got, I mean, this just says Trump 2020 face mask,

1810
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,280
but this is the scariest.

1811
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,000
Oh, my God.

1812
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,400
That's how we thought he would look coming out of the hospital.

1813
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,960
I think COVID.

1814
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,800
Had he not been so doped up?

1815
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:02,200
Yeah.

1816
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,240
And then other topical folks.

1817
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:10,360
Here's balding old man wig, which is clearly meant to be Bernie.

1818
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:15,240
But I feel like this in other years was probably just like a Benjamin Franklin

1819
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,240
or like a Thomas Edison or something.

1820
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,400
He's also wearing little glasses like what Santa Claus would wear.

1821
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:24,120
But it might just be that guy's glasses, though.

1822
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,160
That's just what he brought.

1823
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,640
And then this is a specific subsect.

1824
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,000
This guy gets a little artsy.

1825
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
He's like an auteur of this area.

1826
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:41,400
He lists his own name, Chuck Jarman, and he combines presidents with other themes

1827
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:48,920
such as Reagan Stein, Frankenstein Reagan, Barocula, a vampire.

1828
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,240
This is a depiction of how half the country sees Barack Obama.

1829
01:33:54,200 --> 01:34:02,040
And then next to that, G.W. of the Apes, which is a genuinely affecting haunting.

1830
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,320
This could be in Anomalisa or something.

1831
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:11,160
This is very well crafted, but a very forlorn ape, George W. Bush.

1832
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,320
Isn't this emotional?

1833
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,920
This is like a work of art.

1834
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,560
Yeah, really.

1835
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,400
That's got to be the first post on Twitter.

1836
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,800
Yeah, we'll put that front and center.

1837
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,080
Good job, Chuck Jarman.

1838
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,120
And then some other topical stuff.

1839
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,200
Daughter in chief wig.

1840
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,520
That's your Ivanka.

1841
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,840
And then this is really inexplicable.

1842
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,200
Fly hair don't care.

1843
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,200
VP debate costume.

1844
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,120
Wow.

1845
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:41,640
They really turned that out.

1846
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,120
I guess it doesn't take much.

1847
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:49,000
And so fast that I suspect that this was a different costume at one point

1848
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,960
because it's a guy with it's a very cheap, just kind of like cotton wig.

1849
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,840
That's just a jet silver.

1850
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,000
And then there's a bug up in it, which I suspect is photoshopped,

1851
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,960
and they're just going to take a stockpile of old spiders

1852
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,600
and maybe clip a couple legs and it becomes a fly.

1853
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:12,840
And then he's got his jet silver beard as well, like Pence.

1854
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,200
Pence and his silver beard.

1855
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:16,760
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,560
Yeah, of course.

1857
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,760
Was this a most interesting man in the world?

1858
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,280
Oh, right.

1859
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,160
I bet that's right.

1860
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:23,400
Yes.

1861
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,560
Got pence-ified very quickly.

1862
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,200
That's correct.

1863
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,720
Like, if you buy it, do you also get the beard?

1864
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,720
I don't think it's removable, so I think you have to.

1865
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:35,960
Yeah.

1866
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,760
But I think it's, I like this title a lot because I think it's hard to depict

1867
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,280
Pence as cool in any way during that fly scenario.

1868
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,240
So describing him as fly hair don't care.

1869
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,320
Look, they had to get this turned around.

1870
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,560
I don't want to be in a bad reputation.

1871
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,680
Like that's, you know, that's how I look at it.

1872
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,120
Pence is too busy talking about the issues to worry about some stupid fly.

1873
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,720
And he's cool enough.

1874
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:04,760
He's got enough swag.

1875
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,240
He knows.

1876
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,960
I got to look into that.

1877
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,080
I will look into see if we can find the exact same costume without the fly.

1878
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,000
This is the exact same way again, the beard.

1879
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,520
I would imagine somewhere.

1880
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,080
Anyway, that takes us through at least what I gathered.

1881
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,520
And, you know, fly hair don't care brings us into, you know, we've been going long.

1882
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,280
We don't have to do this forever and ever, but it seems like we.

1883
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,200
Should do a little bit of like thought exercise.

1884
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:39,240
If we want to cash in on the events of the fun, fun year, 2020 and do some topical

1885
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,400
Halloween costume comedy, but we can't attain any of the licenses.

1886
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,800
What do we what can we call these things?

1887
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:53,480
How do we how do we be leg Avenue beach leg Avenue and get away with some scams?

1888
01:36:54,440 --> 01:37:00,760
I have a list of possible 2020 things that we could do costumes of.

1889
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,640
So you want you want me to throw a couple out and we'll see if we can if we can crack it.

1890
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:06,680
Sure.

1891
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:07,560
Sure.

1892
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:07,800
Great.

1893
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,040
Okay.

1894
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,880
I mean, let's start with we were talking in that Beetlejuice episode.

1895
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,960
Who is like the easy target?

1896
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,840
Who can you make fun of?

1897
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,120
Like you could Paris Hilton and somebody answered on Twitter and they were correct.

1898
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,640
It's obviously the Tiger King and Carole Baskin.

1899
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,760
Who are those people?

1900
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,800
And there are a lot of those costumes, but how but we don't have the license.

1901
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,600
What do we call them?

1902
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,280
Let's see here.

1903
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:32,680
Tiger.

1904
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,600
I mean, I don't want to be too clever about it.

1905
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,720
You know, that's the first thing.

1906
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,560
That's there always a little clinical.

1907
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,360
Yes.

1908
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:40,680
Yeah.

1909
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:51,400
So you could do like just go one off and it's like predator royalty.

1910
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:52,600
Mm hmm.

1911
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:53,400
That's good.

1912
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,040
Yeah.

1913
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,480
Furry creature ruler.

1914
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,000
Sure.

1915
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,320
Yes.

1916
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,120
Karen Baskin.

1917
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,040
Which could masquerade as just a general Karen costume because that's probably going

1918
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,160
to be a big thing of the year.

1919
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,360
Oh, right, right, right.

1920
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:09,080
That's good.

1921
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,600
That's good.

1922
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,320
I'm into that.

1923
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:15,320
Could you like insert more of the title like King of

1924
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:22,840
Um, like King of, you know, the tiger esque business practices.

1925
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:28,200
King of Large Cats is good.

1926
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:28,680
Yeah.

1927
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,080
Yeah.

1928
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,480
King of Large Cats adult adult costume.

1929
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,840
I feel like that's what it might be.

1930
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,240
It's this is a little bit in the past, but he's coming back soon.

1931
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,040
Baby Yoda.

1932
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:43,720
Little guy.

1933
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,600
Little green guy.

1934
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,920
Little green pal.

1935
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,920
That's maybe where you could just use the child.

1936
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,240
Like they can't copyright that.

1937
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:55,560
Right.

1938
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,520
Like for the first time ever, people will use the actual name.

1939
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,680
How about little Udle?

1940
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,800
You, Y, O, O, D, L, E.

1941
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,680
Little Udle.

1942
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:14,760
Could you do like you, you, you, the best baby.

1943
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,960
Or just you, the baby.

1944
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:18,840
Yeah.

1945
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,640
That's good.

1946
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:32,120
What about burning up the charts, burning up the streets, the Fleetwood Mac TikTok guy,

1947
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,560
the guy drinking the juice.

1948
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,560
Cranberry Skateboard Group.

1949
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,760
No, Cranberry Skateboard Group.

1950
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,720
That's pretty good.

1951
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:43,960
Yeah.

1952
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:47,560
Cranberry Classic Rock Enthusiast.

1953
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,920
Cranberry King.

1954
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,600
Juice Dreamer.

1955
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,440
I think you got it.

1956
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:58,760
Yes.

1957
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:00,520
Yeah, that's it.

1958
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,120
And a nice little nod to the juice demon as well.

1959
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:04,360
Right.

1960
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,720
What about a bottle of juice doesn't come with it?

1961
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:09,400
Yes.

1962
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:10,600
Separate.

1963
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,680
And it's more expensive than just buying a bottle of juice.

1964
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,880
And on the thing, on the bag, he's drinking like sea blast.

1965
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,920
It's not ocean spray, it's sea blast.

1966
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,320
It's not beaucoup.

1967
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,160
Certainly not.

1968
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,280
Funny you say that.

1969
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:33,240
I do think we gotta keep bringing our A game because occasionally they do come up with

1970
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,160
something funny like this.

1971
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,440
Adult White Clam Seltzer Costume.

1972
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,320
Oh, White Clam.

1973
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,200
White Clam, yes.

1974
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,400
This is White Claw.

1975
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:46,760
Yes.

1976
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:47,720
Can I share that?

1977
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,000
Natural Slime.

1978
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,120
Natural Slime's pretty good.

1979
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,920
Spiked Sea Water, as you said.

1980
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,760
So maybe that's more 2019, but still very popular in 2020.

1981
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,840
And pretty affordable, $29.99.

1982
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,160
If you needed something in a pinch.

1983
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,600
Wow, God, we could get in on this, it feels like.

1984
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,240
Well, I think one of these, or all of these.

1985
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,560
I think there's two versions of this.

1986
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:16,760
There's the one where we like them and the one where we don't like them.

1987
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,200
I'm talking about Dr. Fauci.

1988
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,960
Oh, right, okay.

1989
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,720
If you approve of him, then is he...

1990
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,560
Daddy Doctor?

1991
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,040
Doctor.

1992
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:37,160
Yeah, Doctor Hunk, McHunky.

1993
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,320
Yeah, like, yeah.

1994
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,080
Social...

1995
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:45,640
Doctor Hero.

1996
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,000
Doctor Hero is good.

1997
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,360
Social Distance Daddy.

1998
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,920
That's good.

1999
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,120
Yeah.

2000
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:52,680
But what if...

2001
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,960
Oh, feel free if you have it.

2002
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:01,400
But if you were of the point of view that this guy is an idiot,

2003
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,680
he doesn't know what he's talking about.

2004
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,440
I mean, once this guy said you don't have to wear masks,

2005
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:08,120
and then he got new research and scientific recommendations,

2006
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,920
and he changed his mind like a flip-flopper.

2007
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,920
If you think Fauci is an idiot, what do you...

2008
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,240
Doctor Fake-Chi.

2009
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,040
Fake-Chi.

2010
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,400
Doctor Flip-Flop.

2011
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,680
Doctor Flip-Flop is good.

2012
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,800
That's good.

2013
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,160
Doctor Fun-Runer.

2014
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:26,360
Yeah.

2015
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,480
Doctor Lockdown.

2016
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:34,200
Doctor Cure Worse Than the Cause.

2017
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:36,840
Doctor Don't Reopen.

2018
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,440
Doctor Liar.

2019
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,320
And you just repurpose Pinocchio noses along with glasses.

2020
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:45,960
That's good.

2021
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:46,440
Yeah.

2022
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah.

2023
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,500
Yeah.

2024
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,000
Let's see.

2025
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,040
What else is on my list?

2026
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:53,400
What about...

2027
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:59,640
Oh, here's a good one.

2028
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:04,840
One of the big hit movies of the year, iconic film of 2020,

2029
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,440
King of Staten Island, which could also sort of...

2030
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,560
Because it is his story.

2031
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:12,760
If you were doing a Pete Davidson costume.

2032
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,200
Does he play Pete in the movie?

2033
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,160
I haven't seen it.

2034
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:15,720
I forget.

2035
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,400
I don't think I know.

2036
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,040
They change it.

2037
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:18,760
It is not...

2038
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,040
His father does not die in 9-11 in the film.

2039
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:22,840
This is a thing I know.

2040
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,440
It's just a different fire.

2041
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,840
Um, yeah.

2042
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,380
Okay.

2043
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:31,800
David Peterson.

2044
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:34,920
Oh, you flip...

2045
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:36,140
Yeah.

2046
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,880
Dave Peterson.

2047
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,160
Dave Peterson.

2048
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:39,640
That's good.

2049
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:46,840
The King of Brooklyn or something.

2050
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,560
New Jersey.

2051
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,160
Yeah, it's Jersey.

2052
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:49,800
Sorry.

2053
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,160
New Jersey Royal.

2054
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,440
Tattoo New Jersey Man.

2055
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,000
Tattoo New Jersey Duke.

2056
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,200
Like tall tattoo...

2057
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:03,720
Then what?

2058
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,400
Tall tattoo Titan.

2059
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,120
That's good with the alliteration.

2060
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:08,620
Yeah.

2061
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:11,560
And what could...

2062
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,080
I mean, if you remember anything else about 2020,

2063
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,400
but what could take us out?

2064
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,600
I got one.

2065
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,200
Nine Nin.

2066
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,160
It's the tenant.

2067
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,240
It's just kind of a suit.

2068
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,160
It's just kind of a slim fitting suit.

2069
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,240
It's like tenant where it's the same forwards and backwards.

2070
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:29,960
Are you a sketch?

2071
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,360
Is that a sketch of it or is that a piece of...

2072
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,640
I was trying to write out the palindrome of like,

2073
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,760
well, what is nine?

2074
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,000
Because it's got 10.

2075
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,320
What is...

2076
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,920
How would you do it with nine?

2077
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:41,240
Right.

2078
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:46,120
So nine Nin, which is nine forwards and backwards.

2079
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,000
It's no, no, no.

2080
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,400
Don't sue us, Nolan.

2081
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,960
It's not ten and it's ten and it's nine Nin.

2082
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,800
Nine Nin.

2083
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:59,240
I was also just thinking besides the generic names that sexy version,

2084
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,560
like sexy tariff and sexy mail-in ballot,

2085
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,400
are there any sexy 2020 things that we would like to...

2086
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,560
I mean, the one that occurred to me,

2087
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:13,720
I think the hit of the Zoom party is going to be going as Jeffrey Toobin's penis.

2088
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:19,880
I mean, that's the ultimate topical.

2089
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,240
And it's also already built in to be dirty.

2090
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,040
You know, you could also...

2091
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,680
We could make a killing real fast.

2092
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,480
I think it's already too late,

2093
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,320
but if we'd been quicker on the draw,

2094
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,160
we could have quickly wholesale bought some penis pasta

2095
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,840
and repackaged it as Toobin's penis pasta tubes.

2096
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,800
Wow, you're right.

2097
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,120
Oh, you're right.

2098
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,560
I think we could still do this, right?

2099
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,160
Penis pasta tubes.

2100
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,240
T-O-O-B-S.

2101
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,600
And you know what you top that with?

2102
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,600
Rudy's red sauce.

2103
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,560
You know, you got all the perverts in there.

2104
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:05,000
It doesn't come in a jar, it comes in pants that have to be unbuckled.

2105
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:06,860
Yeah.

2106
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,880
Tuck into this delicious flavor.

2107
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,160
How about...

2108
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,680
Go see Borat.

2109
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,720
Watch Borat 2 for Borat's subsequent movie film on Amazon Prime

2110
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:19,080
by our friend Jason Waller.

2111
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,000
How about postmaster general Louis DeJoy

2112
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:27,880
having sex with a mailbox because he fucked the post office up so bad?

2113
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,040
How about that?

2114
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,720
Take that, Louis.

2115
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,000
You asshole.

2116
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:37,720
Pretty good, I think.

2117
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,960
Oh, man.

2118
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,440
I want to...

2119
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:45,480
I have the mechanics of that, too, seeing a big weird floppy cloth.

2120
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,500
Yeah.

2121
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:52,140
Um, honey, I ruined the washing machine when I machine washed my...

2122
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:56,380
Louis DeJoy fucking a mailbox costume?

2123
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:00,220
My Louis DeJoy cloth mailbox.

2124
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:07,820
Yeah, well, I mean, those are pretty good.

2125
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:08,620
We could probably...

2126
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,460
We could close it there.

2127
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,740
I'm sorry we're too late on all this.

2128
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:17,900
If you have any costume building skills yourself at home

2129
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,300
and are looking for something to do on a Zoom call,

2130
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:23,820
you have our permission because you're already paying us here

2131
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:27,420
across the cemetery gate, which you survived.

2132
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,740
Haunt cast the fright you survived.

2133
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:30,940
So feel free.

2134
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:34,700
Those are all free for you, but don't let non-patrons use them.

2135
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:36,400
Yes.

2136
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:41,260
I think the world is going to be full of these...

2137
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,620
Jeffrey Tubin's penises come next week.

2138
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,420
Oh, I guess this week, sorry, which is Halloween week.

2139
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:53,500
I... yeah, just like anywhere where costumes are allowed,

2140
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,540
people like multiple...

2141
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:00,140
People who are both dressed as DeJoy fucking the post office

2142
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:01,740
are going to meet and fall in love.

2143
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:04,060
You too?

2144
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:04,700
The kinship.

2145
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,900
You were DeJoy.

2146
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,900
I was Tony Bubolinski.

2147
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:08,940
Oh, Bubolinski.

2148
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,300
We forgot about Tony.

2149
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,340
Oh, right.

2150
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,540
Tony Italian.

2151
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:15,340
I don't understand what he is or the scandal at all.

2152
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,700
So you have to tell me.

2153
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,660
The big man.

2154
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:19,500
The big... he's got a thing that says big man.

2155
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,220
The big man.

2156
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:21,820
Big man.

2157
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,580
I was dressed as Tony Bubolinski.

2158
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,940
You were in a Zoom window dressed as sexy Lev Parnas.

2159
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:28,780
And we locked eyes.

2160
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:31,100
Even though we were in different box, you weren't in the same...

2161
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,860
I wasn't in the same box that you were in.

2162
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,660
It's confusing.

2163
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,700
Very confusing.

2164
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:36,620
I guess sexy Hunter's laptop.

2165
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,220
That's good.

2166
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:38,720
Yeah.

2167
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,740
I'm sure how you do that.

2168
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,740
Maybe that one's not sexy.

2169
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:44,540
Maybe that's just...

2170
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,260
That's a child's costume.

2171
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:49,900
Because you're laptop sized.

2172
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,660
You could do it as a bunting.

2173
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,140
Yes.

2174
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:52,780
All right.

2175
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:55,340
So Hunter's laptop bunting.

2176
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:57,180
Cummings...

2177
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:01,500
Well, if we don't get around to it this year, it's okay because it'll still be relevant

2178
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,500
for many years to come because it is the biggest scandal in American history

2179
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,540
and it will not stand.

2180
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,520
That's right.

2181
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:15,020
So folks, if you're as mad about the laptop as us, vote Trump next week and...

2182
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,300
No, I'm not.

2183
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,300
Election day, November 4th, folks.

2184
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:22,620
It sounds right.

2185
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,020
I won't look it up.

2186
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:24,140
Vote early, vote often.

2187
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:31,180
And vote for quality content by continuing to subscribe to Podcasts

2188
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:36,780
throughout the second gate, which will get unspooked-ified next week.

2189
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,260
Right?

2190
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:37,740
Yeah.

2191
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,420
Fun coming in November.

2192
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,860
Less scary fun.

2193
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:42,060
Or the following.

2194
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,820
It kind of depends on how we're doing.

2195
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,060
Depends on distribution.

2196
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,500
Yeah.

2197
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,300
It's going to be good.

2198
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:49,520
Thanks.

2199
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:51,020
Thanks for listening.

2200
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:54,380
Happy Halloween and happy Election Day.

2201
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:54,880
Bye.
