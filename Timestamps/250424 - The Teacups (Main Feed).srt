1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,160
Warning, the following podcasts may contain incredible

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,400
anniversary ribbons, colander nightmares,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,600
wrist punishing rides, and big coat tea smuggling.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,880
We return to the Disneyland Class of 55

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,520
for an episode about the teacups.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,760
Hey, it's a very merry Podcast the Ride.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:49,560
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, where conversation goes round

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,000
and round in circles and leaves you feeling a little bit nauseous.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm Scott Gertner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,960
Let's do that order.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,280
I but and occasionally we put in a guard.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,280
So it's harder to go round and round.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,320
We do.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,040
And what does that mean metaphorically?

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
And the metaphor of the show?

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,480
Uh, I haven't quite figured that out.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,760
Is that one of your cards?

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
One of the guards is like one of Jason's comments that calms

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,440
the listener's stomach down from feeling too upset by the other discussions.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,480
No, mine are the chaos comment.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,880
So I don't know.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,640
You never know.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,880
This guy might bring up Dr.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,440
Odyssey for 10 minutes.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
You never know the chaos that comes.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
Mike Carlson. Hey there.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm here. Yeah.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
I just I you know, who knows?

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,840
I think every different type of like any person could be allergic

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,200
to any one of us at any time.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,360
You don't know as far as allergic or just make we could.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,520
They could feel motion sickness from the allergic type you say.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,840
Well, allergic in the sense to the type of conversation

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
one of us would have often.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,960
You know what I'm saying?

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,240
But we're all nice.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,720
That has nothing to do with it, though.

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm just saying that you are nice, but I'm just saying once in a while,

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,200
maybe the discussion, somebody listening says,

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,440
I don't want to hear about this, you know, old time.

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't want to hear about some old stars, a state sale.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,000
You know, I don't want to hear about this.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
And they go, I'm turning this off.

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Maybe they don't puke, but they do feel angry at Jason.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
But they he's the person might still know that you're nice.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I guess I have noticed something like this at even the mere mention of Bugman.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,640
I guess that's a little familiar to me that even saying these two words

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,000
that are just seven letters that are seven letters in English language

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,160
that, you know, like that we've always used and will continue to use.

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
Yes, somehow these letters have this power to just every drive people mad.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Everyone has it were right.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,960
Everyone has their own different set of words and topics

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
that they might say, oh, it makes me angry.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Like people hear me and I'll be like, I want to talk about Long December

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,800
by the counting crows and they'll be like, oh, no more and turn it right off.

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
Well, what you're referring to is me.

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
You're referring to one of your co-hosts.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
I wasn't going to say it, but you're allergic to a lot of stuff.

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Jason and I say on a regular basis.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
I know. Yes.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,760
I just want to talk about the Hedy Lamar's scientific discoveries

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,960
that would go on to form the basis of Wi-Fi and radar.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Well, and I just want to talk about the song Johnny Depp wrote about Hedy Lamar.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
So that's a different thing, too.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
So we both are in the same zone.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,960
Still the Johnny Depp album.

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,920
Still, yeah.

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,080
What if I were to tell you I did not intend to set you up for that?

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
Oh, I was there was no doubt in my mind you did not mean to set me up for that.

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,800
That was pure Hedy on that was.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,080
Yeah, I'm all in on Hedy.

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,000
No, I wasn't looking.

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
I didn't think that was a lot.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,560
But you were lobbing that thing up for me to smash.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,640
Well, I just I don't like the idea of allergy because that seems that seems sure.

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,440
I hear you.

78
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,960
You're a bit of a host.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't know. There's no pill that we can prescribe.

80
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,840
It's going to fix that.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
What's the weaker aversion?

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,040
Food aversion?

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Food averse.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
You're not fully allergic, but it sometimes doesn't sit well with you.

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
Is that the term? I don't know.

86
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,600
I guess it doesn't sit well with you is this thing you say about food a lot, I feel like.

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,360
So that might be your term.

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
You know, teach their own.

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
Something doesn't sit well with me.

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
I do remain confused with how that Taco Bell made you numb.

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,080
It was Chipotle. It was Chipotle.

92
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,160
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Taco Bell made him numb.

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,920
Taco Bell sauce.

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,000
There's too many things lately that hurt him.

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,680
That Chipotle made me bloated for two days.

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
Yeah, I felt bad.

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,160
Two straight days of bloating from Chipotle and then Taco Bell made you numb.

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
Two days is a long time.

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,120
It was it was pretty bad.

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,280
Huh, huh.

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Could you see the bloating or you felt bloated?

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
I felt bloated.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,240
You felt pregnant.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,640
You wondered if you were pregnant.

106
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,240
I was pregnant with a burrito bowl.

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
A burrito.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,320
I like the way you said that.

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,360
Burrito.

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
Yeah, it was just the bowl.

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,120
The bowl made you bloated for that's kind of a small animal.

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,240
And we, you know, I think they you can get the tortilla on the side.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
And that was just really gummy.

114
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,360
And remember, we've gotten the incorrect order and they're just like, just keep it.

115
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,080
And we're like, this is not.

116
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,880
Well, I don't remember.

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,960
I don't remember that.

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,600
This is good.

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,320
Surely you do.

120
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
And remember from that classic tale.

121
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,880
But we yeah, we didn't really dig into it much because our correct order that came was so unpleasant.

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
Well, look at my opening joke has just proven this is what I was saying,

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,960
is that the conversation ends up making you a little bit nauseous because we often describe being a little bit nauseous.

124
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,480
Right. So, yeah, it all ended up in the right place.

125
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,080
It all went round and round back to where we started.

126
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,520
Literal nausea.

127
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,040
I guess it takes us right back to the to the opening and to the the point of today's episode,

128
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,720
which is the teacups, the goddamn teacups.

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Wow.

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
It's podcast.

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,760
The Ride is doing the teacups.

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,120
This is a big deal.

133
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
Year eight here.

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
Disneyland teacups.

135
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,400
I mean, are you putting up a border where we can't talk about the other teacups?

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
When are we ever going to do the other teacups?

137
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm leaving it open.

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,800
This is what I'm allergic to is this kind of thing.

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,960
It's class of fifty five.

140
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,400
Once again, you're on podcast, the ride and the others weren't built.

141
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,800
The others weren't built in fifty five.

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
It's well here.

143
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,680
It's class of fifty five.

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,440
Really up to me when we when we cut that off.

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
I'll go longer.

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,800
You'd be fine.

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,040
I'd be happy to hear the whole thing.

148
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
The entire gets sued by the man himself.

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,240
You know, he's sort of I got curious knowing that I was going to play that.

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
What what Hagar has been up to lately, recording wise, because that that seemed

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
like something that could be the great Sammy Hagar, of course, the red rocker.

152
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,440
Mm hmm.

153
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,920
Who does that song that because you have red hair.

154
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,280
I don't think not really.

155
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,240
No, good question.

156
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,440
I don't know.

157
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,200
I don't know.

158
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,720
No, I'm here, right?

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,360
Sunburn.

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,760
It could be from Sunburn.

161
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Did he wear red a lot?

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,320
I feel like you have to wear a red jumpsuit.

163
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Yeah.

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Anyway, I got curious what he was what he's been up to.

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Like, what are the last couple of records?

166
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,800
And he is he has a band now called Sammy Hagar and the Circle.

167
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,920
Oh, yeah, I know the circle.

168
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
You know the circle.

169
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,480
OK, well, do you know they're this is sort of in the Johnny Depp area is

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,960
like an all covers album that he put out called Lockdown 2020

171
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,280
that is entirely covers of like Won't Get Fooled Again and Heroes.

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,400
Heroes, I believe, also covered by Johnny Depp frequently.

173
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah, of course.

174
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,880
But but with one original called Funky Feng Shui.

175
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,960
So at some point, I might I don't know if it's going to be too confusing to

176
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,120
in the class of 55 drop, start inserting just a little taste of funky feng shui.

177
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, yeah.

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
I mean, it might be a lot for the listeners to connect the dots down the road.

179
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,880
He's got a band, too, with the like Sammy Hagar on the Wobbos or something.

180
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,280
He also, I believe, is another one.

181
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,640
And then he's also got a slightly different band for his Van Halen Tribute.

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean, he was in Van Halen, but he has a Van Halen Tribute concert.

183
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
And I think he replaced a guitarist with like Joe Satriani.

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
But it's the same band as the circle with like Jason Bonham,

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,600
John Bonham's son drums.

186
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,160
And then Michael Anthony, I think, plays bass from Van Halen in the circle

187
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,600
and in the Van Halen Tribute as well.

188
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,680
He's got a lot of things, a lot of irons in the fire.

189
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,040
But here I'm looking at the website of Sammy and the Wobbos,

190
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,520
which has a female member and the photo.

191
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,720
I didn't say anything about the Wobbo Wobbo membership.

192
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Well, Mona Nodder seems to be in Sammy and the Wobbos.

193
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,000
OK. And they introduce her.

194
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,680
This is all of our introduction, I guess, to Sammy and the Wobbos,

195
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,600
is that there's a group that the whole all the band is there.

196
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,320
But it's the female member who's standing up at a urinal

197
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,080
and Sammy and the other guys are going, what the hell? OK.

198
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,280
What's all this then?

199
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,840
I mean, is it a girl is I'm just going to give a Sammy credit.

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
This is some sort of progressive statement he's making.

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,000
That's what I'm going to hope that what it is. Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,000
And then how do you then how do you calculate into that

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,600
the drummer who is not paying attention to the situation anyway?

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,360
I don't know.

205
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,520
I mean, two of the Wobbos are responsive to this female urinal situation.

206
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,560
He thought this was a test photo and then they ended up using it.

207
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah, it was just everyone else looked better.

208
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
So they wanted to just go with that one.

209
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,280
I think it works that David's just staring off.

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Yeah, I think it's interesting.

211
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,160
OK, it shows he marches to the beat of his own drum.

212
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,720
And he is the drummer. Right. Which is what you want.

213
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,760
That's perfect. Anyway, we're doing a great job of staying on topic

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
with the class with the class of fifty five.

215
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,040
Yes, this is an opening day Disneyland attraction, July 17th, 1955.

216
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,920
And that's when we are going to be covering

217
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,680
opening day attractions throughout the year.

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,120
Opening day madness and nonsense as Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary.

219
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,360
And it's also a good excuse, I think, to check in here and there

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,840
on Disneyland's 70th anniversary, which is not officially begun yet.

221
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,480
But what we are starting to get is little glimmers of information

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,920
about what this celebration is going to entail.

223
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,720
That's something that's happened since the last class of fifty five that we did,

224
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
which was Sleeping Beauty Castle.

225
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,760
Back then, we were just speculating.

226
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,400
We were flying blind.

227
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
Now we know some of what Disney is offering.

228
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,280
Do you guys see any of this?

229
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm sure I. Announcements of what's coming.

230
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,080
You know what? I probably have.

231
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,440
But I'm I'm wondering what the ones you're going to say are.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,760
Well, I mean, there's so many that I don't even know where to begin.

233
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,280
Well, like we talk like the refurbishment of the car.

234
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,920
They circle is undergoing like they're underway.

235
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,200
That's not even one of them. That's not what you're talking about.

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,400
OK, so that is like there's sort of art of what it will look like

237
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,680
with sort of different trim around it, like repainting it.

238
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,680
Well, it's not a Disneyland anniversary if it's not like hanging new ribbons.

239
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
That's what a lot of their anniversary stuff is.

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,240
New ribbons, a little bit different colors.

241
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,280
They've never done the shade of maroon on the castle before.

242
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,480
Right. Slightly different color t-shirts and sweatshirts.

243
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
Yes. And new outfits.

244
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Popcorn buckets that they would have done anyway.

245
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,400
Well, well, yeah, I think that is that's definitely one that I noticed

246
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
was new outfits for the characters that I pulled this day.

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,720
I did you have you seen the new outfit?

248
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
Oh, yeah, these have been out for a long time.

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, these are the same ones you're talking about.

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,280
OK, are you talking about Mickey with his not symmetrical coat?

251
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,880
Yes, yes, yes, that hangs down longer on one side.

252
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,960
Yes, that's been out for a month, actually.

253
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,160
So I hate to I hate to make you feel bad that you've missed something important,

254
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,520
but that's been out since early in the year.

255
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,680
Is Mickey doing a half tuck now?

256
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,720
It's not a tuck. It's a long here.

257
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Jason, do you not see the code either?

258
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,480
I didn't know about the code either.

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Look at this coat, Mickey, on the right side, the coat goes down longer

260
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,640
than on the left and he's not tucking the left.

261
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,080
He just has a like a symmetrical coat.

262
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,400
That looks like a manufacturing error more than anything.

263
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,880
Then then fashion or style, some sort of style.

264
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
What? Oh, good.

265
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,280
I was going to say he's kind of got like great, like blue

266
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
that that turns into purple pants.

267
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
He's got big, bright yellow shoes,

268
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,160
but they're more like sneakers than his normal big, solid yellow shoes.

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, here's what here's what I think about what he's wearing.

270
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,800
And I don't know if you've seen the group of what everybody is wearing.

271
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
I have, yes.

272
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,880
I think this is all I think they're aiming for you with all this.

273
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,600
I think, yeah, I fucking love this very colorful.

274
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,480
I would like to wear all of this.

275
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,720
Yes, I agree.

276
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,520
I mean, it's a little bit too much for me just to wear to Ralph's maybe.

277
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,160
You don't have sparkly swirls on your pants and bright yellow shoes.

278
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,560
But if and like and and I don't like

279
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,320
the dazzled berets, which is what Donald seems to be wearing.

280
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Yeah, Donald. So Donald still has to know pants, which I like.

281
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,520
But it is a very, which I also wouldn't recommend for going around.

282
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,360
No. And Pluto just has a sort of stylish collar in the same style.

283
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,160
I like Donald shirt.

284
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,160
And then many has a really many probably looks the coolest

285
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,920
of all of that, because it just you would wear that in a normal

286
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,760
non anniversary year, I think, too.

287
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,600
In what in what photo would you not say many looks the cool?

288
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
Well, that's true.

289
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,160
But I'm just saying specifically, this one, like even maybe kind of blends in.

290
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,920
It's the same style as the rest of them, but it almost kind of blends in.

291
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
It is not as flashy as the others, I guess.

292
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
But yes, I would wear.

293
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
I would love to wear one of these pieces, just Mickey's shirt,

294
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
just Mickey's pants.

295
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,560
But would you if you were if you well, you didn't put in your list

296
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,280
the asymmetrical coat, would you wear the asymmetrical coat?

297
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,880
I it depends on what you call like a cost,

298
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,960
because I don't want to spend like 100 north of 100

299
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,080
on an asymmetrical coat that I'm only going to wear once in a while.

300
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,360
But what if what if you're you know, sometimes you go to events

301
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
where fashion is specified.

302
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
This is a black tie event.

303
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
What if you get invited to an asymmetrical coat event?

304
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,440
Oh, of course I would wear that Mickey's asymmetrical coat.

305
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
Yeah. Cut to a lot of people with nice coats like, oh, shit, I didn't realize.

306
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
And I got to be there in an hour.

307
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,480
All right. Snip, snip.

308
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,600
And they just have to like take a giant wedge out of their own jacket.

309
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,120
Well, yeah, you don't want to stand out in a bad way.

310
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah, no, thirty, thirty five dollars old Navy version of this code.

311
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm in, I think. OK.

312
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,400
And then and then, yes, I would wear only at specific events.

313
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Now, I'm interested in the fact that there's a practical zipper

314
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
up near Mickey's head.

315
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,440
Like, why does Mickey need a pocket on his 70th anniversary wardrobe?

316
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,960
It's just interesting to me because like none of the other characters

317
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,480
have any pockets, literal pockets, as far as I can tell.

318
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,720
Yeah. And then he has a zippered pocket up by his head.

319
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,160
Lighter joints. I mean, that's getting high.

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah. The pills of ecstasy.

321
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,240
It's barking up. Seventieth.

322
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Seventy pills in here.

323
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,600
Ollie. One for each.

324
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,960
With all my friends.

325
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,080
Yeah, this is weird.

326
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,640
I don't know. It's an interesting style choice.

327
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,200
I've worked my ass off for 70 years.

328
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,840
You're telling me I can't enjoy a little E for 70.

329
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,920
I got cash and Molly in here.

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,960
Got five hundred dollars in bills, non non sequential bills.

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
They're dirty, you know, they've been washed, you know.

332
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
It's yeah, well, I guess it could have a cell phone in there, I suppose.

333
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,720
It doesn't look like anything's in there from the look of it.

334
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,520
It just looks kind of flat now.

335
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,720
But, you know, you'd want to have the option.

336
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,040
Yeah. But it's a yeah.

337
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
And the zipper is a regular zipper, too.

338
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,280
It's not like a little lightning bolt or a little sun or moon.

339
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,680
You know what I mean?

340
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,240
If it was the spirit of this feels very much colorful,

341
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
but then also there's a lot of stars and moons.

342
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
Yeah. And the design, you would think that they would want to make the zipper

343
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
very specific. That's right.

344
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,000
We've made it 70 years American history.

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
We're an American institution.

346
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,480
And you, the guests, multiple generations have passed through these gates

347
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,840
and you've passed it on to your children and their children and their children.

348
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,520
And to say thank you, we just want to tell you, Mickey has a zipper now.

349
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,800
Mommy, mommy.

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,960
I think he's got an affectation zipper.

351
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,880
It's not really practical.

352
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,920
It's just visual.

353
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,720
He's got a superfluous zipper, mommy.

354
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
There's no need for it.

355
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
I love this. Happy 70th. Happy 70th.

356
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
Mommy, let's go watch the Walter animatronic again.

357
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
Let's go to Walter's office like our candles.

358
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,080
So I yeah, I like I like this is this is exciting stuff for you.

359
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,040
How do we feel about I like that?

360
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,520
I like this degree of announcement of Disney announce it,

361
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,240
not just announcing that there will be a song, not saying here's the song.

362
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,680
Right. They have announced Celebrate Happy, a new song

363
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,800
performed by the Jonas Brothers. Right.

364
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,200
We will be getting stay on alert, everyone.

365
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,040
J alert. The Jonas Brothers will be striking any day now

366
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,600
with a new song to help you celebrate happy. Right.

367
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,520
So that's it. Yes.

368
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,880
So we already knew about the new verse.

369
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,640
As far as a small world is concerned, I need a little more explanation.

370
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,440
You're going to leave it there. Yes.

371
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,240
The new verse. Yes. I'm a little slow today.

372
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,840
Sorry. But yes, the new verse.

373
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,880
And it's a small world.

374
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
I've heard that small world is now delayed.

375
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,480
They're installing some new figures, but they're also installing the new verse.

376
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,760
OK, so that's going to take a few more weeks.

377
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,240
I read that long as it takes to install a verse.

378
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,160
I don't know. But it's it's been delayed.

379
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,400
The new verse has been delayed, I think, into May now.

380
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,480
I think it was going to be open maybe this month, actually.

381
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,760
OK, so much is retrofitted there.

382
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,800
They have to figure out how to flip an MP3 to a WAV file.

383
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
That's probably right.

384
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,240
Something close to that is, I mean, probably it's like

385
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
it's running on a record album, I think, probably.

386
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,800
Well, now they're up to Windows and you think so.

387
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
OK, you recall that one.

388
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,560
Yeah, yeah. So, yes, it's

389
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
there's a lot of stuff going on. New verses, new clothing.

390
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,800
Yes. What else? What else?

391
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,960
And just to be clear, because I looked up, like, does the song exist?

392
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,520
Did they even release a preview of the song?

393
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,080
And they did not.

394
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,920
But what's confusing is Jonas Brothers already put out a song called

395
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,680
Celebrate a couple of years ago.

396
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,080
So Celebrate is not celebrate happy.

397
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
Oh, wow. Clear. OK, that's that's that's tough.

398
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,240
That's a thin slice for them to have to

399
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,760
you try to reinvent what celebrating means as far as Jonas Brothers.

400
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,040
So it's not like Candle in the Wind or something.

401
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,640
And they just know.

402
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
No, I don't think so. OK.

403
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
Hopefully happier than that.

404
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,480
It's about celebrating. Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Different.

406
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,160
Elton's doing a new version for Walt.

407
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,240
What's that?

408
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
He's doing Candle in the Wind for Walt.

409
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah, Candle in the Wind. I didn't hear.

410
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,480
He's he's just a little bit late.

411
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,200
Performance on the what was it?

412
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
The Christmas parade.

413
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,960
Everyone was like, that was really good.

414
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,920
It was pretty good.

415
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,040
This kid's got something. Yeah.

416
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,920
Got anything in the pocket? Mm hmm.

417
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,320
Could you write a song about a man who died 70 years ago?

418
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Could you rewrite a song?

419
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,880
You should really do. Yeah, he should do more.

420
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,800
There's a lot of people.

421
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
There's a lot of people who died.

422
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,960
A lot of legends.

423
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
And he's only written about two.

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah, come on. Lazy, lazy.

425
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,560
There's a we're getting a special rendition of Rainbow Connection

426
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,360
for World of Color performed by Boys to Men.

427
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,040
Yes, I did see that in a new original song called Makes Me Want to Move.

428
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,520
I can't tell if that's boys to men or if it's performed by no artist.

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,120
Will it make us want to move?

430
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,880
Time will tell.

431
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,400
And then this one, I'm I mean,

432
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
I let me like take a deep breath just to the quality

433
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,680
because I won't be able to get through the sentence.

434
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,920
I don't know if you guys have heard,

435
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,600
but ahead of the first World of Color happiness showing guests

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,920
inside Disney California Adventure can vote on the Disneyland app

437
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,480
for one of four different emotions, sadness, anger, disgust or envy

438
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,200
to see which is featured in special scenes throughout both day's shows.

439
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,040
I get to we get to choose.

440
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,000
Wait, hold on. Democracy works.

441
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,680
So what did you understand about that sentence?

442
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,920
I was very clear.

443
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,800
I understand they made two versions

444
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
and they've created a fake voting system that does nothing.

445
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,920
Well, I don't for I think it's four versions inside out.

446
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,960
Inside out has a land of the world inside out has invaded World of Color

447
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,920
and four of the characters, not Joy.

448
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,280
Joy is not in this list.

449
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,360
Joy's side emotions only.

450
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,720
OK. Sadness, anger, disgust and envy.

451
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,680
You get to pick which one is are you feeling disgust today?

452
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
And you get to put disgust in the show.

453
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,760
Huh? So it's the majority wins.

454
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,760
Yeah, I guess. That's what they're saying. Yeah.

455
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,600
What you get to be one of one of a bunch of people voting on the app.

456
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
And we know the app and we know this is going to be a very clean voting system.

457
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,560
We know that it's going to be easy as hell for you to register your anger

458
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,440
by putting anger into the World of Color happiness show.

459
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Won't the same thing win every time

460
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
because it'll just be the most popular character from inside out?

461
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,560
Maybe. But I don't know.

462
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Maybe not. You know, like if if if we're you know,

463
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,720
there's some days where we're feeling particularly angry about the state

464
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
of this nation.

465
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, you think that maybe we're feeling or we're feeling disgusted

466
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,800
by the state of this nation or feeling envy on behalf of other countries.

467
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,920
So we're not dealing with what we're dealing with.

468
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,560
I think it's how how is the news striking the general populace

469
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,360
every day when they're going to Disneyland?

470
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,160
Uh huh. How does that reflect in their votes?

471
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,360
I think people have been there all day.

472
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,680
Sometimes by the time it gets around to the nighttime show,

473
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,920
anger and or disgust might already be an emotion they're experiencing

474
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,880
because they're because they're tired, they're tired out.

475
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,520
And those I love I love my kids, but they are a handful.

476
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Gosh, they are a handful.

477
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,760
I'm disgusted by the behavior of my children.

478
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm just I'm today. I'm voting disgust.

479
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,840
Opened all those ketchup packets and he knew he was just going to use one.

480
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,920
So then it's just a pile on the plate and then I got to take it to the trash.

481
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,080
I like this picture. You're painting the Disneyland, dad.

482
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,560
It was pizza. Why do you even need ketchup?

483
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,000
Just wanted to play with it, dammit.

484
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
That was not a good ketchup opening.

485
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,520
Stinks like Heinz.

486
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,720
My stinky kid, my stinky ketchup kid.

487
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
So mad of this kid.

488
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,120
This is a it's a phrase that you're saying would disgust,

489
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,760
but I could easily see either of you saying, now, when I was growing up,

490
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,800
I was a little stinky ketchup kid.

491
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,360
Jason was this little stinky kid.

492
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
I was a big ketchup kid.

493
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,200
He's the one with all the stinky kids around him, as we've established.

494
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,200
Well, this is that was it was a club three.

495
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't know. I didn't hear that breaking news on Club Three.

496
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,960
And if this doesn't get you over to Club Three, then I don't know what will.

497
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,320
Breaking news is Jason would sometimes get headaches at school

498
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,040
because of how bad all the kids around him smelled.

499
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,400
The kids smelled.

500
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,480
There was very little ventilation, obviously no air conditioning

501
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,800
in that old, you know, worst progress administration building.

502
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,160
And ultimately, it ultimately goes back to the 30s.

503
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,360
Your headache was born in the 1930s.

504
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,160
Yeah, my headache and the conditions.

505
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,880
And it also led to the conditions that, you know, in the poor nutrition

506
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,280
in this nation that caused those children to stink.

507
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,200
That's a good point. Yeah.

508
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,120
It all makes sense now.

509
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
Curse you, FDR.

510
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,800
The dairy surplus that America constantly has, you know,

511
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,440
all those all that extra cheese and milk produce that the schools have to take.

512
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,840
And the kids were secreting the milk and cheese, do you think?

513
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,080
Well, no, it was the lunch, the lunches, the school lunches,

514
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
and then they'd all be farting and smelly from all the dairy.

515
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,760
And do you think is this a problem that persists to this day?

516
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,760
Do you think this is a problem that why didn't Mike have this problem growing up?

517
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,120
Was this like your area specifically?

518
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,480
No, this is countrywide, like the farting.

519
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,640
School lunches had a lot of cheese and cartons of milk for the default drink.

520
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,120
And because that was just from so much

521
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
surplus dairy and government funding for dairy farmers.

522
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
They forced all of us to eat so much dairy.

523
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,680
Now, this is a facet of this conversation that didn't come up in the Club 3 episode.

524
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,240
Was Jason's blame of the government for the stinky children in his classroom?

525
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, looking back, I mean, it was more like the parents just hadn't been like,

526
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,320
yeah, we should probably get you bathing more,

527
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,600
would probably get you a deodorant stick.

528
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Here's here's a question. Yeah.

529
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,440
Did were you part of the problem?

530
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,280
Were you a stinky kid yourself or were you the lone not stinky kid?

531
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:12,680
I think my mom did a good job of like, you need to start showering more or bathing more.

532
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,520
What ages does this have to do with nutrition?

533
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
This is like nine.

534
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,520
This is no, these are all systemic. Never mind.

535
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,920
It's fascinating because I just wasn't my other than the one kid that sat next to me

536
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,320
for a couple of months in third grade that smell like baloney.

537
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't have a strong memory of like those my classroom stinking a lot.

538
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,440
The kids stinking.

539
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,880
I did. I've always had kind of a sensitive sense of smell.

540
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,400
Either my nose is stuffy or I just I have that smell hates me art.

541
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,960
So I would have to be a baloney kid.

542
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,840
And I would also be curious if you were to go, go back home, go to that classroom.

543
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,560
Would you find that the ghost of the smells?

544
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,040
I think the building was demolished and rebuilt.

545
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Oh, my God.

546
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
There was at least an opportunity.

547
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,240
Plasticy, you know, more air conditioning and current habits

548
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,640
caused the children in that area, like kind of matching the demographics.

549
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,200
Are they still as stinky?

550
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
Well, they now they all just smell like Mr.

551
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,120
Beast's feastable chocolate bars.

552
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,000
The nasty chocolate bars that always seem to be on clearance

553
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,520
that people are posting pictures.

554
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,600
Every single child, every single store.

555
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,600
Can I trade? Can I trade your beast for my beast?

556
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,040
Well, we got the same beast.

557
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,280
Yeah, I want to feel something.

558
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,240
All right. Well, again, well, again, we've wrapped back around to the nausea.

559
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,360
We've talked about Jason's stinky kit.

560
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,840
I do. I do think it was starting to go bad.

561
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm going to get four hundred thousand dollars if I can put up

562
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,800
with a month's worth of stinky kids. Mr.

563
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,040
Beast told me that that's the subject of that's what entertainment is.

564
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,960
Mr. Beast's stinky kid challenge is the next show.

565
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,880
He's lying, though, because it's four hundred dollars in Robux.

566
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,360
Like, I don't know what to do with Roblox, Roblox, whatever.

567
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,040
It's cool. Yeah, I do. I have one more question.

568
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,000
Do you because you seem to answer to my question

569
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,440
that you were the lone non stinky kid out of what?

570
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,280
30. Would you would you agree with that?

571
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,120
Or do you think there's maybe like four or five who are not stinky?

572
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,160
No, I think we all took turns being a little stinky.

573
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,160
You know, kids start to sweat more and your body starts to change.

574
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
And there's some stink, you know.

575
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,600
I feel like my memory is maybe junior high is when I started becoming aware of

576
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,960
maybe that's just maybe my awareness.

577
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,080
But that's when I really sort of remember like, oh, now it's time to really

578
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,440
like fix hygienic.

579
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
And yes, maybe somebody smells a little bit.

580
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,200
I don't recall it so strongly in elementary school.

581
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
Yeah. Yeah. Well, maybe that's my maybe that's me.

582
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,400
I don't know. Jason is good.

583
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,280
Jason goes back like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now.

584
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,120
Just a cold sweat middle of the night recalling the stink.

585
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,200
Yeah, I'm lying. Eyes wide awake.

586
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,520
Ceiling fan slowly rotating.

587
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,320
I do imagine just you in a room full of pig pens from peanuts.

588
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,120
Just think lines coming off of all these kids.

589
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,800
I bet. Yeah. Right.

590
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,680
Which I remember, of course, we met.

591
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,200
We met Pig Pen at the livery stable at Knott's Berry Farm right before the pandemic.

592
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,400
And he he didn't.

593
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,040
He if he smelled, I didn't notice because all those farm animals.

594
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,800
He smelled fine.

595
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,880
Well, stinky.

596
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,280
I don't think that they would make the costumed character

597
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,040
stink in order to complete the illusion.

598
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,400
This is not something that you find a lot in theme park mascot characters.

599
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,080
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah.

600
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,240
But it would have been nice.

601
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,120
It'd be an interesting innovation and something that they could do for the 70th.

602
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,360
Let's say like, sure.

603
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,760
Colorful, fun clothes.

604
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,680
What colorful, fun smells are these characters bring to the table?

605
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,280
Right. What are the what does Pluto smell like?

606
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,680
Let's be honest. Goofy should smell a little.

607
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,000
You know, he doesn't like take care of himself so well.

608
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
He's very chaotic.

609
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,520
And I'm not saying it's a specific type of smell, but like whatever.

610
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,960
He forgot he was cooking or something.

611
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,400
And he like got a bunch of batter all over him.

612
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,680
And it's just been drying on his pants and he didn't notice.

613
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,320
I forgot to change.

614
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,560
I was doing worse.

615
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,920
I was going to say I was too invested in listening to kill Tony while I eat my batter.

616
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
Oh, he's problematic.

617
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,720
Oh, no, Goofy.

618
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,800
No, I think it's a little bit of Bane, but a little bit of Lorne Michaels.

619
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,560
Hello, Mickey Mouse.

620
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,000
My skis don't go on because they're ready to go on.

621
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,840
All right. Well, let's bring it back.

622
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,160
So a lot to look forward to for the 70th.

623
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,800
We will keep giving you these updates.

624
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,240
We will check in as soon as the actual Jonas Brothers song has been released.

625
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Yeah, I am excited.

626
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,280
We'll try to be more timely, Mike.

627
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,360
I'm sorry that these clothes have been out for.

628
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Although, you know what? I put the blame right back on you.

629
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
You could have been talking about these clothes all year.

630
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,920
None of them are the ones who dropped the.

631
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,120
You would have been allergic to the discussion if I had brought up the clothing, I think.

632
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,560
And by now, you would have been really allergic to it.

633
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,040
Also, let's call it out. None of those clothes platinum.

634
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,720
Well, but that is true.

635
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,920
No, it's true. But again, the idea of platinum is a thing

636
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,120
that Mike made up that is not anything they were ever going to do.

637
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,360
Yes, the platinum celebration.

638
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,440
That's why you should have brought it.

639
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,280
You should forget that I made a platinum celebration.

640
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,280
I thought we looked up what the 70th anniversary of a thing,

641
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,840
of a marriage, but that doesn't mean that Disney ever thought of it.

642
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,480
But 60 was diamonds.

643
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,120
Yes, that's why I said that the 70th will be a platinum.

644
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,360
That would lead to the discussion.

645
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,000
I guess, but that doesn't oblige Disney.

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,040
They've never said it's obliged.

647
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,960
They've never called it the platinum.

648
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,680
Because they did the wood anniversary.

649
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,160
They did the paper anniversary.

650
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,000
Who on earth has ever followed these?

651
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,600
I don't know.

652
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,240
The poor wife who's getting so paper, I get.

653
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,120
And we have to do it by the books, darling.

654
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
I get a paper necklace this year.

655
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes. Yeah.

656
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,080
We were pouring on our anniversary and my gifts melted.

657
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,400
All right. Well, there's no easy way to transition.

658
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,240
So I will just hard pivot back into the topic proper today,

659
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,800
which is this is a discussion that we have to have, I think, is that there's,

660
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,000
you know, if we're being all if we're being all proper and by the books,

661
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,720
then we call this episode Mad Tea Party. Right.

662
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
But who on earth has ever called it that tea cups?

663
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,040
Yeah. The tea cups is what we are talking about, which.

664
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,640
And I think there's a lot of firsts with this attraction,

665
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,760
and I think that is one of them.

666
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,120
I think the this is the first attraction

667
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,200
that has an official name that no one uses.

668
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,080
That's a good point. Ever said, you want to hit Mad Tea Party?

669
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,480
It is like it paves the way for Tiana's by Tiana's bioadventure

670
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,960
for names that will never be, you know, used in full.

671
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440
Yeah, that's a good point.

672
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,840
Well, Mike hears that he's like, are we going to hear

673
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,000
an Imagine Dragons cover tonight or a Hoosier cover?

674
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
When I hear Mad Tea Party, when you hear Mad Tea Party,

675
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
was his name Hoosier?

676
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,960
Hoosier. Hoosier?

677
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,760
Oh, I didn't even know he was talking about he was so off.

678
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,120
Yeah. Oh, Hoosier, I guess.

679
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,920
Are we going to hear a cover of a speech from the movie Hoosiers?

680
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,400
I guess Hoosiers is that a movie.

681
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,560
Yeah. Well, that's a team, a college team. Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
It's not the name of that artist. Hoosier. Yeah.

683
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Hoosier. Yeah, now I get it.

684
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,760
By which you're referring to, I mean, I knew we weren't going to make it

685
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,840
too far with that Mad Tea Party coming up.

686
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
Mike's favorite band in the world.

687
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,520
It goes, it goes Mad Tea Party, Beatles,

688
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,040
Led Zeppelin, Sammy and the Wobbos, Sammy and the Wobbos,

689
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Sammy Agar in the Circle, Jonas Brothers, but just Celebrate Happy.

690
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,600
And then Hoosier and his band.

691
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,840
By the way, Hoosier's band, Hoosier and the Hoosiers.

692
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,040
Sorry to dwell on this, but I don't know that.

693
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,280
Or is Celebrate Happy going to live up to Come on Everybody, Get Your Ears On?

694
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
Well, that is an interesting question.

695
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,560
I don't remember what that is or when it's from.

696
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,280
It's from Mickey's Mix Magic.

697
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,560
Yes, it was a song that I forgot was an actual like song that they put.

698
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,080
I thought it was just from an ad campaign and then it was in the mix magic.

699
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,880
It is also on Spotify.

700
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,280
So you can hear it.

701
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,720
Yes, it was not as it was just it was for a show, though.

702
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,040
It was not for an anniversary.

703
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,920
So I can't hear it, you're saying it is available to be heard.

704
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,680
Yes. Now, well, Scott, careful.

705
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,920
You're going to drop your phone.

706
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,680
You're getting it.

707
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,720
But I guess I could have been listening to the song for months

708
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,680
and knowing about Mickey's a regular coat. Yep.

709
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,480
I should just I should get off the band.

710
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,120
But I did knowing that the band was going to come up.

711
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
I was like, can I find a song by this band I haven't heard?

712
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,120
And then I looked it up and I found them doing a cover of Razorglass by Pink.

713
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,360
Yeah, I've heard.

714
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,320
Oh, I've heard. Yeah, I don't.

715
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,400
It was the funniest thing to me when you were you've been talking up

716
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,040
and this was a band that played at an event in California Adventure.

717
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,640
That's like a crazy that's the Malice in Wonderland meets Evanescence,

718
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,800
a G rated rave, top hits from the 70s through 80s through now. Yeah.

719
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,440
And I still find it so funny

720
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,360
that when they appeared on a very public stage before D23,

721
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,560
that multiple people were texting, what the hell is this shit that Mike likes?

722
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,600
It was we were those were bad streams.

723
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,440
It wasn't an official live stream that was plugged into the music, the soundboard.

724
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

725
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
Well, then how do you account for the person who was in the room

726
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,120
who texted me the same comment? Where were they seated?

727
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,200
Were they seated by the band or were they seated?

728
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,400
Because depending on the room, they were used to arena sound.

729
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,960
They play smaller venues.

730
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,360
So that was unfair. Right.

731
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,000
They didn't get to properly do the sound mix.

732
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,560
It's a hockey arena.

733
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,400
You know, no acoustics in there.

734
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,240
Yeah. No band has ever sounded good.

735
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,120
I think everyone can attest.

736
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,680
No band has ever sounded good.

737
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,920
The only song you can even hear in there is Blur's song number two.

738
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,320
Song number two. Also known as Woohoo!

739
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
It's called Song Two.

740
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
I don't know. It's called Song Hoosier Two.

741
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,160
I thought the fact that I was pretty close, pretty good.

742
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,200
You were pretty close on that one. You did get the number right.

743
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,560
I like that. I'm a big Damon Albert boy.

744
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,520
OK, I look, I hear you.

745
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,760
Can you say you're a fan, not boy?

746
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,240
What is this boy?

747
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,000
Why do we do this?

748
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,080
We are adults.

749
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,480
You are so close to 40.

750
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
You're not an anything boy.

751
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,400
Song movie, the movie 43 song, the song number two.

752
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,120
Well, that sound appears on the criteria channel that is not in the title.

753
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,360
It will be added.

754
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm a little article adding boy.

755
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,760
Yes, yes, that is what he is.

756
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
A little article adding boy.

757
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,800
Mad Tea Party.

758
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,880
This is we're going to have to focus up

759
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,040
because and they look because there is a lot to talk about here

760
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,520
because keep in mind, maybe you haven't thought this through.

761
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,080
This ride goes round and round, right?

762
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,760
So that's two giant facets that we have now an hour remaining to cover.

763
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,480
I don't know if we're going to get to both.

764
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,240
Maybe we only get to the first round.

765
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,880
There's multiple turntables in play, too.

766
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,600
There sure are. And this it's been in a different spot.

767
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,280
It's moved. It's moved.

768
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,680
And you know, the original was manufactured by Arrow

769
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,720
Development, as many early Disneyland attractions were.

770
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,280
Cool street phrase.

771
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,320
And you know, no, Arrow Development put that that motherfucker together.

772
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,920
Not aerodynamics.

773
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,480
That was the company's later name, eventually bought up by SNS,

774
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,000
undone by the complications of building X,

775
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
the rotating ride at Six Flags of Magic Mountain

776
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,520
and the unbuilt stratosphere roller coaster.

777
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,160
They were undone by that. What is that?

778
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,360
Just like they didn't have a lot lined up after that.

779
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,640
And they were kind of put all their eggs in a basket.

780
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,800
There is a great storybook amusement video on this.

781
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
And there is an expedition theme park as well about unbuilt

782
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,680
and built stratosphere stuff.

783
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,640
Of course, stratosphere, the big Space Needle looking kind of casino

784
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,680
that used to have a roller coaster that would circle the top of it.

785
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,240
A nice badly put together roller coaster.

786
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,920
Oh, long gone, long gone.

787
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,200
And never built the one, the roller coaster that was going to go down

788
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,840
the side of the building and across the road.

789
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,840
Residents were not wild about that idea.

790
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,080
Sure, sure. Sounds cool, though.

791
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,680
Well, it's similar.

792
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,720
I mean, like, look, it was uncharted territory in building the teacups.

793
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,800
So you can, you know, maybe you don't blame them too much.

794
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,160
But this I think it was kind of poorly put together back then.

795
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
So probably something we all ran into.

796
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,120
But like, what's like just as we dive in here, this is this is truly a fundamental.

797
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,840
It is it is a big one and not just a big one for Disney,

798
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,920
but a big one for all the various parks that ripped it off for years and years.

799
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,560
There was even a part of me that was like,

800
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,400
was this was this a type of ride that existed called the teacups?

801
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
And then they took it one step further by making it

802
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,040
literal teacups and to play into Alice in Wonderland.

803
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,240
And the answer is no, they nothing was ever called the teacups before this.

804
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,720
And everything else that does that, because plenty of other theme parks

805
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,920
call all these things teacups, it's all ripping Disney off.

806
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,760
And you have to this.

807
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,400
It seems odd that it's an area where they have not been super litigious,

808
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,520
where it seems like they could and would be.

809
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,400
Yes, that's true.

810
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,520
I mean, it feels like, yeah, it feels like to invent this,

811
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,440
which now just feels like part of any park.

812
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,480
Like it feels like having something that looks like this in every theme park

813
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
is just like, that's what you do.

814
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
It's like law that you do it.

815
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,440
But since Disney started it, you would think that they would be a little more

816
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,880
like, no, that's what we invent to making people dizzy.

817
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,840
Like this is what we invented. Right. Right.

818
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,960
But there is a big thing they could take off the table for competitors.

819
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,720
Although I think I saw somewhere that they don't own the patent on it.

820
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,840
So I think they can't stop people from doing a ride of this nature. Right.

821
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,320
Because maybe there was one, there were maybe there were a few

822
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,560
that existed before, but nothing that called it teacups.

823
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,480
I think what they have a patent on is like the design, the type of cup.

824
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,640
Right. The type of squiggle that is on the side of the cup.

825
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,360
So you could do like a glass, like a clear glass,

826
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,640
like you drink water out of and you could spin people around in that.

827
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,800
Yeah, because it doesn't look like a teacup.

828
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,720
And I think you could just have a general bucket, but still call it the teacups.

829
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,920
But I think maybe I don't know, I could be wrong.

830
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,320
I don't know what the I don't know what the copyright entails,

831
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
but maybe you can't do handles.

832
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,200
Maybe you can't do little plates, saucers.

833
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,960
Maybe you can't do saucers.

834
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,560
But only Disney can do saucers.

835
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,760
You could do like little dishes, like little like a dish, a candy dish.

836
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,880
It's hard for me to picture how a plate is different than a dish.

837
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,280
Well, it's like a little bowl, a little bowl, a candy dish would be a little bowl.

838
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
A candy. I was going to say dishes aren't.

839
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,880
Yeah, no, the concept of dishes themselves.

840
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,720
Yes, there's a lot of things.

841
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,600
But like a dish or like a dish for like a cat or they sometimes call dog dish.

842
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,400
It's a little bowl. Yeah.

843
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,120
Jason, is there another thing that you would want to be spun around

844
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,880
in a big version of some sort of kitchen dish?

845
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,440
Kitchen. Well, we have saucer and teacups.

846
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,760
So those are off the table.

847
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,520
That's off the table, right, because we can do that.

848
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,160
You just mentioned water glass.

849
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,760
So I guess that's all glass bowls.

850
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,840
Is there any other maybe like a colander?

851
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,680
You could spin and then go through the go through with the end.

852
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,680
You go through it. Yeah, you would be.

853
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,360
Oh, OK. I guess they kind of already have that like a gravitron kind of.

854
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,760
Well, I was going to those water slides where you kind of go around

855
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,120
the big funnel and you go out the bottom.

856
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,480
Oh, OK. Yeah, I guess.

857
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
So I think that's a different ride.

858
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,040
I think you spinning around a colander coming out of one of the holes

859
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,440
is a different ride than the teacups.

860
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,120
Yeah, I don't know how they aim you through the holes.

861
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,920
That's I think it's just like hand up and it's spinning through. Yeah. Yeah.

862
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,800
I don't think it's there's much precision in that.

863
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,880
A dinner plate.

864
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,000
You potentially you could fly off. That could be fun.

865
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,480
You're putting the most dangerous terrible at fun.

866
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,240
I think it's something simple here.

867
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,920
Well, if you want to, if you want to, if the way you want to go out

868
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,920
is flying off a giant dinner plate into an audience and a crowd.

869
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,200
Wait, why is there a crowd?

870
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,760
They're waiting to go on the ride.

871
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,960
Could be some mattresses or like, oh, OK.

872
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,560
Well, I was picturing the way you were you wanted to go out.

873
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,360
So that's the plan.

874
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,480
The plan is for people to fly off and then land on mattresses.

875
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
OK, this is a really haphazard.

876
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,880
Yeah, I was hoping you were going to say,

877
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,480
like, oh, a juice glass or something you were going to answer.

878
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,640
But you're coming up with a bunch of action park style rides here.

879
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,280
Juice glass, awfully similar to water glass.

880
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,720
It is a little more ounces.

881
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,200
You're right. Or like a sippy cup.

882
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,840
Two handles. Yeah.

883
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,360
Like a baby sippy cup or a toddler sippy cup is good.

884
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,600
Or being, you know, like an adult version, like, like, you know, one of those.

885
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't drink a lot of Moscow mules, but I like glasses.

886
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,160
Copper mug of some kind.

887
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,440
It'd be nice to those were like, like, those were like shimmer in the sun.

888
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,760
Yes. Would look very pretty.

889
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,640
They'd look good under moonlight.

890
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
It'd be a nice, like adult way to do it.

891
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,960
The sun would probably damage the copper pretty quickly.

892
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,120
I mean, you could probably figure out a way to paint it.

893
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,040
It's for if it's faux copper.

894
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,600
But yeah, sure, it doesn't have to be legit copper.

895
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,400
But that is that would be that would be cool.

896
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,120
Well, for a full, like alcohol themed theme park.

898
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,360
Duffland. Yeah.

899
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,600
Like a bro, like a bro park or something.

900
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,280
Put it in there.

901
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,840
I don't know if they're going to attract bros to the bro park.

902
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,120
I think bros are maybe going to rebel against maybe the notion

903
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,240
that this is where they're supposed to go. Maybe.

904
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,200
But then I don't know.

905
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm not a bro.

906
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,080
And I haven't known a lot over the years.

907
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah. I can't get into the head of one.

908
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,320
Well, let's ask the bros out there.

909
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,680
Would you go to a bro park where you could get in a big copper mug

910
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
that spun you around?

911
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,560
Yo, bros need your feedback, bros.

912
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,960
Are you listening to this to this show?

913
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,160
And you're a bro.

914
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,800
If first of all, why?

915
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,320
Secondly, when you're done picking all the sauces for your big wing box,

916
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,160
you know, fucking bros getting big wings.

917
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,040
Getting some brew, getting a 30 rack of keystone.

918
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,040
I mean, you know, I mean, you're right about the bros getting their wing sauce,

919
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,520
but don't you and I like to get our wing sauce to say you love your chicken

920
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,800
guy's sauces. Oh, that's true.

921
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,880
What's the difference?

922
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,200
Those are genteel dipping sauce.

923
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,600
Oh, it's a different thing than the other round of sauce they're getting tossed.

924
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,720
But I'm a B-dubs guy.

925
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,520
I'm a Buffalo Wild Wings guy. That's true.

926
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm a buffalo. I'm a little Buffalo Wild Wings boy.

927
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,880
I'm a little sauce boy.

928
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,680
This is this allergy that you described before.

929
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,960
There is no worse phraseology.

930
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,520
So it truly is.

931
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,440
I think I think the hairs inside my ear all stand up.

932
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,240
Yeah. Well, I try to block the words from getting in there again.

933
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,720
Look, you don't understand. Mike's still young.

934
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,640
He can still go.

935
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,680
You do. Oh, he does understand that.

936
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,760
He does know that.

937
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,720
Well, yeah, I've been made to understand it from how often it's been said.

938
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,360
I grab his wrist and I let go.

939
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,160
You're not leaving jelly rolls until that door closes, locks.

940
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,480
I do think I guess all this to say, I do think the teacup perhaps is the best

941
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,760
of all the different things in a kitchen you could ride in and spin in a circle.

942
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,360
I would have to agree.

943
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,080
Yeah, I think it makes

944
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,760
it makes sense within the storytelling and makes sense in the world.

945
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,120
And I think that it's a you almost have to.

946
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
You know, look, this is like,

947
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,280
you know, maybe there's more like excitement about a big e-ticket type

948
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,520
attraction and maybe there's more bean on the bone to talk about

949
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,880
even with a big e-ticket attraction.

950
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,400
But I've really I don't know if it's just a parenting thing.

951
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,440
I don't know if like now bringing

952
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,760
young children into the parks has affected my thinking.

953
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,120
But I think it has because you gravitate to different rides when you do that.

954
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,000
And this really struck me a couple of weeks ago when we talked about Epic

955
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,640
Universe and how much it all clicked with me.

956
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Yoshi's Adventure is a ride that seems like nothing on its face is like

957
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,400
the heart of the land.

958
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,360
And you wish they had a lot more of these.

959
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:25,080
I do. I think there is some just like basic fun and creativity to.

960
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,360
All right. One of our most popular movies we have to represent

961
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,960
is Alice in Wonderland. What are we going to do when we put people in a car

962
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,040
that takes you through the scenes of the movie?

963
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,640
I mean, yes, they ended up doing that.

964
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,080
But even that you're in a big, cool caterpillar.

965
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,600
That's neat. But like that we're going to abstractify the movie

966
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,200
and put not not just have you be a passive participant

967
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,040
looking at characters and scenes that you aren't a part of.

968
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,560
But you're in the you're in a cup.

969
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,440
Yeah, you're in the tea party.

970
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,920
You are the tea. Right.

971
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,080
And I really and I do think this is a kind of thing that gets lost

972
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,720
in kind of the more when the when the narrative is fleshed out in the stories

973
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,480
like in a rise, the resistance or not.

974
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,640
I'm sorry. In a galaxy's edge or an Avengers campus or whatever.

975
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,760
That when the when the narrative is too strong,

976
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,600
you can't there's not opportunity to just have a silly, stupid ride

977
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,480
that doesn't make any narrative sense, but that is great fun for everybody.

978
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,280
Is that does all that make sense?

979
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,880
Yes. I think what you're saying is that they're like, especially in the last

980
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,720
10, 20 years, the obsession with the idea of story.

981
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,840
Yes. And the story is immersed in this world.

982
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,160
And what this has led to some wonderful things.

983
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,360
But I think there's also like a place for your.

984
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,520
Yeah, you're in the you're in the tea.

985
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,280
You're like, yeah, you're in this silly vehicle

986
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,960
and it's fun what it does to you. Right.

987
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,080
Now, obviously, Cars Land, Radator Springs did a great job with.

988
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,880
I think Radator Springs took the

989
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,640
teacup style, D ticket, C ticket, wherever you want to call it,

990
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,160
and like updated it, took it like, you know, into the new millennium

991
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,720
to the next level.

992
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,600
And I just wish that there were I think we

993
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,680
parks should not neglect this kind of thing where it's like, yes,

994
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,240
it's simple, but it's effective.

995
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,760
People have loved it just as much for 70 years and always will.

996
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Yeah. I mean, there should be like a Star Wars land.

997
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,960
It should be like, yeah. And you ride a lightsaber like it doesn't like it.

998
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,320
Yeah, I know.

999
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,800
Like, I know.

1000
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,760
Like, there's got to be something like that.

1001
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,720
Yeah, it's just too.

1002
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,800
Is that it? Or what if you're what's there?

1003
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,520
What's their chess?

1004
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,040
Is there something with that? What's the what's the hologram chess?

1005
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,960
Yeah, but there's some other there's some sabbath.

1006
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,360
Is that it? That's the card game, the holographic chess games.

1007
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,960
Yeah, that's what it is.

1008
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
What if you were one of those?

1009
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
What if you were moving around?

1010
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,640
Oh, that would be awesome, too.

1011
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,960
That would be really sliding around from and like knocking other figures.

1012
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,600
Yeah. Yeah, that's fun.

1013
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,280
I think like I think people in the 50s did not ask.

1014
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,400
But how does this work in terms of the broader narrative?

1015
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,400
I think they said I get to be in a teacup that spins around.

1016
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,120
Sounds great. Sign me up.

1017
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
Yeah, I think this what is the story?

1018
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,480
You know, what's the story behind this can be helpful.

1019
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,920
But like it has like infected.

1020
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,720
Like, what is the story of this gastro pubs?

1021
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,680
Like, what is the story of this clothing line?

1022
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,360
Yeah, you know, sure.

1023
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,200
There's too much, especially theme parks.

1024
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,680
There's too much logic in of everything instead of just.

1025
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,720
You know, figuring out what the coolest version of every room is

1026
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,320
and the coolest version of every ride in space.

1027
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,160
I think I said this before on the show and a Tony Baxter interview.

1028
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,560
He claims that Mark Davis was complaining about people

1029
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,560
calling ride stories and going, they're not stories.

1030
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,920
Wow. They're just stuff happened like fun stuff happening.

1031
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,520
Like he was really irritated by it.

1032
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,560
I think Tony was using it to illustrate that he felt similarly about it.

1033
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,920
I think of the same interview, he was also talking about how

1034
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,360
Jar Jar Binks should be in Galaxy's Edge.

1035
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,760
And even though Jar Jar Binks was like controversial or people

1036
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,640
didn't like him at the time, people he was like, people would go nuts

1037
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,960
seeing Jar Jar Binks in Galaxy's Edge.

1038
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,280
And he's absolutely right.

1039
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,280
That's definitely 100 percent right.

1040
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,640
And yeah, well, he's he's Star Wars.

1041
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,200
Goofy is what he is. Yeah.

1042
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,400
And I'd love to see him there.

1043
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,560
And I'd love to see what colorful vests he's wearing, of course,

1044
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,920
for the 70th anniversary.

1045
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,960
But there's a lot less of that these days.

1046
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
I feel like the thinking is more just like

1047
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,640
the perfectly crafted narrative.

1048
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,880
And the ride is so makes so much sense.

1049
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,640
And this right connects to this.

1050
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,600
And some of that's cool.

1051
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,720
But some of it's just like, I think we're missing out on

1052
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,800
just like the most fun version of things.

1053
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,480
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't.

1054
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,120
Yeah. And it's not bad. Yeah.

1055
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,320
Well, it's where you think it's not always better.

1056
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,240
What's where you got to be thankful for this this perennial and this?

1057
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,720
Like I don't like isn't Disneyland really built on the back of it?

1058
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,080
Like when people were leaving that place in 55,

1059
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,760
and I'm sure there was a lot to complain about in that first day

1060
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,360
and that first month and all that.

1061
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,160
But I think the big headlines were, oh, it's cool.

1062
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,000
There's this one thing where we fly around an elephant.

1063
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
It goes around around this other thing.

1064
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,400
We sit in a teacup and it spins around and around.

1065
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,400
It's really where they're not these.

1066
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,320
And maybe people were as excited about, you know, what are the big like?

1067
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,200
What did you leave?

1068
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,920
What was as we as Epic Universe opens?

1069
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,680
Yeah. And knowing that all the all the heat and all the pressure

1070
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,080
is going to be on Potter and the monsters.

1071
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,000
What do you think people were leaving Disneyland talking about?

1072
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,200
Was it was it this?

1073
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,280
Was it Jungle Jungle Cruise?

1074
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,840
Pretty like new immersive that like that might have really tricked people

1075
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,120
in terms of I don't know what they I don't know how they made a jungle train.

1076
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,920
I bet the whole thing, though, since it was so crazy, too,

1077
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,640
there was just nothing.

1078
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
There was nothing like it.

1079
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,360
So I can imagine everybody a different thing.

1080
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,000
Now we're so we're so jaded with all of our themed entertainment.

1081
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,560
Now we require it picking things apart a little more.

1082
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,480
But I have to imagine people like, hey, look at that thing they built,

1083
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,040
that big crazy thing they built.

1084
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040
Yeah. Yeah. This is this is wild.

1085
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,560
Yeah. I think one thing I'm looking forward to that seems like they got

1086
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,560
right in this sense for you mentioned Epic Universe in,

1087
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,080
you know, the monsters area.

1088
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,320
It's like, yeah, Igor is here and Dracula and Frankenstein and the Wolfman.

1089
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,600
Yeah. And fuck it.

1090
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,400
The creature from the Black Lagoon and the Phantom of the like.

1091
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,920
Everyone's here. Yes. Yes.

1092
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,640
And they figured it out with the construct of dark more.

1093
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,000
It's just yeah, it's still it is still technically it's a coherent story.

1094
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,200
Even if that, you know, you could poke holes in it if you thought too hard.

1095
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,120
But do you want to think too hard or do you want all the monsters to be right?

1096
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,640
The movie Dark Universe, the line of movies that never got off the ground

1097
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,200
where it's like, OK, and so there's a mummy,

1098
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,840
but it's not Tom Cruise at the beginning, but maybe by the end.

1099
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,520
And Dr. Jekyll and Mr.

1100
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,640
Hyder there and he runs a secret like shield organization.

1101
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,480
This is going to be Frankenstein.

1102
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,960
This is going to be Dracula and blah, blah, blah.

1103
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,640
And it's like, that's so complicated than just this ride is all the guys.

1104
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,720
Yes. Yeah, yeah. I think they've got the right idea.

1105
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,960
I mean, we haven't got to do it yet, but it definitely seems promising.

1106
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,840
In one of the like alleyways near one of the windows,

1107
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,120
there's like a whole audio track playing of Dr.

1108
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,720
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde getting into an argument. Oh, wow.

1109
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,200
There's a couple of minutes of like, what are you doing?

1110
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,720
You're out of control.

1111
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,280
Like in this whole like dramatic thing, there's a sign to for like, oh, yeah, yeah.

1112
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,560
Dr. Jekyll apothecary.

1113
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,040
Yes, ever. All the all the characters are there.

1114
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,720
Smart. And they have yes, they have figured out their logic for it.

1115
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,560
Well, I don't know if I don't know.

1116
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,760
I don't know if I'm just trying to hamfistedly go back to what we're talking about.

1117
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,760
But but that is like they also had the right idea with Fantasyland where they don't go.

1118
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,560
But why would how would Snow White know Mr.

1119
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,840
Toad and you're saying their neighbors and that there has to be some construct

1120
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,520
that allows you to jump from realm to realm at like or I don't know.

1121
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,760
This is just a place all storybooks live. Yeah.

1122
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,040
All the princesses are here.

1123
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,080
They didn't. Yeah, they didn't ever think.

1124
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,360
Yeah. I think Dumbo is in Old England.

1125
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,200
That's fine. Right. No problem.

1126
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:10,000
Is this an necessity of invention kind of thing where it's like we have the space.

1127
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,080
We don't have much time.

1128
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,000
We have some money.

1129
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,920
Hopefully more money is coming.

1130
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,880
Yeah. I mean, I just think they weren't.

1131
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,480
It's just that I mean, we like completely like theme to one thing.

1132
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,160
Big lands. Yeah.

1133
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,520
But yeah, it was not.

1134
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,600
This was not a there was anything that's sort of like in a book.

1135
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,800
And I've got look, I've complained.

1136
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,280
I don't like who would buy you country.

1137
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,720
But I think that's because by you country is too specific.

1138
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,600
Sure. Sure.

1139
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,080
If we mean that retro, it is been retrofit so many times.

1140
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,320
Yeah, they've changed the name of it.

1141
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,240
I'm just saying that like that bothers me now because the land is so specific.

1142
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,680
Fantasyland is a pretty broad name.

1143
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,160
What does that even mean? Really?

1144
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,520
Other than just fictional.

1145
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,080
Yeah. I guess fantasy is in that way.

1146
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,760
Like it really does give it.

1147
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,320
I almost feel like maybe what we just want is a new fantasy land today,

1148
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,040
one that doesn't take itself as seriously.

1149
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,840
Yeah. It is just kind of like and plop.

1150
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,720
It's all here.

1151
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,240
But it's sort of what like Soos landing or whatever would say that's all here.

1152
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,120
It doesn't matter if the characters never met or wouldn't know each other.

1153
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,120
Just put them all there.

1154
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,920
I guess Fantasy Springs is the souped up version in Japan.

1155
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah. Fantasyland where it's still little mini lands

1156
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,960
connected, they're still not.

1157
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,720
I think they're still in the mindset of like land or mini land

1158
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,480
because it does feel like, yeah, are we ever going to get just a land opening up

1159
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,120
that is multiple?

1160
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,240
I mean, I guess kind of that area in Animal Kingdom that's got Indiana Jones

1161
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,400
and oh, sure, that seems like a good mishmash.

1162
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,080
Yeah, that's yeah, that's closer to what I think we're saying.

1163
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,680
We're saying we like our mishmashes.

1164
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,840
We can still do mishmashes.

1165
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,200
And actually, well, let me let me tie things together with Epic Universe

1166
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,760
and teacups and another another first that I think the teacups does,

1167
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,240
because I thought Epic Universe did a great job of using attractions

1168
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,560
as the kinetic energy in the land, as like, you know,

1169
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,040
things work if you're not on the ride because you're watching it pass by

1170
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,200
and it's fun to look at.

1171
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,040
And it obviously works to be on it because it's fun to be on a ride.

1172
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,240
And I think the teacups are probably an early attraction

1173
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,000
where it is sort of this kinetic sculpture

1174
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,920
as well as a being a fun ride to go on itself.

1175
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,040
And I'm sure that was evident in day one.

1176
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,080
But what you didn't have in day one yet was attractions up in the air.

1177
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,440
And by the time you add Skyway and Monorail

1178
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,880
and I guess Matterhorn, you catch glimpses of it, but that you can like

1179
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,440
that you can look down on this thing and that it's well designed

1180
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,400
just to look at as well and that there's psychedelic swirls

1181
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,040
and the and the colors are fun to watch and just like watching the mecha,

1182
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,280
watching the mechanism, watching the turntables.

1183
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,240
Yeah, it was really neat.

1184
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,000
So I think like, yeah, I don't know.

1185
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,960
It pays it pays the way in that regard, too.

1186
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,080
It's just a cool experience to look at it.

1187
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,960
Yeah, I mean, I hate this episode turning into a complete

1188
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,440
just complain about everything else episode.

1189
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,840
But that is where my head is at now, because I'm like Spider-Man

1190
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,640
ride in Avengers campus.

1191
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,400
It's like that ride is OK.

1192
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,840
Some people say bad. I say OK.

1193
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,360
But would it have been better for them to build?

1194
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,160
What is a very expensive ride that ride?

1195
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,360
Or would it have been like make some like little swing ride

1196
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,920
with some like cheap, like simple looking buildings

1197
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,360
that makes you kind of like dip in and out of the buildings?

1198
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,400
And it's like your web.

1199
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,960
Yeah, as if your web you're swinging and there's a couple static figures.

1200
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,400
But the movement of it looks cool from like the streets.

1201
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,000
So you get the swoop that Spidey and you get the swoop.

1202
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,120
And it's just a simple ride.

1203
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,400
Yeah, probably a lot cheaper than what they put in there.

1204
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,920
It gives that zone a lot more energy.

1205
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,360
People take a lot of pictures.

1206
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,400
People take a lot of pictures of it.

1207
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,120
And it ultimately is at least as popular as what's there.

1208
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,760
That does sound really doesn't.

1209
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,400
That's like there's got to be some little premise.

1210
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,280
And then you've got that going all around the land instead of this

1211
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,840
like kind of clinical.

1212
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,960
These are offices.

1213
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,160
These are where I go to do work. Right.

1214
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,320
And I'm sort of basing it on that like patent that they put for like

1215
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,760
a crazy looking swing ride that never got made

1216
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,400
or hopefully will eventually get made with like big practical buildings.

1217
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,840
But like make a kind of kiddie version of it.

1218
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,520
And I don't know, maybe it makes the land better.

1219
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah, in a way. Yeah.

1220
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,520
And it's not as complained about as the ride is now.

1221
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,640
Yes, possibly. Yeah.

1222
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,280
But let's let's talk basics here.

1223
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,120
Let's make sure we get just like the stuff out.

1224
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,280
We got 18 cups.

1225
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,120
We got three big turntables.

1226
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
Let's not forget those plates.

1227
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,720
We got those little plates as well.

1228
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,080
Handles only because you can do those handles.

1229
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,640
Yeah.

1230
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,000
Step plate steps that you could trip on.

1231
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,080
Yes, very easily. Yes.

1232
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,720
Yeah, I'm always cautious.

1233
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,440
Everybody should be cautious with the kids.

1234
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,960
That is a kid. Oh, yeah.

1235
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,840
The height of a kid.

1236
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,280
That's a magnet for for a slip.

1237
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,280
I had not thought about how the breakdown of the spinning happens.

1238
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,920
That so your cups can spin.

1239
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,120
The cups go counterclockwise.

1240
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,240
They are then there's three turntables with six cups each.

1241
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,440
Those all go clockwise.

1242
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,960
Then all of it is on one big turntable, which goes counterclockwise.

1243
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,480
So you got a lot of competing directions,

1244
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,000
which I don't think I really clocked or appreciated is part of the dizzying effect

1245
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,680
that you're spinning in three different ways, essentially, at all times.

1246
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,480
Yeah, I guess I mean, it makes complete sense.

1247
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,000
But I guess I never thought of it in that way.

1248
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,160
But it definitely felt like you're going against the grain.

1249
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,800
It doesn't feel to me.

1250
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,080
I don't know about you guys.

1251
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,280
And I don't ever feel that dizzy on it.

1252
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,080
This particular thing doesn't make me dizzy or queasy

1253
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,520
in the way that guardians does a little bit.

1254
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,200
This is a good question.

1255
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,320
How much does this affect?

1256
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,560
Because it like it's there's the I think the notoriety through the years

1257
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,360
of that this is the queasy maker. Right.

1258
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,160
This is like don't get on the if you were writing a sitcom joke about Disneyland

1259
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,080
and you didn't know anything about Disneyland. Right.

1260
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,840
It'd probably be something about barfing when you get off the teacups.

1261
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,000
Yes. How do people how do people feel?

1262
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,720
Has this ever affected you in a in a nauseous way?

1263
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,440
This was a big childhood favorite of mine. Right.

1264
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,680
And would be at Disneyland or be a smaller park knockoffs.

1265
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,800
And I wanted to spin it fast.

1266
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, I think when I got older,

1267
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,520
I did have the impression of like, were these always so hard to spin?

1268
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,640
Now I learned I guess I never really thought about why.

1269
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,480
And learning about this. Yeah.

1270
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,920
Reading about it, it was like a purposeful choice after

1271
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,040
someone fell getting off of one.

1272
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,400
Yes. Or I think I think somebody stood.

1273
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,360
I think a kid stood up and flew out of the thing.

1274
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,240
Something that they, you know, like theoretically, if you were sitting

1275
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
because this ride does not have seatbelts. Right.

1276
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,280
And theoretically, gravity should keep you inside.

1277
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,080
But that is undone if you if you're going crazy with it in 2004.

1278
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,520
It's made more difficult to spin fast after a disabled rider

1279
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,480
lost his balance and slipped from a teacup. OK.

1280
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,280
So you could go like as fast as you possibly wanted before 2004.

1281
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,160
Like your strength was the only thing holding you back.

1282
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,680
Well, kind of.

1283
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,040
This is also part of the history.

1284
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,520
And you guys probably ran into this, too, that if you go all the way back

1285
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,120
when the park opens July 55,

1286
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,000
there is literally nothing stopping you from cranking this thing up

1287
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,440
as fast as it can go.

1288
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,440
I think in the early days, also, maybe they didn't limit

1289
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,920
how many people could be in there, because I think there's

1290
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,960
photos where you could see six people in.

1291
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,600
Yeah. Or I mean, it's you're limited by just how many can physically fit.

1292
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,000
But I think maybe they keep it in the four range.

1293
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Now, I don't I don't actually know that.

1294
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,320
I don't know. But I think I think six people could jump on there.

1295
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,680
And there was absolutely nothing slowing it down.

1296
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,320
So you could just spin and spin and spin and spin in the reveal of the ride,

1297
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,880
the reveal of the ride to an ABC television audience in the opening day.

1298
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,800
Special. They kind of like

1299
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,920
the characters run to this ride and they run over here and they run over here.

1300
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,440
And the Alice in Wonderland characters run onto the turntable.

1301
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,880
And you see the March hair just like nudge a cup.

1302
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,280
And it like it like it spins so fast

1303
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,520
from being like accidentally touched for balance, basically.

1304
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,440
And it really gives you a sense of how this thing you could just crank in 55.

1305
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,960
You could go really fast.

1306
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,200
You buy tobacco on Main Street, no gum, no gum, no gum and no booze.

1307
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,560
You're saying that the things you were allowed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1308
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,360
You're saying gum was the least dangerous perhaps of the three.

1309
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,680
I'm just saying like Walt said no gum.

1310
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,920
He said no booze.

1311
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,280
Yeah. So you had to. Yeah.

1312
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,520
You couldn't you couldn't drink.

1313
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,080
You had to get the natural high of spinning really, really fast in there.

1314
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,280
So I think that led to probably a lot of early

1315
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
vomiting from people who had never been on anything remotely like this

1316
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,400
and you had no built in measures to stop themselves from doing it.

1317
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,120
Yeah. I think it also led to a lot of wear and tear on the attraction.

1318
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,480
This is some of the history and backstory that you could find is that

1319
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,840
very early on in the first month, they are sending welders

1320
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:43,040
to weld the ride back together for two hours a day every day.

1321
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,880
That is that is the amount that this thing was just cracking apart.

1322
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,560
Due to zero regulations on the spin.

1323
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,880
Yeah. Now we go to an often looming figure in Disneyland history, Bob Gurr.

1324
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,240
Bob Gurr helped put this together as well as everything.

1325
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,640
I think the entire thing was hanging on his shoulder.

1326
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,080
He was just he was like, you know, the handyman in the building.

1327
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,920
Anything breaks, you call you call this one guy

1328
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,000
and it might not get fixed for a while because it is all on the one guy

1329
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,640
and he's got a long list and a bunch of other buildings to go to. Right.

1330
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,760
So that is what Bob Gurr seems like for early Disneyland.

1331
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,760
And he describes having to fix the thing and like, try to get like,

1332
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,240
get under the hood, basically, and figure out what the hell is going on.

1333
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,600
Why does this thing keep cracking apart so often?

1334
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,120
And he describes doing this, getting under the attraction

1335
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,040
while the ride is in motion.

1336
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,840
Now, I don't know what you got under there.

1337
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,160
I don't know. Maybe maybe it's very comfortable.

1338
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,920
Maybe you've got 10 feet down there.

1339
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,520
I don't know. But my suspicion is you do not.

1340
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,280
These guys are built differently. Yeah, yes.

1341
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,680
When men were men, you see.

1342
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,480
Yeah, completely insane.

1343
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,600
And then there's a there's a recent video because Bob is still with us.

1344
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,680
And he like a like a month or so ago

1345
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,320
went on the teacups for the first time.

1346
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,320
And the person he's with is like, what do you mean?

1347
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,480
You've never been on it.

1348
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,760
And he's like, I don't know.

1349
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,480
I look, I built the thing that made me want to go on at the least.

1350
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,840
Never had any desire.

1351
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,280
I know too much.

1352
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,760
And then interesting in the video

1353
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,400
that he he has a very particular method of spinning.

1354
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,520
He's like, I know how to do this for maximum pleasure.

1355
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,600
I know when to do it and I know when to stop.

1356
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,840
And they're like, how? I built it.

1357
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,680
All right. Just know I know from looking.

1358
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,680
I like so Bob Gerr said, if you watch this video, he like his method,

1359
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,560
because you might think just spin and spin and spin and spin.

1360
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,120
And maybe that is the most pleasurable way to do it.

1361
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,520
But Bob Gerr, having never been on it, just like is here's my

1362
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,240
here's my method. I don't know what it is.

1363
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,680
Did he explain? He didn't explain it.

1364
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,360
It'd be hard. It was hard for me to parse.

1365
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,080
And I think you'd have to watch it to understand.

1366
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,320
But it was not dissimilar from what I do these days.

1367
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,800
I think I'm a kid and I'm just spinning and spinning and spinning.

1368
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,680
I think now what I like to do is like put in a big run and then like

1369
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,920
he's off and then like kind of like not worry about it for a second and just cruise.

1370
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,080
And then we lose a little bit of speed and we come back to it.

1371
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,280
We crank it up again.

1372
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,280
But I like I really like all right.

1373
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,800
Like sprints, sprints, sprints, sprints, now relax and and so on and so forth.

1374
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,120
Because it's nice to just like, well, it's fun to spin.

1375
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,400
It's also fun to like just lean back, put your arms up on the side,

1376
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,120
just kind of just just cruise, just just let momentum do it.

1377
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,200
Because you can really tire out your arms completely.

1378
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,960
Yeah. Yeah. Which is why I mean, I mean, you must have done this with your brother

1379
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,480
instead that like if you're with another kid and or a group of kids.

1380
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,560
Oh, yeah. And you can just collectively

1381
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,720
use all of your little energy.

1382
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,560
Yeah. And just and probably not lay back and enjoy the sights.

1383
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,560
Just try to get that thing going as fast as you can.

1384
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,320
Seems like fun. That's right.

1385
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,120
Yeah. Every time there was a bunch of kids, that would be the case.

1386
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,320
Yeah. I think classic Disneyland experience, I think.

1387
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,440
Yeah. But I'm more what you're saying now.

1388
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,320
I don't I don't need to go nuts with it because I also like to like

1389
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,120
give me a second to like take in the Matterhorn just like and kind of like

1390
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,800
enjoy because it is always spinning, even if you want to spin it.

1391
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,600
Like, let me enjoy the wide.

1392
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,720
Let me let me do the macro spin now.

1393
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,360
Oh, yeah. And do the micro spin.

1394
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,160
Well, and especially if it's a night.

1395
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,240
Yes. Oh, my gosh. It's great at night.

1396
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,280
Disneyland at night. Yes.

1397
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,080
The lanterns that were added are wonderful.

1398
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,120
I think the placemaking here is fantastic.

1399
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,800
Yes. That they created this little Alice mini land

1400
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,400
because Alice I've said before, I think might be my favorite of the of the dark rides.

1401
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,200
And I really like it.

1402
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,680
The exterior and the caterpillars are coming in and out.

1403
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,000
And I like that it's all in the shadow of the Matterhorn.

1404
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,320
I like that monorails are passing by and storybook land.

1405
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,800
Those boats are launching.

1406
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,680
It's kind of that like I can get a little stressed out in main drag

1407
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,760
fantasy land, you know, because it's like two rides here, two rides here,

1408
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,000
like lines that pile up real fast, carousel clogging up the way.

1409
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,040
And I kind of like let me relax a little.

1410
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,640
Let me go over to chill fantasy land, too.

1411
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,800
This is your side nook.

1412
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,160
Yeah, we were. It's more like pastoral, you know?

1413
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,480
Yeah, I know.

1414
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,280
And then you can get out a little bit easier that sort of toward the

1415
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,320
yeah, out toward the convenient Alice bathrooms with a lot of built in

1416
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,600
wall seating, one of the best.

1417
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,160
They put them back in the best bathroom.

1418
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,640
You hear all kinds of your music from every direction.

1419
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,200
It's all kind of different. Yeah, that is a fun.

1420
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,360
You get a fun carnival kind of atmosphere.

1421
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,160
A bunch of different cues coming in and out.

1422
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,880
Maybe a little monorail honk.

1423
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,520
Maybe I hear a little bit of Swiss Alps music from Matterhorn.

1424
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,800
Yeah, it's just it's a magic zone in the park.

1425
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:42,360
I agree. And I think you got to credit Tony Baxter for this unless he

1426
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,320
who knows the breakdown of what people do in these land overhauls.

1427
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:52,560
But this where the teacups are now is a post 83 thing, a post new fantasy land

1428
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,520
thing, because in the 50s you go through the castle.

1429
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,360
That's carousel right there.

1430
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,480
And then it's teacups right behind it.

1431
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,160
Barely any room between and I think Dumbo right in there, too.

1432
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,640
Dumbo move is kind of a flip almost where the carousel is.

1433
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,560
Now is where the teacups was.

1434
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,760
Yes. Yes.

1435
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,280
I believe. OK. Yeah.

1436
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,960
So then they just yeah, the carousel moved.

1437
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,840
But it was sort of like early teacups seem maybe a little unpleasant

1438
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,720
because you don't have the lighting fixtures.

1439
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,960
Yeah, there's nothing above it.

1440
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,920
Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

1441
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,080
When and it is just it did seem like kind of like a big open

1442
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,560
hot kind of area. That's true.

1443
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,240
I think they didn't paint it originally.

1444
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,840
And it was just kind of brown wood.

1445
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,280
Gray. Yeah. Yeah.

1446
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,640
And then they paint it the spiral.

1447
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,600
Yes. Underneath. Yeah.

1448
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,920
Red and yellow, which may look cool for Skyway.

1449
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,640
I'm sure. Yeah.

1450
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah. But I don't know.

1451
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,040
I think that I think that move had some some magic to it.

1452
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,400
I think that I agree. New little nook is.

1453
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,240
I think where it moved to was kind of empty space. Right.

1454
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,360
Right. From what I saw.

1455
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,320
I still think you have visually,

1456
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,600
especially if you're a kid, you walk in and there's big teacups.

1457
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,920
It looks the old version still looks pretty awesome.

1458
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,960
If that's your expectation, like.

1459
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,560
But yes, the new version added an extra layer of of Disney

1460
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,760
magic to it, for sure. Yeah, I believe.

1461
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,280
So the teacups are in five of the six

1462
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,240
Magic Kingdom Disneyland style parks. Correct.

1463
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,440
I don't think they're in Shanghai. Yeah.

1464
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,920
This is the only one that's uncovered by like a pavilion.

1465
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,000
Yes. Yeah.

1466
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,080
Which the pavilions kind of help.

1467
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,040
They can run in the rain because covered. Yeah.

1468
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,040
And the hot beating sun.

1469
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,560
It's some relief, some shade from the sun. Right. Right.

1470
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,360
I'm going to do a little gotcha.

1471
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,040
I've been looking up. I've been looking at some maps.

1472
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:48,920
I've been looking at some overheads.

1473
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,160
Was I wrong about the carousel? Wrong about the carousel has not moved.

1474
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,080
I think you are. I think you're thinking of unless.

1475
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,200
Oh, wait. Or am I crazy?

1476
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,360
Was it? You know what? I can't tell what I'm looking at.

1477
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,520
I don't know if it was Dumbo that was right past the.

1478
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,960
No, wasn't it always carousel?

1479
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,000
No, I think it was always carousel. Yes.

1480
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,560
Yeah, that is correct.

1481
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,680
What did they read then on Yesterland?

1482
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,920
Maybe I misread something.

1483
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,400
Well, I've seen that it's like the only attraction that did like a full flip.

1484
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,840
But I think what that is, is the flip of Dumbo and

1485
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,080
and teacups. I believe this is what I this is what I am seeing.

1486
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,680
Um, did I need to say that?

1487
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,760
Was that a fight that I needed to win? No.

1488
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,680
I guess. I like to be accurate.

1489
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,920
Yes, it was.

1490
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,960
We need to. I think.

1491
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,800
OJER needs to be pronounced correctly and I need to know where the teacups were.

1492
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,800
I think Disneyland Fantasyland, I feel like it's a sort of thing.

1493
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,280
People think, well, this has been there forever.

1494
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,040
This has been just like this forever and it has been there since 55.

1495
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,240
Yeah, yeah. But it's but it's important to correct those people

1496
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,920
and say they're wrong. They're dead wrong.

1497
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,480
And it's important to shame them and make make them know where they're incorrect.

1498
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,520
Yeah, I don't know. I'll look it up.

1499
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,000
I think Disney World to you might be confusing stuff.

1500
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,720
And Disney World Fantasyland, expand it in the 2010s.

1501
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,200
Maybe stuff open and closed.

1502
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,480
Mad Tea Party was located where the King Arthur Carousel sits today.

1503
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,840
That's what it says on Yesterland. OK, so.

1504
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,320
But I do think here I'm looking at I'm looking at 59.

1505
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,720
This is just a piece of art, by the way.

1506
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,880
But what I'm looking at is that you walk in carousels right there.

1507
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,160
Now, maybe Carousel moved a little bit, maybe it backed up a little bit.

1508
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,560
That might be what happened. Yeah.

1509
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,320
That might be what it's saying then. Yeah, yeah.

1510
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,960
I I wish I'd put a financial value on this correction, though.

1511
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,400
Oh, you wanted to bet? Yeah.

1512
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,120
Yeah, it's too late. It is too late.

1513
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,040
I mean, you can't bet in reverse.

1514
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,680
No, it wouldn't really make sense.

1515
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,640
I think you just have to look in your heart and think about what you owe me for this.

1516
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,320
But isn't it unclear? It's unclear versus this.

1517
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,600
So I don't know if the bet would have completely gone through.

1518
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,160
Well, I could be if we not.

1519
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,800
Maybe we haven't officially solved it yet.

1520
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,080
I don't know that we've officially solved it.

1521
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,840
Well, look, and to go back and like be looking at different.

1522
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,360
I already got I got so many tabs open.

1523
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,000
I still got wabos open. I got locked in.

1524
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,320
Yeah, no, I hear you open.

1525
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,960
And we should still keep talking, I guess.

1526
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,160
I guess so.

1527
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,880
What do we think about Disneyland as opposed to the other version,

1528
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,640
especially Magic Kingdom version?

1529
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,440
Well, I like the little pavilion that Magic Kingdom is kind of in.

1530
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,800
But I like the lantern.

1531
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,440
I mean, the lanterns at night are really lovely.

1532
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,800
Yeah. That said, can operate in the rain.

1533
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,960
Has to do some cleanup after a rain, you know, still the case.

1534
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,960
Or is that an old is that reported?

1535
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,080
But I feel like I've been there in the rain and it is it might be heavy rain.

1536
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,720
But there is some something with the turntables in the rain.

1537
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,880
Least in the past. Right.

1538
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,920
I mean, I think it's better open air. Yeah.

1539
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,280
But yeah, I'm not mad at it with the thing, with the coverings.

1540
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,640
But yeah, I think it's better open air. I'm mad. I am mad at it.

1541
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,200
I think that they're cowardly to put those overhangs on.

1542
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:08,920
Disney World did.

1543
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,840
Actually, Disney World opened, I think, with it open air.

1544
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,400
And then a couple of years.

1545
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,360
Well, with the weather and the hurricanes, they decided maybe we need something.

1546
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,800
And I think that's a fear based move.

1547
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,760
And I think you can't, you know, you can't run forever.

1548
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,080
And I think there was a lot of cowardice on the part of those people.

1549
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,240
Scott's been watching a lot of Silicon Valley

1550
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:34,800
hustle grindset, you know, can't live a fear based life kind of stuff.

1551
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,320
And, you know, yeah, yeah.

1552
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,480
I think that they should we should start our own

1553
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,960
like Save Splash Mountain campaign to get rid of that covering.

1554
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,560
We should do a whole like, yeah, a petition.

1555
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:53,160
There was when they, you know, made it harder to spin in the early 2000s.

1556
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,920
I saw an excerpt from like Associated Press, Sacramento Bee

1557
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,800
about like people like, it's just not as fun.

1558
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,440
You know, it's all these lawsuits and everyone's so safety conscious now.

1559
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,680
And it's like, God damn it.

1560
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,000
History really does rhyme. This shit never changes.

1561
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,720
Wait, wait, go on.

1562
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,760
I mean, I mean, just every time there's a change, people go like,

1563
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,120
it's just not the same as it used to be. Sure.

1564
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,960
Yeah. But aren't we here complaining about all the new shit they've done lately?

1565
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,960
Well, I think I bet more of a problem.

1566
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,800
Finally, though, we're right about that.

1567
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,720
The thing is, yes, everyone who did it before was not right.

1568
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,720
And that's what makes us special and cool is that we are right

1569
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,840
and everything we say is right.

1570
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,680
We have we're precision complainers, too.

1571
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,320
We complain about the exact right things to complain about.

1572
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,280
It's like Tobias Arrested Development.

1573
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,480
Has that ever worked before? No.

1574
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,920
But this time, this time for us, it might just work.

1575
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,840
Similar, yes.

1576
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,240
But yes, I think open air, cooler. Yeah.

1577
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:02,040
Nicer. But yeah, the other ones,

1578
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,320
they want to save money, I bet.

1579
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,480
Save maintenance money.

1580
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,040
You think it's that, too?

1581
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,240
Well, probably, I mean, if it's if the if it gets a beating during a storm,

1582
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,240
they're probably covering and they can run it, I guess, during a storm, too.

1583
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,440
That's why guests shouldn't be fear based either.

1584
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,680
We need it is our duty to go on this ride in the rain. OK.

1585
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,040
I'd love to go and then you get the closest to an actual teacup

1586
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,920
experience if the if the by vehicle is flooding was filled up.

1587
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,440
Yeah. Uh huh. And your waist deep in water, dirty water resembling tea

1588
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,560
smacked in the face by dirty teawater.

1589
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,280
Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1590
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,840
Jason, what liquid would you want in your teacup?

1591
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,520
If you could choose, if you had to do the ride with a liquid.

1592
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,440
Michael, I I feel like I would put tea bags in all my pockets.

1593
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,320
It's early in the day English breakfast, late in the day, like chamomile.

1594
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,960
OK, I mean, I'm just saying you don't have to do this on the slide.

1595
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,840
This is an official Disney sponsored event

1596
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,160
where you could just put in Diet Pepsi if you want it.

1597
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,080
You could do the ride with Diet Pepsi.

1598
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,840
Well, I think the bubbles would be irritating. That's fair.

1599
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,200
Even on a two and a half, three minute orange juice.

1600
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,520
Well, that's definitely going to be irritating.

1601
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,280
Yeah. Cranberry juice.

1602
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,200
I also I like what he's thinking with his first answer, too,

1603
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,240
which is saving money on expensive tea,

1604
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,080
but not having to buy tea at the parts by bringing your own from home,

1605
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,280
letting the teacup fill up and then just sopping it up from the inside.

1606
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,240
You got some milk jugs like, OK, you can bring that home for later.

1607
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,560
Yeah, you can scoop it up like, yeah.

1608
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,400
All right, needle, I'm moving slow.

1609
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,960
I get now the teacup and then just out of a backpack,

1610
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,760
just start scooping the tea in the milk jugs. Yeah.

1611
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,200
And then you're just then you're just leaving.

1612
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,520
Then all you have to do is leave the park with just a just a conspicuous

1613
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,600
backpack that you just play it cool and pretend that you don't have

1614
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,760
eight full jugs in there. Yeah.

1615
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,320
Of dirty of of tea bags mixed with rainwater.

1616
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,040
You just get like, oh, I'm I'm a sponsorship from Lip Dead.

1617
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,600
The official tea of Disney.

1618
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,240
I've got the Lambie. I've got a laminate.

1619
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,720
It says Lipton on it.

1620
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,800
Little Lipton boy.

1621
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
By the way, that's a little Lipton boy I love.

1622
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,240
And I love saying I'm so sick of saying the big complicated word laminate.

1623
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,520
Why? There's never been a cute nickname for laminate.

1624
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,320
Lambie. Adorable.

1625
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,920
Lambie is cute. Yeah, you get a Lambie.

1626
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,600
You go backstage for the Wobbo, the Wobbo gang.

1627
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,280
I got a Lambie for the Wobbo show. Yeah. Yeah.

1628
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,400
I know I do like this, though, and then I like that two months later,

1629
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,000
maybe you have a friend over.

1630
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,680
You want to actually, you know what the let's keep hanging out.

1631
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,960
You want to come up. Are you thirsty?

1632
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,520
Yeah. You want to drive 90 minutes to Anaheim and help me with some.

1633
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,360
Well, I'm saying this is I think that you're like you're just in your apartment

1634
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,040
two months later and like you want to come up there.

1635
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,280
You want some tea or something? Yeah, I do.

1636
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,080
And then they're drinking like, oh, this is delicious.

1637
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,160
I really like this. Who makes this?

1638
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,040
Well, it's funny.

1639
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,760
I put a bunch of tea bags in my pocket to Disneyland

1640
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,400
and mixed it with rainwater two months ago.

1641
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,080
They called me the human teabag

1642
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,280
and there's nothing around.

1643
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,280
I don't mean that in any sort of suspicious sexual sense.

1644
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:14,040
That said, I do mean that in the in the sexual erotic sense as well.

1645
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,000
I'm just saying separately.

1646
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,920
Two different things apply. One name, two things.

1647
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,160
Do you was the did the skyway go right over the buckets?

1648
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:28,400
Could you have dumped scalding hot water from the skyway bucket

1649
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,960
into one of the teacups or is it a little bit to the side?

1650
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,040
I don't know the geography of that sugar, at least some sugar.

1651
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,040
Could it have been?

1652
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,720
Could you have run an empty skyway bucket with hot water,

1653
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,000
tipped it, dropped it into one of the teacups?

1654
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,320
I think you are in prime position. Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1655
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,200
And then the next one, you need a little bit of projection.

1656
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,920
It's not directly under you.

1657
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,160
And then one of the buckets would have a bunch of sugar

1658
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,360
and we could have honey in another one.

1659
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,840
You could sort of make your perfect tea.

1660
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,920
So you're terrorizing the teacup riders.

1661
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,720
Well, in my mind, it's sort of a fun, cute little thing.

1662
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,120
You don't have to have a rider in there necessarily,

1663
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,880
is that you could like make tea, make tea perfectly with two rides.

1664
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,120
It would be kind of a cute Rube Goldberg style.

1665
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,440
So this would have to be arranged with the with the park.

1666
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,000
I think so. Hours.

1667
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,720
But I guess you could do the gorilla version of it with people

1668
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,920
with somebody who says a bucket of scalding hot water on the skyway

1669
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,560
and dumps it into dumps it out of there.

1670
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,120
And then somebody throws handfuls.

1671
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,960
Well, that's why Obama's friend got escorted out of Disneyland.

1672
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,720
But Obama got escorted out

1673
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,280
because he was puffing on a sea.

1674
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,200
They were trying to teach up. They're trying to.

1675
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1676
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,520
Excuse me. No, no drinks on the skyway.

1677
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,600
Oh, no, it's fine. This is.

1678
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,480
Oh, you mean my my gigantic bucket of scalding hot water.

1679
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,840
This is this is a therapeutic.

1680
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,200
I'm going to put my feet in this on the feet are killing me.

1681
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,760
I go ahead, sir, to be able to walk for the bunion treatment.

1682
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,680
Oh, very well. OK, I didn't realize.

1683
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,960
What else about this?

1684
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,080
They also are in terms of early day aggro cups,

1685
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,880
which I think it's I think it was either late 55 or 56

1686
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,000
that they added like breaks, like something to like a max speed.

1687
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,200
But you got a good six months where you could just go

1688
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,640
as fast as you cared to go.

1689
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,520
I knew there was something left off the checklist.

1690
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,200
What do you mean of building building the teacups?

1691
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,680
Oh, I forgot to write the word breaks.

1692
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,960
I put everything else.

1693
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,480
There's very funny old archival footage of the Disneyland band

1694
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,840
riding the teacups, like one instrumentalist in each one.

1695
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,000
That's fun. Yeah, I like that.

1696
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,640
They also did when this thing opened, half teacups weren't decorated.

1697
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,320
They didn't have doors.

1698
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,440
You didn't do it. There wasn't the disk inside.

1699
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,080
So you just had to find another weighted.

1700
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,840
I guess. OK, so that stopped people from spinning just crazily.

1701
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,640
Right. You could just you just because how else would you do it?

1702
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,560
I've definitely written some off brand teacups without the doors. OK.

1703
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,960
It's just the whole and like the get Gravitron with the spinning.

1704
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,080
You're being pushed back. Yeah. Yeah.

1705
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,280
You guys ever been anywhere?

1706
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,800
Because I feel like I found this.

1707
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,920
I found this at Knott's.

1708
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,080
I think I found this at Elitch Gardens.

1709
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,720
Have you been anywhere is it's it's kiddie rides, especially

1710
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,280
where you have to be it's it's like the the person at the grocery store

1711
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,840
on like taking the the the cap off of the bottle, off of the liquor bottle,

1712
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,080
where like only the special little key does it.

1713
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,240
This is a thing on rides that likes the ride operator, who also starts it,

1714
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,960
does the announcement at the beginning, then has to go around to every

1715
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,840
single person in the ride with their special key in order to let them out.

1716
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,640
You ever been in on anything like that?

1717
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,560
I feel like I think I have.

1718
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,040
Is that just a simple clock key, though?

1719
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,640
A clock? Well, I don't know.

1720
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,000
Do you know what a clock is a clock?

1721
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,960
Like if you

1722
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,440
are winding a clock

1723
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:08,640
like an old fashioned like mantelpiece clock, I got I have one in my office.

1724
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,640
You have a clock key.

1725
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,520
I I've not bought in the clock key because the mantel.

1726
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,120
We had one on like the fireplace when I was growing up

1727
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,160
and you had to wind it like once a week or every couple of weeks or something.

1728
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm going to say that that like the swing ride doesn't operate with a clock key.

1729
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,760
I think, you know, there's different sizes.

1730
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,320
A clock key on Amazon.

1731
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,920
You can buy clock keys.

1732
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,840
Is a clock bigger than a normal key?

1733
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,600
Wouldn't it just be a regular key that just does a different thing?

1734
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,200
No, it's it's kind of like it's like a tubular.

1735
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:45,240
It reminds me that's that's all of a very specific type of.

1736
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,480
Yeah, not just a weird shaped key.

1737
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,680
OK, this this week.

1738
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,080
But the thing is, with like an old style clock, you have to wind.

1739
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,560
It will chime every hour on the hour and sometimes in the half hour.

1740
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,280
Do you have an old do you have an old clock?

1741
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:03,080
Or I did when someone was moving out and left a bunch of stuff,

1742
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,000
you know, where people leave like freebie stuff.

1743
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,280
OK, how big is this clock?

1744
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,040
Oh, OK. Not a full grandfather clock.

1745
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,640
No, no grandfather clocks, I think, operate differently, but you might have to.

1746
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,320
There are keys for grandfather clocks.

1747
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,240
There are key. OK.

1748
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,520
I recall my grandmother having a grandfather clock that had a key you would insert.

1749
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:29,000
Michael, stop eating the grandfather clock key like Ducky, the Disney duck.

1750
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,560
Oh, the official magic.

1751
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,960
I wasn't here for that episode.

1752
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,280
He eats a key.

1753
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,360
Yeah. So Ducky is the official magic key

1754
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,320
mascot for Disneyland's magic keys.

1755
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,680
And there's a story that Ducky lived in Disneyland and loved it for many, many years.

1756
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,640
And then a couple of years ago, he ate a key at the bottom of the river.

1757
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,400
And bottom of the moat, bottom of the moat.

1758
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,880
He ate it. And now he can go a lot of different places in Disneyland.

1759
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,160
That is what they said.

1760
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,480
The narrative really was complaining about story.

1761
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,000
This is a real shitty story.

1762
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,320
It doesn't make any sense.

1763
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:07,160
Ducky seems to exist primarily on Instagram reels and some website posts.

1764
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
But Ducky, he ate the key for no reason.

1765
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,440
We don't know why he ate the key.

1766
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,160
I know that you did this episode and I saw people saying, what are they talking about?

1767
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,920
I cannot find the source material.

1768
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,480
There are about three Instagram posts about Ducky.

1769
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,680
And I wanted to get on top of it before anybody else did.

1770
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,240
Well, that was also I think a good like Scott's gone.

1771
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,440
Ducky time.

1772
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,000
Ducky gets his due.

1773
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,520
Yes. Come on out, Ducky.

1774
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,440
Scott and his allergic ears.

1775
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,200
We can be little Ducky boys.

1776
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,400
That's the kind of thing you get on our Patreon.

1777
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,600
This is what you get.

1778
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,240
You get to hear about Ducky, the Disney Magic Key Duck.

1779
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:49,000
Ninety minutes about three videos of a duck that are impossible for you to find.

1780
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,840
We have another one where we I was like, hey, you're rubbing your hands.

1781
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,560
Yeah, it wasn't rubbing.

1782
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,520
Well, because I was Mike, we were driving home from here once, I think.

1783
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,840
And I was like, what about an episode of this?

1784
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,480
And he was like, yeah, I also was thinking about that.

1785
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,880
What was it? Maybe when Scott's.

1786
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,040
No, I'll tell you later.

1787
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,400
I'll remind you later.

1788
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,200
Oh, just come tell him. Yeah.

1789
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,000
Statue of Lou Wasserman.

1790
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,720
Statue of Lou Wasserman herself.

1791
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,680
You're not going to believe the statue of Lou Wasserman at Universal.

1792
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,160
He disappeared right after he moved to try me not to even checked in on Lou Wasserman.

1793
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,240
These motherfuckers be so crazy.

1794
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,880
As soon as their dad, the narc is gone.

1795
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,080
They start rubbing that, you know, we can do we can do the statue of Lou Wasserman.

1796
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,880
What is it? Where where was this?

1797
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,120
This was originally in Universal Studios, Florida,

1798
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,000
kind of as the San Francisco area transitions into New York.

1799
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,880
It was moved to open up the space for like crowds and parade floats.

1800
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:53,520
And now he has since gotten a pedestal in the Central Park area by the water.

1801
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,880
But at some point, he disappeared from there.

1802
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,760
And so I don't know if he's been put back.

1803
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,760
Lou Wasserman, of course, an early head of Universal

1804
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,160
Films, something like the development of the ride.

1805
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,000
Well, we haven't done the episode yet.

1806
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,840
Guess what? I just tricked you.

1807
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,440
You just said all of the pertinent information in the episode.

1808
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,520
There will be no episode.

1809
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,600
Back to the teacups.

1810
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,200
Have you seen the I found a website of a bunch of knockoff teacups that you could get?

1811
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,600
Yes. I have I have a couple.

1812
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,520
Well, these are the one I have doesn't have any fun names, but it's like

1813
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,640
it's like Sino rides dot com.

1814
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,040
And you can buy S.I.N.O.R.I.D.E.S.

1815
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,960
And you can get like this is for like renting them.

1816
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,200
Yeah. Oh, I see. Or sale.

1817
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,960
I mean, I have not seen Sino rides.

1818
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,640
Like you can get one that kind of looks like you've got like paint

1819
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,760
coming out of all the cups.

1820
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,840
It's like very carnival style.

1821
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,920
Jason, you're looking blue and red and it looks paint is.

1822
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah. Teacups, I think.

1823
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:00,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1824
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,640
I'm looking up for water and shit.

1825
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,640
You but you guys have your fun.

1826
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,200
And the real fun's over here.

1827
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,240
Yeah. And there's a fancy there's like you can get like a fancier

1828
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,280
like teacup ride with like, you know, this is more like

1829
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,800
very grand. That's what you would take the queen on.

1830
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,240
Right. Exactly. This is the queen's teacup ride.

1831
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,600
So, yeah, there's it is often like a flat ride.

1832
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,480
They call me usually, you know, it can be put on a flat move.

1833
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,480
Yeah. So there's a lot of different.

1834
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,000
Yeah. The knockoff versions.

1835
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,480
I guess, yeah, they want you to buy this.

1836
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,160
They don't want you to rent these.

1837
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,280
These look like they want you to permanently install them.

1838
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,240
Ones that I've found.

1839
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,240
There's one that used to be at Fiesta Village at Knott's Berry Farm.

1840
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,320
I don't think it's still there anymore.

1841
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:47,720
There's the one called Hat Dance in a sombrero, I think.

1842
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,480
I went on this one in Gilroy Gardens.

1843
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,360
This is one of the like more odd, fun, just simple rides ever.

1844
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,440
Garlic twirl where you're in a big garlic

1845
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,520
not bulb, bulb, bulb, I think.

1846
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,360
Garlic knot is like a thing.

1847
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,320
You get an Italian restaurant.

1848
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,720
That's a good idea, though, too.

1849
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,120
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1850
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,560
You're in the mechanism that's like getting all of the seasoning

1851
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,640
onto the garlic knots.

1852
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:18,000
Oh, yeah. Well, is are you saying this is at Gilroy Gardens?

1853
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,520
No, no, no. These are raw. This is raw garlic.

1854
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,640
Oh, OK. But a hypothetical garlic

1855
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,680
knot ride would be good. Yeah.

1856
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,720
In a Pizza Hut theme park.

1857
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,760
Oh, now I've got a lot of ideas immediately.

1858
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,320
Well, they should really do honestly.

1859
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,200
They should do the what is the yum brands?

1860
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,480
It should be it should be yum lands.

1861
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,320
Yeah, I would I would help them with portals that take you or like the

1862
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,960
if you're in, I don't know what like

1863
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,320
I don't know how you get from one or the other, but the realms of KFC.

1864
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,000
Well, OK. Well, hold on.

1865
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,720
I'll fight you to get my idea out first.

1866
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,800
Oh, you go ahead.

1867
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,440
Then you both say the same thing at the same time,

1868
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,320
even though it's sentences long.

1869
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,320
Well, if they're different lands, I think they should take inspiration

1870
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,760
from the old boat ride that was at the Luxor Hotel and Casino

1871
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,960
that would take was practical, but also a boat ride.

1872
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,200
It took you a room. Yeah.

1873
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,920
It took you around the casino floor.

1874
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,040
So if you rode a river Pepsi around the outside of the park

1875
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,120
and you could get off at each land, similar to the Disneyland Railroad,

1876
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
at every young brand.

1877
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,600
Yeah. Yeah. Go to the Colonel's Kingdom.

1878
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,480
That's good.

1879
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,680
I was going to say you get into you can either come into Pizza Hut land

1880
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:37,760
or exit Pizza Hut land through a big stuffed crust tunnel.

1881
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,840
Oh, that's great.

1882
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,680
Which is, yeah, like they're hollowed out crust with a little cheese on the walls.

1883
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,080
Yes. Yeah. Well, and I guess one big tipped over bucket, obviously,

1884
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,640
for Colonel's Kingdom. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

1885
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,000
Who would you want to see reflected in Pizza Hut?

1886
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,840
Are there other characters from pizza?

1887
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
And we aren't even I forgot Taco Bell.

1888
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,280
I mean, yeah, obviously, that's all right.

1889
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,240
That's a whole thing.

1890
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,400
Scott, do not ruin this for us.

1891
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:05,520
Pizza Hut, do not ruin this with big New Yorker mishmash stuff.

1892
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,080
What are you talking about?

1893
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,520
Oh, I thought you were getting to Donald Trump being the spokesman

1894
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,800
for Pizza Hut, the big New Yorker.

1895
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,520
I was not.

1896
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,680
No, I can't say that was on the front of my mind.

1897
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,320
But what do you?

1898
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,160
Well, I guess because you say because he asked where,

1899
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,120
like if there were any characters in the first character

1900
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,200
you thought it was Donald Trump.

1901
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,880
Yeah, because I couldn't remember it like a Burger King's Kids Club.

1902
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,480
Well, right. Pizza Hut is low on is like big famous mascot characters.

1903
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,040
But that is so funny that the one mascot you think of when Pizza Hut comes up

1904
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,600
as the president, the Book It logo.

1905
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,880
Well, what about the Ringo Starr Pizza commercial with the monkeys?

1906
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,960
That's a famous. Oh, I'm sorry.

1907
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,240
Mine was too obscure.

1908
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,880
Yeah, I think we think everyone.

1909
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,760
I do remember it.

1910
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,200
But I didn't say that's like as popular as the Noid was from Domino's.

1911
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,440
I'm just saying.

1912
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,360
Well, OK, so that would be that would be a facet of Pizza Hut.

1913
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:05,800
Land is the walk around Donald Trump with a sign somebody else.

1914
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,360
Somebody's walking next to him with a sign with an arrow

1915
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,960
that's an apology sign that says this is Trump due to his appearance

1916
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,480
in a Pizza Hut commercial.

1917
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,000
This does not reference his presidency. Right. Right.

1918
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,040
Don't be mad.

1919
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,120
It's a good. Yeah, that'll fix it.

1920
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,360
I mean, it could be the Chinese Donald Trump.

1921
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,640
What? The guy.

1922
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,240
There's a guy in China.

1923
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,320
What's happened in the last five minutes?

1924
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,640
There's a guy in China who does a very good Donald Trump.

1925
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,640
It's very funny.

1926
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,240
How does that get around the issue? He walks.

1927
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,160
He can be OK.

1928
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,560
He can be the character.

1929
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,520
Pizza Hut ad. We will do a Chinese.

1930
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,240
We will do the Chinese Donald Trump.

1931
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,480
No further explanation.

1932
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,320
Shouldn't do any teach shows people the size.

1933
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,160
And he works at the American Pizza Hut Park,

1934
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,720
but no one's mad at him because he's not.

1935
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,000
What is the type of online where you find the things that we've never heard of?

1936
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,080
Well, this is pretty popular.

1937
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,960
This is a tick tock.

1938
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,840
Cut to comments.

1939
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,040
Jason is right.

1940
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,200
He knows the thing.

1941
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,560
And I guess God are dumb.

1942
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,400
They don't know the thing.

1943
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,480
And also all the sex things he mentions, Mike and Scott should know, too.

1944
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,320
All right. We should.

1945
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,800
If we commit to how we're going to,

1946
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,400
although I think I think yum yum lands is worth flushing.

1947
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,200
That's a whole nother further in the future.

1948
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,040
But if we're going to stick to the construct that we have done for Class of 55,

1949
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,320
where we have brought back our old mechanism of, you know, keep it as is,

1950
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,480
plus it up, burn it down for the insurance money.

1951
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,960
How do we feel after 70 years of the teacups?

1952
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,960
Yeah, I mean, I really was thinking about this of like, what is any

1953
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,680
what is a way to plus it up?

1954
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,240
It's hard to improve on perfection.

1955
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:47,080
I guess maybe you could make the mechanism a little easier to turn it somehow.

1956
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:50,880
Yeah. Like the way you bring that back a little bit like the way you turn it now.

1957
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,240
Yes, there's a lot of resistance and it does feel like you work

1958
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,120
have to work pretty hard to turn it.

1959
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,080
Is there a way to make you turn it?

1960
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:01,360
But that doesn't it's not like you actually are using like one to one energy

1961
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,640
to turn it with resistance.

1962
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,120
Is there a way to just kind of like turn it and make it feel like you're turning it?

1963
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:10,480
But there's some sort of motor underneath that's actually doing the turning

1964
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:15,040
that doesn't make it as hard on your wrists and your arms.

1965
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,240
Do you know what I'm saying?

1966
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,360
Like, I guess, like, like, don't like right now you are wanting in the work to turn.

1967
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,920
Yes, I guess it would be fake in some ways.

1968
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,800
I'm not saying I want I'm thinking about this, like, because, yeah,

1969
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,040
you if you really want to go fast, it feels like you get off with sore arms.

1970
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,520
Hi. Maybe that's not good.

1971
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,160
I'm just saying that you could change it to make it was probably an easier mechanism.

1972
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,000
But I think we overrate how sore you get on these.

1973
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,640
OK, it's not so bad news.

1974
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,680
And then we did the canoes.

1975
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,240
And I'm like, what has everybody been complaining about?

1976
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,880
This is not so the canoes.

1977
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,600
I got Mr. Strong, man.

1978
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,440
I just think it's not a little more of a workout with the canoes and the

1979
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,120
key cups. Yeah, certainly. Yeah.

1980
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,160
But I do feel I do feel it on whipslingers.

1981
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,560
Another complaint that I do feel very exhausted.

1982
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,120
But I guess that's because that's nobody's guiding me.

1983
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,520
No mechanism is I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

1984
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,720
I just throw my arms around and I guess I do it in a way that hurts.

1985
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:11,640
When Kermit's upset, that's what you do on Spider-Man or excited.

1986
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,240
Often excited.

1987
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:16,880
Well, nothing destroys my arms like Toy Story.

1988
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:23,040
By the end of Toy Story, my wrists, my wrists and my arm feel feel crazy.

1989
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,440
Yeah. I'm going so fast.

1990
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,720
I'm going so hard on that.

1991
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,480
I want to win so badly that I'm going I'm going sicko mode.

1992
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,680
That's what I'm doing, which I'm going to guess gets you the fourth one up.

1993
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,120
Yeah, I'm not even the only one that is possible to get.

1994
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,760
I know it's if you work incredibly hard once in a while,

1995
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,680
I will get a couple of the secret things that open up the up the boards.

1996
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,600
Yes, those are fun.

1997
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,440
And if you get those and I can do pretty well, then maybe I can get up the third tier.

1998
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,800
Yeah. God, that's so difficult. Yeah.

1999
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,000
So other than that, it's like the ride vehicles are perfect.

2000
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,080
The setting is pretty perfect.

2001
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:04,720
The music, which is kind of like it's very, very fun

2002
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,720
and is very Alice in Wonderland appropriate.

2003
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,200
It's the unbirthday song.

2004
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:13,920
I suppose once in a while they could give me a different song.

2005
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,440
Now, it doesn't have to be a popular rock and roll.

2006
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,920
So it doesn't have to be Pink's Raise a Glass.

2007
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,720
It could be a different Disney song, perhaps.

2008
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,760
But from Pink's song, any pink song, any pink song.

2009
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,240
Get this party started, whatever it was called.

2010
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,840
I know four or five pink songs.

2011
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:35,440
You want an after hours event that's all pink songs

2012
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,280
and the limiters on the teacups are removed.

2013
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:43,520
Yeah, well, I want a reckless night at Disneyland or something

2014
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,160
where you pay two hundred dollars and you sign a waiver.

2015
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,680
And then but I don't want pink force.

2016
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,040
If it's reckless night, I don't want I want something crazy being played.

2017
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,480
You want to purge.

2018
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,520
I want Slayer being played while I'm on the teacups or something.

2019
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,200
That's that's a different vibe.

2020
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:58,880
You know what? It's funny.

2021
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,240
You mentioned this because in pre thinking about what a plus it up might be

2022
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,080
and also in looking up a weird off model,

2023
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,600
not off model, but just other places that have done teacup type attractions.

2024
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,280
Six Flags Great America is the one in Chicago.

2025
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:18,200
Yes. They have a ride that during the day is called Chubasco

2026
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,200
and it's a pretty standard teacup.

2027
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,280
I would say with some notably good cups and a big it's what I'm looking at.

2028
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,240
It's too dark to see what's in the middle.

2029
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:29,120
But just good, like, you know, glassware sculpture in the middle.

2030
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,560
But at night or at least at Fright Fest,

2031
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:36,480
they have remade it and do something called Terror Twister.

2032
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,760
And let me give you guys a vibe for the listener.

2033
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,840
Just picture very dark lighting strobe lights and then this kind of music.

2034
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,280
Oh, that's it's like purple lighting.

2035
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,120
What is that song here?

2036
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,640
I don't know what the song is off hand.

2037
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,800
It is called My Invisible Friend.

2038
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,560
They also seem to play something called Wolves of Darkness.

2039
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,280
OK, that's a scary title if I ever heard one.

2040
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,080
Yeah, but I could see that did just open up with Six Flags can do it.

2041
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:11,800
Doing like a scary, an after dark version of the teacups

2042
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,840
where you feel as though you are trapped in some kind of horrible saw mechanism.

2043
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:22,200
Yeah. And almost made to spin like if someone's yelling at you faster, faster.

2044
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,200
Yeah, make it.

2045
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,640
I think it's it very easily, I think, lends to terrifying experience.

2046
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,080
Yeah, I think so, too.

2047
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:33,920
I think music, especially the music and a little lighting change could really do it.

2048
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,160
I mean, a full fantasy land Halloween villains overlay.

2049
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,880
Yeah. Some kind feels like a kind of simple idea that would be very popular.

2050
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,080
A lot of villain songs.

2051
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,560
That's true. Yeah. Lines or speeches or stuff.

2052
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,400
Is there one that sticks out to you that you'd want to hear on the teacups?

2053
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,880
Oh, probably something from Wish.

2054
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,520
Oh, OK. Is there a villain in Wish?

2055
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,000
There is a villain in Wish.

2056
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,840
I forget who the villain is.

2057
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:03,880
Because I want to hear what's the opposite of a star, the moon, the moon.

2058
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,760
Oh, my God. Big, scary moon wants to eat the star.

2059
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,520
Yeah, that's perfect.

2060
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,400
I'm glad I haven't seen Wish too scared.

2061
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,520
What about Hellfire on the teacups?

2062
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,680
Oh, there we go.

2063
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,320
Oh, and then it kind of becomes what is it within?

2064
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:27,360
Like then you're kind of like you are just inside the tumultuous feelings of

2065
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,080
your inside lust.

2066
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:32,000
What's his character? What's the Frodo Frodo Frollo?

2067
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,360
I don't think it's Frodo Frodo.

2068
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,040
I think it's Hoosier.

2069
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,880
Frollo is close, Claude Frollo.

2070
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,280
Oh, so all right.

2071
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,040
So the overlay is Claude Frollo's erotic nightmares.

2072
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,160
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

2073
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,200
And then you can you light it with fire colors, right?

2074
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,080
Just put some orange and red and then like, you know,

2075
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,320
sexy silhouettes of Esmeralda.

2076
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,760
Yeah. On the side of the of the Matterhorn.

2077
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,560
And there's maybe, you know, maybe there's something phallic about that.

2078
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,480
That's like, you know, the the it's not explicitly said,

2079
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:19,560
but if you want to imagine that the Matterhorn is Claude Frollo's misshapen dick.

2080
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
I mean, I do want to imagine that.

2081
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,240
You stupid fool.

2082
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,560
Like the Matterhorn is just I was going to say it's him.

2083
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,400
It's a giant version of him where it's his big mouth when it's goofy hat.

2084
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,440
Hellfire.

2085
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,320
You know, we've never we've recently, you know, we've talked about,

2086
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,520
like feeling like we want rides with different emotions,

2087
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:41,920
not just thrills and chills.

2088
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:46,200
And we were talking about wanting to feel melancholy, sadness, sort of tranquility.

2089
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,920
But we really don't have a good lust ride.

2090
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,960
You don't have a ride that really simulates lust.

2091
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,440
Well, we have nights and white satin, but it's gone.

2092
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,120
All right. But that wasn't was that lust.

2093
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,360
Did you feel lust? That was more of a no.

2094
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:01,160
Were you when you were thinking like some candles turned the lights down?

2095
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:05,160
Oh, you think that we just discovered Jason's biggest make out.

2096
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,960
Oh, yeah. Wow.

2097
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,320
That's what not a lot happening at those dorm rooms.

2098
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:14,200
One of the new always blow it was blurring and he's playing nights

2099
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,040
and white satin again, and I heard a door slam.

2100
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,920
That's one of the more newer songs you've been listening to, though.

2101
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,720
More recent pre Jane before before all the twenty

2102
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,320
twenty's music and he's parking back up.

2103
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:33,240
I hear bugy, woogie, woogie, woogie, woogie, woogie, woogie, woogie, boy.

2104
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,200
It's just I'm just too excited by my songs.

2105
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,000
Anyway, yeah.

2106
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,240
No, I think that's it.

2107
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,440
I think it was the name of it again.

2108
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,160
Just for my

2109
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:50,400
Claude Claude Frollo, they are the erotic nightmares of Claude

2110
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,000
Claude Frollo.

2111
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,040
We need a Frollo ride in a park, an American park.

2112
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,720
And it just ends with a blood curdling scream.

2113
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,400
And you're left to determine, is that him like

2114
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,360
like stabbing himself in the heart?

2115
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,280
Yeah. Or ejaculating.

2116
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,120
It is up to choose your own adventure.

2117
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,160
Yeah. Yeah. Your interpretation.

2118
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,640
I did a search on Twitter.

2119
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:19,160
It seems like the Lou Asterman statue came back at the beginning of the year.

2120
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,360
But as of late March, it's gone again.

2121
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,400
I was correct.

2122
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,560
People keep stealing it.

2123
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,680
Is there a is there a whole thing?

2124
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,040
Is there a high school graduating class

2125
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,280
that Dr.

2126
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,000
Philips high school right behind Universal is playing some?

2127
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,720
Oh, thank you. It's like a whole senior prank.

2128
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,360
Yeah. Seniors rule every year in Orlando.

2129
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,280
There's a senior prank to steal the on rival school.

2130
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:45,000
Universal Studios. Right. Yeah.

2131
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,280
I mean, oh, man, if you're a high school senior,

2132
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,960
oh, what I wouldn't give to get my hands on Lou Watson. Yeah.

2133
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,040
Seniors rule Lou Wasserman drools.

2134
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,000
Well, that's true. All right.

2135
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,200
Unless there's closing thoughts on the way out the door.

2136
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,200
I think you survive.

2137
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,800
I guess the ride.

2138
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,560
Well, I was just going to say capacity wise,

2139
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,400
I feel like I couldn't see a good number because I think per ride,

2140
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,480
it said 72, which be four people per teacup.

2141
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,640
That's too many.

2142
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,440
All right. I don't think that's too much on that note.

2143
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,920
You survive. I guess the right.

2144
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,000
Maybe it's too. What is it?

2145
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,520
How do you feel about that?

2146
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,480
I think well, and then I saw 1,400 people per hour.

2147
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:30,120
And I'm like, that's I feel like if everything's running exactly

2148
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,840
like the ride is exactly as long, it takes everyone

2149
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,240
like 90 seconds to get in and out.

2150
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,560
You know, hell fire.

2151
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:43,120
This false capacity makes me burn.

What else do you want to hear as far as class of 55?

2158
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,920
Is there weird bullshit that didn't make it very far past 55?

2159

Let us know.

2160
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:12,400
I if you want your thoughts on Yum land as well.

2161
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,800
Brands land. Yeah.

2162
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,520
Oh, that's well, that's the whole.

2163
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,200
This would be the most easily greenlit theme park on earth.

2164
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,200
I'm surprised that there hasn't been something like it. Mm hmm.

2165
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,680
Yeah, it's so exciting.

2166
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,160
The thing is, but it'll start with a bunch of ride ideas

2167
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:28,080
and then it'll end up just a bunch of rooms where you look at facts

2168
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,560
about the company and it's, you know, and and to bring it all back,

2169
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,560
our company's story, our company's value and our company's story.

2170
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,200
Yeah. So starts a big chicken bucket and then it just becomes.

2171
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:44,640
Here's how KFC enables people to live their chicken stories all across the world.

2172
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,760
Bronze statue in every land.

2173
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:50,680
Colonel Sanders and one, the late yoke hero talk about dog

2174
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:55,000
and the other we don't we don't think enough about how he's sorry.

2175
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,200
Glenn Bell, you lost out.

2176
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,160
Everyone's forgotten about you.

2177
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,000
All right, P.

2178
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Pour out a hot cup of tea for Glenn Bell.

2179
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,440
Oh, Mike's favorite talk about water is called.
