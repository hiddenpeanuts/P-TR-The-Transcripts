00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Podcasts Arise doing a live show in Los Angeles.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Yay, June 7th at Dynasty Typewriter.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,120
It's gonna be fun, we're doing a very special topic

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,360
and we have very special guests planned.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,800
No hints right now, just mystery.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,840
Now if you want tickets, go to dynastytypewriter.com

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,480
or there's a link right to it on our Twitter.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,240
It's the pin tweet at the top of our Twitter.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,320
You can get it there,

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,220
you can probably get a link somewhere else,

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,300
but those are the two places

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,060
I'm letting you know about right now.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,900
June 7th, Los Angeles Dynasty Typewriter Podcasts Arise live.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,740
Forever.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,180
Dog.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,620
Warning, the following podcast contains wall crawling,

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,260
web slinging, silk secretions, radioactive body fluids,

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,580
and an eight-eyed look at Universal Orlando's

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,700
The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,140
Excelsior, it's podcast, The Ride.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,140
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a show hosted by three men

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,780
who describe recording two episodes back to back

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,380
as the most dangerous night of our lives and yours.

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,740
I'm Jason Chariton, as always my scout character.

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,580
That's the famous catchphrase.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,580
It is to me and we'll get into that.

27
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,700
Mike Carlson here as always.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,180
I had no idea where you were going with that.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,260
I was like, I guess we get tired.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,260
I think you were gonna make fun of us for being like tired,

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,860
like tired of podcasting after two because it can get.

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,620
Well, it's like as harrowing as we get.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,380
We don't face challenges as much as Spider-Man

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,300
today's topic.

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,860
No.

36
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,860
But I don't know, most dangerous night of our lives

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,340
in a way potentially does apply to what I wanted

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,140
to talk about and we will get to Spider-Man obviously.

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,140
We'll, you know, I'll veer back to that track,

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,940
but there's something important that I need to address,

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,780
which is that I have recently come across

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,780
a rather interesting video of one of you, my co-hosts.

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,780
Oh no.

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,820
I'm not sure if you can guess.

45
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,660
No, you found it?

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
But I have a feeling.

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,340
Oh man.

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,540
You know the man, sir.

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,380
Oh, it exists.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,380
It certainly does.

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,220
Wow.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,700
You knew it was coming.

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
That was quick.

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,380
I guess.

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,220
Not too bad, not too bad, right?

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,620
It is the most dangerous night of your life.

57
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,460
For you it's easy.

58
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,460
You're like back at the station, like Jameson.

59
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,180
Yeah, not worrying about like getting sepsis

60
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,140
or Listeria or whatever diseases.

61
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,300
Oh wow.

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,220
Yeah, it's happening, it happened.

63
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,340
Let me explain.

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,220
If you didn't hear it back on our Expedition Everest episode,

65
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,580
we talked about, I forget even why it came up to begin with,

66
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,420
but there was a giant epilogue devoted to Mike's appearance

67
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
on the dearly departed Spike TV show, Mansers.

68
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,260
Right, yes.

69
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,420
Which if you aren't previously aware,

70
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,540
I mean first of all, it's a place where dudes

71
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,740
can find out the answers to, you know,

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,300
like can tits fart and that kind of thing.

73
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,500
The answers that probing bros wanna know.

74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,780
Their language, not ours.

75
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,740
And then it would be in the void of like,

76
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,060
what do you think, can tits fart?

77
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,300
Like that would be the way it would be presented.

78
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,780
I think that's how we got into it,

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,740
was talking about Travel Channel voice,

80
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,020
which morphed into Spike TV voice.

81
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,860
You're correct.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,340
That is related, and then Mike,

83
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,940
you revealed a little too much information.

84
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,020
I even went back to check,

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,540
and you like almost didn't give the nuggets of what it was.

86
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,340
I was gonna tease it, I was gonna tease it for like later,

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,220
but then I said a little bit more about it

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,060
at the end of the show,

89
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,620
and then it was just like, all right, here we go.

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,140
Yeah, yeah, we coasted out of here.

91
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,260
I hope it was helpful.

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,660
I feel like you aired this,

93
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,740
then you can go back to that episode

94
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,140
to hear the allure of details of Mike's horrible shoot.

95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,380
It's at the end, yeah.

96
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,220
Yeah, we basically tacked on a mini episode.

97
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,420
That we didn't expect.

98
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,500
Yeah.

99
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,100
Which honestly made me feel more bad

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,500
about the whole endeavor than anything else,

101
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,260
because this was your first shoot for television,

102
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,820
quote unquote, and yet it was more unprofessional

103
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,940
than this very podcast.

104
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,660
Just a mess with no makeup and hair,

105
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,740
and you were just pointed at

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,380
and forced to make out with a stranger

107
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,420
who was upset to have to do it.

108
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,140
Yeah, she was mad about doing it,

109
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,380
and then she stormed off.

110
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,260
Then there was a negotiation happened without me,

111
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,820
and then some sort of resolution happened again without me,

112
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
and then I was not filled in on what the resolution would be,

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,500
and then I was just told, okay, action.

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
With no time to adjust back into,

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,820
oh, now I get to make out with someone?

116
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,660
What are we doing?

117
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,900
I didn't know, and you can probably see, I don't know,

118
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,220
but you probably can't, because the thing is edited so well.

119
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,980
Well, it's aggressively edited.

120
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,220
That's certainly true.

121
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
I think you convey false pleasure very well,

122
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,100
and then so much of it is discomfort

123
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,460
that you were probably able to use

124
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,460
what you were actually feeling.

125
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,060
If I could just say really quickly

126
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,220
how I came across this clip,

127
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,700
because I think I noted in the episode

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,820
that I had tried to find it randomly before

129
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,220
without really any clues,

130
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,540
just because you can buy them piecemeal on Amazon Prime.

131
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,740
You do have to buy them, though.

132
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,100
It is $2 a pop.

133
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,100
So with every false attempt, I'm losing $2.

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,540
But I'd forgotten about this entirely

135
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,060
until bug main Extended Universe character,

136
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,420
Franklin Lombardo, tweeted a picture of the DVD

137
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,420
of Best of Mansers Season One, which I got.

138
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,540
Right, I saw this happening on Twitter, too.

139
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,460
I think I tweeted, hey, or something.

140
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
You just tweeted, hey.

141
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,660
Scott is holding the cursed object.

142
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,540
The Best of Mansers Season One,

143
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
it has is the death touch for real?

144
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,980
It has how teeny can a bikini get

145
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,060
before it's legally considered nudity?

146
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,660
And then just how can you get drunk faster?

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,100
That's nice and basic.

148
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,460
So popped in the DVD, and sure enough,

149
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,940
it was not on the DVD.

150
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
More money wasted.

151
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,420
The joke's on me.

152
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,220
How much money are you in at this point in the story?

153
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,100
I think I've spent, I think in the search for this,

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,820
I've spent about 20 bucks.

155
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,380
It's not crazy, but that's a meal or two, potentially.

156
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
And I can't tell you how dramatic it was

157
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,860
to be watching Mansers Best of Season One with Aaron,

158
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,220
and around every, it's a countdown from 25 to one,

159
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,660
and the closer we get to one, we lose our chance.

160
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,340
Like, oh, there's only two left,

161
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,940
and then there'll be a bonus Manser,

162
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,580
and you'll go, maybe it's the bonus.

163
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,980
But none of them were, but I was like,

164
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,460
there's gotta be a way, and there was a way.

165
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I searched Twitter for the words Manser's British hand job,

166
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,060
and I went as far back as that could be found,

167
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,500
and I found two tweets, really,

168
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,060
we're going back to the dawn of Twitter.

169
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,580
This is early days of Twitter.

170
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,060
It's 2008, or seven.

171
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,820
A little later, this episode aired specifically

172
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,940
on January 20th, 2010.

173
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,780
It did?

174
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,620
Yep, yep, and I was able to cross-check that

175
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,780
with the air dates on Amazon Prime, and bang,

176
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,980
before I knew it, I had your episode.

177
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,860
It's like 306, 307, I forget which one exactly.

178
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,460
But, yeah, this, you know, really,

179
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,380
I wanna put the choice in your hands.

180
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,660
With great power comes great responsibility, Mike.

181
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,500
Whatever, I could play it if you wanna relive this now,

182
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,380
if you wanna shove it back in a drawer,

183
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,020
but I do have it available for you, if you wish to see it.

184
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,540
Well, the audience, look, if it's content,

185
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,460
and if it's going to draw the audience in,

186
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,340
we need the content to be shared, so.

187
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,180
That was my justification.

188
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,060
I don't feel great about this.

189
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,260
I'm no prankster, I'm not trying to embarrass you,

190
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,220
and I don't think it is embarrassing, by the way.

191
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,580
I think it is an acting job, and it's a.

192
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,540
I mean, it is embarrassing, let's be honest.

193
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,700
I don't know, though, I don't know.

194
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,380
I should weigh in here and say,

195
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,980
today's topic is maybe my favorite ride.

196
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,860
And we're.

197
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,980
We got a specially long line.

198
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,900
And especially there's a dark, yeah,

199
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
this is actually a good throwback

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,780
to the first opening few years,

201
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,020
when this was the most popular ride on Universal Property.

202
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,820
It's a frustrating wait.

203
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,940
You didn't get Universal Express.

204
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,380
This is like you without Universal Express.

205
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,700
No, it took a little while, and yeah, but that said,

206
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,500
this queue, much less satisfying.

207
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,340
All right.

208
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, the faster we get it done with,

209
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,060
the faster we can get to Spider-Man.

210
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,900
Back into it, because.

211
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,540
No, this is important to weigh in with.

212
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,100
I don't want to, this should not be a side track episode,

213
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,940
however.

214
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,420
It should not be, but let's draw it out a little longer,

215
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,980
because I have the email for my call time,

216
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,700
and I do see that it was 2009, which is crazy,

217
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,260
because that's how long I've been in Los Angeles,

218
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,460
and I'm losing my mind.

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,820
It was Tuesday, September 8th is when we shot it.

220
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,300
Your call time for Tuesday is 7 a.m. at our bar,

221
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,940
which is located blah, blah, blah.

222
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,340
Your on-site contact is Katie,

223
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,300
I won't give her phone number.

224
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,460
For wardrobe, please bring a variety of options

225
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,580
that you would wear to a club or a bar.

226
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,340
A couple of pairs of jeans, T-shirts,

227
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,780
button-downs, polos, et cetera.

228
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,700
So, you know, a country bear jamboree shirt,

229
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,140
a Oliver and Company ringer tee, you know.

230
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,980
Also, you may want to bring a book or a magazine to read,

231
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,620
because you may have some downtime.

232
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,620
You mean like jugs weekly, like something a man would read?

233
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
So yeah, so I remember now, I got there,

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,940
and I did not have any downtime.

235
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,340
I mean, I may have it later, but I was literally sat down,

236
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,100
like, all right, you over here.

237
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,380
I was wearing a green shirt,

238
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,540
they didn't look at any of my wardrobe.

239
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,540
I just stood up and they went, all right, here we go.

240
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,980
So that, wow, that is crazy.

241
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,700
So that is, so 2009, so that's,

242
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,780
we're coming up almost on the 10th anniversary.

243
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,220
10th anniversary of your first screen appearance.

244
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,140
Yeah, I think that's right.

245
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,020
Maybe there was something before.

246
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,940
Let's, I mean, should we just play the audio?

247
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,260
I think the main way for you, the listener,

248
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,540
to watch this will be on Twitter,

249
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,540
because the audio's not great and it's not terribly fun.

250
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,980
I even edited it down, I did the luxury,

251
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,340
and I edited it in such a way that you will,

252
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,220
I moved up the appearance of someone else we know

253
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,100
in this very segment.

254
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,460
So you ready?

255
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,300
And the audio's not great, so I'll just play a quick second,

256
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
but just for you to transport back to it.

257
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,780
I mean, yeah, play as much as you want.

258
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,540
I haven't seen it in a few years.

259
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,140
I think, can everybody see, okay, we'll find out,

260
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,940
but you'll be delighted by the extra cameo.

261
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,980
I forget who the extra cameo is even.

262
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,020
That's me and British Babe at the bar,

263
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,820
totally ready to play Yashydoodle with your big face.

264
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,420
But wait, dude, something here stinks.

265
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,140
Why should you never get a hand job from a British chick?

266
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,660
At this point, let me just pause it and describe it,

267
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,140
which is that a woman in a Union Jack dress

268
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,260
has spotted you without any dialogue, obviously,

269
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,300
because that caught sex through it,

270
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,340
pushed you against the wall of a bar,

271
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,020
and just started to just whip straight to it,

272
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,020
although making out kind of just on your neck.

273
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,500
You didn't really have to kiss in this.

274
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,700
That's the story, so to fill in a little more

275
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,860
if you didn't go back and listen to the Expedition Everest,

276
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,820
what the situation was was that she didn't wanna make out,

277
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,980
she stormed off the set, the director got pissed,

278
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,140
they went ahead and had a negotiation, came back,

279
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,100
and they didn't tell me what the deal was,

280
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,380
and then they just said action,

281
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,140
and I was so scared and weirded out and confused,

282
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,380
and then she just sort of like gently put her head

283
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
on the other side of my neck to, I guess,

284
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,820
make it look like she was kissing my neck,

285
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,220
which she was not, she was barely even touching me.

286
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,900
It wouldn't fool anybody.

287
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,100
It's clearly someone kissing a neck.

288
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,580
Right, and I think I even in the first take

289
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,340
wanted to be like, does this look okay?

290
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,860
This doesn't look good, right?

291
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,660
But obviously- You would be the first person

292
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
to ask any question on the set of Mansers.

293
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,500
Right.

294
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,660
I think this was a shoot, shoot, shoot scenario.

295
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,700
Yeah, and I think they were like,

296
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,820
well, we'll just speed it up,

297
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,780
and there'll be an aggressive man narrating it,

298
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,580
and it won't matter, which is obviously what happened.

299
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Late Ots reality TV production was just absolutely dog shit.

300
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,860
As someone who worked a pH of like eight shows,

301
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,820
like terrible, especially right after the writer's strike.

302
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,220
They were just grinding stuff out to fill time.

303
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,100
And it's obviously gotten way better

304
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,460
in the era of non-union web production.

305
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

306
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,300
Now we live in a paradise.

307
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,540
Everything's great.

308
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,260
Okay, so Mike's up against a wall,

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,340
and things were pleasurable,

310
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,620
but now they have turned very sour.

311
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,260
As your buyer, you gotta get out of there.

312
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm a whine, oh you a whine.

313
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,100
Did you see the camera?

314
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
Yeah, I did.

315
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,780
Yes, I did see him.

316
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,900
Right off the show, and past guest of the show,

317
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,580
Jordan Morris, in the very same segment as you.

318
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,500
I forgot all about that.

319
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Seemingly in a, he's just making kind of a like,

320
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,460
hmm face that could apply probably to any Manser.

321
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,260
He's a very broad, confused man.

322
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,340
A performer who I know is capable

323
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,020
of more subtlety than that.

324
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
But I think on Mansers,

325
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,180
you yourself included, everybody had to act

326
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,700
as if they had like, got hit in the head

327
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
with a brick a couple times.

328
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,380
Yeah, I had to play it so big,

329
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,980
it was like I was acting at the Staples Center

330
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,140
for the back row.

331
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,740
You have to have your expression read

332
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,860
for the very cheap nosebleed seats at an arena.

333
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,060
Though the camera is four inches away from your face.

334
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,900
Yes, yes.

335
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
And I honestly, I remember seeing it and going,

336
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,180
oh man, I played that too big.

337
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,660
I remember thinking that initially.

338
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,180
At the bed at the same time,

339
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,740
it's what they required.

340
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,060
Yeah.

341
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,820
And what other way can you play a man

342
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,620
who has realized there's fecal matter on his penis

343
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,700
and thus height, like at the very end,

344
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,380
and I won't play it, they'll save this for YouTube,

345
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,140
but at the very end, you speed out of the room

346
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,660
in a Wile E. Coyote manner,

347
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,140
leaving a trail of smoke behind you.

348
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,980
Yes.

349
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,340
And she waves goodbye and she still has toilet paper

350
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,260
dangling off of her fingers.

351
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,940
That is how much this woman has just been to the bathroom.

352
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,460
She tried to clean herself.

353
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,780
Which I think is not really,

354
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,500
it really goes against what the lesson was,

355
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,980
is that they just didn't wash their hands enough.

356
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,020
So toilet, well, actually now that I think about it,

357
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,060
no, I guess it's right.

358
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,460
So the idea is she didn't wash her hands.

359
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,540
She just went in and got the toilet paper

360
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,820
stuck all over her hand and then didn't wash her hand.

361
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,740
So now that I think about it, that's actually.

362
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,020
Oh, it is consistent.

363
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
It is consistent.

364
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,180
It's horrifying.

365
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,380
I think I would have noticed that too,

366
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,820
if she just had toilet paper stuck to her hand.

367
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,140
When you say you edited that,

368
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,620
did you add any extra sound effects

369
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,860
or that is the direct,

370
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,620
that is the normal cut level of sound effects?

371
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,900
That's as it came.

372
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
And though that probably sounded very tinny

373
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,980
as being filmed off of a computer monitor

374
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,420
and then shown through an iPad

375
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,900
and then played on a podcast,

376
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,380
the sound was as unpleasant raw as when I heard it

377
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,820
as you the listener just heard it.

378
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,660
But also here, let me play one more thing.

379
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,660
And Mike is actually not part of this segment.

380
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,940
The reveal of why you shouldn't make out

381
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,460
with a British chick, but this is like.

382
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Hand job.

383
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,020
Oh yeah, why do I keep self-censoring?

384
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,620
Yeah, come on Scott, ass eating is a 2019 thing,

385
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,220
not a 2009 thing, all right?

386
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,740
You don't want a British chick touching your love stick

387
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
because British babes have poo pans.

388
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,140
Poo pans.

389
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,900
And they made like a graphic cover of her hand

390
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,580
that looked like her hand was covered in poop.

391
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,740
She did like a talk to the hand motion

392
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,580
and then they covered it in feces,

393
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,900
like a graphic of feces.

394
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,660
In addition to a recession of jobs and money,

395
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,660
we also had a recession of taste in 2008, 2009.

396
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,380
It's funny because this would come out,

397
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,980
if this exact thing played in 2019,

398
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,620
people would say, well, we deserve Trump.

399
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,860
We have brought Trump upon ourselves.

400
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,820
But this played in the, just straight in the middle

401
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,100
of Obama, it's not as if like, you know,

402
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,660
we feel like things have gotten more coarse,

403
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,860
but Mansers was, you know, right at the tip top

404
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,540
of the administration, so.

405
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,380
The hooting.

406
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,220
Who's to blame?

407
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,900
The hoards of like, yeah, I'm gonna ask for straws

408
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,980
and I'm gonna watch whatever problematic movie,

409
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
I'm gonna watch Revenge of the Nerds

410
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,060
however much I want, you know,

411
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,180
would be hooting and hollering for that garbage.

412
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,060
Mansers, apparently I think Mansers had the issue

413
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,620
where it was a really highly rated show,

414
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,580
but the reruns would rate just as high as the new episodes.

415
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,740
So at a certain point, they just like had so many produced

416
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,340
because they were very popular for Spike TV.

417
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,940
I liked the show.

418
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,460
I feel like, I like a show where the producers

419
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,340
are shitty clearly, but you know there are people working,

420
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,140
places in the show like editors,

421
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,580
and people are getting in subtle digs

422
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,140
and like, oh let's like twist this on itself

423
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,500
and show that we know it's bad.

424
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,940
That was how I felt about my super sweet 16.

425
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,020
Like that was set up in a very cynical way

426
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,580
to like, let's put these awful girls on display

427
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,340
in the, you know, the vest wealth they throw around,

428
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,180
but you could tell the editors would like cut it

429
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,300
to make them, they'd get in digs at the girls

430
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,060
and the dads and everything.

431
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,700
I think Mansers, I bet like if you talked to a Mansers editor,

432
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,740
he'd be like, yeah, I was trying to be funny.

433
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,540
Is that like, but is it an early sort of paving the way

434
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,860
for like a Vanderpump rules or like the insanity

435
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,340
that everyone agrees that's like,

436
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,940
well this is a trashy nightmare, but we love it.

437
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,140
I think you gotta trace that stuff back earlier

438
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,580
than my super sweet 16 or whatever it was called.

439
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,540
I mean, the Temptation Island is back on USA Network

440
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,420
for God's sake and that's over 20 years old at this point.

441
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,580
I keep seeing, like it comes on after like SmackDown.

442
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,420
Is that right?

443
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,100
Well, we'll watch it a little bit later today.

444
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,900
Yeah, so I'll catch, I've caught a little of it here

445
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,900
and there and I honestly have not followed what's going on.

446
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,780
It seems like just people cheating on each other,

447
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,820
either physically or emotionally

448
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,460
and then feeling bad about it.

449
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,300
That's the show.

450
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,340
In front of cameras.

451
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,900
That's the show.

452
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,300
You've got it, you got it down.

453
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,540
But you were really, you got to be a pioneer in this genre.

454
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,940
A decade ago, I got to do one of these early,

455
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,740
well not early, it was still 10 years

456
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,500
into this trash reality show stuff.

457
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,300
But I just, my main takeaway is I just, you know,

458
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,860
it's no offense to you, I find it unrealistic

459
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,900
that you would be somewhere and a woman

460
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,020
in a Union Jack dress would just leap all over you unprompted.

461
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,700
That clearly is what would happen with a mouse woman

462
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,180
in a red polka dot dress.

463
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,900
A much more realistic scenario.

464
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,740
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,580
Honestly.

466
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,180
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

467
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,020
Honestly.

468
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,860
Why?

469
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,460
Like whatever, whatever Foley effects,

470
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,700
like whatever stock effects you can use for free.

471
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,940
Why you shouldn't get hugs from a mouse woman.

472
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,420
She's a mouse, she eats shit all the time.

473
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,540
She hangs out with a dog and a duck.

474
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,860
They eat shit too.

475
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,300
I was just going to say,

476
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,540
Minnie was much more intimate with me though

477
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,260
than this woman was comfortable being

478
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,500
because Minnie would put her snoot right on top of me.

479
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Her snoot?

480
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,860
Yeah, I call it snoot.

481
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,420
I like calling it, I call Edwin's snout a snoot more than,

482
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,660
but it is, it is real.

483
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,500
That's real, look it up.

484
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,420
That's a pronunciation for snout.

485
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,700
But she would just like shove it into me and go skin.

486
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,580
Then the performer would say, kiss.

487
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,020
She would make a kiss noise.

488
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,660
And it happened to me at the contemporary,

489
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,940
happened to me at Epcot Center.

490
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,980
And then I think it happened to me at Disneyland too.

491
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,700
So there was connection there and that's maybe why it's,

492
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,620
perhaps unsettling to watch that video

493
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,740
because you sense how false it was.

494
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,580
It was fake, yeah.

495
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
It was just so that you both could get

496
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,860
your $75 for the day.

497
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,260
Yes, and it was $120 I think

498
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,980
for an unlimited buyout.

499
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,820
Oh man.

500
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,020
I believe that's right. That sucks.

501
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,140
And then what extra sucks is that like Jordan

502
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
and other people that were, that had to react,

503
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,260
they just did that once and they got one fee of $120.

504
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,420
So he's probably in a whole two or three seasons going,

505
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,260
what?

506
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,300
And then he like makes that like, yeah.

507
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,980
And they can use it for things like, you know,

508
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,940
like, like why is Al-Qaeda good and just?

509
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,780
Yeah.

510
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
So I think if they brought Mansers back,

511
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,780
they could probably legally use that footage again.

512
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,820
They could re-edit my footage probably.

513
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,780
I don't have to, I'm not owed anything.

514
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,700
And they could do those.

515
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,540
They could answer those questions.

516
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,220
Why Laurie Loughlin was in the right.

517
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,060
It would be.

518
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,940
Why Sharia Law is great.

519
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,020
It would be funny if Mansers came back as like a,

520
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,940
as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a,

521
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,820
as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a, as a,

522
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,060
a very like political left leaning show that would now try

523
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,260
to answer the true questions that are facing Americans.

524
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,980
Why you have to like these movies paid for partially

525
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,380
by the United States guard services.

526
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,980
And then it's just me, you and a British woman.

527
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,180
Just figure out a way to cut that in.

528
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,580
Well, it like represents like some geopolitical.

529
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,420
Yeah, that's true.

530
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,260
Oil.

531
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,940
Well, they, yeah, they make a special commercial

532
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,340
for the United States army or air force.

533
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,580
And then they make the SAS, the special air service

534
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,340
or the Royal air force in England.

535
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,860
Purpose as highfalutin of a purpose of this can be.

536
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,980
And when you, when you, when you sign that buyout,

537
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,660
you didn't realize it could be used in perpetuity

538
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,180
and on podcasts in 10 years.

539
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,020
No, it's true.

540
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,220
I did not see that coming,

541
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,060
but it's there.

542
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,420
Hey, look up podcasts, the ride on YouTube and, and you can,

543
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,460
you can join in the fun.

544
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,820
Real quick.

545
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,180
Do we answer the question you found it?

546
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,860
It was just a clip posted.

547
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,700
No, no, no.

548
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,340
I, I, I get NASA now and $22 in the tank.

549
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm edging, I'm getting towards I see, I see you found the,

550
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,540
I got, I got it.

551
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,380
I almost spent to find this.

552
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,300
I almost spent what you were paid to make it.

553
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,420
I was glad I didn't get it.

554
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,020
It was like at least like, like three hours of your time.

555
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,860
I think honestly, now that I think about it,

556
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,220
and this is a funny thing you do after you've been around

557
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,580
for a while, maybe I put that back in my reel.

558
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,260
Maybe that's a conversation starters.

559
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,460
Or yeah, maybe that's number one on the reel.

560
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,340
Cut anything I was in with a celebrity and it's just that.

561
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,780
It shows that you can go broad.

562
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,620
Yeah.

563
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,460
That's what they're after.

564
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,340
You're scalable.

565
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,340
You're a scalable.

566
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,780
Come on, Seth Rogan, put me in a gross out movie of yours.

567
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,620
Come on.

568
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
You see what face I can make when I smelled duty.

569
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,220
Come on.

570
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,580
You could be used as a reference for sausage party too.

571
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,420
Yeah.

572
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Like as like, here's what an animated character would do.

573
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
If they bugged their eyes out,

574
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,620
I'll be like a Sean gun motion capturing rocket raccoon

575
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,140
for the sausage, the new sausage and sausage party.

576
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,060
There is a part they do show.

577
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,500
I think they represent you getting fecal matter

578
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,740
on your penis by showing a hot dog dipped into chocolate,

579
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,540
which as I say it on the one hand, a little upsetting,

580
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,940
but on the other hand,

581
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,620
maybe something that Jason would want to consume.

582
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
We talk in chocolate hot dogs.

583
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,940
You can send me.

584
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,380
Usually, I mean, I've heard of chocolate covered starfish

585
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,580
and hot dog flavored water.

586
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
Certainly.

587
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,460
Yes, we never thought about just combining two

588
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,780
of my faze these foods.

589
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,260
Well, ignore the metaphor and just enjoy that

590
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,300
on its own merits.

591
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,860
And with that said, we can now get back

592
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,860
to another red suited character of whom we are more fond

593
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,060
than Mike was fond of the union Jack woman.

594
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
Yeah.

595
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,940
And that is spider man.

596
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,620
What are the,

597
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,460
I don't know how we would cover.

598
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm gonna have to like rest for all the G O Jason talk

599
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,700
for a while.

600
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,820
One of the few fictional, I feel like, you know,

601
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,900
you hear about like millennials being in like a, you know,

602
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,940
forever adolescence or whatever,

603
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,860
arrested development and all that.

604
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,340
And I like to think part of me is, is, oh, that's not true.

605
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,780
That's not the case, but I am like,

606
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
I would call spider man a friend.

607
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
Oh geez.

608
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,940
I would say like, oh, my friend spider man,

609
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,020
it's like, oh, I'm always happy to see him.

610
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,660
I think the other one or another character,

611
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,300
I would say that about would be R2D2.

612
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,220
Like it's like, I like these characters.

613
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,540
I find these characters very in your,

614
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,380
that's me with the racks.

615
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,220
That's what you see.

616
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,780
You admitted that to Tony Baxter.

617
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,940
I think this, I think it's a nice feeling.

618
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,780
Yeah.

619
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,540
A lot of, there's a lot of friends in theme park world.

620
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,380
Yeah.

621
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,140
So you would think, cause I'm trying to think I would,

622
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,780
when I read X-Men, cause with comics, I was,

623
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,620
X-Men was the first like superhero Marvel comics.

624
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,020
I was way into, and I would imagine living

625
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,740
at the X-Men mansion.

626
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,580
Sure.

627
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,380
When Harry Potter like started, I really got it.

628
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Cause I felt like everyone was thinking,

629
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,060
dreaming of when they would get their owl

630
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,980
and they would go to Hogwarts and they would live there.

631
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,980
But I had the same fantasy about the X-Men's mansion.

632
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,780
I would go to the X-Men's mansion.

633
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,820
Rogue would find a cure for her powers.

634
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,780
And then we would fall in love and I would ice Gambit out.

635
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,620
Sure.

636
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,460
I loved Gambit.

637
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,100
Gambit's a cat, a rogue.

638
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,620
You don't settle down with that.

639
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,460
Right.

640
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,140
I mean, I'm definitely in the comics.

641
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,180
They are in canon merit now.

642
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,940
They've settled down once in a while.

643
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,660
But so, so it was, I guess that's,

644
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,540
I was thinking about that.

645
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,220
Were you kind of fantasizing as a kid about being buddies

646
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,060
with Spider-Man?

647
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,700
Well, I guess I probably was too.

648
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,140
Yeah. I mean, I, I like you was more of an X-Men kid.

649
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,940
Although even as a kid, I was like, in 90s X-Men,

650
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,980
it's harder to square the circle of like,

651
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,500
you go to the school and live with them because how old are

652
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,140
the fucking Jim Lee 90s X-Men?

653
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,420
I was like, Oh, look like they're 35 years old, 40.

654
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,660
And they're all still living at Xavier school

655
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,340
for gifted youngsters, which that was a whole issue

656
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,100
in like 94 and 95 was they changed the side,

657
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,380
the sign to Xavier's school for higher learning.

658
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,540
Cause they're like, Oh no, the youngsters are in a

659
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,940
generation X they're in Massachusetts now.

660
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,260
Right. Yes. That's true.

661
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,140
And then they, they started to change stuff.

662
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,420
Cause when Grant Morrison came in the book,

663
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,900
then he put a bunch of like young people in the school.

664
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,180
It went back to being a full school.

665
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,540
Why are all these old people hanging out?

666
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,780
Why are all these old people with seemingly unlimited?

667
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,980
Because that's the other thing with the X-Men is they either

668
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,700
get their unlimited money from angel from Warren

669
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,340
Worthington's fortune or Charles Xavier's.

670
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,900
We lost Scott already. We've lost.

671
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,300
I needed a break. So that's good. Okay. Good. That's,

672
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,940
that's fine. Have at it.

673
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,940
I'll say this is my ideal X-Men lineup and not characters

674
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,860
wise, I'm fine with rotating characters.

675
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,180
In fact, I think like the Avengers,

676
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,580
they should rotate in and out.

677
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,260
But I think it's five to eight X-Men and the supporting cast

678
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,420
is students, the X-Men comics for the last 10 years or so,

679
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,660
it just been like, here's 30 X-Men, every issue.

680
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm look, I'm torn. Look,

681
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,820
we have to get back to Spider-Man cause I can talk of another

682
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,500
two and a half hours about the X-Men's perfect lineup.

683
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,660
Uh, but I am torn on this cause I like a nice small team.

684
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,260
I like the grand Morrison run. I like the Josh Whedon run a lot.

685
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,660
Uh, but, uh, we grew up on an X-Men when X-Men had two teams,

686
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,860
a blue team and a gold team.

687
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,940
And there were about 15 people on each team.

688
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,780
No, it was like six or seven on each team. I don't know.

689
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,860
I think we're maybe we're in the middle. I think was smaller.

690
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,060
I think blue team would be more anyway. Now we have to tell,

691
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,700
we have to figure out, I'll say this,

692
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,900
the difference between me as a kid, um, uh, with,

693
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,860
with X-Men and Spider-Man, like X-Men, I,

694
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,260
I put me more at ease cause I'm like, okay,

695
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,540
at least they all have powers and they could all have each other.

696
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,700
Spider-Man, I was like, Spider-Man's fun and cool,

697
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,820
but Peter Parker's problems stress me out and his supporting cast are all

698
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,820
like frail people or his high school bully who also works at the

699
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,620
newspapers sometimes.

700
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,060
And occasionally someone else with power shows up,

701
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,900
but they're not guaranteed to be there. Like he's, he's kind of on his own.

702
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,460
So Spider-Man's like alter ego life.

703
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,660
Peter Parker constantly struggling, which stressed me out.

704
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,860
I agree with that.

705
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,420
I think I liked the X-Men cause there wasn't so much of that.

706
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,900
I think I liked Spider-Man. I liked the fact that he was a kid.

707
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,020
Cause I liked Robin. I liked reading impulse.

708
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,780
I liked the kids stuff to imagine I was a kid,

709
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,300
but Peter Parker was like two working class and I wanted to imagine you lived in

710
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,820
like a fancy mansion. I was like, sort of, I think,

711
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,700
I think that stressed me out too, where it was like,

712
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,860
he's always in trouble and like he's worried about like his aunt catching him

713
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,020
and he's got homework. And it was like, that's too much pressure for me.

714
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,580
I liked the X-Men where they're all like their parents hate them cause they're

715
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,820
mutants. But then they don't have to deal with them.

716
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,540
They don't have to talk to them anymore. And then that's not,

717
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,860
I'm saying I didn't want to talk to my parents. Don't get me wrong.

718
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,460
I was, I want to hear other problems. It was just,

719
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,060
it was more of a fantasy of thinking the X-Men would move away.

720
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,460
X-Men was soap opera, but I kind of, I liked that more. I liked when Peter

721
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,220
and MJ were married, like they were married for like 20,

722
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,140
30 years and then he got the devil to undo it.

723
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,740
And it's a whole fucking mess. Yeah.

724
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,340
It looks like we're, as far as the team, I think you were closer.

725
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,180
I think it's like eight from my account real quick. Yeah.

726
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,900
Do you want me, I think I can do blue. I think I can do these off the dome. Hey,

727
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,820
do it. Go for it. Gold team. Jean Grey storm,

728
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,620
Iceman, angel, Archangel at the time.

729
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,340
And Bishop eventually joined once he got stranded in our time.

730
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,220
And isn't professor X on the gold team as well.

731
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,180
Professor X is more to the gold team because cyclops led the blue team,

732
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,180
but then storm or I think led the gold team. Did she? I think,

733
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,180
so blue team, I think, no way.

734
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,340
She was on that was she on the white team, right? Sure. She had her later.

735
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,220
That was later.

736
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,100
Blue team, Cyclops, rogue, Gambit, Psylocke, Jubilee.

737
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,980
I think that's it. Beast. Yeah. Beast. You're right. And there's like Gambit.

738
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,340
I said Gambit. Okay. All right.

739
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,420
They'll hang out even though they're on different teams.

740
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,140
So you're that well,

741
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,060
that was a lot of conflict cause Jean and Scott were on different teams and

742
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,100
then Psylocke and Scott had to think for a while and Psylocke and Archangel on

743
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,620
and off for years. It's yeah.

744
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,420
So you would split up couples once in a while,

745
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,860
but then they kind of broke that down pretty quickly. That's a whole,

746
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,420
we'll do that one. We finally build an X-Men ride that we like. I mean,

747
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,660
the storm ride is fine at islands of adventure,

748
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,860
but it's not quite the level of the Spiderman ride. Sure. So,

749
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,780
but Spiderman, I, I, the Spiderman ride, I think too,

750
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,660
and I'm going to give this ride so much praise and researching this ride.

751
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,660
Most of the articles about it are universal acclaim.

752
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,940
So I don't feel as bad doing that,

753
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,380
but I think this is my platonic ideal of Spiderman. Like,

754
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,220
it's like the nineties. It's kind of the cartoon. He's fighting bad guys.

755
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,980
There's a little bit of Peter stuff, but it's more like funny.

756
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,380
It's more like bumbling and funny in the queue.

757
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,940
There's not a lot of stressed out.

758
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,660
Tonally this is the year the Spiderman that you, yeah. It's not too,

759
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,860
it's not too dark. It's not, it's silly. It's still fun. Gotcha.

760
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,260
I get what you're saying. I mean, because it's very,

761
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,780
there's a lot of like nineties cartoon influence on it. Yes.

762
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
Especially the queue. I feel like,

763
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,580
cause the characters is that character designs are different than the cartoon,

764
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
but in the queue,

765
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,620
it very much feels like J.

766
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,540
Joan and Jameson's office from the nineties cartoon. Yeah.

767
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,740
Inspired by it at least, which famously voiced by Ed Asner,

768
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,500
just for a little, a little trivia there in the, in the ride. No,

769
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,060
in the, or maybe in the ride, we should look that up,

770
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,020
but in the cartoon from the nineties at Asner does J.

771
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,780
Joan and Jameson's.

772
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,660
Fun. So he's another newspaper editor and yeah,

773
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,780
I assume that's what Jameson is. Yeah, he is. Yeah. That's good point.

774
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,460
Lou grant. Then of course he was the head of Mary Tyler Moore's newsroom.

775
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,540
Of course everyone knows that,

776
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,940
but then he of course was spun off into his own show,

777
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,980
Lou grand where he was the head of a newspaper. Yeah. More dramatic. Yep.

778
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,340
Need a good Mary Tyler Moore ride. Yeah. Well they never.

779
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,820
Well that one also will have a photography dark room with hand prints on the

780
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,100
walls and ceiling, but it won't be explained.

781
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,980
If there was a Mary Tyler Moore ride that we didn't know about that it closed,

782
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,140
I feel like whoever texted on our chain, we would have been like,

783
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,780
put a pot of coffee on. We gotta go now. We gotta do this.

784
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,460
It is whatever time of this. Yeah. Like 2 AM.

785
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,860
We have to get together and record this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it exists,

786
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,340
but if you know of it, please tweet it us. Yeah.

787
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,020
In a theme park recreation of Minneapolis of miniature Minneapolis,

788
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,060
right? One of the rejected islands of islands of nature.

789
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,140
Let me just say the broad strokes details just in case opening day islands of

790
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,420
adventure attraction at universal Orlando, gigantic ride.

791
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Probably what they like, I don't know what they put their money into,

792
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,300
obviously, but like, doesn't it say,

793
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,860
I feel like this was like the big opening day.

794
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,220
It was technologically years ahead of everything else,

795
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
probably cost a fortune.

796
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,780
Everything I think in any of the, like, I'm not sure Disney had,

797
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,140
had gotten there. And if you haven't been on this ride, it's what it,

798
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,380
but you have been on the transformers ride.

799
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,500
Those are clear analogs and it's the same ride vehicle and the same general idea

800
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,580
moving from screen to room screen to room.

801
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,740
And it's thrill ride, but a simulator and this,

802
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,540
this has been so many things that are like this now.

803
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,860
And this was the first and like, like truly unbelievable.

804
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,220
The first time you went on it,

805
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,380
they invented a technique that universal owns the copyright for called squinching

806
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,380
to account for the distortion one would feel about viewing a 3d footage while in

807
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,380
movement. Cause before this 3d footage, you would be watching it stationary.

808
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,380
So they had to write an algorithm,

809
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
figure out how if it distorts in this way,

810
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,380
we have to factor in an equal amount of distortion the opposite way.

811
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
And that'll balance it out.

812
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,380
So that if you are entering a room with the 3d screen from the left and then

813
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,380
leaving through the right,

814
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,380
the perspective has to perfectly match where your eyes would be over and over

815
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
again all day.

816
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,380
And if you just stayed in one place and weren't moving and just stared at that

817
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,380
screen, it would look bizarre and distorted and bendy and weird,

818
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,380
but it also, it only works in motion.

819
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
It is crazy when you think about it,

820
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,380
cause it works so well and you take it for granted.

821
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
But yeah,

822
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,380
it's like just walking in and like walking into a movie theater and seeing

823
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
things from different perspectives.

824
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,380
Like if you walked across a movie theater and then the screen like changed,

825
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,380
so you almost perfectly saw it and it looked like it was coming head on to you

826
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,380
while you were moving.

827
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Like that's impop like impossible.

828
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
It is a thing.

829
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,380
It's there's essentially a thing like this in mission impossible for,

830
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Oh yeah.

831
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
He in Russia,

832
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,380
he like puts up a screen and land it like,

833
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,380
like lines up with the pupils of the security guards that it moves with his

834
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
perspective.

835
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
So they can't,

836
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,380
so we can't see the Tom Cruise just down the hallway.

837
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
It is his mission impossible level technology.

838
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
Yeah.

839
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,380
And the entire thing is like military grade tech net,

840
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
like the,

841
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
like yeah,

842
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,380
probably the most technologically advanced ride ever upon its opening and

843
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
that universal had it not Disney.

844
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
I don't,

845
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,380
I was trying to think like,

846
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Oh,

847
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
when did Disney top this?

848
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Cause I think universal matched it with forbidden journey.

849
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
And it's the same idea with like the,

850
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,380
the attempt at a seamless transition between sets and screens.

851
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
Yeah.

852
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,380
Giving you a much more dynamic experience than a pure screen ride might give

853
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
you.

854
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,380
And a lot of the people who worked heavily on this went on to work heavily

855
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
on a forbidden journey.

856
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
And the more I thought about it,

857
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,380
I was wondering when did Disney top this or has Disney top this

858
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
flight of passage.

859
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
Oh,

860
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
it's pretty close.

861
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
I don't know if initially,

862
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,380
like I don't know if I was wowed as spectacularly as I was by Spiderman the

863
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
first time.

864
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
I don't know if I was,

865
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,380
I don't know if I was,

866
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,380
I don't know if I was.

867
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
I don't know.

868
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
I don't know.

869
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
I don't know.

870
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
I don't know.

871
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
I don't know.

872
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,380
I don't know.

873
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I don't know.

874
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm not sure.

875
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,380
I'm not sure.

876
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
I'm not sure.

877
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
I'm not sure.

878
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm not sure.

879
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
But I think it's,

880
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,380
I don't know if it's as spectacularly as I was by Spiderman the first time,

881
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
but pretty close.

882
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
It's not quite the same.

883
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Cause there's not physical sets,

884
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,380
but as far as immersion and three D and really getting people like absorbed

885
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
in 3d screens.

886
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
Flight of passage is pretty close.

887
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,380
There's a lot of like augmented screens and things that'll make the other already

888
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,380
like practical sets and stuff,

889
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
but no glasses on rice.

890
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
I don't, I don't believe so.

891
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
Yeah.

892
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
Which could help step it up.

893
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I'll say, I'll say this.

894
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
The,

895
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
uh,

896
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,380
you, this is a rare case of like universal cracks,

897
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
a type of ride.

898
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
And then Disney does it.

899
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,380
That being the ratatouille ride,

900
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,380
it's a little different,

901
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,380
but ratatouille in Paris is a trackless vehicles,

902
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
but moving from screen to room.

903
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
And some are big screens and some are small screen.

904
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Some simulate big old drops and some are just like transitional screens.

905
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Not as good, not as thrilling.

906
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
The ride vehicles aren't as good.

907
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
The, the, the transitions aren't as seamless.

908
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,380
It's a, it's a neat ride for sure.

909
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I wouldn't speak ill of it,

910
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
but it's nowhere close.

911
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,380
Right.

912
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
So universal for sure.

913
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
And probably by virtue of that,

914
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,380
they have patents on stuff on like squinching and the,

915
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,380
the ride vehicles themselves,

916
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
like they're able to do it the best.

917
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Yeah.

918
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,380
And the ride vehicles are just so much more like different than the ride vehicles.

919
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,380
Yeah. And the ride vehicles are just so much more like dynamic and then,

920
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,380
and the, this and transformers, which I, I'm,

921
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,380
I do really like transformers as well.

922
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
They really like jostle you around,

923
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,380
which really also adds to the immersion of it.

924
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,380
Cause you really like feel like beat up and like,

925
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,380
and my mom thinks now she can't do these rides cause she feels too beat up by

926
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
them.

927
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
I think, and it seems like when they were sketching out,

928
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,380
like what is this ride going to be?

929
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,380
I think maybe they were going to be like,

930
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I think it was like the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the ride.

931
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,380
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

932
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
the ride.

933
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,380
The, the, the, the, the, the,idan, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

934
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
the ride.

935
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
So,

936
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,380
early on it seemed one of the creators was saying like,

937
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,380
we thought it might just be a simple dark ride.

938
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,380
And then we realized we,

939
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,380
after seeing Indiana Jones in Disneyland,

940
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
we thought it was the original ride.

941
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,380
And we were like,

942
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,380
we were going to call it the daily Bugle instead or maybe,

943
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,380
or it was just still called Spiderman or something.

944
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,380
But it was going to be more of an Omni mover.

945
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Which the rumor is that that's what the,

946
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
the new one is going to.

947
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,380
That what Disney's Spiderman ride is going to be like more of a

948
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
kid friendly, slow moving.

949
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,380
But it's like say like less scary.

950
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
I think.

951
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,380
This Spiderman ride can get. Yeah. I think cause, cause there was a rumor,

952
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
or a patent was filed. I'm sure we've talked about it before.

953
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,380
There was a patent filed for a ride system that Disney made,

954
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,380
which was a giant arm where it was like a roller coaster type thing.

955
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,380
And you would swing in a giant practical city,

956
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,380
which I think everyone got real excited for cause it even mentions in the

957
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,380
patent, like swing like Tarzan or Spiderman. You've seen it, right?

958
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Yeah. Yeah. To both of you, I'm sure.

959
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,380
And it's like, it would swing this way. So you would simulate swinging.

960
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,380
And then when they announced that there would be like a Spiderman ride,

961
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,380
but then the guardians of the galaxy ride is anchoring the new Marvel land

962
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,380
next year. People were like, okay,

963
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,380
this is not going to be a crazy e-ticket Spiderman ride that we're hoping for.

964
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,380
After that, maybe it'll still get built one day, but yeah, that's what the

965
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,380
rumors are. It's like a slower. Sure. Sure. I'm the mover type thing.

966
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,380
So that's almost,

967
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
that's almost what universal did to begin with weirdly.

968
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,380
And then Indiana Jones stepped up to the get is the best example of the theme

969
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
park wars.

970
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Absolutely. And this kind of, it is a simple idea of like, well, we had it,

971
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
they want it to combine.

972
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,380
We have a motion simulator like back to the future and we have like 3d combined

973
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,380
with practical sets like Terminator, the Terminator show.

974
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,380
And basically these ride vehicles are just motion simulators,

975
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
but they move along a track.

976
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Yeah. I'm trying to think now I'm probably jumping all around here,

977
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,380
but I'm the first time I was on a ride.

978
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,380
I'm the first time I was on the ride. I couldn't believe it.

979
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Like I couldn't quite believe that they finally got me into the cartoon.

980
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
I guess is what it really felt like.

981
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,380
It was, I, I dis opened in March,

982
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,380
March of 1999 and I, my family went in like June or July.

983
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,380
And I was just so excited of like a brand new theme park.

984
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,380
Like this is incredible. And, and there's a whole Marvel area.

985
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
Are you kidding me?

986
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
And then the ride, like, yeah,

987
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,380
all of the effects and just the tone of voice for a spider-man in the ride.

988
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,380
I was like, this is, this is good. This is a spider-man I like.

989
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Yeah. Cause in the night, I guess we were spoiled in the cartoons.

990
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,380
Cause there was all the spider-man and Marvel cartoons,

991
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,380
some of them better than others.

992
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,380
The best ones being X-Men and Spider-Man, which aren't really that good,

993
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,380
but they're good and nostalgia good.

994
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,380
And then the last good ones are like the Iron Man cartoon,

995
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,380
which I was so bored by as a kid. Do you remember that?

996
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Yeah, I think that and the whole cartoons were kind of made on the cheap.

997
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,380
Yeah. Although I have to say, I mean, of course,

998
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,380
this spider-man ride got kind of upgraded 4k footage in 2012.

999
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:34,380
And then Hulk got a bit of a track upgrade and a different Q video in 2014.

1000
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,380
And we both have had, got headaches after riding the new Hulk.

1001
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,380
Yeah. It did a disservice to the Hulk and it just improved the Spider-Man ride.

1002
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,380
Yeah. The Spider-Man ride looks great.

1003
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,380
I hadn't watched the new, I hadn't watched the 2012 redo.

1004
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,380
I think like the only thing that you might have ever said was lacking in this ride

1005
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,380
was that the 1999 era CGI was starting to get a little out of date and they fixed it.

1006
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,380
It looks so great. You can all, I haven't been on the new version,

1007
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,380
so I can only watch the, I could just watch a video where it's 3D and I, you know,

1008
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,380
it's blurry and everything, but even through that, it looks incredible.

1009
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,380
So it's all the same scenes, but just rendered so much more dimensionally.

1010
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,380
And like those, the, the big moments, like who is it who jumps into your face and screams?

1011
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,380
They all kind of do that, but scream I think you're looking for.

1012
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,380
A character's name, scream, of course. Yeah. That, that, yeah, they look great.

1013
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,380
Everything it's all it's cause everything is the same.

1014
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,380
It's like, if you went on it, like I went on it now and I almost forgot that it was redone.

1015
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
Exactly.

1016
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,380
I forgot. I was like, oh yeah, I used to look.

1017
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,380
And then I went back because my memory was just like, oh, it always looked like this, right?

1018
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,380
It reminded me in a way of like the, while I don't really like the film,

1019
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:53,380
I like, I think it's really neat to see like Tron legacy redo this.

1020
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:01,380
It's the same effects and scenes and bikes and discs, but rendered with decades advanced technology,

1021
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,380
but they retained how it all works and like the basic functions of it.

1022
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:14,380
And it felt like that, like, so like so cool to just like, you know, five times advanced animation.

1023
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
And I keep the same ride.

1024
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,380
I have to say the aesthetics of that movie and the color palettes and that version of like the future,

1025
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,380
I am really kind of shocked and delighted.

1026
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,380
I think I really haven't seen that movie in a while, so I can't speak for the movie itself,

1027
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,380
but I think the aesthetics of it have aged very nicely.

1028
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,380
Yeah, like we talked about that before of like, yeah, you know how you make it look like the future neon blue neon.

1029
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Yes, yes.

1030
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Always looks like the future.

1031
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,380
They just got to get Tron into Disneyland.

1032
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
Just put it there. However you got to jam it in.

1033
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Like what? Why? How could this tomorrow land problem be?

1034
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,380
So we really need to like do an episode that is the tomorrow land problem.

1035
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Yeah, you know what?

1036
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
You know what? You know what I was thinking here?

1037
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,380
I'll just pitch this to you guys on the episode that you know, we do.

1038
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,380
We do our plus ups and sometimes those can be jokes.

1039
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,380
If we just didn't even do bits, it's like all what all right.

1040
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
It is your job to fix tomorrow.

1041
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
And what do you do? Oh yeah, that would be great.

1042
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,380
Yeah, yeah, that won't be funny, but it'll be important now.

1043
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,380
I mean, they'll be fun.

1044
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,380
I will make up some tomorrow and characters that you might giggle at.

1045
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,380
I won't giggle at them.

1046
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,380
They'll be totally serious, but they might have a silly name or something.

1047
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,380
But yeah, it'll be all it'll be mostly serious stuff. No jokes.

1048
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,380
But this whole but you know, you talk about plus and it up and everything.

1049
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,380
Like they they did what you would want to happen on this ride.

1050
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,380
They updated it and made it 4K and nicer animation.

1051
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,380
And did that give them more business? Probably not.

1052
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,380
I feel like Disney would have just kept it the same.

1053
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,380
I think it's amazing. Universal just unprompted.

1054
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,380
Let's bring it into the 2010s and that ride has 20 more years of life because they did it.

1055
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:03,380
They they said to like there is saw an interview with TheoryCoop and one of the other people who were behind it.

1056
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:12,380
TheoryCoop, one of the still one of the main Universal creative people, oversaw a lot of like their popular rides in the last X number of years.

1057
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,380
They asked him like, well, Marvel got bought by Disney in 2009.

1058
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,380
Are you concerned about these characters going away?

1059
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,380
And he's like, we love these characters and we want this ride to stick around and for the foreseeable future it is.

1060
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,380
So we want it to be relevant still. And they just did it.

1061
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:34,380
And is there also something in the contract where they have to like kind of add stuff to things to like make it?

1062
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,380
I think maybe not. I think I'm wrong about that.

1063
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
I think they have the freedom.

1064
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,380
I mean, they've upgraded the characters costumes to a more modern look.

1065
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,380
Yes, there's so many.

1066
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,380
I mean, that's probably a great episode, too.

1067
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:56,380
Now that we're just pitching, I'm thinking of other episodes is that I'm so confused by the contracts for Marvel and Universal because there's certain characters they can use in Marvel Superhero Island.

1068
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,380
Some they can't.

1069
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:04,380
And then I'm still confused because for a long time there were rumors that they were going to build a new Marvel ride in Islands of Adventure.

1070
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,380
But I think they need Disney to sign off on that somehow.

1071
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380
But why would Disney ever sign off on it?

1072
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,380
Unless Disney can get their own Marvel rides.

1073
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,380
So there's this whole stalemate, I think, still at this point between the two companies over that.

1074
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
I do. And I have said before, I love it.

1075
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,380
I love how interesting and weird it makes everything.

1076
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,380
I love that so much of the land is still stuck in 1999 bankruptcy era Marvel.

1077
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
And that has to be stuck, I think. Right.

1078
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
I think to a certain point.

1079
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,380
That's why I'm on all these questions I need to know.

1080
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Because the land is filled with glorious Adam Kubbert art.

1081
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,380
Adam Kubbert, a comic book artist, did a lot of runs on X-Men in various series.

1082
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:50,380
Son of legendary artist Joe Kubbert, brother of Andy Kubbert, another whole comic book family.

1083
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,380
I have their cards.

1084
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,380
They do a whole line.

1085
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,380
The three of them did a whole line of X-Men trading cards that I have upstairs.

1086
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,380
The family made a trading card line together.

1087
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,380
It was via FLIR.

1088
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,380
But yeah, it's just the three of them trading off on the cards and all the hundreds of X-Men characters.

1089
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,380
The Kubbert School has produced multiple generations of comic book artists.

1090
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,380
And I feel like the actual drawn art does look good.

1091
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,380
People still recognize that as the characters.

1092
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:24,380
Because all of that stuff was so ubiquitous in the 90s of T-shirts and baseball caps and that sort of thing.

1093
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,380
I believe he drew the finale of the onslaught crossover.

1094
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,380
I think that's right. They were all over that.

1095
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,380
Yeah, they were the superstars of the 90s for sure.

1096
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,380
So you get what Marvel and Universal gives you is more of a comic book come to life.

1097
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Whereas Disney will clearly do the more photo real, the like aesthetic of the Marvel film.

1098
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,380
Disney? Yeah.

1099
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:52,380
Yeah, Disney will welcome you to a college campus style land where you can be recruited.

1100
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,380
You can see every strap on his backpack.

1101
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Yeah, I assume there'll be a second wave where it's a little kooky or like the Guardians ride and stuff.

1102
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:08,380
But yeah, right now it looks like Marvel's doing a lot of like shield base like sterile shield base places to go.

1103
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Which I'm like less and less into that.

1104
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:17,380
But I liked in Captain Marvel, like spoiler alert, I don't know that they introduced the Kree and the scrolls like all right.

1105
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,380
Yeah, more weirder stuff, more weirder Marvel Universe stuff. Absolutely.

1106
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:26,380
Well, I'm hoping that once the second wave of the Marvel land goes around the Hollywood area and California Adventure,

1107
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:33,380
we can get like a crazy career scroll base or some weird shit because it would make sense to do something like that.

1108
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:42,380
But we it's like basically like you're going in the pages of a comic book because let's remember back then we were not spoiled like we are now.

1109
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
It's hard.

1110
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:51,380
Some I know we have listeners that are younger, so perhaps they don't remember a time when there weren't fifteen superhero movies a year.

1111
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,380
Yeah.

1112
00:48:52,380 --> 00:49:04,380
When there weren't fifty TV shows, there wasn't a whole DC streaming service that focuses solely on DC Comics exclusive TV shows.

1113
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,380
The idea that this all changed exists.

1114
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,380
There was no comics ology like you can.

1115
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,380
I could get any comic book right now on my phone like instantly.

1116
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,380
That's crazy.

1117
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,380
I used to be a pain in the ass kid.

1118
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,380
I mean, I was a good boy.

1119
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,380
I was a good kid.

1120
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,380
But I would be like any time my parents had to run an errand, it's like, hey, can we swing by the comic shop?

1121
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Look, I went to the comic store right before my dentist appointment today, so I'm still doing it.

1122
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,380
I get to drive myself now.

1123
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,380
Ha.

1124
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,380
Yeah, I am in my thirties.

1125
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,380
You get gassed.

1126
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,380
Probably shouldn't drive.

1127
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,380
I shouldn't do that.

1128
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,380
I did not get gassed.

1129
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,380
So even so, but yeah, that's all crazy.

1130
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:49,380
I'm just saying, though, that I remember a time when a couple kids in high school read comics and I knew those kids and I was friends with them.

1131
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,380
And it felt like an impossible dream.

1132
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:59,380
I remember reading an article on my computer that finally they were going to make the Spider-Man movie because James Cameron was going to do it in the mid 90s.

1133
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:05,380
And I remember finally reading that it's going to come out in like a year or six months and they find because it was a bunch of legal problems with it.

1134
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,380
So it's like, OK, cool.

1135
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,380
I knew there was an X-Men movie coming out in a Spider-Man movie.

1136
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:17,380
But most things other than Batman had not been treated with a ton of respect or money.

1137
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:25,380
And so the idea that anything on this scale, like Marvel Superhero Island or this Spider-Man ride was crazy to me.

1138
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,380
Now it makes total sense that we get a giant big, big budget Spider-Man ride.

1139
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:38,380
But back then, the idea that there would be a movie and the suit would look kind of like the character was, oh, yeah, they got it.

1140
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,380
OK, good.

1141
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:44,380
Spider-Man looks like him because you'd always be worried because there was that Generation X show on Fox.

1142
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,380
And it's like the only way Jubilee kind of looks like yourself.

1143
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,380
And they did that bad Nick Fury, David Hasselhoff, which is great in a different way.

1144
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,380
But everything was kind of like you.

1145
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:01,380
I thought I almost kind of thought less of the characters because of the way I felt they were treated in the media and by mainstream audiences.

1146
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,380
I know that sounds weird.

1147
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,380
But you're getting it.

1148
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,380
Sounds true.

1149
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,380
You know what I'm saying?

1150
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,380
I know what you mean.

1151
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,380
I mean, I would tape all of those made for TV movies on my TV.

1152
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,380
I would not rewatch them a lot, though.

1153
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,380
It was also like, how do you mess up super spy?

1154
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,380
How do you mess up teenagers, horny teenagers with superpowers?

1155
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,380
Like and they they did it.

1156
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,380
They messed they messed up.

1157
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:30,380
But yeah, it just felt like other than like Superman and even Superman was having trouble getting off the ground again.

1158
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:36,380
But like other than Batman, most people didn't know about these characters and take them very seriously.

1159
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:47,380
And we were only going to get them in comics, kids cartoons and then occasional TV specials that didn't really feel at all.

1160
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,380
Didn't even have a piece of the reason I liked the comic or the characters.

1161
00:51:51,380 --> 00:52:02,380
And it's fun, which is funny, too, because like I think it took a little while, but there is a lot of a claim for the Batman and Superman animated shows and the spin off comics.

1162
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:22,380
I mean, Mark Miller, that one of his first jobs was writing the Superman Adventures comic based on the TV show, and he would go on to write Kickass and Kingsman and Ultimates and all of these like bestselling comic books and ultimately, of course, is like sort of sort of inspiration for some of the Avengers stuff.

1163
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,380
Yeah, it's like grounded take on the Avengers grounded, but like, oh, yeah, thousands bad.

1164
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:41,380
Like I've read some of that stuff recently, and it's like a little two thousands badass, a little too matrix, a little too conservative, but post nine eleven George Bush kept America go like this.

1165
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,380
He doesn't stand for France or something.

1166
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,380
Yeah, yeah, they're beating up.

1167
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:52,380
And of course, the Spider-Man comic, the post nine eleven Spider-Man comic where all the villains are standing at nine eleven crying.

1168
00:52:53,380 --> 00:53:01,380
Oh, yeah, well, that's here underneath Dr. Dooms mask, and it's like Dr. Doom kills people all the time.

1169
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:08,380
And then, of course, the one where the X-Men refused to save England because the women all have shit on their hands.

1170
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,380
Well, sure.

1171
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,380
Yeah, not worth saving.

1172
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,380
Yeah, there's islands, though.

1173
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,380
There was a mass genocene genocide in the comics.

1174
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,380
Yes, the very first Grand Wars and X-Men.

1175
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,380
He kills off an entire population of anyway.

1176
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:36,380
Yeah, I feel like Apple Marvel DC feels very like Apple, Microsoft, in a way, where like they like one will excel far past the other.

1177
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:46,380
And then suddenly, you know where the other like shoot past it in terms of public acclaim and the best products and the most like now.

1178
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,380
And then sometimes they're neck and neck.

1179
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,380
Yeah.

1180
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,380
And then it's also like they all just have identical products to each other.

1181
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,380
There's so many things that are the exact same thing.

1182
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:04,380
Like I was telling I was I was going to say telling, but boring Lindsay with this the other day that Jason correct me if I'm wrong.

1183
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,380
The negative zone is this is the dimensional prison from the DC comics.

1184
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
Yeah.

1185
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,380
And the Phantom Zone is the get it the wrong way.

1186
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,380
No, it's the wrong way.

1187
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,380
Negative Zone is Marvel's other dimension jail.

1188
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,380
Another dimension, but it's not a jail.

1189
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,380
Other creatures just live there.

1190
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,380
I believe the Phantom Zone is where Superman banishes enemies.

1191
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,380
Is that a jail or is that where they send bad guys?

1192
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
The Phantom Zone?

1193
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,380
Yeah, that's a jail.

1194
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,380
That's a jail.

1195
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,380
Okay.

1196
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,380
But they both have zones.

1197
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:40,380
They both have people in and they've like bad guys into the Phantom to the negative zone.

1198
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,380
I feel like bad guys are in the negative.

1199
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,380
I think that's where Annihilus comes from.

1200
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,380
But it's another frontier that the Richards family discovered.

1201
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,380
Scott, you are right.

1202
00:54:50,380 --> 00:55:05,380
Like not just in terms of like in the zeitgeist of like Marvel and DC jockeying back and forth for relevance, but even just on a practical like dollar share of the comic book market or unit share of the comic book market.

1203
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,380
They're constantly going back and forth.

1204
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,380
So who's the who's the Dell of comics of 90s?

1205
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:22,380
I think 90s belong to Marvel in terms of how ubiquitous and you mean like it would be Dark Horse Comics.

1206
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,380
Because Dell.

1207
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,380
Yeah, what's a smaller company that was the equivalent to Dell?

1208
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,380
No, no, sorry.

1209
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,380
In the 90s.

1210
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,380
Yeah, you're right.

1211
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,380
Dell was small.

1212
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,380
I was thinking in the 2000s, Dell was just just fucking everywhere.

1213
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,380
You could trip over it.

1214
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,380
Smaller.

1215
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,380
Smaller. Yeah, you're 90s.

1216
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,380
Image.

1217
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,380
Image or Dark Horse.

1218
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,380
Yeah, which are still like.

1219
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:47,380
Demi Dell was a Dark Horse that suddenly was dominating and now now gone.

1220
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,380
I don't know what's up with Dark Horse.

1221
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,380
They still go and sell licenses.

1222
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,380
Probably more apt.

1223
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,380
Yeah, no rides though for Dark Horse.

1224
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
I don't think so.

1225
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,380
I can't think of the Dark Horse properties of the top of my head.

1226
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,380
They have the aliens license, maybe still do.

1227
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,380
So the alien from alien shows used to show up in the great movie ride.

1228
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,380
That's true.

1229
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,380
But no Dark.

1230
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Well, I don't think they got any money for their Hellboy thing.

1231
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,380
They have Hellboy.

1232
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,380
There should be a Hellboy ride.

1233
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,380
That'd be a cool one.

1234
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,380
Yeah, absolutely.

1235
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:22,380
Anyway, so yeah, so a little stuck in its time, but still a fun land with like a great

1236
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:27,380
with well, a good now coaster and great still like hanging in there.

1237
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,380
Twenty year old attraction.

1238
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,380
There's another thing technologically.

1240
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:38,380
I learned that not only is there the patent for squinching, but the type of ride vehicle

1241
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,380
is patented as well, which is also Transformers.

1242
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,380
And it's a company, Ocean Earing International, built these ride vehicles.

1243
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,380
And you hear that name and you go, well, that's what's that like a theme?

1244
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,380
And then no, no, no.

1245
00:56:53,380 --> 00:57:00,380
This is a Ocean Earing company that built sea vessels that would go like do repairs

1246
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,380
on oil rigs that plant into the sea.

1247
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:10,380
And like before they got into the theme park game, Ocean Earing International sent vessels

1248
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:17,380
out that recovered pieces of both the Lusitania ship that sank and the Challenger space shuttle.

1249
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,380
Wow.

1250
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:23,380
Like they found a weird little ring piece that was like crucial to why the Challenger

1251
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,380
exploded.

1252
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,380
And that's the kind of thing that Ocean Earing did.

1253
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,380
And then they started making theme park vehicles.

1254
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,380
So like the technology is so top notch.

1255
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:40,380
And they got into business with Universal originally because of the Jaws attraction,

1256
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:45,380
which if you heard our episode about that major problems with it of all the opening day

1257
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,380
attraction, there were so many problems with opening day attractions at Universal,

1258
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,380
especially Jaws, terrible.

1259
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,380
Sharks did not work much like the film.

1260
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,380
Totally unreliable.

1261
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,380
Universal thought the company built this royally fucked up.

1262
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,380
We got to talk to people who deal with underwater mechanisms.

1263
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,380
And they like outsourced weirdly to this Ocean Earing company who were like, well,

1264
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,380
actually the theme park business is fun and lucrative and it can be a whole wing.

1265
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,380
So yeah, what a strange lineage.

1266
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:21,380
And the same company, they've made other rides with similar vehicles that are in odd

1267
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,380
locations.

1268
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,380
I forget the one that's in Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, but there's like essentially

1269
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,380
a Spider-Man Transformers kind of thing there.

1270
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,380
Is that Dark Castle?

1271
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,380
And I think it's gone.

1272
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,380
I think it was closed for something else a couple of years ago.

1273
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,380
Okay.

1274
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:42,380
And there's another one in Tokyo Dome City where I will soon be and I'm very excited,

1275
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,380
but I have just learned that this ride has closed.

1276
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,380
It is not there.

1277
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,380
There was a essential.

1278
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,380
There was a Transformers or a Spider-Man Transformers type ride with this exact same

1279
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:58,380
ride vehicle that spun you around into like crazy, but much more cheaply rendered

1280
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,380
anime worlds.

1281
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:06,380
This ride was called Tokyo Panic Cruise and I'm so bummed to learn I don't get to go

1282
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,380
on Tokyo Panic Cruise.

1283
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
When is that close?

1284
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,380
When did that close?

1285
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,380
I think like last year.

1286
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
I barely missed it.

1287
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
And they are opening.

1288
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,380
Amazingly, they're opening some new stuff.

1289
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,380
Right before I go.

1290
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,380
So there will be new things at Dome City right before I go.

1291
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,380
I'm really excited.

1292
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,380
But I can't tell if any of them are replacements for this.

1293
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,380
I don't know.

1294
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,380
How do you have the space for a Spider-Man ride and then don't replace it with any?

1295
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,380
I really can't.

1296
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,380
There's very little information about any of this, at least in English.

1297
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,380
It's really hard to find stuff about it.

1298
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,380
But anyway, dearly departed Tokyo Panic Cruise.

1299
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
Wow.

1300
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,380
We're on the subject of Japan.

1301
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:49,380
So this Spider-Man ride exists in Universal Japan in Osaka too.

1302
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,380
Oh yeah.

1303
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,380
Has a very cool facade.

1304
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,380
Sort of looks like the museum building that the mummy's in in Florida.

1305
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,380
But it says that Daily Bugle across the top.

1306
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,380
Oh, neat.

1307
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,380
Like it's a historic newspaper building.

1308
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,380
Is it kind of a cooler?

1309
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:06,380
It's the only thing like the outside is a little, the comic book style in Florida, while fun,

1310
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,380
does seem a little cheaper sometimes.

1311
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,380
What has the outside of?

1312
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:16,380
It looks like those marble columns kind of like it's in the New York section in that

1313
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:22,380
part, because Spider-Man famously a New York character, a New York, your institution,

1314
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,380
like Robert De Niro.

1315
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,380
So on the web, a couple of interesting things.

1316
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,380
One, they have this great photo op you can do there.

1317
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,380
This is a small picture.

1318
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,380
I was having trouble finding a good version of it.

1319
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,380
It's just a statue of Spider-Man hanging upside down, but you can get your picture with it.

1320
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,380
I think that's great.

1321
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,380
There is in the gift shop.

1322
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:46,380
You can buy Spider-Man instant ramen where the little Neru.

1323
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,380
This is what these are called.

1324
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,380
Neru toes, which is the preserved fish like little circles you get in ramen that have

1325
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,380
the little pink swirl.

1326
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,380
Oh, look like little Spider-Man heads.

1327
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,380
That's cool.

1328
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:05,380
And then my favorite thing on the English version of their website.

1329
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:12,380
And this is actually like really a very good Japanese to English translation.

1330
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,380
And I think sells the ride really well.

1331
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,380
It says so overwhelming.

1332
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:22,380
It bends reality, an unbelievable immersive experience, encounter a new dimension of

1333
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,380
excitement in the world's greatest ride.

1334
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,380
I like that really sounds like Huckster Stanley in the mid sixties.

1335
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:34,380
Hawken is where it's like that is just the perfect encapsulation of the ride.

1336
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,380
They also use and they don't really use this in Florida, but on the Japan website, there

1337
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:44,380
is a lot of references to this ride being four K three D.

1338
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,380
So those are good stats, good stats, good numbers.

1339
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,380
Also, that reminded me that the one cool, the one thing that sounded neat about the

1340
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:58,380
more Omni mover type version that they didn't end up building is that they at the end, they

1341
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,380
would have taken your picture and you would have gotten to get do a print out of yourself

1342
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,380
on the cover of the Daily Bugle.

1343
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,380
That's fun.

1344
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,380
And that's something they should do on the current ride that exists.

1345
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,380
I think the pictures do.

1346
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:16,380
It kind of looks like a photo frame, but like if it was a print out on actual newsprint

1347
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,380
that you could frame, that would be, yeah, that would be amazing.

1348
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,380
Maybe they can do that California adventure.

1349
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,380
Yes, that'd be an idea.

1350
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,380
Oh, sure.

1351
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,380
It's moving slower.

1352
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,380
You can get those pictures more easily.

1353
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,380
Yeah.

1354
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,380
Guys, save city.

1355
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,380
It's going to probably be like a name tag or some ID card.

1356
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,380
Yeah.

1357
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,380
Well, there hasn't been any employee.

1358
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,380
Yeah.

1359
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,380
You're worried about this being functional.

1360
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,380
It's going to be a functional campus.

1361
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,380
I think, yeah, I do think that's the idea.

1362
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,380
That's my feeling.

1363
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:44,380
I mean, from the pictures, we don't have the Daily Bugle yet.

1364
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,380
The Marvel cinematic unit, or that's true.

1365
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,380
So I, you know, I was glad that the new Spider-Man, the Tom Holland Spider-Man, we did not have

1366
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,380
to watch Uncle Ben die again, but I would like to see J.

1367
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,380
Joda Jameson back.

1368
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,380
Sure.

1369
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,380
Bring back J.K.

1370
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,380
Simmons for all I care.

1371
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,380
That's what people have.

1372
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,380
Yeah.

1373
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,380
People want that.

1374
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,380
But yeah, I know.

1375
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,380
More well, the bigger star now than then they have.

1376
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,380
They don't.

1377
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,380
I think they don't like to feel like they didn't.

1378
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,380
There is not their version.

1379
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,380
I mean, I don't think anyone would be mad at all.

1380
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,380
And I'm an advocate for like, just bring Toby Maguire back as his like older Spider-Man

1381
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,380
like they were going to do in Spider-Verse.

1382
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,380
Like there's a rumor they're going to do have the three Spider-Man actors do voices as well.

1383
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,380
I like anything like that.

1384
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,380
I mean, wherever we're getting the old actors back, we're putting people together.

1385
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,380
It's the one thing about you kind of like that trailer for Shaft.

1386
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,380
I was less sold, but I do think it's neat to see while one of them is new, one of them

1387
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,380
is not.

1388
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,380
There's two old Shafts and a new Shaft.

1389
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,380
It's an easy trick and I love it.

1390
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,380
And it's a big thing in comics.

1391
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,380
Shared universe, legacy characters.

1392
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:53,380
That's what we I know we've talked about before, like DC, like had all these legacy characters

1393
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,380
in the 90s like Wally West is a flash now.

1394
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,380
Kyle Reiner's Green Lantern.

1395
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,380
Yeah.

1396
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,380
And then the 2000s, they crapped all over that.

1397
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,380
It's like they're still back to the original.

1398
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,380
Yeah, went back to the original Marvel has done that to a lesser extent.

1399
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:12,380
Yeah, honestly, the first non Marvel cinematic universe character that will enter that was

1400
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,380
cast before is Deadpool.

1401
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,380
Hmm.

1402
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,380
Dead.

1403
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,380
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,380
Remain Ryan Reynolds, this version of him, and he will probably end up in some of these

1405
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,380
movies.

1406
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,380
Wow.

1407
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,380
So the Deadpool will be in Disney movies.

1408
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,380
That's what Bob Iger has said.

1409
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,380
So I think he makes too much money for them to not.

1410
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,380
Yeah, it only it only makes sense for sure.

1411
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,380
Does did does did pull end up in the parks?

1412
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,380
That seems like they can't or they would have to neuter it.

1413
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,380
I mean, I think they neuter it probably.

1414
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,380
Yeah, it's a ton of money.

1415
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:48,380
Yeah, the problem is there's no they still have to work out the Florida parks and then

1416
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:53,380
they just have to have room for like there's a Deadpool ride would people lose our minds.

1417
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,380
Sure.

1418
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,380
PG plus PG 13.

1419
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:02,380
How about you know, all of these rides, the one we're talking about has on board audio,

1420
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,380
right?

1421
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,380
Like you could presumably customize.

1422
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:13,380
Could you like press a button and show your ID to press the button to where you are accepting

1423
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,380
the R rated experience of like it's a different imagine.

1424
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,380
Yeah, I don't think that's a bad idea.

1425
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,380
It would be it's it would be very hard because I think even universal would be too skittish

1426
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:28,380
with stuff like that because, you know, you inevitably a mom and a five year old go on

1427
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,380
the ride and mom doesn't know what to hit.

1428
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,380
She's like, well, I'm older than 18 and she hits that and then yeah, dead.

1429
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:40,380
Well, the monsters after dark this year, there's cursing on this ride pools here.

1430
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:45,380
The funny is 95 percent of Deadpool comics are like PG PG 13.

1431
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:50,380
There's there's a handful of R rated Deadpool comics, but in the movies it's like, oh yeah,

1432
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,380
it's disgusting.

1433
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,380
It's filthy.

1434
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,380
What if it's like headphones that you put on only and then it's like such you have to

1435
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,380
sign like three consent forms to be sworn at.

1436
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:07,380
It's like there's so many checks and balances and then you get to hear the word shit said

1437
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,380
officially in a Disney park.

1438
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,380
Please shit taco.

1439
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,380
I mean, you got to gussy it up.

1440
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,380
You got to go to that thing that happens.

1441
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,380
I know I've not seen either of the movies all the way through.

1442
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:22,380
I have seen both of them and I can confirm that while shit taco I don't think appears

1443
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,380
directly, it is certainly in the same vein as the other jokes in Deadpool.

1444
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,380
I see.

1445
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,380
That's what you're seeing.

1446
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,380
So it's the way that people like Donald Trump is a douche nozzle.

1447
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,380
It's that kind of garbage.

1448
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,380
No.

1449
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,380
Yeah, I think I if I'd be less concerned about the profanities and more, if I could press

1450
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,380
a button, I'd press a button to where he doesn't get meta.

1451
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:46,380
If I could stop him from brain, I would only do a Deadpool ride experience where fourth

1452
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,380
walls remain intact.

1453
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,380
It's kind of trying to put a leash on a wild dog like Deadpool.

1454
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,380
That ain't happening.

1455
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,380
I guess this ride's not free.

1456
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,380
No, no, no.

1457
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,380
It's not a moral thing.

1458
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,380
It's a it's a comedy snobbery thing.

1459
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,380
Okay.

1460
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:08,380
I think I, I think there'll be a lot more Deadpool to come in all media and a ride,

1461
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,380
probably third park.

1462
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:14,380
What if California, you know, this is like actually if they let them do whatever they

1463
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:21,380
wanted, like some Deadpool somehow like taking over great moments with Mr. Lincoln and then

1464
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,380
like making a profane speech.

1465
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,380
I mean, that would be so much fun.

1466
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:34,380
It might have like fly in the 90s, but I feel like now so much of the crap we consume is

1467
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,380
like, well, what side are you on?

1468
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,380
The good side?

1469
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,380
The on the bands of what movie are you seeing opening week?

1470
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,380
You know, that sort of crap.

1471
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:47,380
It's like how Disney can now never remove the hall of presidents because there are

1472
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,380
good.

1473
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,380
Yes.

1474
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,380
Is politicized.

1475
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,380
It's our sacred good presidents.

1476
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:57,380
But can they have Deadpool run up and fart in every president's face?

1477
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,380
The Democrat or Republican or wig?

1478
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,380
Maybe.

1479
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,380
Hmm.

1480
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,380
How would he?

1481
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Just because we're blue sky here, how would the animatronic move from president to president?

1482
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,380
Ooh, I'm not sure.

1483
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,380
Maybe we don't have the technology for that.

1484
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,380
Or is it like a sophisticated hologram or is like a screen in front of the presidents

1485
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,380
that can dart around?

1486
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,380
It's a live actor.

1487
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:28,380
There is an actor whose job it is in every single show of the hall of presidents to fart

1488
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,380
on them, how hard in their faces.

1489
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,380
How about it's this?

1490
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:34,380
It's those robot stunt performers that they were testing at Disney and they sail one over

1491
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,380
the presidents, but he farts while he's flying.

1492
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,380
He unleashes kind of like a like a toxic fart spray.

1493
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:47,380
So he shoots out like a Batman six, a sixties Batman style colorful gas that spells the

1494
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,380
word fart or like rap for one of those Batman sound effect.

1495
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,380
He'll fly over the presidents crop dusting all of them essentially.

1496
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,380
And it'll be a Roy.

1497
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,380
So they'll just have to take the robot.

1498
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,380
They already have the technology and they'll just have to shoot, put a gas canister in

1499
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,380
its asshole.

1500
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,380
Yes.

1501
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,380
You know, technician every time we'll have to just like take like a spray paint can shake

1502
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,380
it up.

1503
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,380
Yeah.

1504
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,380
Just jam it up its butt and then like, okay, slap on the butt.

1505
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,380
You're ready to go.

1506
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,380
And then, yeah.

1507
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,380
So yeah, I think, I think Deadpool takeover.

1508
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,380
Maybe that's one of those late night events too, where Deadpool takes over a lot of the

1509
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,380
rides.

1510
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,380
The rare ride that is only open past midnight.

1511
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,380
So they have to extend the hours.

1512
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:35,380
But if you go to Disney, let's say Magic Kingdom past midnight, Deadpool is interrupting every

1513
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,380
single ride.

1514
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,380
Yeah, I went to, I went to Disney after dark.

1515
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,380
I went to the Star Wars one.

1516
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,380
I went to the nineties one.

1517
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:47,380
I went to the one where Deadpool farts everywhere and the only food they sell is chimichangas.

1518
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,380
That's what he likes.

1519
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,380
Right.

1520
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,380
Oh yeah.

1521
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,380
Like that.

1522
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,380
You know what it's like food.

1523
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,380
It just sounds funny.

1524
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,380
It just sounds.

1525
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,380
It's a funny sound.

1526
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:56,380
Spider-Man's fun.

1527
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,380
Spider-Man's fun.

1528
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,380
I think the jokes in this are like pretty good.

1529
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,380
There's some fourth wall jokes in Spider-Man.

1530
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,380
Should we go through, I guess the one thing we're missing is like actually stepping through

1531
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,380
the plot of the ride.

1532
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,380
Sure.

1533
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:13,380
The primary thing of which, I mean, I don't remember why you're there, but the overargue,

1534
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,380
the one line synopsis is that the Statue of Liberty is being stolen.

1535
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,380
Well, sure.

1536
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:25,380
Well, to answer your question, you are there to tour the Daily Bugle and see their new

1537
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,380
news gathering vehicle, the scoop, which is why it has satellites on the.

1538
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,380
That's why it's got satellites on it.

1539
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:37,380
And it is Daily Bugle, the newspaper, even though you're watching like New York one or

1540
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,380
something that's supposed to be New York one or something like that.

1541
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,380
And it's like, actually, we're watching the news van that picks up like public access,

1542
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,380
like local news stories.

1543
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:56,380
Now, the news van is also a news story that he it's like a big deal that J Jonah Jameson

1544
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,380
famously stingy invested in this news van.

1545
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,380
And it's important.

1546
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:08,380
I mean, there's a gag where like he makes Peter Parker, one of his photographers, talk

1547
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,380
about the scoop and he touches it.

1548
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,380
And then they usher him away and Windex it.

1549
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:17,380
And then there's a bunch of scoop scientists who they demonstrate how to improperly get

1550
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:20,380
in the ride vehicle and that how to properly get in the ride vehicle.

1551
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:25,380
That's really funny in the opening and the pre show animation where all of these stiff

1552
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:31,380
lab coated scientists then end up in traction and with casts like in the cover in their

1553
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,380
bodies and they're they're flying out of the vehicle and everything.

1554
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,380
That's a lot of fun.

1555
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:41,380
And also, and then the Jameson very dry simply refers to Spider-Man as there is to Peter

1556
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,380
Parker is that shutter bug.

1557
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,380
Yes.

1558
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,380
He's always calling him a shutter bug.

1559
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:52,380
Spider-Man is a menace or a vigilante, but he trusts us.

1560
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,380
We can go in there.

1561
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,380
Yes, we can go in patrons of the paper.

1562
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:01,380
The other thing is, I believe they imply that like, well, all of his reporters are scattered

1563
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:07,380
about the city trying to get a handle on this, but they know where it is now.

1564
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,380
There's been a sighting and so like we need somewhere out.

1565
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,380
We need people on the street.

1566
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,380
Okay, so you're getting in the news vehicle to help them gather the news.

1567
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,380
Okay.

1568
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:23,380
And they did not anticipate that you would end up in the crosshairs of the action.

1569
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,380
No, specifically in the way in the hideout.

1570
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:30,380
Like your very first thing is kind of going through the city and you find the secret hideout

1571
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,380
of the sinister syndicate.

1572
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,380
Yeah.

1573
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,380
So this is a whole thing.

1574
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,380
Yeah.

1575
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:41,380
It's not sinister six, which is a familiar title to sinister.

1576
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,380
Yeah, which we've talked about in the patron episode, but for some one specific reason.

1577
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:52,380
And usually within, okay, within the Marvel universe, there is both a sinister six and

1578
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,380
a sinister syndicate.

1579
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:59,380
The sinister six, usually a list villains, sinister syndicate, kind of like the B team

1580
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:03,380
of Spider-Man villains, but they have, again, rotating memberships.

1581
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,380
Oh, cause no green goblin.

1582
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,380
Yeah.

1583
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,380
So like this, there's no venom, there's no carnage, there's no green goblin.

1584
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,380
There are heavy hitters.

1585
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,380
Heavy hitters, doc, Ock, Electro.

1586
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,380
Do you think Electro was in an A list?

1587
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:19,380
I was trying to think who do you think is more A list Electro or shocker?

1588
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,380
Oh, electricity.

1589
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,380
You know what?

1590
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,380
Electro for sure.

1591
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,380
I think it's a list.

1592
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,380
I love shocker, but shocker is for sure B list.

1593
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,380
Okay.

1594
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,380
Electro.

1595
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,380
Yeah.

1596
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:32,380
Which one plugs the big plug into you and shakes your head.

1597
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,380
It's Electro.

1598
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,380
That's a crazy moment in the, it's like a little unpleasant in a way, but very scary

1599
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,380
and a neat moment in the ride.

1600
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:42,380
Hobgoblin in this ride instead of green goblin.

1601
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,380
Yes.

1602
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,380
Hobgoblin is like has his own interesting backstory that is very complicated, like any

1603
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:53,380
comic book character, but like green goblin is walking around the land.

1604
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,380
So yeah, right, right.

1605
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:59,380
But they, yeah, he's not on it's because I think they kind of picked which characters

1606
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:05,380
to use and which set pieces they were going to do because they would, if they had this,

1607
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,380
if it was the sinister six, they would have had to have a six villain because there's

1608
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,380
only five.

1609
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,380
Okay.

1610
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,380
And they wanted to pack this thing, which that's the thing I, that is very neat about

1611
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,380
this ride, that it's all of these villains all at once.

1612
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,380
It's like Batman 66.

1613
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:21,380
They didn't just choose one or two.

1614
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:22,380
Yes.

1615
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,380
All of them.

1616
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,380
They're all running rampant.

1617
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,380
Yeah.

1618
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:29,380
And around every, like every screen is devoted to a different one of these villains.

1619
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,380
It's, it's a very exciting.

1620
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,380
Yeah.

1621
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,380
Yeah.

1622
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:40,380
So it's electro doc, Havgoblin scream and Hydra man, Hydra man.

1623
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,380
Right.

1624
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,380
Yeah.

1625
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,380
Hydra man kind of an obvious, yeah.

1626
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,380
Water effects are easy to do.

1627
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,380
Um, sprayed in the w what's his, yeah, you get sprayed.

1628
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,380
He sprayed.

1629
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,380
Uh, he, well, that's a funny moment you guys, you, so you go through the hideout, you see

1630
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:00,380
the levitating pieces of statue of Liberty and then you kind of like encounter the villains

1631
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,380
one at a time until eventually doc, Oc levitates you.

1632
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,380
The first time you see Hydra man, you're in the sewers and spider man's like, all right,

1633
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:12,380
why don't you all just calm down, get back to the bugle and Hydra man rises up behind

1634
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,380
him and spider man tries to punch him a few times.

1635
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,380
Even though he's like a clear liquid thing.

1636
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,380
Yes.

1637
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,380
It was much bigger.

1638
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,380
Yeah.

1639
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,380
Yeah.

1640
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,380
Yeah.

1641
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,380
Uh, so, and he throws a pipe at you at the end of the ride, uh, spider man tricks electro

1642
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,380
into shocking Hydra man.

1643
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,380
So it just makes a giant explosion.

1644
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,380
Smart.

1645
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,380
That's very fun.

1646
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,380
I'm glad you're here to explain all this because I had never understood.

1647
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,380
I liked this ride a lot.

1648
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,380
I couldn't tell you the plot at all.

1649
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,380
I didn't know what happened in that pre show.

1650
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,380
I'm like, well, it doesn't matter.

1651
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,380
That stuff happens.

1652
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,380
Fireballs is great.

1653
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,380
Uh, do you think scoop and evac know each other?

1654
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,380
Oh, do you think they were an item?

1655
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,380
Oh, I didn't even, I didn't want to go that far, but yes, I do.

1656
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,380
Now that you say it.

1657
01:15:54,380 --> 01:16:02,380
Uh, well with six degrees of freedom on each, uh, who knows what, uh, what flurries their

1658
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,380
bodies could form into.

1659
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,380
Sure.

1660
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,380
Uh, transformers introduces the other, uh, transformers uses an elevator system.

1661
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:13,380
So you're kind of on two different levels in that spider man doesn't really do that.

1662
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,380
So we've acts on top.

1663
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,380
Well, all right.

1664
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,380
Save it for bansers.

1665
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:22,380
The answer is when the ride vehicles fucking.

1666
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,380
Uh, 13 screens, right?

1667
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,380
13 massive screens.

1668
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,380
Yeah.

1669
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:29,380
Kind of guy.

1670
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,380
Another technological thing of like, this is 1999 before like big blockbuster movies

1671
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,380
were on IMAX every weekend.

1672
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,380
True.

1673
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:42,380
And before there were like these like semi IMAX screens everywhere, like you had to go

1674
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,380
to a theme park to see these giant screens and a sort of boring thing, but a little interesting

1675
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:50,380
is how like the, the audio is big, uh, complicated thing with this ride.

1676
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:55,380
And there's a lot that's on board, but certain things just for realism had to sound like

1677
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:58,380
it's coming from the front or from the sides.

1678
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,380
And most times on a ride or in a movie theater, the speakers are behind the screen, but they

1679
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:06,380
had to use a different, they had these special kind of screen and the view wouldn't be able

1680
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,380
to hear the audio through it.

1681
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:12,380
So it was very tricky finding where to put all the speakers, uh, much like expedition

1682
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,380
Everest.

1683
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,380
Like it's, I think it's an underappreciated thing, like all the, the hidden speakers that

1684
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,380
are in every one of these rides.

1685
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,380
Yeah.

1686
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:24,380
I read somewhere that they, they, some of the speakers that they are by the screens,

1687
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,380
they're like in front of the screens and then they bounce the audio off like a vinyl piece

1688
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,380
of vinyl or something.

1689
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,380
That's crazy.

1690
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,380
Wow.

1691
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:37,380
And then there's that other odd thing about this where much of the set design in this

1692
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,380
ride is on canvas.

1693
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:44,380
It was printed onto canvas because with all of the technology going into the vehicle and

1694
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:49,380
the films themselves, uh, there was not a lot left over.

1695
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,380
Like it would, it would have taken forever and very, very expensive and complicated to

1696
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,380
like hand paint a lot of sets.

1697
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,380
Yeah.

1698
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:01,380
And plus it would look more comic booky and like you could literally take the assets from

1699
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,380
the film and print them out onto canvas.

1700
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,380
And that's what helps the seamlessness.

1701
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:12,380
You're like something that was rendered in CGI is just printed and next to you on beautiful

1702
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,380
film, like super, super quality canvas.

1703
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,380
Uh, I don't know.

1704
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,380
It's, it's, it's, it's very well done.

1705
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,380
It's very effective.

1706
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,380
Helps you feel like you're in an animated world.

1707
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,380
Yeah.

1708
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:26,380
And I mean like all the effects kind of were refreshed in 2012 to like the, I mean the

1709
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:34,380
how goblin explosion, him throwing a pumpkin bomb to an actual explosion above you is still

1710
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,380
like, it's still impressive.

1711
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,380
Unbelievable.

1712
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,380
And I didn't know that was coming the first time I went on it.

1713
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,380
So shocking.

1714
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,380
It's such a big explosion.

1715
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:43,380
It is so close to you.

1716
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:49,380
And if you watch the video, I kept looking up ride videos and watching that path from

1717
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:56,380
the movie, you're by this point, like leaving a room and watching a fireball that's digital

1718
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,380
perfectly.

1719
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,380
Like it's a, such a specific arc.

1720
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,380
Yeah.

1721
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:05,380
It throws it from the screen to become a real explosion going in the same direction in the

1722
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,380
room with you.

1723
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:10,380
I think this is like one of the best things that happens in any theme park ride anywhere.

1724
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,380
Yeah.

1725
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,380
And they re reuse it for transformers.

1726
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,380
They use that same thing with you get shot at.

1727
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,380
Oh, right.

1728
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,380
And in the ride.

1729
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,380
Yeah.

1730
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,380
I think it's the same thing where it's like, you're, it really messes with your brain.

1731
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,380
Yeah.

1732
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:27,380
The whole thing, by the way, just in general, the transitions are crazy.

1733
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:31,380
Like it is just watching a video of it or my memory of going on it.

1734
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,380
Like there are points.

1735
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:38,380
I mean, obviously you can tell where they happen, but it's insane how well the perspectives

1736
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,380
line up and that there are points where you bug out and you're like, Oh my God, this is

1737
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,380
a screen in front of me now.

1738
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,380
Like you, sir, you're a little late to it.

1739
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,380
Yeah.

1740
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,380
I think it's, it's so uncanny how well they did this.

1741
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,380
I'm Kenny.

1742
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:51,380
Excellent.

1743
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,380
Yeah.

1744
01:19:52,380 --> 01:20:00,380
It was so the first time we went on this, his 99, I think, and it's the summer, it

1745
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,380
opens.

1746
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:06,380
And I don't know the actual amount of time we waited, but I believe we waited at least

1747
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,380
three hours for this ride.

1748
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,380
Maybe it was only two.

1749
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,380
Maybe my memory is bad.

1750
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,380
Um, it was raining all day.

1751
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,380
I was not wearing socks.

1752
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:22,380
My feet soaked to the point of like bloating in my shoes.

1753
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,380
I've never seen this happen to my feet before or since.

1754
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:31,380
And we went on, I didn't realize how bad it was until after, but we went on the ride and

1755
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:37,380
we were all very wet and cranky before we went onto the ride and we left the ride and

1756
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:42,380
we were like, well, that was worth the whole, that was like, cause of all the things you're

1757
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:47,380
saying about it, uh, that it felt so worth three hours.

1758
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,380
It's crazy or what?

1759
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,380
Who knows two hours, but, but it felt some insane amount of time, but we like, we have

1760
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,380
to do this.

1761
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,380
It's the last thing of the day.

1762
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:00,380
And then I took my shoes off and it looked like my, it looked like just a big chunk of

1763
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,380
skin would fall off my foot.

1764
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,380
Oh, like it looked like, like it was so puffy.

1765
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,380
I was like, am I going to lose this?

1766
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,380
The bottom half of skin?

1767
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,380
I did not.

1768
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,380
That's funny.

1769
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,380
Cause my family, we waited like four hours for Gringotts.

1770
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,380
Like we were there opening summer.

1771
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,380
It was still three or four hour waits and it did poured rain that day.

1772
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:24,380
And we, I don't think any of us had your disgusting puffy feet, but we were definitely

1773
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:29,380
waiting in like wet clothes and wet shoes for a while.

1774
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:34,380
Um, again, I, who knows how the star, by the time this comes out, maybe we'll know

1775
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,380
how we're going to get reservations for star wars, but I am prepared to soak my feet to

1776
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,380
wait for star wars.

1777
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:44,380
If I have to, I will, but I, but it's going to open in the summer.

1778
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,380
So I don't know where you're soaking your feet unless you have to stand in a line where

1779
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:52,380
a sewer is broken or something, which I will, if there's an open sewer, I will stand in

1780
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,380
it.

1781
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,380
If you have to drink some of that water, okay.

1782
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,380
If you have to get a handshake from a British chick.

1783
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,380
I am willing to do almost anything to get into star wars land, even without rise of

1784
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,380
the resistance open on opening day.

1785
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,380
Uh, so yeah.

1786
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,380
It's going to be a song again.

1787
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,380
My family too, we were all in agreement.

1788
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,380
Like it wasn't my mom.

1789
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,380
I didn't lose dad either.

1790
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,380
Like everybody's on board.

1791
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,380
I don't remember.

1792
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:20,380
He doesn't always say like, Oh, what a great ride or anything like that.

1793
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,380
But I think he thought it was fine.

1794
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,380
I'll ask him after this.

1795
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,380
But I do remember my mom being very excited about it.

1796
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,380
And then I would take her on the transformer ride years later and she'd be like, that was

1797
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,380
too rough.

1798
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,380
I'd say, well, spider-man is exact same ride.

1799
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,380
And she'd be like, I don't remember it being like, well, it's transformers.

1800
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,380
I think has worse footage.

1801
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,380
It's darker.

1802
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,380
It's, it's a chaos.

1803
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,380
Those movies are chaos.

1804
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,380
It's so hard to tell what's going on.

1805
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:47,380
I think that's spider-man is so clear what the action is.

1806
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,380
Yeah.

1807
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,380
Yeah.

1808
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,380
It's like big, bold colors.

1809
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,380
I find the transformers to be like a much.

1810
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,380
Even darkened it a little like it was a little more florescent.

1811
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:59,380
I kind of miss how florescent the colors were in the original version compared to the more

1812
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:06,380
like darker movie aesthetic and say spider-man's costume or doc doc doc's got the duster on

1813
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,380
like it's my red too.

1814
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:12,380
But yeah, I think it's, it might be partly a trick.

1815
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:17,380
Maybe, but I think she would just, she felt like she doesn't like doing star tours anymore.

1816
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,380
So I don't think she was.

1817
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,380
That's fair.

1818
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,380
I do think it's clear what the action is and star and spider-man then transformers.

1819
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,380
Although those transformers, I was just on this ride a couple of months ago.

1820
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,380
They are letting that thing get dark.

1821
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,380
That screen is dark.

1822
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:34,380
I remember a few years ago because I was way, I was way into it.

1823
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:39,380
I would pop up the universal just to do it and leave a couple of times that summer.

1824
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,380
Cause I had annual pass and that screen was much brighter than it is now.

1825
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:47,380
I think there's this whole, I've maybe mentioned on the show a little bit, but I,

1826
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:52,380
I think this is even something, another episode pitch something we can chart here and there.

1827
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:55,380
I, I, I've, I've been thinking about like MVP rides.

1828
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:58,380
What is the best ride in the world when it opens?

1829
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,380
I think this might've been one at some point.

1830
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:06,380
I think transformers might've been high on the list, but maybe less so now because there are better,

1831
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:12,380
like better rides of open sense, but also just it itself, the quality is as diminished.

1832
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:17,380
More endearing characters on more recent rides too.

1833
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,380
Like the transformer.

1834
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:27,380
Yeah. I mean, I will, I do like the end when Optimus prime talks to you, but I don't have the warmth for him that I do for Spiderman.

1835
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:28,380
I don't have the warmth.

1836
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,380
I think Evac is endearing cause he's another character trying his best.

1837
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:36,380
I want to say on record, I do respect Optimus prime.

1838
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,380
He does not have an easy job.

1839
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,380
Thank God.

1840
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,380
There was no confusion about that.

1841
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,380
I just want that written down.

1842
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,380
Well, you've also have respect cause he's respectful to you.

1843
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,380
He really leans in.

1844
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:56,380
He gives you what I like on rides is he gives you a good two to three seconds of a moment to sit with them, which is what I like in star tours.

1845
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:02,380
When the new one three PO gives us a couple like a second to sink in that we're part of the rebel Alliance.

1846
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:06,380
Now I also like that character actor who's the general in the transformers queue.

1847
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,380
I forget his name.

1848
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,380
He shows up and a lot of plays Landry's dad on Friday night.

1849
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,380
I knew you were going to say I knew he was a friend.

1850
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,380
There was some sort of connection.

1851
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,380
He's in a bunch of stuff too, though.

1852
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,380
I can't think of his name.

1853
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,380
So yeah.

1854
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:24,380
So Optimus prime tells you so Spiderman doesn't ever quite have a serious moment with you where you feel important.

1855
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,380
Do you does that make your favorite themed entertainment character smokey the bear?

1856
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,380
Is he always pointing at you?

1857
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,380
I certainly like him.

1858
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:36,380
McGruff also points at me and I like him to mean these has commands for you.

1859
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,380
I like that.

1860
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,380
He's right.

1861
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,380
I don't want to correct me now.

1862
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:50,380
Like smokey is I listen up Spiderman at the beginning of the ride jumps on your ride vehicle.

1863
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,380
You feel the bounce and it's great.

1864
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:58,380
When he says like this is the most dangerous night of my life and maybe you and yours, but he's still being like funny.

1865
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,380
He's like it.

1866
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,380
He's a little serious.

1867
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,380
I'm going to be more sincere.

1868
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,380
You just love this Optimus.

1869
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:08,380
You feel like seen and loved and like you're seated at the right hand of God.

1870
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,380
I guess I think that's right.

1871
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,380
I think you're right about that argument where Spiderman's warning you.

1872
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:16,380
But you secretly he's like, well, a little help would be good.

1873
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,380
I mean, that's funny.

1874
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,380
Yeah, that's the character.

1875
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,380
He's hanging down upside down.

1876
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,380
He takes your picture and everything.

1877
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,380
Mike doesn't like that.

1878
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,380
He wants he doesn't want him to be funny.

1879
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:28,380
I'm not saying I want Spiderman to change his character because that wouldn't be right for him to do.

1880
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:40,380
But I'm just saying it is nice when a serious person that I respect like Jason who's in charge tells me that I did a good job and he lets me sit with it while he stares at me for a couple seconds.

1881
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,380
But there's like I feel like this is the one example of this.

1882
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,380
Can you name more C3PO?

1883
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,380
He's a serious person.

1884
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,380
He doesn't tell me.

1885
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:51,380
But he doesn't expect you respect C3.

1886
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,380
I respect him.

1887
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,380
But it's not quite the same situation.

1888
01:26:54,380 --> 01:27:03,380
But and Star Tours, once we get the transmission from whether it's BB-8 or Maz Kanata or Princess Leia, he turns and he has a couple different things he says.

1889
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:11,380
But one of them is he says something to the effect of looks like we've all just joined the Rebel Alliance and we kind of sit there for a moment in the middle of the ride.

1890
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,380
And it is a serious moment.

1891
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,380
It's not played for his usual laughs or his head got torn off or something.

1892
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,380
It's not.

1893
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,380
I like that.

1894
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:30,380
I like it in the middle of the ride or at the end of the ride when you have to sit with a serious beat for and they get I would like it for like 30 seconds, but they give you what feels like a substantial time in like the time frame of the ride.

1895
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,380
So C3PO said I love you.

1896
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,380
And then and then you just looked into each other's eyes for 30 seconds.

1897
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:42,380
If he says it to me, will that be like a second Rebel spy where he'll choose a different way to cut?

1898
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,380
Well, I mean, I think the cleanest thing is you're the spy.

1899
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,380
I'm the spy every time.

1900
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:51,380
Well, you're gonna have to make an arrangement with Disney where you're always a rebel spy.

1901
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:56,380
But the rebel spy also C3PO finds you, points you out and says, I love you.

1902
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,380
You did a good job.

1903
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:02,380
I think that would be fantastic because I do think this is everybody else.

1904
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,380
But yeah, but that's the I love you the most.

1905
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,380
I love you the most.

1906
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,380
Yeah, I think that'd be good.

1907
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,380
You can find a way where he says it more generally and you feel like it's to you.

1908
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,380
How about Optimus Prime?

1909
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,380
They combine the ET technology and then have all this.

1910
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,380
We had this I love you thing to it.

1911
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:21,380
So he's like, you did well out there recruits.

1912
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,380
Jason, I love you.

1913
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,380
And then he goes person by person in the car and it's newer technology.

1914
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,380
So he's very clear.

1915
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,380
And then he says I love you to everyone in the car.

1916
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,380
Everyone would feel great.

1917
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:39,380
But yeah, but that that was a big backup behind the car while it pauses at that point.

1918
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:44,380
OK, well, there's going to have to expand the ride then and all the cars, there'll be like six different things.

1919
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,380
They'll split off.

1920
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:50,380
So the car will split off into different sections with Optimus Prime.

1921
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,380
And it'll be easier for loading is what I'm saying.

1922
01:28:52,380 --> 01:29:04,380
What if it's after the ride and you just you get to like enter a room like a like a like a confession with a priest or like you're like, you know, seeing a dying person for the last time.

1923
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,380
And they give you a moment.

1924
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,380
Maybe you'd like a moment alone.

1925
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,380
And well, that's good.

1926
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:14,380
I thought you were going to go with like in a confession and then the little thing opens on the side and it's Optimus Prime's eyes.

1927
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,380
You're not sure who it is back there.

1928
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:20,380
There's anonymity, but I'm feeling it's Optimus Prime.

1929
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:26,380
How long has it been since you rescued the All Spark?

1930
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:30,380
Say four hail bumblebees.

1931
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:31,380
I think that's good too.

1932
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,380
I like all of this.

1933
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:35,380
Sing four of his fun boogie songs.

1934
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:39,380
He's always play his boogie Psalms.

1935
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:43,380
So you want you need more.

1936
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,380
Do you consider the Indiana Jones end beat to be in this genre?

1937
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:51,380
No, I ride a heart to hearts is what you know.

1938
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,380
That's too.

1939
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,380
He's been funny and he's been flipping.

1940
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:54,380
You're not.

1941
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,380
You don't want.

1942
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,380
All right.

1943
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,380
This is the thing I'm just saying.

1944
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,380
The thing I specifically like is not funny.

1945
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,380
I'm going to do.

1946
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:06,380
Yeah, but I'm going to say serious Spider-Man sometimes sucks at dealing with his clone.

1947
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:10,380
I went back and I said before, I don't necessarily think he should say something serious.

1948
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,380
You're looking for your you don't want to throw other things out.

1949
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:19,380
You're fine with the Spider-Man moment, but you want other moments and rides where a serious character.

1950
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:26,380
Yeah, something nice like they tried a few years ago to do Dark Knight Returns in the Spider-Man comics.

1951
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,380
And I think it's called the last will and testament.

1952
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:35,380
And the crux of it is a very old Peter Parker has to come out of retirement like in the Frank Miller comic.

1953
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:52,380
But he goes to Mary Jane's grave and reveals that due to the radioactive nature of spider bite and his powers, all of his fluids, all of his bodily fluids were toxic.

1954
01:30:52,380 --> 01:31:00,380
So if I have a wife that you have relations with, he gave Mary Jane not powers, but like cancer.

1955
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:03,380
He killed Mary Jane by loving her.

1956
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,380
Jesus, this is a mini.

1957
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,380
This is a Spider-Man mini series.

1958
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:09,380
I and it is it's insane.

1959
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,380
It's one of the things.

1960
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:18,380
So I want an overlay for the Spider-Man ride in Florida where he explains to you that he gave his wife my blood.

1961
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,380
We're all sick.

1962
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,380
Hey fellow wall crawlers.

1963
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,380
Guess what?

1964
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:29,380
I gave my wife cancer with in our marital bed.

1965
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,380
Don't share a drink after me.

1966
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:37,380
I don't even know.

1967
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:43,380
All our organs and I'm not talking about HPV, but get that new vaccine.

1968
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,380
True believers.

1969
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,380
I don't know what that run.

1970
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:48,380
That's that's a weird.

1971
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,380
That was I.

1972
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,380
Yeah, I don't look that up.

1973
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,380
I don't get out.

1974
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,380
Yeah, I.

1975
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,380
Oh boy.

1976
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,380
What have we missed?

1977
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,380
Probably toxic semen.

1978
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,380
Semen got him giving Mary Jane cancer.

1979
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:08,380
The love making sexually exchanged cancer juice.

1980
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,380
We've got character heart to hearts.

1981
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,380
I don't know.

1982
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,380
The free falls.

1983
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,380
Cool.

1984
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,380
Okay.

1985
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:17,380
Yeah.

1986
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:20,380
So maybe one of the best endings for a ride ever.

1987
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,380
Doc.

1988
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,380
Oc levitates you specifically.

1989
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,380
They're fighting.

1990
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,380
You're fighting about the city.

1991
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,380
Doc.

1992
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,380
Oc levitates you.

1993
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,380
I have his dialogue right here.

1994
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:36,380
I always thought this was very clever for theme park script writing.

1995
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,380
Spider-Man says Doc, your aims worse than your haircut.

1996
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:43,380
Spider-Man knocks him out of the way and he goes, it's good enough for your sitting duck friends.

1997
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:47,380
And he zaps you with the, the levitation ray.

1998
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:50,380
You start to rise up above the city.

1999
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:58,380
Spider-Man tries to web you down and pulls you throughout the city because Hobgoblin's like pulling him along in the glider and then Doc.

2000
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,380
Oc reverses it.

2001
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:02,380
So you start to free fall.

2002
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:07,380
You're only free falling about like like I saw 10 inches.

2003
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,380
It's crazy.

2004
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,380
Is that all it is?

2005
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,380
That's all it is.

2006
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,380
But the walls are moving.

2007
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:15,380
The footage is moving and it truly feels like you're falling out of the sky.

2008
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,380
That effect.

2009
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,380
Yeah.

2010
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,380
Especially.

2011
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:21,380
I mean, now it's, I can, I'm not as panicky on rides.

2012
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:24,380
But at the time, yeah, it was like felt like you were falling.

2013
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,380
Like I was so impressed.

2014
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,380
It's a massive and I'm a little scared drops.

2015
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,380
So like, oh God, oh God.

2016
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,380
All right.

2017
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,380
Well, it's cool looking and you were not.

2018
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:39,380
And one of the main designers of the ride is like, I know exactly how I know how it works better than anybody.

2019
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:41,380
And it still bugs me out every single time.

2020
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,380
Yeah.

2021
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:47,380
And again, another thing where they just stole this for the Spider-Man ride, the exact same ending.

2022
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,380
Transformers.

2023
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,380
Oh yeah.

2024
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,380
Sorry.

2025
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,380
She's losing my mind.

2026
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,380
Okay.

2027
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,380
The heart to hearts.

2028
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,380
To go back to that.

2029
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,380
Sure.

2030
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:01,380
Would you accept the villain heart to heart where a bad person says, I was defeated at your hands.

2031
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:04,380
You have bested me and I salute you for it.

2032
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:08,380
I think that I'm about to die because of you.

2033
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,380
Well, I mean, that would be, I mean, that's a little bit of a bummer.

2034
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:22,380
I would think like Doc Ock kind of telling me a quick sob story about his life and why he got here and then how he's going to give it all up and turn to a life of heroism, heroism and not crime.

2035
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:23,380
I think that'd be nice.

2036
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,380
You want to give him redemption.

2037
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:27,380
I will change my ways because of you, Mike.

2038
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,380
I think that would be fantastic.

2039
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:54,380
You get a lot more like, no, like when Poseidon defeats the evil Lord Darkanon in the other islet, the adventure ride Poseidon's fury Poseidon's fury or journey to Atlanta, whatever that one day, one day we'll get to talk about all the different versions that it's just so like we do it every time my family goes to universal.

2040
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,380
And I think we always do it once.

2041
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:03,380
That's not a rewrite, but I just as a kid, like as I've grown up, like how many times has this story changed?

2042
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:15,380
Like, so, so for you, Poseidon looking you in the eye and saying there were a lot of people, well, there's like 300 people in this show, something like that come in every 20 minutes.

2043
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:22,380
But you Jason helped me defeat Darkanon Lord, the evil Lord Darkanon.

2044
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,380
Oh, beloved character.

2045
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,380
We all know it love from this.

2046
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:27,380
Uh, well from week.

2047
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:31,380
This is the public domain island and we got to get this park open.

2048
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,380
What if, okay.

2049
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:46,380
So say we're in the Ogas Cantina and you're having a drink, Scott, and all of a sudden Rex goes and he points at you and he goes, I'm here because friends like you and friends like you have kept me alive in their memories.

2050
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,380
Scott.

2051
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:56,380
As long as, as long as I could toast a glass of, I don't remember the name of the, I don't remember the name of the white wine.

2052
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,380
Yeah.

2053
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,380
Yeah.

2054
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:00,380
Whatever that Padme white is.

2055
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,380
Yeah.

2056
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:07,380
I mean, you know, he could, she could do or Rex could have a Imperial red cab sav.

2057
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,380
I forget if I'm getting that right or not.

2058
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:14,380
But he's having the white blend from the planet that no longer exists anymore.

2059
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:15,380
Yeah.

2060
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,380
It's great.

2061
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,380
So old that they aren't even grown.

2062
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,380
Rex says like, this was a bringer show.

2063
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:27,380
And by you being here, you helped me reach the 10 people that I had to get tonight to get a drink ticket.

2064
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,380
I'm getting 20 space bucks.

2065
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,380
Cause of you.

2066
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:33,380
Yeah, that would be great.

2067
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,380
Yeah.

2068
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,380
Like that.

2069
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:36,380
Yes.

2070
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,380
I know.

2071
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,380
Now I understand.

2072
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,380
That's the, that's the idea.

2073
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:44,380
If he put all three of his claws on me, on my shoulders.

2074
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,380
He's got his little air horn at you.

2075
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,380
What's that?

2076
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,380
Then he shot his little air horn.

2077
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,380
Oh yeah.

2078
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,380
Hey, hey Scott, this one's for you.

2079
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:54,380
But I can't wait for the, Oh boy.

2080
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,380
Rex has got an air.

2081
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,380
Was there any way to make me like Rex more?

2082
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,380
Give them an air.

2083
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:05,380
So end of the Spider-Man ride to after Spider-Man pops down, takes your picture.

2084
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:08,380
You get to see a little, a fun little joke.

2085
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:11,380
The beam is aimed in the bugle office.

2086
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:14,380
Now specifically J Jota Jameson's office.

2087
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,380
And he's like stuck flying on the ceiling and stuff.

2088
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,380
And that's very fun.

2089
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:24,380
And they play the rock and roll rock and roll kind of version of the Spider-Man theme song,

2090
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:28,380
which I am always a sucker for rock and roll covers of that song.

2091
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:34,380
Well, I also kudos to the Marvel cinematic universe for using the Spider-Man theme and like an orchestra.

2092
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,380
It's not the rock and roll version, which is better.

2093
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:39,380
But they use like an orchestrated version of the Spider-Man song.

2094
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,380
Yeah.

2095
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:43,380
Which they'd Rami versions and the other versions did not.

2096
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:44,380
Yeah.

2097
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:52,380
The Rami version stressed me out because it was so much about Peter Parker's problems and there wasn't as much funny Spider-Man.

2098
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:56,380
And then I never saw the Andrew Garfield one, so I can't speak to those.

2099
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,380
But hey, a lot more Nickelback.

2100
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,380
A lot more Nickelback.

2101
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,380
Yeah.

2102
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,380
That's the only, that's the way you get me on this room.

2103
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:04,380
Lead singer of C.

2104
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,380
C.

2105
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,380
Yeah, we, I think, no, I still think that's not it.

2106
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,380
I think we, we did this before on the show.

2107
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:11,380
Have we done that already?

2108
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:13,380
Is it Nickelback or is it just Chad Kroger?

2109
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:14,380
It's just saliva.

2110
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,380
It's saliva.

2111
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,380
Is it just Chad Kroger?

2112
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,380
It's just Chad Kroger.

2113
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:23,380
Nickelback was only going to hold him back from the heights of greatness that he achieved with Hero.

2114
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:28,380
But that was like towards the end of like album sales and singles.

2115
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,380
Like he probably made a fortune on that, right?

2116
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,380
I would imagine.

2117
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,380
I would think.

2118
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:40,380
I mean, creatively though, like, you know, that fucking dumb ass Nickelback bass player was going to ruin his vision if he didn't fly solo.

2119
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,380
I see. Yeah.

2120
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:47,380
He, he like Spider-Man had to take matters into his own hands to save the world with music.

2121
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,380
Hero can save us, vindicate it.

2122
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,380
Was there a third song?

2123
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,380
I don't remember the song from the third movie.

2124
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,380
I don't think there was a big hit.

2125
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,380
Did they just call it?

2126
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:58,380
I don't know if there was a big hit.

2127
01:38:58,380 --> 01:38:59,380
Spider-Man Shuffle.

2128
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,380
I think Will Smith did one.

2129
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,380
Oh, only.

2130
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,380
That's what he's dancing to.

2131
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,380
A little tale that I'd like to spin.

2132
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,380
Does he have a song in Aladdin?

2133
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:12,380
I mean, he has a friend like me, but he should have his own rap song in Aladdin.

2134
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,380
Should be a new genie rap that Will Smith does.

2135
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:16,380
Probably not.

2136
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,380
The answer is no.

2137
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,380
They can't go off script.

2138
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:21,380
Well, yeah, they should throw a whole new world in the garbage and he should.

2139
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:22,380
Fine.

2140
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,380
That trailer came out today.

2141
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,380
He's both blue and not blue in it.

2142
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,380
Apparently I haven't watched it yet.

2143
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:30,380
Well, they added the, the rumor is they added the blue late because people went, why the hell isn't he blue?

2144
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,380
He was never going to be blue.

2145
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,380
So like there's a couple of scenes where they added him being blue.

2146
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,380
But as I pointed out on Twitter, the main thing that they brought to this film is that Aladdin says, really?

2147
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,380
The G makes Aladdin like levitate towards Jasmine to go talk to her.

2148
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,380
Really?

2149
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:57,380
This is what Aladdin, you know, that cartoon's okay, I guess, but I want, but it's what it's missing is 13 years after the fact, Jim Halpert moments.

2150
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:03,380
I mean, if, if Iago could say that's not even a thing, I would like that.

2151
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:05,380
It's not even a thing.

2152
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,380
Is Iago in the movie?

2153
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,380
You think he's gone?

2154
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,380
I didn't see him in the trailer.

2155
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,380
Is Abu?

2156
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,380
Abu's in it for sure.

2157
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:15,380
But Abu cut from the stage version California Adventure.

2158
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:16,380
Famously, yes.

2159
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,380
Famously cut.

2160
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:20,380
The carpet or real ham though in the stage version.

2161
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,380
In the movie version too.

2162
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,380
You know what?

2163
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,380
That's when the movie, when is this movie coming out?

2164
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,380
Is it in a week or something?

2165
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,380
Or is it in?

2166
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:28,380
I don't know when this episode comes out.

2167
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,380
Sorry to say.

2168
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:30,380
Dumbo's coming out too.

2169
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,380
Dumbo's coming out soon, but is Aladdin coming out soon?

2170
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:34,380
Cause we should do California Adventure ride.

2171
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,380
Or maybe.

2172
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,380
Yeah.

2173
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,380
Yeah.

2174
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,380
We have.

2175
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,380
So we're getting a lot of our internal business done on today's show.

2176
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,380
Yeah.

2177
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:44,380
Including showing you an old video I found of you.

2178
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,380
A lot of inside baseball stuff here.

2179
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,380
It's insular.

2180
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:52,380
Now we have to deliver on this promise of a dry tomorrow, sincere tomorrow land.

2181
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,380
Yes.

2182
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,380
Crying tomorrow land.

2183
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:55,380
I think we can knock it out of the park.

2184
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,380
I think that's fine.

2185
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,380
Yeah.

2186
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,380
It's all going to be great.

2187
01:40:58,380 --> 01:40:59,380
There's a Stanley cameo.

2188
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,380
There's multiple.

2189
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:01,380
There's a bunch.

2190
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:02,380
Yeah.

2191
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,380
I think they gained more when they redid it.

2192
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,380
The one at the, I'm talking about the one at the end.

2193
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,380
What is the one?

2194
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,380
Well, there's the one he's driving the garbage truck.

2195
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:13,380
That's a new, that's in the new one.

2196
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:15,380
I'm confused by which cameo.

2197
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:18,380
And he's soliciting a hooker on the streets of New York.

2198
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,380
He's buying crack from someone.

2199
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:24,380
If anyone asks, my name is Steve Ditko.

2200
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:25,380
Steve Ditko.

2201
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,380
Excelsior.

2202
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,380
Uh, Spider-Man.

2203
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:29,380
I don't remember why.

2204
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,380
Yeah.

2205
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:34,380
So there's the truck one that's earlier, but they've added a little voiceover with him

2206
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,380
in the new ending.

2207
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:36,380
And I'm trying to remember what it was.

2208
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:40,380
And I think there's a picture of him in the bullpen on his desk in tribute after he passed

2209
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:41,380
away.

2210
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:45,380
Um, and he's like, I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to go to the park and I'm

2211
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,380
going to go to the park and I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to go to the park

2212
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,380
and I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to go to the

2213
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:50,380
park and I'm going to go to the park.

2214
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:51,380
Yeah.

2215
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,380
So I don't know if he's a, a, a, um, yeah, I don't know that there's any Ditko tribute

2216
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:55,380
Scott.

2217
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,380
This is,

2218
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,380
there is a, there is, there is a creator in the, I forget this part in the office.

2219
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,380
They have mentions of, there's a lot.

2220
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:03,380
I mean, they're filing cabinets where all of the names on the filing cabinets are like

2221
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:04,380
Mark Gargan.

2222
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:07,380
Or who's like the Scorpion, Mac Gargan.

2223
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,380
Gargan.

2224
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,380
Yeah.

2225
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:14,380
Um, and then like all the filing cabinets of like, you know, silver sable through x-men.

2226
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:19,380
And then there's the trophy case, uh, has like all the universal creative names on it.

2227
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,380
Yeah.

2228
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:25,380
The hidden Mickey is obviously very common, but the hidden Mac Gargan can only be found

2229
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:27,380
on the Spider-Man ride.

2230
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:30,380
Uh, Mac Gargan in the newer movies too, right?

2231
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,380
Yeah, I think so.

2232
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,380
I think he was one of the henchmen.

2233
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:33,380
He's a, he's played by the game.

2234
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,380
He plays Nacho on better call Saul.

2235
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,380
Oh, yeah.

2236
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,380
I believe he's good.

2237
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,380
Uh, he's good.

2238
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,380
Uh, Steve Ditko.

2239
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:40,380
I, that's a big hole.

2240
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,380
I, I'm fascinated to see if they reissue a lot of that stuff.

2241
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:49,380
Steve Ditko, like never like let this thing did some work for Marvel and DC in the seventies

2242
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:55,380
and eighties, but kept making self published comics until he died last year, two years

2243
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,380
ago.

2244
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,380
He died the same year that Stan died.

2245
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,380
Yeah.

2246
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:01,380
Which is crazy because they were both so old at that point.

2247
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:04,380
He was just making black and white weird comics.

2248
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:08,380
Like he was a weird guy kind of into object, uh, objectivism.

2249
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,380
Is that the term?

2250
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:11,380
Like, uh, I don't know.

2251
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,380
No, no, no.

2252
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,380
Like really weird.

2253
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:17,380
We're still obsessed with like hands and eyes, like in the early Spider-Man comics.

2254
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:18,380
And it was kind of mad.

2255
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,380
Kind of mad.

2256
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:24,380
I think he was very mad about if you hand wrote him a letter, it was likely he would

2257
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:25,380
write you back.

2258
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:26,380
Right.

2259
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,380
So like you could tell him like, Hey, you inspired me.

2260
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,380
You're Spider-Man.

2261
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:32,380
And he would write you something nice, but I think he was very famously mad at Marvel

2262
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:37,380
and yeah, kind of a crank mad at Stan like everybody was.

2263
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:41,380
And he built his own janky ride just in a field somewhere.

2264
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:45,380
You'd have to call him and he'd show up and you could, he'd take you on it.

2265
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,380
He'd unlock the barn where he built it.

2266
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:48,380
Yeah.

2267
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,380
Just like push a wheelbarrow around.

2268
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,380
Sure.

2269
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,380
All the characters are about weird or all the characters in that ride are weird little

2270
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,380
freaks.

2271
01:43:55,380 --> 01:44:01,380
Just like all the first 40 Spider-Man comics where everyone is hideously ugly or like an

2272
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,380
outcast from society.

2273
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,380
You just stop and stare at a hand for a good 30 seconds.

2274
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,380
30 seconds or so.

2275
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,380
It's closer to your dream of a ride.

2276
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,380
Yeah.

2277
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,380
Still moments.

2278
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,380
I also believe we shouldn't.

2279
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:17,380
I don't know what the facts are.

2280
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:21,380
Jack Kirby then after a while claimed that he actually created Spider-Man.

2281
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:28,380
There's a whole controversy because Stan and Jack, you know, people say, you know, Jack

2282
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:33,380
may did like 80%, 90% of the work and Stan did 10 and took credit or whatever.

2283
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:35,380
Especially by the end of Fantastic Four.

2284
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:37,380
I think he was right a lot and stuff.

2285
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:41,380
But then there's other creators that like were there and don't say that's what happened.

2286
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:45,380
But then Jack sort of by the end of his life was saying like, go and Stan didn't do it.

2287
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,380
He just created Spider-Man 2 and it's very unclear.

2288
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:52,380
Like no one was keeping good records of these things or it was literally just like guys

2289
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:56,380
like, hey, you need to create a whole new thing that's going to be a giant hit in 50

2290
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,380
years.

2291
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,380
Can you do it by three o'clock today?

2292
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:01,380
And it'd be like, I guess I was smoking and then, okay, here you go.

2293
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,380
Here's a Spider-Man.

2294
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,380
Here's a character that will endure the test of time.

2295
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:08,380
You'll make multiple movies and TV shows out of him.

2296
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:10,380
I just knocked it out before I got to go home.

2297
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,380
Just shitting them out.

2298
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,380
Yeah.

2299
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,380
Yeah.

2300
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:15,380
Pretty amazing.

2301
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:22,380
Well, you can, everyone can go and enjoy Jack Kirby's shit out drawings in a high tech

2302
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,380
environment.

2303
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:25,380
What have we missed?

2304
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,380
We covered a lot of ground.

2305
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:30,380
Almost as much ground as the giant acreage of this very ride.

2306
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:31,380
This is one of the biggest ride buildings.

2307
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:33,380
I feel like on that property.

2308
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,380
Yeah.

2309
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:35,380
Massive.

2310
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:36,380
Yeah.

2311
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:40,380
I have, I have a fun thing at the end that's Spider-Man related, but maybe not this ride

2312
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,380
related.

2313
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:42,380
Okay.

2314
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,380
Great.

2315
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,380
Are we there?

2316
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,380
We might be.

2317
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,380
I guess.

2318
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,380
We can be done for a while.

2319
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,380
Yeah, we can be good.

2320
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:49,380
Here's the thing I would say.

2321
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:56,380
So I know we talked about like universal express kind of, kind of implemented after the fact,

2322
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:01,380
like kind of wonky like stuff retrofitted for fast pass.

2323
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:03,120
The queue for this is great.

2324
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:06,340
Like going through the daily bugle offices, all of that.

2325
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:11,940
So if it's a short wait and you, you do have express pass, try both go through the express

2326
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:14,380
line and then just go through the standby line.

2327
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:18,720
Cause I realized like what looking through queue video is like, Oh yeah, I haven't been

2328
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,240
in that room with the little scoop.

2329
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,300
There's a model of the car you're about to get into.

2330
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,700
And then there's a big projector screens showing some different cartoon segments.

2331
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:28,700
Yeah, that's great.

2332
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,500
And see those file cabinets.

2333
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,340
I think those are in the express line now.

2334
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:38,020
I'm not sure how they very large extended queue to, which they had to utilize early,

2335
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,020
early on.

2336
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,020
Right.

2337
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:45,740
Cause I remember waiting a lot outside that first year, like most of it outside, which

2338
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,980
I don't know where that went, but yeah, I looked up the touring plans for like mid March,

2339
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,580
their crowd estimates and they were like, yeah, early in the day, probably five minute

2340
01:46:54,580 --> 01:47:00,500
wait height of the crowds, 60 minutes starting to get in the spring break season, but still

2341
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:03,980
not very long for like a still grade a attraction.

2342
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:06,940
The last two times I went, yeah, we were, I mean, I think we had expressed cause we

2343
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:10,860
were staying on site, but it was still like the regular time was 20 minutes, 20, 30 minutes.

2344
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:12,860
So what do you got?

2345
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:16,200
We're going to do, I was, I want, I have a plea, I have a question for the audience

2346
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,260
real quick and then I'll play this thing.

2347
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,060
We're going to do a lot more Marvel stuff.

2348
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:26,020
We've talked about it, talked about doing that.

2349
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:31,340
But I just, if anyone out there has seen pictures from a Marvel theme park that we're going

2350
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:36,300
to build in Dubai, like a decade ago, they're the greatest pictures.

2351
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:40,060
They really seem like they would have lived up to my expectations of a Marvel park.

2352
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:44,880
There's pictures of like a crazy time square with what looks maybe like Doc OX tentacles

2353
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,480
coming out and daredevils over here on a billboard.

2354
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:53,560
And it's very kind of cartoonish, but not in the way that the islands of adventure is.

2355
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:57,400
It's like, it's like a crazy, it's a little warped version of reality, but it's cool.

2356
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:00,160
And it looks like if they built it, they would be awesome.

2357
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,820
And there's expense mansion stuff and whatever.

2358
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:09,040
If anyone out there in the audience knows about this gives us, it has any secret information,

2359
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,400
please message us.

2360
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,400
Marvel Dubai.

2361
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,840
Marvel Dubai theme park.

2362
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
And you'll see the pictures if you don't know what I'm talking about.

2363
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,360
But if you do know what you're talking about and you have more info.

2364
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:26,000
Yes, please just email us at podcast, the ride at Gmail or DM us on Twitter or something.

2365
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,480
Because it says it was, there was these sketches were made by a place called Chimera designs,

2366
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,480
I believe.

2367
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,120
And I think if I click on that, that website doesn't exist.

2368
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,120
I think that is gone.

2369
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,820
I don't know if it exists anymore.

2370
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:37,820
Maybe it does.

2371
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:40,000
It's another name or something.

2372
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,600
So yeah, message us because we want to do something on this.

2373
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,800
At the very least, I want some secret information, please.

2374
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,840
Yeah, for us to immediately make not secret.

2375
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,040
Yeah, I mean, we will keep it secret if we have to.

2376
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,800
You can pick and choose what you tell us.

2377
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,280
Yeah, we're very good about that.

2378
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,920
So if you have any information on that, please let us know because I would love to do something

2379
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,000
with it.

2380
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,440
But now here's, I don't know, I'm sure I've played this for you guys.

2381
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,120
This is one of my favorite Spider-Man things.

2382
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:11,120
Okay, so this is not directly real Spider-Man related.

2383
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:17,080
So there's an album that I did not know about until a year or two ago.

2384
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:18,480
And it is like a narrative.

2385
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,480
It's like a story.

2386
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,800
Spider-Man gets its own story.

2387
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,360
It's not based on like a TV show or anything.

2388
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:28,600
But there's a theme sung by this man, Ron Dante, who sang the Archie's hit sugar sugar

2389
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,120
and all the other Archie songs.

2390
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,160
And then he does Spider-Man's voice.

2391
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,800
Have I played this for you before?

2392
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,040
I can't remember.

2393
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,920
It's so great.

2394
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:40,680
And I wish my plus up for this ride is if they can figure out, and the movies, if they

2395
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:47,000
can figure out a way to put this song in a movie ride, whatever it is.

2396
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,840
So here we go.

2397
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:52,040
Spider-Man rock-omic theme.

2398
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,440
It's like a rock-omic, like a comic.

2399
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,440
Rock-omic.

2400
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,440
Okay.

2401
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,720
So let me play this because I love it so much.

2402
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,640
Spider-Man is a Spider-Man.

2403
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,720
Everybody's talking about that normal Spider-Man.

2404
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,720
Amazing, amazing.

2405
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,720
How does he get through it?

2406
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:21,120
He moves like a spider, moves like a man.

2407
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:24,520
We're calling superhero your friendly Spider-Man.

2408
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:28,520
Amazing, amazing.

2409
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:32,320
How does he get through it?

2410
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:47,600
He's a killer if he does that.

2411
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Wait, no.

2412
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,000
Oh, I didn't think about it.

2413
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,600
He's a deadly sex machine.

2414
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,600
He's a sex suicide machine.

2415
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,200
Geez, that's a different, that's a darker movie.

2416
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,000
Ron Dante didn't know that.

2417
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,640
That was before his confession.

2418
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,680
We should not blame the song.

2419
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,680
Don't blame Ron.

2420
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,080
I will post a link to that.

2421
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,080
1972.

2422
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,080
Fantastic song.

2423
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:16,960
I'd go so far as to say the second best song ever inspired by Spider-Man.

2424
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,680
Obviously behind Shag Kroger and the man from saliva.

2425
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,840
I guess we made it.

2426
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
You Survive podcast, the ride.

2427
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,840
That was a blast.

2428
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:29,160
Hey, as I said, go to YouTube where you can see that Manser's thing and some other fun

2429
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:34,520
stuff that we've done and Twitter where you will find the Ron Dante song and learn all

2430
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:39,240
about what a sex machine Spider-Man is and email us any questions, podcasts, the road

2431
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:43,600
at gmail.com or any secret info about Marvel Dubai.

2432
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,440
And that's a lot of commands this time.

2433
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,440
Yeah, sorry.

2434
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,440
No, that's it.

2435
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:54,120
I mean, just every, you know, rate and review us on Apple podcasts and what have you.

2436
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,120
Yeah.

2437
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:57,720
Any specific Spider-Man specific commands?

2438
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,640
Oh, for the braiding in a review.

2439
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,640
Oh, in the review.

2440
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,640
Uh, yes.

2441
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:08,560
Uh, let's see if, uh, tell us your a list Spider-Man villain.

2442
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:12,120
Who's your top, top of the list Spider-Man villain?

2443
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:20,200
Or give us your best J. Jonah Jameson rant about Spider-Man being a wall crawling menace.

2444
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,880
Oh, so you want them to write like a couple of paragraphs.

2445
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,600
It can be one pair.

2446
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,480
It can be, you know, just a letter from the editor.

2447
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,480
Sure.

2448
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,480
Do that.

2449
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,480
That is a letter from the editor.

2450
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,480
It's a letter from the editor.

2451
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:34,240
Also like to hear Jameson's thoughts about Chad Kroger.

2452
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,240
Yeah.

2453
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:36,240
Now he's great.

2454
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:37,240
He's great.

2455
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,600
Now that's a singer we can all agree on.

2456
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:43,160
Wholesome rock and roll.

2457
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,560
Wild untamed hair.

2458
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,040
A true king of the genre.

2459
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,760
Uh, well folks, thanks for listening.

2460
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,760
