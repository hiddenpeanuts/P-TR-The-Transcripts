00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate where today I want to say first, much like

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,280
section of a YouTube video or a message board thread or something. I feel like that was an

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,680
early internet thing, but today I'm saying Mike Carlson first when it comes to the topic we're

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,880
talking about today. Jason Sheridan is here. He also should say first. You'll not understand

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,960
what I'm talking about in a second. I'm saying first. I mean, you were first. You clocked this.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,560
Yes, I clocked this. So you're seeing this topic right now come up in your second gate feed and

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,160
you probably don't know what it is, but I just want to say Podcast The Ride, specifically me,

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,800
Mike Carlson discovered it first. So let's just get that out of the way. We should say that we're

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,480
Scott free today. Some stuff has happened, good stuff as far as Scott is concerned, and we will

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,960
be Scott free for a few episodes or so. It's not going to be as long as last time, but he is not

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,680
here today to enjoy the firstness of it all. That's right. And I'm sure he's kicking himself

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,400
for missing out on this one. Yeah, I can't tell if this is good that he's not here or he is going

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,400
to be jealous that he wasn't involved in the firstness of it all. I don't know. I mean,

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,640
look, I would love if he uncovered something that we missed because I don't know that I could have

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,560
searched any other thing. No, I don't know how much there is sort of to dig into this, but we should

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,480
just say now that I keep being vague that today we're going to be talking about a new Disney

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,520
character. How often, I should say this, park specific Disney character, how often does this

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,760
happen? It's so often these days. Kind of rare. Kind of rare, especially because all the rides

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,040
are generally IP based on movies and shows. So it's rare that you get a full original theme park

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,840
character. And that is what Disney has done literally two months ago. Yes. Two months ago,

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,800
like around December 13th. I'm not sure we were trying to find the exact date. So maybe this is

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,880
where Scott would have come in handy. He would know the exact date of this character's creation,

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,600
but they posted a video of the new character that is supposed to be the mascot of the Disneyland

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:49,920
annual passes, AKA the magic key passes. This character is a duck and his name is,

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,680
let's say it together. Ducky. Now I don't know if it's supposed to be pronounced duck key,

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,360
but that seems to be the pun, the joke of the name. He has key in his name. He has key in his

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,520
name. So this is the new character. No one is talking about it. I feel that Disney hasn't done

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,240
enough to push this character on the public. Yeah. Uh, I would agree because shortly before

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:25,440
you got here, uh, I was searching Reddit and the Disney store app and I found, uh, nothing.

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,240
I literally got this no results found for ducky on the Disney store app with this kind of condescending

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,800
upside down goofy. Yeah. So when you search for something on the Disney store and you can't find

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,640
it, goofy is like doing a headstand and he's really like flashing his groin at you. Yeah.

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,040
It's a little, uh, mocking. Yeah. He's not, obviously he has his pants on. He's not flashing

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,600
his junk at you, but he does like have his like, he's like man spreading in the air

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,640
and he's kind of thrusting it at you in that image. Yeah. I, I guess it's meant to be whimsical or

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,040
foolish as his qualities are. Right. He's not aggressive in general as a character. He's not

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,480
like a predator or something, but it does feel like put that, put that away, pal. Yeah. Um,

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,160
ducky has real, uh, if you remember the Mr. Show sketch of pit pat, the non-denominational

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,360
genderless spokes thing. Right. Yes. Uh, ducky is kind of, he's definitely in the zone of like

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,480
kind of generic character as far as like, who is this character? What's he supposed to be?

41
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,200
I will make the argument though that duffy, the Disney bear ends up being a little more like pit

42
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,400
pat to me than this character and ducky. Yeah. Because like duffy and they've given duffy some

43
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,720
stuff over the years. He has outfits, he has friends. The friends though seem to have a lot

44
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,400
more personality still to this day than duffy. I would say so, uh, duffy is kind of like,

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,440
do you remember action man? The dolls that you could, he was just kind of a generic

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,080
GI Joe kind of soldier. Right. But then he would have a scuba suit. He would have space suit.

47
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
These are characters where you're supposed to like kind of infuse them, I think with your own

48
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
personality. Yeah. They're kind of ciphers. They're ciphers. So like when you, Jason Sheridan is

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,680
playing with a duffy doll, duffy is you. Yeah. Right. Well, you sent me earlier, you sent me

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,680
a limited edition, uh, Donald duck D mu. Is that how it's pronounced? Yes. That's yes. It's a very

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,240
cute, like cutie doll sort of thing. This is something I wanted to maybe, I was trying to

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,040
figure out if we were going to bring this up, but this is a whole thing. So there's this company,

53
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,640
I believe it's a Chinese company, uh, called pop Mart. Yes. And they have a store in the Glendale

54
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,360
Galleria. I like this store a lot. They got a lot of little figurines. They have very cool store.

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,400
They have a character named Molly. Okay. And I really want to get into buying Molly toys

56
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,040
because Molly has a bunch of different series of toy, series of toys. So there's baby Molly.

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,120
There's like, it says like Molly carb lover, and she's just eating different foods that she likes.

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Then there's space Molly. Oh, and they have different sizes of the Molly space, Molly toys.

59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,040
And some of the Molly toys have IP characters on the spacesuit. So you can get a space Molly

60
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:41,440
with a Ted spacesuit or a Care Bear spacesuit or a Garfield spacesuit. So when she pulls down the

61
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,040
helmet on the spacesuit, it's Garfield's face and ears. That's great. And then you can buy what's

62
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,520
called a mega space Molly that is about this big, let's say like a foot, foot and a half of the

63
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,040
Garfield of space Molly. Uh, I need to learn more about Molly. Yes, do I. I'm not an expert on Molly

64
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,280
yet, but anyway, so I sent you, um, a Pop Mart toy cause they do, they do IP, they do Disney stuff.

65
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,160
And they have put out what I can only describe as a nightmarish child that is dressed to look like

66
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Donald who was also holding a Donald like plush. Yeah. Sometimes he just kind of looks like one of

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,960
the love is characters. Uh, if you're listening to the show, you probably know what love is.

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,360
I would hope so. Yeah. And you might also get the shivers every time you think about it, like I do,

69
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,320
but this can be plain like doll wearing Donald duck outfit or you can give him a beak.

70
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Yeah. So imagine, um, on the Island of Dr. Moreau, they kidnapped like a child

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,040
and a Donald duck plush doll and they mutated them together somehow. Yeah. A mutant it's like

72
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,040
half boy, half Donald duck doll. And that's what we're talking about here as far as a toy.

73
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,600
So I don't think I'm going to buy this. I'm not as into this toy as I am into the, the Molly toys.

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay. But I mean, maybe I could buy it for you for your birthday or something.

75
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah. Especially if they have a big version of it. Oh no. Something that you could put in your bed

76
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,600
or something. Something you could sleep next to. Yeah. There's a little space between the pillows.

77
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Right. You might hit your head on its beak. Sometimes if you toss and turn,

78
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:34,080
there's usually a Snoopy, uh, Squish Malo floating around the bedroom, uh, from Nod's Berry floating

79
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,280
around. Oh, you mean like sometimes like I'll fall asleep clutching it. And then sometimes it'll just

80
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,480
be at the foot of the bed. Yeah. Do you, do you mean to be like, did you wake up and you go,

81
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,920
how did this get here? Or did you start? Well, it's less, you know, when you try to hold a pillow,

82
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,400
it's kind of sizable and then try to get on the, like I was, I kept falling asleep like that. It

83
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,920
kept taking up so much room. So like it's a body, it's, it's not as big as a body pillow though.

84
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,680
No, no. It's like an oval shaped, like very cartoony, very simplified version of Snoopy.

85
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,600
This is there, there was a prize booth right at the entrance of Camp Snoopy. Right. And they said

86
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:24,960
every, um, how did they phrase it? Every player wins. Right. And we're like, okay,

87
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,200
well, and they're like, well, do you want to play $10 or $15? And we're like, what? And they're like

88
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,040
pointing at the prizes. So if you paid, so did you, so $10 would give you a less good prize?

89
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,360
Yes. But this is the one I wanted. The, the $15 one was not as good. And I was like, well,

90
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
want to win that. Well, and they're like, okay, pick up the duck. All right. Picked out the duck

91
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,560
and here's your Snoopy. I basically bought a Snoopy for $10. Is it a decent quality?

92
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,960
Cause sometimes those carnival games have like really shitty quality plush. It's a,

93
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,400
it is an officially branded squish mallow, you know? Okay. I guess those are of a certain quality.

94
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Right. And they're like, can you show me on your hands how big it is? Oh, it's very small.

95
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Like paper size. Yeah. Okay. Cause I was picturing like a five foot tall Snoopy body pillow.

96
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Oh no. I did have like, uh, two or three feet high Snoopy when I was really young and it started,

97
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,720
uh, leaking, uh, beanbag beans. Yeah. It started leaking pretty quickly into elementary school

98
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
and my parents were like, we have to get rid of it. I was like, no,

99
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,000
no, we can't throw out Snoopy. Did you end, you had to end up, you did, right? They got rid of it.

100
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Yes. We, I finally caved at some point because there was just so many little

101
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,800
beanbag beans in my bedroom. Did they make you do it or anything? Was there like a teaching moment?

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,600
No, it wasn't. It wasn't an old yellow row. Jason, you have to get, you have to become

103
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,440
a man one of these days. Please throw out your broken Snoopy plush. Please cut Snoopy's head off.

104
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,680
Please set him on fire. Yeah. Woodstock will watch. Uh, well that's good. Uh, uh, yeah. So

105
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,000
this is this nightmare toy that I sent you. Um, that's not the thing. There was a lot of other

106
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
things I was going to maybe bring up at the top of the episode, but I decided to get right into

107
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Ducky. Uh, and we'll see what else we talk about in the midst of this. Um, so Ducky the duck,

108
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,840
they posted, uh, there's, there's some pictures. There's like, he's in some magic key videos kind

109
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:46,320
of bopping around and it's a very like, like retro-y style video and it's cute. It's a cute

110
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,120
duck. I'll say that. You know, we don't talk, we, you really don't get a good look at his seat.

111
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,680
If that's what people's head are at when it comes to podcasts to write in duck, like cute ducks,

112
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
because we talk about, you know, Donald duck seat, but that's not what this is. He's a very

113
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,000
much a realistic ish looking duck. He's the right size. He's not walking around talking to Mickey

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,720
and friends or anything. Right. Yes. He is, uh, seems to be, well, I got a couple of things.

115
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,480
First off, Ducky, I don't believe Ducky is not the bird at the end of runaway railway,

116
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,000
which I've been meaning. That's an episode I want to do similar, but that was a character that was

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,280
introduced as a joke of like, this is a character made to sell a plush of it at the store.

118
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,960
And I feel like that's a pretty decent, that's a solid joke. Uh, and they abandoned that very

119
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,080
quickly. You mean as far as trying to sell the merch? No, I think they still sell it, but in

120
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,560
terms of like, he doesn't get a lot of stage time in the ride. You're saying that he should

121
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,080
have been more prominent in the ride. Like, like you feel like that was something they initially

122
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,920
were pushing with marketing or what do you mean with like marketing and like the, the whatever

123
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,800
store plushy booth when you left, but it's like kind of, you only really notice it when you're

124
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,400
waiting to like pull up to unloading. He's about to born and like he occasionally tweak tweets, but

125
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,960
he isn't as memorable as like Shondu, the tiger and the Sinbad ride in Tokyo Disney Sea. That's

126
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,520
true. Yeah. And it's kind of funny because he would fit throughout runaway railway. There's a

127
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,600
lot of stuff that goes wrong. I feel like there's a lot of antics. I bet you can track him. I bet

128
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,760
he just doesn't sort of register as a character. It could be, he could be in the background and

129
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,520
I just have never caught it. Maybe I'll have to, the next time I go on it, all I'm going to be

130
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,200
doing is focusing on that bird. On this little yellow bird. I'm not going to look at anything

131
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,200
else and I'm going to just keep my eyes on it. Cause I bet he's like doing stuff. He's got to

132
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,280
be doing stuff. I would hope he's doing stuff. He's up, he's in the background. Like maybe it's

133
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,680
unrelated, but like he's up to, I would say he's up to no good. Maybe he's just enjoying the

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,600
amenities. He's just enjoying the carnival and the underwater kingdom and the dance class. Oh,

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,000
he's underwater and he can't breathe, but he's enjoying it. Maybe he has a snorkel on or a

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
breathing tank or something. He's just sort of doing a, um, sort of a deep sea diving expedition.

137
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Yeah. Or he's in a sub. He's in like a submersible. Oh, that would be good. Yeah. If he had a

138
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,840
personal submersible. Um, the, uh, the other thing, uh, I wanted to bring up with Ducky.

139
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:41,040
Ducky's story has a lot of beats as the little man of Disneyland. Well, okay. Yes. Yeah. Let's

140
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,520
get into it. That is, that is if, if they were like, okay, well what else are they going to say?

141
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,040
It's a cute little duck, you know, not a lot to it. Mostly what I want to talk about is this

142
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,560
video that they posted that explains the lore of Ducky. Yeah. And I'll give them credit because

143
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,640
there's a lot of lore packed into a minute. Yeah. So, cause they could have easily just said,

144
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,600
oh, it's Ducky. He's the magic key duck, blah, blah, blah. Here's a picture of him. And then

145
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
every time they post a video like magic keys are on sale or whatever here, you can, you can buy a

146
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,680
button or something or whatever. Like here's Ducky. They could have done it. They didn't.

147
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,200
No. So kudos to them for developing an origin story for Ducky. Now I think today we're going

148
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,960
to dissect, do we like the story? What does the story mean? Yeah. What are the implications

149
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,440
of this story for the rest of the Disneyland resort? Right. So I have it here and yes,

150
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,320
I agree with you. This is what we need to talk about. Once upon a time, there was a sweet,

151
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
friendly, curious little duckling who loved the Disneyland resort with all his heart.

152
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,080
It all started when as a tiny hatchling, he migrated to a beautiful river that would become

153
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:07,520
the rivers of America. Let's just start right there. Yeah. So Ducky was a little baby

154
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,920
before Disneyland was created. Yes. He existed in Anaheim before that. So automatically,

155
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,680
Ducky is 70 years old, easily 70 years old. So right there, there's something magical about him.

156
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,920
You drew the parallel to The Little Man of Disneyland, which is a little golden book

157
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,200
that is like 60 or 70 years old or whatever. It's a similar story where The Little Man of

158
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,760
Disneyland supposedly lived in Anaheim before Disneyland existed. Mickey and friends wined and

159
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,040
dined him and were like, we're going to build this thing here. You're going to have a house

160
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,840
in Disneyland. Bro, don't worry about it. You're going to love it. And he did. He loved it. You

161
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,440
can still see the little house over in Adventureland still to this day. In the tree,

162
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:04,560
yeah, by Indiana Jones. So very similar to his origin, Ducky's. So already Ducky is magical

163
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,720
because like Little Man of Disneyland, he's already kind of a magical character. Ducky is

164
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,480
being presented as just a regular duck, but they've already introduced the wrinkle that Ducky is at

165
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,520
least 70 years old. Yeah. Just looking real quick, the average age of a mallard duck,

166
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:30,080
five to 10 years. Yes. So this creature has likely watched his friends and loved ones die around

167
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,360
him as he does not age. I think that's true. Now, could there be an implication here

168
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,120
that living inside Disneyland keeps you young forever? Well, now we're getting into kingdom

169
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,960
keepers, like magic territory, like powers. Ducky likely has powers. Well, he does have

170
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,000
powers and then he gains more powers as you learn, but he clearly has some sort of powers.

171
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,960
And I'm just wondering, like, if I were to, like, do I age the days I go to Disneyland?

172
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,840
Oh, that's good question. You know what I mean? Because like I've been to Disneyland a lot in my

173
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,880
life. I'm very lucky. Have I been a hundred times to Disneyland? I don't know. Maybe approaching

174
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,320
that. Does that mean, though, that almost like a third, one of the, I'm almost getting back like

175
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:25,360
a third of a year. So I'm not actually the age that I am. I'm a little younger. The touring plans

176
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:35,120
crew must be like ageless. Right. Guy Selga. Guy Selga is 12 years old. No. He's in Disneyland

177
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,640
almost every day and he's only 12. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. So again, that's what I'm

178
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:49,760
saying. The implications for what it must mean if this Ducky is still young and vibrant seeming

179
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:58,320
and living in Disneyland for 70 years. Yeah. When he gets more powers, it's with the behavior that

180
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,880
I don't know that they usually like to encourage in children. What do you mean by that?

181
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:14,240
That's a very good point. Yes. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. We're not racing yet, partner. I think

182
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
there's like seven things I want to talk about before that happens. We'll see. Okay. Here we go.

183
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Growing, he knew it would blossom into a place filled with wonder.

184
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Bit by bit, he watched it all being built. He napped underneath the shade of the greenery,

185
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,760
dreaming about exploring the entirety of this special place. He played make believe in the

186
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,560
minute. So, okay. He's sitting there in this cute little video they have. He's sitting there with,

187
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,520
I presume is his mother and they're watching as Disneyland is built. So they're sitting there

188
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,320
watching it and there's a clip, a part of it where it's winter time. Yeah. They have winter clothes

189
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,280
on and they're watching the castle being constructed. Yes. First of all, what happened

190
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,000
to his mother? Well, she might be an ageless one too. I know, but she doesn't show up later

191
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,880
in the video. Yeah. Good question. But, you know, who knows? Maybe she left Disneyland because she

192
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,240
was ready to go. You're right. She's like, I don't need to be in this park every day. I've got a life

193
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,080
to live. I, yeah. I got to go to Universal. The one thing I haven't done is death.

194
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,840
So he's so, so then they immediately like, they're watching Disneyland being built. And then they

195
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,800
also, Ducky knew this was going to be the greatest place. You're like, how did he know that? Because

196
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,520
like the little man of Disneyland, Mickey Mouse told this little guy, hey, this place is going to

197
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,600
fucking rule. Well, I, if I remember correctly, they just started building and knocking stuff

198
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,040
down. Then he gave them a piece of his mind and they're like, shit, we have to deal with this guy.

199
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,840
That is true. Now that is a very interesting change to this type of story because I do feel

200
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,720
like that's a difference in modern Disney thinking where you have to make sure that there was never

201
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:14,240
a problem that our product presented. Correct. Yeah. Right. So Ducky just was like, hey,

202
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,960
they're building this big thing where I live. Great. No problems versus like decades ago where

203
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
they were like, oh, wouldn't it be interesting if we started building Disneyland and there was just

204
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,640
a little like leprechaun guy that lived there. He would be upset at first and then he would grow

205
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,920
to like it. But modern Disney would be like, no, the Disney company has never displaced someone

206
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:41,200
from their home. We've never taken, our parks are not responsible for doing that ever. All they do

207
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:51,120
is good stuff. Once they, do you remember well before we ever went there, there was an RV park

208
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,600
by Disneyland and I forget whether it was Disney Run, but people- Disney ran an RV park?

209
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,480
Lived there. Like people would park their RVs there and eventually in the late nineties,

210
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
they're like, we're ending your, we're ending the lease. We're closing the park. Wait,

211
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,560
did you say Florida or here? No, here, Anaheim. Really? Yeah. Where was that?

212
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,560
I, it was close to Disneyland. And you, you saw it? I've seen, I've seen pictures of it.

213
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,600
It came up on Sunday. I think it came up when we were talking about Anaheim. I can't remember

214
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,600
the city government or maybe the monorail. Like, but it, you know, it was,

215
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,360
I think meant for vacations, but then some people would stay there long-term.

216
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,720
Right. But I think there was a pool and an arcade and a general store, like a normal

217
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
campground, you know? Right, right. Hmm. Yeah. It's worth looking, if Disney owned it, that's

218
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,680
worth looking into. Yeah. I mean, it's worth looking into now, even if they don't, because

219
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,080
there could be a harbor hoedown eventually. Sure. That might be part of it. Sure. We just

220
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:10,160
started getting to the point where Ducky is now experiencing Disneyland. Yes. Here we go.

221
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:28,960
So Ducky is shitting and pissing in the Sleeping Beauty Castle mode.

222
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,840
Yes. Just because he's a duck, that's how it goes.

223
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
He's being a good boy. He's not sneaky on rides.

224
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,880
Right. That's true. He's going on bodies of water

225
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
that are kind of open for the wildlife. Right. And he's going in the storyboat

226
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,520
canals and pretending he's part of the story. Yes.

227
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,160
So this is all pretty cute, pretty standard stuff, I feel like at this point.

228
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Yeah. He's just, he's just enjoying, he's kind of like,

229
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,640
oh, you might see Ducky one of these days, right? It's kind of inevitable that they monetize the

230
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,960
wildlife, the ducks, the cats. I haven't seen a lot about the Disneyland cats. I feel like

231
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,320
they're still plausible deniability, even though they feed them and spay and neuter them.

232
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm realizing now, and I should know this before I say it, but I saw some tweets maybe today,

233
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,520
even showing that like on Donald's 50th birthday, he was surrounded by a bunch of actual ducks.

234
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,280
I think that's right. There's certainly been, it was a Disney World commercials where little

235
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,920
duckling stumbles upon a walk around Donald. Yeah. Well, this was like 50 ducks or something

236
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,520
surrounding him. So they'd obviously like done something, put seeds around Donald's seat

237
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,000
to get a bunch of ducks to take that photo. Sure. So they have used, yeah, you've never seen a

238
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,960
picture from Disneyland where there are 50 feral cats surrounding one of the characters.

239
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,280
No. I'm trying to think what character. Some of them are very friendly. I have

240
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,760
petting some of the cats I feel like. But there's not like honest John from Pinocchio

241
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,560
and there's 50 real cats surrounding him. No. Or like Cruella de Vil is surrounded by 50 cats.

242
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:18,480
A little wilder creature is the ducks. Right. I got attacked by a duck like lightly over a jolly

243
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,960
holiday. Have I said this on the show? Did you have food on you? Well, I was eating food. Yeah.

244
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
But the ducks, I just like a beak hit me right in the thigh. Not the thigh. That sounded like the

245
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,360
duck was higher up, but like more of the calf, I guess. A duck pecked me in the calf. And I was

246
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,240
like, this is crazy. Cause like you could easily nail a duck in the head just by scooting your

247
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,520
chair out. Cause it's so close, like such close quarters at jolly holiday. Yeah. And the ducks

248
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,920
are just that comfortable. I mean, it kind of, I was like kind of worried. Then I was like really

249
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,400
stressed eating cause I was like, I'm going to run over a duck. Yeah. By just standing up or

250
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,240
moving a chair. Well, that's what at Sleepy Hollow the last time my family went to Florida

251
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:06,640
and it was just the outdoor seating area just covered in bees. Like all they sell there is

252
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,800
waffles, berry waffles, waffles with syrup and butter and sweet and spicy chicken breast

253
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,320
waffle sandwiches. So the bees are just having a field day. So they were like, you mean just,

254
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
they were swarming. There wasn't like a layer of bees on the floor. There wasn't a layer of bees.

255
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,760
It just, anywhere you looked, every table was like swarming bees. Yeah. Did you stop and eat there?

256
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,800
Yeah. Really? Even though with the bees? Well, we had already ordered. Oh, so you saw the bees

257
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,440
after I see. And then our food came up. I thought you were like, yeah, but I really want a waffle.

258
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,880
Sure. We all wanted the waffle. We love that waffle sandwich. A thousand bees swarming,

259
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
but I got to eat in a waffle. So did you just eat farther away from the bees? Yeah. I think we

260
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,320
eventually moved or just tried to keep an eye on the bees. Just keep them. One of you were the

261
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,600
designated lookout to look out for the bees while you were eating. And it was busy. Like there was

262
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,640
a lot of family seating around there. I've never seen that many bees at Disney World or Disneyland

263
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,000
in one place. Is that like, is there a conspiracy theory that Disney knows how to control the bees?

264
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,800
Well, clearly something was going wrong this day. Well, right. I was going to say. Or they're just

265
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:31,040
trying to turn people over faster. Like don't savor that waffle. Woof it down. So they can get

266
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,680
out of here. They can unleash bees on parts of the park when they want people to disperse.

267
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,880
So they have a machine to keep the bees away, but they also have a bee machine that shoots bees

268
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,240
at part of the park when they want people to leave. Yes. And they were shooting bees

269
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,800
at this waffle. They were shooting bees. The demand for waffles was so great that day.

270
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,840
Get the hell out. Get to a table service restaurant now.

271
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,600
None of this quick service bullshit. They were shooting, yeah. They really that,

272
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,960
they should have never done the virtual queues or the like, whatever, the lightning lane stuff to

273
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,880
to make the lines smaller. They should have just shot bees at the rides that had long lines.

274
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,640
Yeah. People would have gotten out of there. No problem. Okay. So again,

275
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,280
this is pretty standard stuff. Yeah. Or, you know, a little mascot.

276
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,040
While he was taking a dip, someone dropped a mysterious key into the water.

277
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:40,320
The duckling, ever curious, dove down to follow it. He prodded it, inspected it, and swallowed it

278
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:49,440
whole. Okay. What the fuck? What the fuck? Why? That's Pika. You're not supposed to be eating keys.

279
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:57,120
Why would he eat the key? Why would he eat the key? It's a key to a door. Also, wouldn't a key sink?

280
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, it did sink, I think. It showed in the video. Oh, okay. It did sink. So he was just bobbing

281
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,200
down. So he bobbed down and they said he really, this is also what it is that confuses me. If they

282
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,400
said, oh, you know, he was sunbathing, someone dropped a key and it fell into his beak and he

283
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,680
ate it, like fine. But they really present it as he went down there, prodded it, saw what was going

284
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:32,560
on and then consciously thought, I'm going to eat this key. Right. He didn't. It's hard. It doesn't

285
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,880
taste like anything. He probably licked it. He smelled it. It didn't taste or smell like food

286
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,840
and this fucking idiot duck ate the key. Why would he eat the key? I'm assuming a certain level of

287
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:53,840
hubris comes with the magic gained of living in Disneyland. Like you're powerful, you know,

288
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,040
you're invincible. So you're saying like when we're at the end of a five day vacation and we're just

289
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:07,360
like fucking feel so good. Yeah. I want to eat a key right now. I'm on such a high. I want to eat

290
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,240
a key. If somebody were to drop a key right now, I want to smell it. I want to lick it and then I'm

291
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,760
swallowing that thing. This is, I was trying to think of this name a while ago when we were

292
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:28,640
recording, but one of the guest stars on Dr. Odyssey is Fred Melamed. Have you talked about

293
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,040
this before? Did we get there? I couldn't remember, but his whole thing, his medical condition is he

294
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:42,480
just keeps going around the ship eating objects. Oh, so he is like a key eater. Like Dr. Odyssey

295
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,360
has got like, and his wife is in denial. So what does he eat on the show? Like a ring.

296
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,400
I think he eats a key or two, cufflinks. So he eats a key. Yeah. And they have to like pump his

297
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,840
stomach. Is that something you would develop later or is that something you would have since you were

298
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,040
a kid? I don't know much about it. I think it is a thing where it's like, oh, he's had this for a

299
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,560
while. He has been sick and they didn't like suss it out in time. Can I ask this? And maybe this is

300
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,320
just, this is ignorance. Yeah. Is it a sex thing? No, it's not a sex thing. I think it's like a

301
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,200
bullshit thing. Oh, okay. Is it similar to that feeling people get when they're on like a high

302
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,000
cliff or they're on the third floor of a mall and you kind of look down and there's this weird thing

303
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,760
in the back of your mind that's like, I could just throw myself over this. No, I believe that sensation

304
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,840
is normal. Yes, I think that is normal. I think that's healthy to have that thought. Right. But like,

305
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,280
I would have a feeling like when I would be in the audience watching a band concert in high school,

306
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,760
like, you know, there'd be multiple kinds of bands, symphonic band, concert band. So you'd watch the

307
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,040
other bands and then you'd go up and play. Yeah. I would have a weird feeling in a similar way.

308
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Like I could just blow my trumpet and ruin this whole song right now from the audience. Yes. Like

309
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,120
there's like your brain oftentimes is like kind of like floating ideas that you shouldn't do that

310
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,000
you know are bad. Yeah. So it's a, that's what I'm saying. It's like a similar thing to that,

311
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,560
but it's so strong that you're like, I know I shouldn't eat this key, but I have to eat.

312
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,920
Can't help myself. Right. Right. Interesting. So what, how did that resolve on Dr. Odyssey?

313
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:34,080
Well, I think what happened is they had him for a day and a half because he is not in that many

314
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,120
seeds. Do you think his schedule is so demanding? No offense to it. He's great. I'm just saying like

315
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,840
if he signs up for a Dr. Odyssey, he should be there for a week. I don't know that it was his

316
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,280
problem is what I'm saying. It sounds like the writers didn't give him enough stuff.

317
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:59,600
Well, I'm trying to figure out who the actor who plays his wife, but she, she isn't a much more,

318
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,800
she gets more of a starring. But she's not eating everything in sight.

319
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,920
No, but she's in denial about like, no, we're basically like we're normal. We organize these

320
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:18,240
crews and like clearly he's doing it out of like stress or something in the thing. I don't know

321
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,800
why Ducky is doing it. They don't, they don't flesh that out. Yeah. Does he just not maybe know

322
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,240
the concept of keys? I guess, but at this point, okay, so let's start extrapolating here because

323
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,960
the magic key program is new in the scheme of things for Disneyland. They've had annual passes

324
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:46,880
for decades, but magic key is a name that just came about a few years ago. So I have to presume

325
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,480
that Ducky ate this key a couple years ago, which means that Ducky was in Disneyland for

326
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:03,280
over 60 years, not eating keys, not eating things he found. When it was closed for like a year plus,

327
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,160
was he confused? Probably, but I don't know that they did not address that in this minute long

328
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,400
video of like what he did. They did not address what he thought about State Fair or Thumper's

329
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:21,280
Easter or the various reigns of CEOs. They did not say what he thought about Michael Eisner or

330
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,160
Card Walker, E. Card Walker, whatever. So he ate that key a couple of years ago

331
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,760
and it's confusing to me because it just, it's presented in the video as like a positive thing,

332
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
like, oh great, he ate the key, which I don't understand. It's not like, no, Ducky, what are

333
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,760
you doing? No, everyone's like shouting at him. Ducky, no, spit it out. And it's like, and there's

334
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,440
not, the next part is not they take Ducky to the vet and give him the like dog throw-up drugs.

335
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,520
That's not part of that either. No. It's just presented as a good thing. Now I also ask the

336
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,360
question, who dropped that key? Because they're going to reveal that that key is magical,

337
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,600
but someone dropped that key. It's also an old fashioned key. It's not like, right. It's not a

338
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,960
house key. It's not a house key. It's not like a modern hotel key. It's not a card,

339
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,680
like a credit card size. But here, okay, let me just play this a little more and then we'll

340
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,720
talk about who dropped this key. It wasn't just any key. It was a magical key that could open

341
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,920
doors across the Disneyland resort and it gave the duckling powers that made his dreams come true.

342
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,600
Basically, it's a magical key that opens doors and Ducky has swallowed it. Now, first of all,

343
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:48,000
why couldn't he just pocket the key and use it on a practical way to open a door if he needed to?

344
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,440
Right. Why did he eat it and become, because also the key is going to kill him or it's just

345
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,720
going to sit in there and fuck up his digestion. How is a key that's a practical, real,

346
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,440
old school key going to open a door when it's in the duck's stomach?

347
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,120
Yeah, or it's just going to shoot out his cloaca. It's going to rock out of there.

348
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,680
It could rock it out either side. He could puke it out. He could poop it out.

349
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:28,880
Right. It's very confusing to me. Just say he got a key and he has a little key ring

350
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
and he puts it in his little duck pocket. That'd be cute.

351
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
It'd be adorable. If he had a little carabiner.

352
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,160
Right. Who dropped the key is also my question. Walt Disney has been dead for a long time. Now,

353
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,880
remember, it has to be a couple years ago because that's when Magic Key was introduced.

354
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes. So it has to be somebody. Is it Bob

355
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:58,320
Chapek? Is it Bob Iger? Is it John Lasseter? Back in the parks for some reason.

356
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:05,600
Is it abandoning his Magic Key? Right. John Lasseter has a Magic Key to Disneyland

357
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,080
and he drops it in the water because I'm not going to need this anymore. I don't know. I'm

358
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,320
just saying who would drop a key in there and why would it be anonymous? Do they know that

359
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,200
Ducky was going to find it? What if a different duck ate it?

360
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Yeah, because they also seem to apply that it opens a lot of doors.

361
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Yes. That's another thing I'm confused by. I'm just saying my Magic Key is just a tab

362
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:43,680
on an app. It's the simulation of a button on a touch screen and it can't open shit.

363
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,400
It gets you in and out of Disneyland and California Adventure, assuming you have a reservation.

364
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,720
So that shit's still going on. Right.

365
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,160
But I wanted to open locked doors. I wanted Jimmy open doors with it.

366
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,200
Right. This doesn't make sense as far as being one to one with your annual pass.

367
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,120
It isn't like Ducky dreamed of going to the Disneyland Resort and for 70 years,

368
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,800
he was too poor to do it. He was just sitting outside the resort wondering and then one day

369
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,040
from the sky up a key dropped. But then Ducky used the key to enter Disney's California Adventure.

370
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't worry. He reserved a date multiple weeks ago and he made sure that his starting park was

371
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Disney's California Adventure and he won't be able to switch until 11 a.m. That would at least make

372
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,720
sense for what the actual Magic Key product does. No strikes against Ducky. No strikes on

373
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,600
his Magic Key if he lives there. Ducky forgot to go for the third time and now Ducky is blocked

374
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,640
for 90 days. You must be punished when everyone's favorite part of purchasing goods and services

375
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,760
being punished for being a naughty boy. Ducky is locked into Disney jail for 90 days.

376
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,240
Will not be able to enjoy his fun. But he's delighted by the 10% off food and merchandise

377
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,760
he receives. Well that's what they're sort of implying that like all these doors that open

378
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,160
for you when you're a Magic Key holder is that you get 10% off your food or your plush purchases.

379
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,360
That's what the doors opening are. But the way they make it seem is that oh my gosh,

380
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,640
you can go in places that other people can't. The regular guests only dream of going through

381
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,280
these doors. Yeah. But not you. Yeah. You do the special stuff like Ducky does.

382
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,760
So it just it's here. Okay, let's keep going. Let's keep going.

383
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,560
Now with a magical click click, he could open the door to the happiest day ever.

384
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,800
What is the click click? What is click click? What are you talking about? Even if he had the

385
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,680
key out of his digestive system, that's not that is that a noise that turn like an old-fashioned

386
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,680
key might make that noise? Sure. Well, click click, I guess you put it is one of the in

387
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,080
is that going in once a click and then turning to the left a click. Look, I'm going to be honest.

388
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,320
I've mostly seen that kind of key in movies and TV. So I think the click click is put in a post.

389
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,640
So I can't say what the actual sound would be. I mean, I guess I've been to Colonial Williamsburg

390
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:30,480
and the presumably it's some name, something different now. The Plymouth Plantation in Plymouth,

391
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:39,040
Massachusetts. Yeah. Learn how candles are made. He doesn't have the key outside his body. Right.

392
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Why is it click clicking? It would the door would be like the door opens. Let's just say that

393
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,840
the door would open magically. Like let's I'm just trying to logic this out. The door would open for

394
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:57,040
him if it was magic. Oh, the door is magic. It recognizes that the magic is in his belly.

395
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,840
Let's just open the door for him. Creek like a magical creek opens the door like smart locks

396
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:16,480
or like electric cars where they play car sound audio to you that it's a car. Yes, that's yes.

397
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,600
But I just, again, logic policing this and I wasn't so like hung up. There were too many

398
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,400
things in a row in this video for me to let go. That's really what happened. They're just thing

399
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,120
one after another keeps making me go. I don't understand what's happening, but this click click

400
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,760
thing. My I am wondering if whatever marketing person came up with this, did they get to like

401
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,920
day before launch day and go like, Oh fuck, we forgot it. We have a duck. Donald shit.

402
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,960
Well, the posts are already scheduled. Let's no one's going to know. Just post it.

403
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,520
So somebody is like, I got the perfect character. It's the perfect animal. We don't. Oh shit. Oh,

404
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,600
shit. Donald duck is very famous. He's like one of the most famous characters we have. Oh shit.

405
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,200
All right. Well, I've done so much work on ducky. There's just no way we can

406
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,360
pivot to a different animal. This has been six months of my life. I am not switching it up.

407
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,400
I've been working on this video for six months. No, don't tell me goofy start in a series of

408
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,400
shorts where he learns how to do things. Yeah, that would have been helpful to know six months ago.

409
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,200
Goofy learns how to use his magic key. All right. What if he's ducky the squirrel?

410
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,640
Okay. I understand it's confusing, but follow the logic here. He's just, they call him ducky.

411
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,760
Okay. Because his nose is sort of shaped like a beak. That's kind of scary.

412
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,080
Yeah. It looks kind of like a hybrid there. Okay. All right. God damn it. All right. Well,

413
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,960
it's got to be a duck. Just leave it. Just leave it in. Just go home. Leave it in. It's ducky and

414
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,000
he's a duck. Okay. People have to fucking deal with it. All right. You would think we're done

415
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,560
with this video. We're not done with the video yet. This video, by the way, is like 80 seconds long.

416
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,680
It's so short. Yeah. But there's a lot of lore.

417
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,840
Okay. Okay. From then on, he was known as ducky. This duck has been nameless for 70 years.

418
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:28,080
This duck didn't have a name. Or he had a name like the other gods in like a Lovecraft story where,

419
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,840
oh, if you knew his true name, it would drive you insane. We can't say. Because he is magical

420
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,200
already. He's 70 years old before he gets the key. He's 65 years old before he gets the key.

421
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah. But like, I guess if it was like, they called him Brian for 70 years and now they called him

422
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:54,240
ducky. Why would they just start calling him a name? Yeah. Just because of the, he's got a key

423
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,560
in his belly. So everybody's like kind of making fun of the key that's in his belly.

424
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,240
Is he getting rezzed? He's getting rezzed. Like, hey, ducky. Hey, we're calling you ducky now.

425
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,360
We're adding an E to the ducky nickname. You idiot. You're not supposed to eat a duck.

426
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,960
You're not supposed to eat a key, man. That's for opening doors. Why would you eat that? This wild

427
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,360
man, you're ducky from now on. So, and then they have these like, they have cute like pictures of

428
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:30,000
ducky and he's got kind of like, you know, that long, what is it? A grand marshal in a parade.

429
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,360
Oh, a baton. Baton. Yeah. He's got Disney ears on and then there are two smaller ducks behind him

430
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,640
with Disney ears on as well. And again, I do like the graphics. They're not dissimilar to like the

431
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:51,120
newer Mickey cartoons. Yeah. But okay, so he is now sort of showing his duck friends around the park,

432
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,120
but I don't understand what the new way he's, he's experiencing Disney now. He lived in the park.

433
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,800
Yeah. He was doing everything for free. Yeah. There's nothing different other than he's getting

434
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,360
a discount on Jolly Holiday Bakery items. He can get a muffin for 10% off. But not at the cart.

435
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,280
It doesn't work at the carts. It doesn't. The 10% does not work at the carts. It doesn't work at

436
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,080
the cart. Maybe it's, is that a little dictator as he sees control of the ducks?

437
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Is he a little dictator? Is he too powerful? Is Ducky a little, well, I would say, okay,

438
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:37,280
it depends what the key, what doors the key opens. Like they're showing literal doors in the video.

439
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,520
Can Ducky get into the weapons cache? The Disneyland weapons cache? The security,

440
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,120
yeah, the security, like. Do you, how many weapons are on the premises of Disneyland?

441
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,400
I, that's, I'm legitimately asking. I, well, if there's Anaheim police there, you gotta factor on

442
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:07,840
that. Sure. I feel like the security area backstage, I feel like they have to have something. Do you

443
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:14,880
think it's like a Kingsman closet where it's full of weaponry? I don't know. I don't,

444
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,840
I would not think so, but. These theme parks, especially the Disney theme parks, are like

445
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,160
national security, like points of interest, you know? So. Right. And there's a lot of

446
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,360
plain clothes guys roaming around. We know that. Right, but are those people armed? I don't know

447
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,120
they're necessarily armed, but might be backstage. So you think maybe down like in the like corridors

448
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,760
or in the Disneyland tunnels or Disney world tunnels, it's like there's a room where you're

449
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,440
getting dressed to be goofy in a parade. And then next to it, there's about 500 guns on the wall,

450
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,640
just in case. That's a good question. I don't know. I suspect there's not that many. I don't think

451
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,680
there's that many weapons there, but according to this video, Ducky can get into those rooms.

452
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,040
So Ducky can like watch you change. Well, okay. Without that brings up a question. Is management

453
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,560
scared of him? Scared of Ducky? Yeah. Yeah. Well, they should be scared of him because he's got a

454
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,520
key that can open any door in the resort. He can open up the bathroom door. He can open up a door

455
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,440
if you're having like a meeting with a coworker, like if you're one of the like supervisors or

456
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
something and you're like, I need to pull you in here and we got to talk about something. Ducky can

457
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,360
just walk in. Ducky is essentially the child from the Twilight Zone episode who has powers.

458
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,440
Right. Ducky can literally open, like there's the doors that don't go to anywhere on rides

459
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,000
can be opened by Ducky. Yeah. He can open up the doors in Indiana Jones that don't work.

460
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,000
He can mess the rides up because he can literally open any door with his belly.

461
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,160
We are starting to get into the territory of does Ducky ever reality warping powers?

462
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,520
You mean like, can he will something into existence? Like if he goes through that door

463
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,320
in Indiana Jones, is it just hallway? Is just machinery back there or is it a temple door?

464
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,360
What were you picturing? I was picturing just a flat wall. Okay. I was just picturing he's like

465
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,880
messing up the ride because he just wanted to see what was back there.

466
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:31,440
Yeah. What do you think? I mean, Ducky lives, they do make it pretty clear because Magic Key

467
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,240
is the branding for the Disneyland annual passes. They make it clear that he lives in Disneyland,

468
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:43,440
not Disney World. Right. But what would Ducky do if he found out that they were paving over the

469
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,360
rivers of America? Oh, we'd go ballistic. He would probably, because yeah, that's where he like lived

470
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,480
most of his whole life. Yeah. Which I assume they didn't want to introduce Ducky living in

471
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,920
the place they were paving over in Florida. Yeah. But they don't call the Magic Keys there.

472
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,880
Right. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm saying that like they have one cute new character

473
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:12,800
living in basically their version of a waterway. I feel like if the character were to catch on,

474
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,440
then it would be like, Oh, well, we destroyed the little man of Disneyland's house. It's the same

475
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,440
thing. So they wouldn't want to introduce like that the rivers is the home of one of the characters

476
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,960
because then if they decide ever to destroy our rivers of America, like they are doing to Florida,

477
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,560
then you're like, well, Ducky doesn't have a place to sleep anymore.

478
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:40,080
Yeah. So I don't know if he could stop it. I mean, when you ask reality warping powers, like he would

479
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,360
he would be able to stop something like that, I assume. Yeah. He would be able to open up like

480
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,720
a door under one of the construction cranes and it falls through into limbo or something.

481
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,240
Yeah. Like, yeah. Does he have chaos magic? Yeah. Why I'm even saying he if he has reality

482
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,640
warping, if he's like Dr. Manhattan and Watchmen. Yeah. Or yeah, he's yeah, he can just he can do

483
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,720
whatever he wants. But oh, Ducky is for sure tired of these people and their problems and

484
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:18,960
knives. Yeah, that's true. Now, if that's true, then I think Ducky is comfortable with all the

485
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,920
different changes that have happened to the Disneyland Resort over the last few years because

486
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,640
he would have stopped them if he wasn't. So he's he's on on the team. He's on the corporate team

487
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:36,480
is what I'm saying. Is he a driver of some of the changes? Perhaps he is. So they just wake up one

488
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,680
day and the burden, the bride with the axe is gone. Ducky has replaced the bride in the Haunted

489
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,320
Mansion and then they have to get Kim Irvine out there to pretend that they did something.

490
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:53,200
In reality, it's just Ducky and he's drawing his wing across his throat and he's like, that's

491
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,080
everyone's like, what happened? How does this happen? They just turn and Ducky's just there.

492
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,600
Right. And they're like, well, say no more. Ducky has made his decision.

493
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah, it's like the Coliseum or something and Ducky kind of gives his thumbs up or thumbs down.

494
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,800
Yeah, but there is no Ducky merch, right? No, I've searched all over. There are two or three posts

495
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:24,000
with Ducky on the Instagram. There are one or two articles written by other theme park bloggers

496
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,680
that mention Ducky, but there's not been a big push yet for Ducky.

497
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,520
And I don't know. It would make a good plush. Yeah. It would make a cute thing, key chain,

498
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,280
whatever, pin. It will be interesting to see because I've also heard rumors

499
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:51,280
that they could abandon Magic Key as a title. Okay. And abandon it entirely or just go back

500
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,960
to annual pass. Go back to annual passes or passports, whatever they call them at the time,

501
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,000
because I think the majority of people call them annual passes. Yeah. I don't think Magic Key is

502
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,760
stuck in the minds of parkgoers and the youth of today. I think they call them annual passes

503
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,800
still generally, not Magic Key, but we'll see. So will Ducky go away if that terminology goes away?

504
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,720
Because they've already changed from the same era, Genie and Genie Plus. They've gotten rid of

505
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,280
that Chapec era branding. Yeah. And it will be interesting to see. Yes. Is Ducky already going

506
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,560
away, which is almost the feeling I get because most people don't know about this. And is that

507
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,520
because they had just finished up all the Ducky stuff and then they're like, yeah, we're going

508
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,800
to get rid of the Magic Key thing. So for me, we're going to kind of send Ducky out.

509
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,440
I mean, I still, I still say fast pass instead of lightning late. A lot of

510
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,560
of course, all these, all these things that were burned in our brains, there's just no reason to

511
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,880
change them. Yeah. It's just weird. I fast pass is like, everybody loves saying fast pass.

512
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:13,200
Everybody has such affection. Now on some level, I don't know if it's protecting something beloved

513
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,800
to test out if the new version that costs more doesn't work. And then we could go back to the

514
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:28,000
original. You know what I'm saying? Like if max, whenever they change fast pass to max pass,

515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,040
okay, well, if max pass people really won't pay, then we can just say fast passes back.

516
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,160
And we haven't soiled the good name of fast pass. I don't know if that's the thinking. Yeah.

517
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,320
Like that's why we were saying with Jeannie and Jeannie plus, like, why would you want to risk

518
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,760
using one of your most beloved characters for a service that's going to just drive everyone

519
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:54,640
insane? And they did and it did. And now they've rebranded already. There is a little more of this

520
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,560
video. A little more, believe it or not. Just play the rest and then we'll chime in.

521
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:06,240
Follow his adventures around the parks. You have the key to the best Disneyland day ever.

522
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,440
So that's basically it. They close like it's a storybook and Ducky is walking with his friends

523
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:23,040
or his children. Maybe those are his kids. It's possible too. Sure. Underlings. Underlings. Yeah,

524
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,720
it's possible. And yes, that's basically a little short story to tell you, the consumer,

525
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,080
that you should get a magic key because so many options open to you at that point.

526
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,760
But they don't, they don't describe any of the actual benefits.

527
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,600
No, I know. There's no, I don't. It's barely a metaphor. It's barely holding on for an 80 second

528
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,040
minute. That's what we were talking about earlier. Yes, I know. It doesn't, it doesn't make sense.

529
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,560
You're like, oh, so I get to like go in the back way on Star Tours? Is there a back door on

530
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,760
Star Tours? From watching the video, it looks like I can like walk on the Incredicoaster from

531
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:08,000
a secret door. Is that what this is? Yeah. No. There's like, I know someone showed me once

532
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:18,240
the like backstage door by the Grand Californian where the security, the metal detectors are to

533
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,360
get to downtown Disney. Right. There's a door, if you didn't turn to go to the metal detectors,

534
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,720
there's a door right around there that goes backstage. I think that's where like time clocks

535
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,160
and bulletin boards and stuff are. Well, Ducky can get in there. Yeah, he can. He can go in there.

536
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,760
He can run havoc and everyone runs scared when they see him coming.

537
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:46,720
So yeah, that's Ducky, like that's Ducky. And I could, do we like Ducky? I think we do.

538
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,920
I think so. I like him okay. I like him okay, but he's first of all, look, I hate to be so insulting.

539
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:02,880
He's dumb. He's a dumb duck. Yeah. He ate a key. He shouldn't have eaten that key. Was there moss on

540
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:10,080
it or something or like delicious moss? Like delicious underwater dirt? Does moss smell good?

541
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,680
Is moss a good smell? I feel like it smells bad. I feel like if it's mossy, it's like smells bad.

542
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,360
Can he only, well, birds don't have teeth. Is that what? Or no, they do have teeth, but they don't.

543
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:29,120
I forget. Yeah. Something about the beak. I guess I like him. I guess I hope for him

544
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,280
that he has more mythology that's more confusing even than that. Now that if they like triple down

545
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:42,080
on Ducky being confusing, I would love that more than just sort of pretending he's normal

546
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,960
because he's not normal. No, he's not. Ducky is not normal. Duffy is normal. Duffy is a normal

547
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,800
bear guy. He's kind of a boring bear. We have to steer him in the right direction though

548
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:02,560
to protect the world that hates and fears him. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think this episode is going

549
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:08,640
to start doing that. We're going to start that conversation with America as far as what is good.

550
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,360
Have we gone too far? No, I think we're right on. I think this is the right amount.

551
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:20,240
Okay. But yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Oh, I was going to say I had something else outside of Ducky,

552
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,920
unless you were to say about Ducky. Well, I was just going to say if they can,

553
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,640
we could pitch real quick on what extra stuff we want Ducky to do that confuses the hell out

554
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:40,480
of a possible Magic Key buyer. Oh, I would like a full court press of Ducky. I would like shirts

555
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:48,160
and spirit jerseys and pins and keychains. Okay. I think they should go all in on Ducky because then

556
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:55,760
if they pull back really quick, then that stuff becomes rare. So you just want merch of Ducky

557
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,400
because then there'll be like a, there's a small window here where we know Magic Key exists

558
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,560
and that's when we could get all the Ducky stuff. Like you want, what would you,

559
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:12,480
of all the merch possible in a realistic sense, would you buy a hooded Ducky sweatshirt that had

560
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,440
like a duck bill on the hood that you could kind of pull down and it would look like your Ducky?

561
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,840
And then over like sort of by the pocket, by the belly, there's a key has been sewn into the

562
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:32,320
sweatshirt. Oh, see, I thought maybe an image of a key on the backside. Yeah, there could be an image

563
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,680
of a key on the backside too, but I think they should sew an actual metal key in the lining of

564
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:44,080
the sweatshirt. So when you touch your belly or sit down, you can feel it because you know,

565
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:52,240
like you really like feeling what Ducky feels. I would love to like, there's a little surveillance

566
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:59,200
steady, but if they sewed in like an RFID chip, so then you don't have to get your phone out if

567
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:06,720
you have a Magic Key. So you could wear your Ducky hoodie at the turnstile and that would read.

568
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,880
So instead of a Magic band, you're advocating for a Magic sweatshirt. I mean, those bands get

569
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,760
more and more expensive. So you may as well have like some practicality to the function.

570
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,080
That's okay. Yeah. Magic, it's like a Magic sweat, Magic sweatshirt,

571
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:31,520
and that gets you into the parks, but it's Ducky branded. Okay. Would you, let me think.

572
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,480
So it's like every now and then there's limited run vacation club. They can only buy if you're

573
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,400
in the vacation club. Supposedly. I bet if you like, we think not that cashier and they're cool

574
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,320
about it, you can probably buy it. You think you could do that? I think it can probably be like,

575
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,560
where, where, where do they sell it at the vacation club? I mean, like, like on the cruise ship,

576
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,160
on the cruise ships, they have some- Right. Oh, you're saying on the cruise ship,

577
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,360
you'd have to be a vacation club member to buy it? Or the emporium, like there might be

578
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,800
an exclusive vacation club shirt. Okay. And you think if you kind of give them the like the

579
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,080
little eye. Hey, you know. Sweet talk them. You know. I don't know. I feel like the opposite.

580
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,200
I feel like they are really like restrictive as far as what they do. Now they do have Magic Key,

581
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,280
like pins that they're selling. I saw they have an Indiana Jones one today.

582
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,680
Okay. I'm not sure there's a pizza Rizzo one that just came out. I'm not sure if that was a,

583
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,520
what is it called? What are the passes called in Florida? I don't remember. There's like an

584
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,240
Accredited pass. There's like an Accredited pass or something in Florida. There's like a different

585
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,800
amount of branding. And there's no platinum pass. There's no both coast pass. There is,

586
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:50,640
but it's not advertised. Oh, okay. I believe. Now you do get one if you're club 33. Yeah.

587
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,680
On either coasts, you get a whatever the premier pass. Okay. Whatever they call it. I'm not sure.

588
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,280
But, and I think you maybe still can get it. It's just not listed on the website. Oh, I see.

589
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,640
That's a wink, wink. You go up to one of the booths and go, give me the special pass.

590
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,920
You go up, you find the one ticket booth that still has a person in it. Yeah. That's like

591
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,760
dusty and you got to get the cobwebs out of the way so you can see them. They put the premier

592
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,640
pass on the table and I pick it up and I eat it. No. I eat it in front of them. No. I sniff it.

593
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,160
It's not there yet. I sniff it. I assess what it is and I eat it and it's in my belly forever.

594
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,120
You're like, smells like delicious moss.

595
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:41,840
If it smells like moss, I got to eat it because moss smells so good. So yeah,

596
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:50,640
ducky. I would a little ducky plush makes sense. But yeah, I don't know. I would think like, what's

597
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:58,320
the like a ducky corset you could wear? A corset? Is that what you would want to waste? Like a

598
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,760
waist trainer? What? You know, like you're trying to cram yourself into a dress or something.

599
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,320
Yeah, no, I'm familiar. Or a corset or like a cummerbund. It could be whatever you want. It

600
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,720
doesn't have to be. It could be gender. Obviously any gender can wear either of those. A girdle?

601
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:20,240
You want a ducky girdle. It could be a ducky girdle. And again, there's a key sewn into the

602
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:26,240
lining of it. But that would be, I think the ultimate ducky merch is something that really

603
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,720
made you feel like you were ducky. And then as the idea you had to use that as your way into the

604
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,640
park and on rides and using lightning lane, et cetera. Her universe clothing line is going to

605
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,240
make a fortune on the ducky past. The ducky, how much you think a ducky girdle would cost?

606
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:53,120
100? 150? How much is a girdle these days? I don't know that they're that popular nowadays.

607
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:00,480
How are girdle prices doing under Trump? Where is William Frawley's? Like the Smithsonian

608
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,960
have his girdle? Yeah, it's the first room with the Smithsonian is William Frawley's girdle.

609
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:12,160
It's by the big pendulum and the ruby slippers. Right. Yeah, they've kept good care of it. They've

610
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,960
taken good care of it. So you should do like a national treasure and try to find William

611
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:24,080
Frawley's girdle. Well, Michael, since we are scot-free today, I figured it'd be a good time

612
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:32,320
to give you your Christmas present. Christmas is coming, I was going to say early, but it's

613
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:38,000
coming very late. Very late. Very late. Whoa. It's flat. I see something that's flat. It's flat.

614
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,160
Okay. Oh my gosh. Just Christmas present here. Let me open this. It's stuck together. I'm guessing

615
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:52,480
this is a photo of some kind. Is it? Let's see. Is it a photo of the two of us perhaps?

616
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,520
An eight by 10 photo of the two of us? You know, you've seen like a headshot before.

617
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:04,320
I am very sentimental. It's a headshot, but it's our two heads. Yeah. So we can go out for

618
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:11,120
rolls together. Oh, there's so many rolls. Oh my gosh. It is a picture of Chuck-O the Clown.

619
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,520
Whoa. Is it signed by him or is it just a... No, it's a news file. Oh, wow. It's got notes on the

620
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,480
back. So it's old. It says April 20th, 1988. So this says Chuck-O the Clown on the back

621
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:29,280
and it says Randy Runyon. That's right. It's the son. It's Chuck-O's son. It's not the original

622
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,400
Chuck-O. Now here's a frame for it, but I want to make sure you could read the back. This is a

623
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,560
pretty good... You could use that for like a photo of your daughter or your family. I could use it

624
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,960
or I could put this photo of Chuck-O next to where my daughter sleeps. That's right. Now,

625
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:52,000
she could wake up. I originally got you this self-published book, but there's a catch.

626
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,600
Are you sure this isn't for Scott? Oh my gosh. This is a used book. It's kind of a dirty book,

627
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,200
but it's also... It's like printed. You can tell it's not like a professional printing place

628
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,960
because it's a little off center. Correct. Yeah. Oh, so the twist, you want to tell me what it is?

629
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:14,560
It's... I got too excited when I found it and I didn't read the fine print that it's a different

630
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:21,120
Chuck-O. There's a second Chuck-O. Holy shit. So this is a book about Chuck-O the Clown,

631
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:28,880
but it's not the Runyon family bloodline of Chuck-O. Yeah. Chuck-Chuck-O Sidlow has been

632
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,920
clowning around. Is this a... This is not a real clown, is it? No, it is. Oh, it is. It's a Barnum

633
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,760
Bailey clown. I thought that was fiction. Oh, it is. I thought it was a book. Chuck Sidlow's

634
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:48,800
amazing story as told to Judy Pichelle Van Tegen. So this is Chuck-Chuck-O Sidlow. Yeah.

635
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,480
And he's from New Jersey. He became the youngest boss clown of the greatest show on earth.

636
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,680
This is about his life after the circus. Yeah. Okay. So he was the boss of the circus. Yes.

637
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,480
This Chuck-O. That Chuck-O. But not Randy... So I had to correct myself and I went and I found

638
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,560
that file. So you get all of it. I do get the book though, even though it's not about this Chuck-O.

639
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,600
Is this... What is this in the... Are you reading it? Why is there a... That was just the packing

640
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,600
slip. Oh, I thought it was like a receipt for laundromat or something. You can use it as a

641
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,160
bookmark. Okay. I know you love self-published clown literature.

642
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:32,720
It says on the front, it says destiny or a gift from God. And then it's a drawing of a clown with

643
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,440
a picture frame and you can see his head through the picture frame. That's what all the clown

644
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,680
teachers in Los Angeles say in their first class. Is this destiny or a gift from God?

645
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,760
Yeah. And he's really like, he's kind of like hunched over. And it's like, it's like a child

646
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,280
drew the front of it. No offense to if this is like, if Judy Pochelle Van Tiegen drew this,

647
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,960
I apologize. It does look like an art class painting. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I guess

648
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,120
I got a lot of work to do. I mean, we've been... Okay. I don't know if Scott will listen to this

649
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,400
at this point. I think this has been a pretty good episode, but... I think so too.

650
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:14,880
I... Well, Chucko will show up this year. I'll declare that. Chucko will be on

651
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:21,280
the podcast again. Not him necessarily. Maybe. I don't think there's been a younger Runyon

652
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,040
that's taken up the mantle. Well, they're both long dead. The father and son. I don't think the

653
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:35,120
grandson took it over. Yes. Yes. But okay. So thank you for that. There's one thing and I'm

654
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,920
stumbling all over myself because there is one thing else I wanted to bring up and I guess I

655
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,280
will. You know, we love our influencers. This is another zone. This is another Scott-free zone,

656
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,960
I feel like. Sure. It's sort of internet people making little videos that are not necessarily

657
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,920
comedic. They just decide they have a thing and they go for it. There's a lot of food reviewers.

658
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:02,320
Right. We like Costco guys. We like Luke's foods. You know him? Yes, I know him. And dang, it's Wayne.

659
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:11,440
There's the Maryland boys. Yes. What is their thing? They're like doing podcasts now. Okay.

660
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:18,240
But they were talking about different buffalo wing sauces they do or don't like. Okay. I don't know

661
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:24,400
if I follow them. There's of course Shirley Temple King who's been around for a while. He's a little

662
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:29,920
boy that tries the Shirley Temples. But then he does other stuff too. But Shirley Temple is not

663
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:36,800
the child who looks at stores lights turning on and off. No, that's a different one. That's Anthony

664
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:41,040
Geo was the one who told me about him. Okay. And I can't think of what his name is off the top,

665
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:48,160
but he'll wait outside like say a Ross or like a TJ Maxx at a mall and he waits for the lights to

666
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:53,920
turn off. And that's sort of a big moment. But I found a new one and plenty of people have found

667
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,120
this. I'm not saying I'm first like I am when it comes to Ducky, but I think you should know

668
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,400
specifically about this because I think you should either steal his bit or should go back in time

669
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:13,040
and try it. Okay. I am talking about my new follow on Instagram, Retro Samuel. Retro Samuel

670
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,120
looks to be a guy in his maybe early 20s. He could even be late teens. He looks young,

671
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:26,960
but his whole thing is buying old clothing like from the 20s and 30s and wearing it and then

672
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:34,480
posting like him in sort of an old like fedora and long coat looking wistfully into the snow

673
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:42,880
as an old song plays. Wow. And he's even got a picture that he's made black and white with him

674
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:50,880
and a little Mickey Mouse. And I don't know what country he's from. He seems to be European.

675
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:58,560
Somewhere in Europe is what I'm saying is where he's from. But this really should have been what you

676
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,880
did maybe with your life in general. And this is different than the like men's wear guy on Twitter,

677
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,360
the die work guy who it's a little more straight forward. It's a little more actual historical

678
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,200
stuff and modern stuff. Right. This guy will just, Retro Samuel will just put on like high

679
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:24,000
waisted pants and an old dress shirt that you would see like a president in 1920 where.

680
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,640
I gotta tell you, I hate high waisted pants. Do you really? My parents both were so like,

681
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:37,920
you wear your, excuse me, you wear your pants around your belly button and I'm like,

682
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,920
this is so uncomfortable. Like your natural waist is low. Like that's where I wear my pants,

683
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,520
where they sit naturally. Do you have like picture day where you were wearing like your pants up to

684
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:57,200
your belly button? I, well, I don't know. I don't think I have full, um, full body shots in the

685
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:05,600
first grade. No, I, I think it's like a chest up basically. Okay. But I'm, I'm interested because

686
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,000
I don't think, I don't remember like having a fight with my parents about how high my pants need

687
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,440
to go to my belly button. That didn't, I don't think they were like that. Yeah. So I don't,

688
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:22,400
I think it's just a matter of taste and tailoring and stuff. And I think it's just

689
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:30,480
my mother buying the same dockers at Sears or Boscov's for everyone at the mall. But let me ask

690
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,040
you this, would you, would you wear the Retro Samuel like this short tie? Cause that was the

691
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,360
style a hundred years ago. So were those short ties? Yeah, I don't mind the tie. I mean, I,

692
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:47,680
pretty slim ties caught on in the 2010s. And yeah, I had a few of them, but like,

693
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,640
I feel like there's a common ground now between a fat tie and a skinny. There's a medium tie.

694
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:02,160
There's a medium, you know, and I, I was never really a tie guy. I much would rather wear a

695
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,080
jacket and no tie as opposed to a tie and no jacket. I'm trying, I am trying to find,

696
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:16,560
I may have sent you, there is a channel on YouTube where a guy dresses like an old detective sitting

697
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:25,680
at a desk. It introduces like public domain film, the war, even I were sending those back and forth.

698
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,600
But it's very much like a old detective version of Svenguli. Right. That's good. I like that gimmick.

699
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,680
Yeah. So what I'm hearing from you is that you don't really want to be like Retro Jason on

700
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:46,000
Instagram. Well, no, it seems like he's, you know, got a good thing going. Yeah. But are we funny if

701
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,800
all of a sudden, like an older man stole his gimmick. Wren just said, it's a Retro Jason

702
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,800
and you start wearing high-waisted pants and then like, well, in the mood played in the background.

703
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,000
Like that would be funny. I mean, I guess I don't want to start a fight. He seems like a nice,

704
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,960
a nice young man. So I guess I don't want to weird him out. But I appreciate you letting me know.

705
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,440
But you should follow Retro Samuel. Yeah, I will. Like he'll come back. Yeah. Follow him right now.

706
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,920
And then just, I like, I like his idea because I, what I like about the influencer types and

707
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,760
he's got like 180,000 followers. He really doesn't need our help at this point probably.

708
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:30,400
But I like about the followers is they can really just like find a very simple thing and do it.

709
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,320
You know, it doesn't, it doesn't need too much to be somebody that I'm going to be obsessive about

710
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:42,480
on Instagram. Yeah. And he looks like he's doing it for fun, you know, for the love of the game.

711
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:47,600
Yeah. He has a Patreon too. Does he? Yes, he does. Does he post exclusive photos?

712
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:54,080
I haven't investigated what, you know, what would be really good for him to do on Patreon is he

713
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,280
would post photos in modern clothes. So it's like, yeah, you know, that would be funny. What's free

714
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,520
is me in the old clothes, but if you want to see me wearing a Looney Tunes t-shirt, you got to pay.

715
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:13,680
I Looney Tunes with Bugs Bunny wearing a chain and baggy jeans and stuff. Right. Yeah. A supreme

716
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,480
shirt is behind the paywall. That's behind the Patreon. Yeah. Oh, it looks like you just get

717
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,760
early access to the posts. Like I can see he's wearing like some old sweat, old style sweaters

718
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,000
like he's dressed like maybe Jimmy Stewart or something. And it's a wonderful life.

719
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,120
That's clever. I mean, it's a miracle that he's found this much in this good of shape.

720
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,800
Yeah. Oh, there's some, but he has bloopers too. He's got some bloopers on the Patreon as well.

721
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:44,080
We should do that on our Patreon, have some bloopers, all the mistakes we make that we edit out.

722
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,160
Oh yeah. Just tripping over things and hitting our heads on microphones. Yeah.

723
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:59,920
I don't drink seltzer or soda when I record anymore because I feel like it gives me gas.

724
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:06,960
I feel like it makes me burp. I hear that. And I do enough of that to be in with. You're burping

725
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,880
enough to be off mic. Yeah. I'm like moving away from the mic. Yeah. Well, look, I've tried to get,

726
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,440
yeah, if you have too much soda, I feel like sometimes my stomach these days, I can't have

727
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:24,800
two sodas in a day anymore. That's over. Now I can if I had to. If the fate of the world depended on

728
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:31,600
me having two sodas, I could have two. Yeah. Well, hey, we've got a Cherry Coke Zero and Sprite Zero

729
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,320
in the fridge. Help yourself if you want any. Well, we've got another episode to record. So

730
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:43,520
maybe on that second episode we will do it. But as for today's episode, I think you, the listener,

731
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:50,320
have survived podcast the ride at this point. Yes. But follow Retro Samuel. Follow Disneyland Magic

732
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:58,000
Key so you can keep up on what's going on with Ducky. And just keep this in the back of your mind.

733
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,160
Chucko is coming. I'm not going to say when. I'm not going to say where. I mean, probably October.

734
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:10,240
But I'm not going to say exactly when or exactly where. But just keep your eyes peeled for

735
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:17,680
Chucko from Los Angeles TV, not Chucko from the Barnum and Bailey Circus. Yeah.
