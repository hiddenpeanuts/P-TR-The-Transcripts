1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Forever.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,240
Dog.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,160
Three massive dorks, all scared and yellow, stuck in the past.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,680
They're stunted fellows, two hours of talk, mixed with some dick pill ads, and then voila!

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,020
It's a podcast.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,620
Why hello!

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Today we're talking about a beloved ride with a new friend.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,320
Can he imagine two?

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,040
Of course he can, Jason.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,540
His name is Derek Waters, and today on Podcast the Ride, we're all going to discuss the original

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,140
1983 Journey intoâ€¦

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,760
Imagination.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,720
Imagination.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,540
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks with two hosts who love their

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,780
children but also kind of wish they were little purple dragons.

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm Scott Gardner, there's my Carlson.

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,500
Why did you say it out loud?

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,620
That's the only thing.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,860
Now that's going to be recorded and will be played in a therapist's office.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,360
I've been feeling that from you, Ferl.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,760
That's been the unspoken thing.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,340
Of course parenting is great.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,440
How's it being a dad?

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm like, it's good.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,340
It's nice.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,860
Nothing surprising.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,540
It's just babies.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,960
They are what they are.

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,680
They can't make things appear with a wink or a smile.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,180
They didn't come out the gate sounding like 60-year-old men.

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,180
Jason Sheridan, hi.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,600
Hi.

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,680
Unfortunately, you'll have to settle for me.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,520
I'm the closest thing to a whimsical childlike purple dragon.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,280
The imp of the show.

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,760
Yeah, that's fine.

37
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,340
I don't know how we haven't made you do that costume anywhere.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,360
Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
That'll be to come.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,760
Oh, sure.

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,220
Yeah.

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,140
Okay, well, file that away for later.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
Guys, it's a big one.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,220
We're at a big one here.

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,800
I was about to say this is a big one.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,900
We've been like, not actively kicking down the curb, but you know, it's special bottles.

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,940
You want to open them when it's special.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,780
This is like my bottle of Scottie Pippen's Digits bourbon that I haven't opened yet.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,520
That's right.

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,240
It's not open yet.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,860
It's still sitting on the shelves.

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,260
Scottie Pippen's, not purse, well, it is.

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,200
Yeah, it's his brand of whiskey, basically.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,180
Private label.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,380
Private label.

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,900
Digits.

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,660
It's got his hand on it.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,400
Do you have any sense of like, is Digits well reviewed?

59
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,700
Are you even going to be like, is it a good bottle?

60
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,120
Outside of like a three month period where Scottie Pippen was promoting it heavily, I

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,460
have not heard a thing about it.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I don't know if they're still making it.

63
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,020
I don't know what's going on.

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,860
I've much more recently seen him promoting a popcorn that he doesn't own.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,720
Like, it's not his like Scottie's popcorn or anything.

66
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,240
But I have not seen any more Digits stuff.

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,380
But he could be making more money endorsement wise than as an investor.

68
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,440
Because that might, maybe there's weird expenses that cut into that.

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,140
Yeah, I don't know anything about his deals, but.

70
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,300
Digits is dead to him.

71
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, I do think maybe he did a grocery store signing of Digits in the last year, now that

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,580
I'm thinking about it.

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,740
But that was maybe the last time I like consciously clocked a Digits.

74
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,860
That's in Chicago, though?

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,080
I think it was here, actually.

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,420
Oh my god, what were you doing?

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,120
Did you find out after the fact?

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,080
I think my daughter was maybe like very, like two weeks old or something, and it was not

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,440
an appropriate time to go drive to like Thousand Oaks or something.

80
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,560
More kids complaints.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,540
They're not dragons.

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,280
They get in the way of your Digits signings.

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
I guess if she could have met Scottie Pippen, that would have been pretty cool, though.

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Oh yeah, imagine her, a newborn baby next to, in his Digits.

85
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,100
Oh wow.

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah.

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,160
That is pretty good.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
That would be incredible scale.

89
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,560
Any fully grown person, but Scottie Pippen especially.

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,100
Tall guy.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,380
Okay, let's not distract anymore from, let's say the words.

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,400
Let's say what we're doing.

93
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,420
It's Journey into Imagination.

94
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:19,240
The classic, the beloved, original Epcot Dark Ride that ran from 1983 to 1998, and we have

95
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,780
arrived at this juncture due to a new friend on the show who I'm so excited is here.

96
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:34,820
His imagination helped him create and host the smash hit Comedy Central series Drunk History.

97
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,780
A writer, director, actor, a good man, a theme park fan, Derek Waters is here.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
Thank you guys, I'm so excited.

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,940
This is such a dream come true.

100
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,160
Oh man, a dream come true.

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,640
Just one little spark.

102
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm so excited.

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,540
Thank you so much.

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,740
One little spark from you saying, can I do this?

105
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,360
I don't know if anybody's, or we've like, either you're the first who's actually called

106
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,540
Journey into Imagination or it's been in other people's emails and we've been like,

107
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't know if we're ready.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,960
No, we're not ready.

109
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm not sure.

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,680
Somebody probably has mentioned it, but I can't remember.

111
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,040
I think I've blocked it out of my memory.

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah, maybe.

113
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,460
But we're opening this bottle of digits for you.

114
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm so excited to be part of these digits and do a signing at a grocery store.

115
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,180
I've never heard of signing at a grocery store.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,280
All the guys are doing, Mark Wahlberg is signing his liquor at a grocery store.

117
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,980
Cranston and Paul, they go to the grocery stores, they sign.

118
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,080
Makes sense, that's where you buy it.

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,180
Makes sense.

120
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,080
In some states.

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,700
In some states, right?

122
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
No, but this is such a dream come true.

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,300
I love the show, I love you guys.

125
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,220
I don't think so.

126
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm very excited to journey with you guys.

127
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,740
Oh boy.

128
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,140
Not into your imagination.

129
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,920
Well, we could, we'll see.

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,480
I've already brought a side-pip in.

131
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,520
We'll see where it goes.

132
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,140
Now that the spark's been lit, I mean, I think we gotta go into your imagination a little

133
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:02,740
bit, or at least your interests and fascinations, because as we've gotten to know each other

134
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,680
over the last year, which has been great, I think a real bonding point and a reason

135
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,560
why I feel like mutual friends were like, you guys gotta talk, because big theme park

136
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,880
persons, feel free, anything else, anything within general theme park you wanna shout

137
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,660
out and talk about, feel free.

138
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:28,780
But there's specifically the thing of like, kind of what this ride is, which is 80s animatronic

139
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,740
fever dreams.

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,940
curious if it will stump the listener, but I wanted to give you a little bit of a platform

141
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:50,060
to talk about your, there's Figment, our 80s animatronic friend, but then you had a really

142
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,540
specific one where you grew up.

143
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,620
If you wanna talk about him and that a little bit.

144
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,240
Wait, wait, wait.

145
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,640
I had one growing.

146
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, you mean the one I still have?

147
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,380
I mean the, oh, I'm talking about the Baltimore specific animatronic location that you were

148
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,000
passionate about.

149
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:18,560
So I remember I went to Disney World maybe in like 2018.

150
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,300
And I just had this animatronic memory.

151
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,600
I was like, I remember this old guy, Captain Andy, but I was like, what was that place?

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,830
And my mom said, oh, it was only around for like three years, but I had such a fascination

153
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,520
of this place.

154
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,860
And as I researched and found out, there were only three.

155
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,830
There was one in Baltimore.

156
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:50,110
There was one in Seattle and one in California, which I don't know where it was, but what

157
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,050
happened more than what I saw, like, wood and Whittier kind of like odd, nondescript

158
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,110
South Bay OC kind of cities.

159
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah.

160
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,890
So I would love for listener knows about this because so I felt I was writing a show about

161
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:12,810
with animatronics and I was like, I don't know where this is going, but I feel like

162
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,610
this old dog that played the banjo he had band come out with them and like this beautiful

163
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,290
stage.

164
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,910
I mean, beautiful stage and like Mike and Jason, by the way, and listeners look up photos

165
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:32,010
of this place if you wish, because just to get the Captain Andy's River Town, right,

166
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,750
is the full that's the establishment.

167
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,230
Because it's this like it is so precisely what all of us want and chase, but it just

168
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,750
wasn't enough of them to for tons of people to know about it.

169
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,170
Yeah.

170
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,990
So I was thinking, you know, I want to do a show that has these animatronics in the

171
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,250
style of Captain Andy.

172
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,490
And so I found this place.

173
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,250
It's a Gardner Belt down in Redlands.

174
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,990
Gardner.

175
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,690
Yeah.

176
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,670
Yeah.

177
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,970
So I went down there and they gave me a tour and the guy goes, I don't know if I ever told

178
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,530
you this.

179
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:13,610
He goes, we're thinking about making an old like Hall of Fame of like animatronics.

180
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,150
And have you guys ever heard of Captain Andy's River Town?

181
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,290
And I just said, shut up.

182
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,890
He goes, yeah, not a lot of people have.

183
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,350
And he goes, that's Captain Andy from Baltimore.

184
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,330
Whoa.

185
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:36,530
So I'm looking at this very old crooked one eyed dog with still like with the hat on.

186
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,070
And it was, I like almost cried, like looking at this most beautiful thing that I was like,

187
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,970
this, this machine gave me such joy as a kid and just like looking at it.

188
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,130
And so you can edit some of this stuff out.

189
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,370
Sorry.

190
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,590
But so I was really excited.

191
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,590
The emotion about an animatronic will never be cut from the show.

192
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,030
Yeah.

193
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,410
Well, I've also learned why I cried too.

194
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,730
Not in general, but about animatronics.

195
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,730
But I got home and I was like, I don't know where this idea is going, but it's going somewhere

196
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,970
and Captain Andy's leaving me.

197
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:20,110
So I found the blueprint of the original layout of the stage and I online and the guy says,

198
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,230
Hey, when you, when this comes to your house, do you mind calling me?

199
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,690
And I said, Oh, not at all.

200
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,110
And so I called him and I said, Hey, thank you so much.

201
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,750
It arrived.

202
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,390
It's beautiful.

203
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,570
It was like all the like blueprints of the act, the original Captain Andy.

204
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,170
And I, I told him briefly what I've said to you.

205
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,570
That was like writing something that really felt like he was inspiring me.

206
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,930
And he goes, I just want to know what was this?

207
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,950
And I go, wait, you sold me something you don't know.

208
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:55,130
And he goes, yeah, the guy who created this just passed away.

209
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,310
And I am a huge Jaws fan and I buy everything Jaws.

210
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,850
And he designed the ride of Jaws.

211
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,810
And his family just gave me all his belongings that they didn't know what to do with.

212
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:16,510
So when you bought this a day after I put it online, I just thought I should give you a call.

213
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,990
And then I told him a little more how much that meant to me.

214
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,490
He goes, you know what?

215
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,470
I have something that I think only you would like.

216
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,730
I'll send it to you for free.

217
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,310
And like a week later, I get the script of Captain Andy's River Town.

218
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,610
It says, creators notes do not lose.

219
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,170
And it has all of the like signals for what the animatronics should be doing during which song.

220
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,570
And it was, I was just so touched by that.

221
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,990
Like it really moved me of like, that was really nice.

222
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,470
And I don't know, I believe in like that thing when ideas start sparking.

223
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:59,730
I'm not trying to be funny, but that you get signs like, all right, this is the odds of that happening are just insane.

224
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,050
To connect with this guy, him not even knowing what he had, the guy just passed away.

225
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,690
Wow.

226
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,730
When he just put it up like the day before you bought it, basically?

227
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:18,070
And that was just a coincidence because I just after going to Redland, I was like, oh, I'm going to look up Captain Andy stuff.

228
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,870
That's a crazy coincidence.

229
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,250
Yeah, it was nuts.

230
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,630
I gave you a wallet.

231
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,450
I have a wallet.

232
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,390
Yeah, yeah, I know.

233
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,070
It's on the mantle still.

234
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,550
It's awesome.

235
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,150
And you look, it's just like such a like the like Captain Andy himself is design.

236
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,950
It feels like very classic.

237
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,270
It's not even classic.

238
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,890
It feels specifically like kind of 80s Disney design or Chuck E.

239
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,890
Cheese design or Rock of Fire.

240
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,330
Yes, all before.

241
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,050
It's just this whole package is like, how has this eluded me?

242
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,270
I purely because I didn't grow up with it.

243
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,730
And if you look at the dogs in there, I don't know if you have it, but I'll send you guys a picture.

244
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,350
Maybe you can put on your site.

245
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,750
You see a lot of it.

246
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:06,850
I believe he was a imagineer briefly that dog's ears and a lot of their faces remind me of America sings big time.

247
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,290
Yeah, yeah.

248
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,490
And I'm not sure.

249
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,330
I feel like one was probably going after the other.

250
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,450
You know how those things.

251
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,330
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,150
Influencers.

253
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,410
Yeah, yeah, that's that like because I also know they're like singing Dixie songs.

254
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,310
So I do want to let your audience know like there are things that are usually.

255
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,470
Yeah, we run into that plenty.

256
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:27,870
Yes.

257
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,710
Yeah, that happens.

258
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,130
We're lucky Figment doesn't.

259
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,810
Right.

260
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,990
We are.

261
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,090
We are.

262
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,550
Yes.

263
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:41,050
Let me ask because your your passion for Captain Andy and then we're talking about journey into imagination.

264
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,150
Since you mentioned Baltimore, did you ever see Six Flags power plant?

265
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,570
Do you know what that is?

266
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,110
I do.

267
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,490
Yeah.

268
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,770
And my mom.

269
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,050
Oh, it's so real.

270
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,990
She goes, I remember when that was up, but we didn't want to go down.

271
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,150
But I'm like, I'm pretty sure my grandmother took me.

272
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,270
I'm embarrassed.

273
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,130
I just admitted that.

274
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,590
But it's funny because I recently was talking about that with someone.

275
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,330
And I think that's like I was born in seventy nine.

276
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,910
I think that comes out like eighty three, eighty seven.

277
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,350
I'm not positive.

278
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,770
But very short amount.

279
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,090
Yeah.

280
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,390
My family did a number of long weekend trips to the inner harbor.

281
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,610
But at that point, it was a Barnes and Noble and Hard Rock Cafe.

282
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:30,990
Right.

283
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,410
Yes.

284
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,730
And the ESPN zone.

285
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,050
Yeah.

286
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,450
Yeah.

287
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,470
And ESPN zone.

288
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,290
And then this giant aquarium is next to it.

289
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,590
And there are some shopping malls, which, of course, at this point in the 2020s are dying.

290
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,470
Yes.

291
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,790
Yeah.

292
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,530
Now those are.

293
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,130
Now you're pining for those.

294
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,450
But yeah, that there was this like magical that place.

295
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,090
We still got to do an episode about that.

296
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,670
That like like a completely original IP.

297
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,010
No other park like that is weird, indoor converted power plant or industrial zone.

298
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,590
That's really singular.

299
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,910
Kind of like a carnival.

300
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,470
Like a yeah.

301
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,670
Kind of like they were trying a lot of different stuff.

302
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,770
They had like leeway to try a lot of different things and like little bits and bobs.

303
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:20,790
Would end up in like the Adventures Club down the road, a pleasure island, you know,

304
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,430
or or the technology would show up elsewhere.

305
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:24,870
Right.

306
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:32,290
But it was just kind of like Epcot Center in general, where it's like, well, it's something kind of new.

307
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,630
It's kind of a world's fair.

308
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,710
It's kind of an exhibition.

309
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,890
It's not exactly a theme park.

310
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,090
So kind of quickly.

311
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,850
I think on a really short term basis with power plant, they're like, we don't know what to do with this.

312
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,770
It's not making money.

313
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,730
We got to close it.

314
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,470
No precedent for.

315
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:48,910
Yeah.

316
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,490
Indoor theme parks.

317
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,830
It's just always a tough, tough game.

318
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,750
Especially if they aren't like super ride oriented.

319
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,070
But anyway, I Captain Andy wise listeners, if you this I was saying before we did this,

320
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,510
I'm like, if you talk about this on the show, 98 percent of listeners won't know what it is,

321
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,970
but two percent are listening and they're like buzzing like he knows that.

322
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,770
Wait, I've never heard that reference anywhere.

323
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,530
So you have listeners, do you have any Captain Andy info, extra stuff?

324
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,010
And then maybe we could dive in deeper down the road.

325
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,270
Although it seems like Derek, you were by default.

326
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,550
You have now become like the keeper of the legend of Captain Andy.

327
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,030
You have a lot of tokens.

328
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,550
I will give you guys tokens.

329
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,330
Oh, wow.

330
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,150
Yes.

331
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,690
But I also remember learning that what happened was they spent so much money on the facility.

332
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:51,170
Like I don't have the exact measurements, but there was a very big facility like with food, mini golf and and then the show.

333
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,330
But they didn't put any money into employees that understood animatronics.

334
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,710
Oh crap.

335
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,270
Yeah.

336
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,490
So if you don't have that show, they're just eating pizza and miniature golf.

337
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,450
So I think that's they just didn't.

338
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,670
There is a clip.

339
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,130
I'm sure you probably saw it.

340
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,830
And I thought, oh, that's the line.

341
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,690
The selling point.

342
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:21,130
When I came to Baltimore, the guy, it's a news reel and the guy goes, yeah, we want to bring a theme park to your neighborhood.

343
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,490
Like that was what their goal was.

344
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,590
Which is so many wonderful people were trying to do this in the 80s and 90s.

345
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,890
Yeah.

346
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,990
All these various hits.

347
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,530
But they would everybody was trying to do everyone wanted one.

348
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:33,770
Yeah.

349
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,250
Around the corner like a little show.

350
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:44,730
Do you think I've as I'm getting older, I'm like, I always forget and I'm going to convert this to what we're talking about as out here doing this business.

351
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,590
I'm like, oh, there are people that didn't want to achieve this for passion.

352
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,950
There are people that wanted to do this for the business and that frightens me.

353
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:05,010
And I'm like, this might be similar to that, where this guy looked at Disney or some show that he was like, you know what?

354
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,250
I could make a fortune, you know, with with this.

355
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,890
And it's like, no, you didn't think about it.

356
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:18,870
You got to take your time and go like, all right, if you're going to have and I believe it's close to 15 to 70 animatronics like on stage.

357
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:27,230
Like you should invest in knowing how to fix that if they were to go one guy with a wrench would be good to.

358
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,910
Yeah, they got the right people to build it all.

359
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,870
And then just write and never know plan for upkeep.

360
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,330
And then you see in London is where they have a Captain Andy.

361
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,850
Yeah, they landed in.

362
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,290
Yeah.

363
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,030
Somewhere called Watermouth Castle.

364
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,370
That is the place where you can.

365
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,630
So it's still there.

366
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,330
You can still see him perform.

367
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,950
Yeah, it's just him.

368
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,590
And I think like a couple of side characters who are in like creepy glass, like they're in fish tanks.

369
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,050
Yeah, they aren't in there like the they're in the set that you have the blueprints for.

370
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,630
They're trapped like the guardians of the galaxy.

371
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,170
Oh, yeah.

372
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,350
I mentioned.

373
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,130
Yeah.

374
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,270
I wonderful.

375
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:13,270
But isn't that always I think the push and pull with Disney, too, to this day is like there's always there.

376
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,890
Like have to be the crass people who just want to make a lot of money.

377
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:24,410
But if that can empower the artists to do something really heartfelt, that's that's that's all that matters.

378
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:35,830
The inspiration and with animatronics, I think and it goes in with figment is like as I was looking at this, you know,

379
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,150
I think the most demented Captain Andy that they were trying to restore the reality.

380
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:50,990
I think my favorite thing of animatronics is this inanimate object just made me feel.

381
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:59,230
Yeah, it's it's actually like I think I don't the word dumb is very lazy, but it kind of works.

382
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:07,330
And it's like it's like this stupid machine is making like, I don't know,

383
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,010
like when like the country bears sing like a Beach Boys song, like I always will find that funny.

384
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,910
Like it's not real.

385
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,890
And I think when you're a kid, everyone has that memory of like, Mom, that is that real?

386
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:20,770
Is that real?

387
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,470
Like trying to figure out if something is real or not.

388
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,850
I think that's one of our first like discoveries as children.

389
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,570
And with them, you're like, I still don't know.

390
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,170
When I watch like a really cool animatronic, I think I believe they're real.

391
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,950
It's still a part of you.

392
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:38,650
Well, I don't know.

393
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,210
I don't know.

394
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,170
But then I watch rocket fire explosion and I'm just like, oh, man, this makes me so happy.

395
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:52,630
I'm when I first moved here, they were selling one of the sets and it was like the whole rocket fire.

396
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,850
Well, yeah, I believe like it was a good amount of money.

397
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,090
And my dad has a tire supply store in Baltimore.

398
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:07,250
I was like, Dad, if I lived in an apartment with no money, I was like, if I could afford this, could I keep it in your warehouse?

399
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,770
He's like, you've lost your mind.

400
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:17,430
I was like, Dad, but just imagine being depressed and then going outside and watching a gorilla play the drums that led Zeppelin.

401
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,770
Like that would just be so awesome.

402
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,650
He was still feeling the same way.

403
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:35,110
It's the only thing where this is the only area where like I don't think that that belongings can give you happiness except for this kind of stuff.

404
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,450
It's the only I would never not laugh at that.

405
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,370
They would never get like, oh, I used to find animatronics funny.

406
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,890
Like there's never I'm never going to say that.

407
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:51,030
No, no, no, this is not this is not my animatronic phase from zero to forty four.

408
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,590
Yeah, right.

409
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,550
A forty five is typically the cut off.

410
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,550
Yeah, scientifically, that's when the animatronic part of the brain fizzes out.

411
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:08,810
I got absolutely and I don't know if you know the extent to which like you're rotting Captain Andy just reminds me of listeners certainly know this.

412
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:15,750
But like there's listeners and we all have a lot of affinity for this character, Botanicus, who is from the E.

413
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,870
T.

414
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,770
adventure, the E.

415
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:16,870
T.

416
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,230
at Universal Studios, E.

417
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,930
T.

418
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,530
's teacher.

419
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,630
And like the whole all the rides, all the rides there were great of all the things.

420
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,210
There's plenty of successful things at Universal Studios, but there's something so special about Botanicus specifically.

421
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,730
Yeah.

422
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,530
And this will tie into figma just like and it's a character you can only meet in this specific place or these two specific places.

423
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:46,930
And when I got a job as a Universal tour guide, one of the first days I saw the rotting corpse of Botanicus sitting backstage, like around a corner unquestionably.

424
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,350
That is what I recognized in an instant just without the skin.

425
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,750
It is so obviously.

426
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,730
And he's got his big staff and his like orb.

427
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:06,510
And just with the feelings, the feelings I got about it and just what that did to me and then that it literally helped my wife and I get together because she came to take my tour.

428
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,890
And I broke the rules of the park so that I was like, I want to show you something.

429
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,130
And I didn't know she had the same affinity and she almost.

430
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:15,930
Show you the world.

431
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:16,690
Wow.

432
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,110
She was a friend I knew.

433
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,750
And then like.

434
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,050
Well, she was either never going to talk to you again or marry you.

435
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,470
Yeah.

436
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,450
A thousand percent.

437
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,790
Yes.

438
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,110
That's the Botanicus test.

439
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,890
Better shoot your shot.

440
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,410
It's like flipping a coin.

441
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,230
You know, you're getting one of two options.

442
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,290
So mad.

443
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:43,510
But then like some of the most important relationships, that one and then Botanicus is completely is what brought Mike and I together, which is the brother Jason.

444
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:50,110
And like so there's there are there is particular magic, I think, to I'm just so happy to learn about yours that you have.

445
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,470
You've had it for Captain Andy.

446
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,030
We've had it for Botanicus.

447
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,990
And I think probably a lot of people listening have it for Figment.

448
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,930
There are so many like visually like I have a wall of toys.

449
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,350
And if you saw what this wall looked like, you would think I was something's wrong.

450
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,430
This guy's.

451
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,650
That's fair.

452
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,350
Most people, normal people would come in and say, oh, oh, yeah, something wrong.

453
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,730
I did it until we started doing the zoom episodes.

454
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,150
And I was like, that is a lot of times.

455
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,630
Yeah, no, it's too many.

456
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,170
It's too many.

457
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,750
But here's the problem is that what you're describing is what I feel when I see these.

458
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,690
And these are perfect recreations of things that that hit me when I was five, six, seven years old.

459
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,830
Tell me what I said that reminds you of that.

460
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,910
You were talking about how happy the animatronic makes you.

461
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:44,990
And in a similar way, I was I find that like literally I can feel I almost can feel it in a practical way in my mind of like I'm looking at this thing that I saw when I was a kid and it is just giving me this joy.

462
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:53,890
And you can like I can go in there and just get a hit of it like I go in the office, literally get a hit of the toy, put like move them around a little bit and then leave.

463
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,510
And I go a little bit better.

464
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,450
You don't need to pick a favorite.

465
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,170
But if can you at least who's in the top five?

466
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,710
Just name.

467
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,250
I have Billy Bob from the rocket fire explosion.

468
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,290
I have a Billy Bob.

469
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,190
It's like I actually have two.

470
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,210
I have one and there's one smaller one.

471
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,730
The head.

472
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,970
But no, no, just.

473
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,490
Well, the head's recreation.

474
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,030
It's a recreation.

475
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,970
How tall?

476
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,410
I have one that's like almost probably 10 inches.

477
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,790
And then there's one that's still in the box.

478
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,430
It's like four.

479
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,590
I don't know if they're making more.

480
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,850
And you went to party time pizza.

481
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,810
I never saw Billy Bob live, but I I never got to see the rocket fire live.

482
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,430
Those regrets.

483
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,590
You know, I never saw Bowie and I never saw.

484
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,190
I never saw Paul Simon before he retired.

485
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,110
I never said Billy Bob.

486
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,630
He retired.

487
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,450
I'm hearing this for the first time right now.

488
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,350
Paul Simon retired.

489
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,710
I didn't know.

490
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,710
Last night I chose rocket fire instead of Tom Petty.

491
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,290
I saw petty second to last night and he died.

492
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,150
I saw Tom Petty second to last night.

493
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,250
We're before the last concert.

494
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,750
And I saw Mike Nesmith from Monkeys last concert.

495
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,190
Wow.

496
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,950
The literal literal last concert.

497
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,450
You shouldn't tell someone that story when they play a concert.

498
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,210
But if I'm like, hey, I want to let you know.

499
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,830
Everyone dies.

500
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,790
I'm the angel of death.

501
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,290
Want to see my choice?

502
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,450
So excited.

503
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,150
So excited.

504
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,050
Young person.

505
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,490
We deal with it.

506
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,670
We have a class as the PTR.

507
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,450
We kill a lot of people by bringing them up.

508
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,550
I think we all have to defend it.

509
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,170
And I just want to say it probably always comes up.

510
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,310
But just to say it's like we only are here for a little while.

511
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,410
Let's get the thing.

512
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,150
There are they are material things.

513
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,710
But if it brings you joy and clearly something happened in our childhood that wasn't working.

514
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,970
But that helped us.

515
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:27,890
Sure.

516
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,250
Yeah.

517
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,810
That was a helping pill.

518
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,430
That was a mechanism that that reminds us that things are going to be OK.

519
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,530
Surround yourself with things that remind you things are OK.

520
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah.

521
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,410
Yeah.

522
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,090
I agree.

523
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,990
That's beautiful.

524
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,530
I say that on every date.

525
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,850
That's your line.

526
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,570
You still have a figment.

527
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,150
OK.

528
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,730
In the last week, I have purchased multiple secondhand Planet Hollywood T-shirts.

529
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,190
Damn.

530
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,590
Oh, you've given it from us.

531
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,890
What is it that drives you there?

532
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,330
It was probably similar to figment.

533
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,730
I'm associating happy times with family.

534
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,950
Going to those places.

535
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,530
Be them.

536
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,610
Orlando or the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

537
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,850
The real hot spot of Hollywood.

538
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,430
Yeah.

539
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,190
It always just felt like an event.

540
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:22,890
Yeah.

541
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,090
And anything also because it's gone.

542
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,370
There's also that drive.

543
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,110
It's gone.

544
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,510
But it's also kind of hanging again, much like figment.

545
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,550
It's kind of hanging.

546
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,110
They still have.

547
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,330
There's still a little.

548
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,930
I didn't know that.

549
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,970
There's one or two Planet Hollywood's hanging on out there.

550
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,910
There's a few tricky.

551
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,550
One by one, they're going.

552
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,250
And so a lot of them have been remodeled.

553
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,530
So they aren't all the 90s velvet zebra pattern nightmare

554
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,710
that they were.

555
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,330
But there's a few.

556
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,090
There's a few hanging there.

557
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,830
When it opened in Baltimore, my parents dropped me off at noon.

558
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,750
And I stayed because I wanted to get a good seat for Bruce

559
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,090
Wallace playing the harmonica.

560
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,890
I wanted to be the opening of Baltimore.

561
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,130
Oh my gosh.

562
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,750
There you go.

563
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,170
Wow.

564
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,330
I love playing.

565
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,410
Also, it's like the world that we love and a restaurant.

566
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,210
Like it was great idea.

567
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,630
Yeah.

568
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,330
And it you know, especially in the late 80s, early 90s,

569
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,110
they were everyone was so good at selling the idea of Hollywood,

570
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,530
be it MGM studios or Planet Hollywood, like the magic of the movies.

571
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,530
But it like anything of that nature just like electrified me at that.

572
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,050
Yeah.

573
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,790
I will.

574
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,610
We will.

575
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,550
I will enforce going to journey after this.

576
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,550
But the do we all know about the the Planet Hollywood like temporary auction

577
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,730
gallery that's happening?

578
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,270
Yes.

579
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,250
As the as this airs, I believe this will be open and listeners to this in Beverly Hills.

580
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,130
I don't know what the deal is exactly.

581
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,350
And if it's the real stuff or if it's recreations, but I think this is going to be this gallery.

582
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,730
I'm going to tempt you, Derek, with things.

583
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:11,110
I think it's it'll be a place where you can like go see Stallone in the demolition man tube and like, you know, whatever.

584
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,710
We can go see him.

585
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,430
The like what recreation.

586
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,270
He'll do it.

587
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,050
Oh, no, I mean, not their life.

588
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:25,730
Yeah, there's there's a thing that all the Planet Hollywood had, which was like a Stallone curled up into a ball naked Stallone.

589
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,030
I remember that.

590
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,030
Well, they almost all you could like eat under it.

591
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,550
It would be hanging up above you.

592
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,150
Yeah.

593
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,990
And your multiple might be exit.

594
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,710
They obviously made multiple for many locations.

595
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,190
But basically, there's going to be this gallery in Beverly Hills, apparently, that where they're selling all this Planet Hollywood stuff.

596
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,490
And I don't know the deal with it yet.

597
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,570
By the time this comes out, I may have tried to go.

598
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,610
I'm not totally sure.

599
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,730
I'm trying to figure it out.

600
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,170
But like, hopefully, it is my hope that this will be like a temporary pop up Planet Hollywood to go walk around.

601
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,270
That sounds like really that's a good time.

602
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,830
Now, the jacket, though, I really like that jacket was so cool.

603
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,310
And you got two of them.

604
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:02,570
Awesome.

605
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,910
I got a couple of t shirts and a sweatshirt.

606
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,470
Oh, sorry.

607
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,830
So those don't know my jacket.

608
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,270
It's in the will probably.

609
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,650
It's the heirloom in the will.

610
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:20,410
We were talking about a while ago and he's like, well, I lost some weight recently, so I fit in it again.

611
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,690
Like, all right, fair enough.

612
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,410
All right.

613
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,770
You were asking about it.

614
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,610
You were you wanted to get it before.

615
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,330
Eating well.

616
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,750
Keep.

617
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,750
I keep.

618
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,690
He's lost weight.

619
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,790
I've gained weight.

620
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,050
So now it's like, well, at least someone's wearing it.

621
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,450
It'll it'll land where it's meant to land.

622
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,610
OK, let's start getting there.

623
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,530
Though I loved all of that.

624
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,930
And it's a perfect like texture to put into what you're talking about.

625
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,190
My last thing is I know.

626
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,510
Yeah.

627
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,130
Oh, please.

628
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,810
Planet Hollywood.

629
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:56,670
I went when I was 17, 18 and auditioned for the real world in Baltimore.

630
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,710
Oh, wow.

631
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,810
But I was like, now I look back, I'm like, I don't think there ever was a real world

632
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,130
Baltimore like I think I got conned.

633
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,910
To do what?

634
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,850
They just wanted to just interview what I'm like to man.

635
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,630
Oh, shit.

636
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,510
That might be where Figment comes in to save me.

637
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,830
From dark energy.

638
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,730
I just remembered they did DC.

639
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,950
Would that have been for maybe they're going to move it?

640
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,370
That would make sense.

641
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,870
That's why I mean, I just look the rest of it.

642
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,150
We could do an hour about I want to know about your Bruce Willis and the Accelerator concert.

643
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,650
But OK, because this is an important one, let's make sure that we do it.

644
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,070
Journey into imagination opens March 5th, 1983.

645
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,290
Cliff notes version in case because this is now it's been gone for a long time.

646
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:45,850
And there's this current thing that happens to have the same title and the same character.

647
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,090
But that's not what we're dealing with today.

648
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,770
Here's the rules.

649
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,490
It can come up.

650
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,330
We can talk about it.

651
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,690
But we're talking about the good one, the pure one that fits with the vibe we've had so far.

652
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:06,970
It is a dark ride that celebrates imagination and explores where ideas come from via hijinks with a whimsical professor type named Dreamfinder and a literal figment of his imagination.

653
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,770
A dragon named Figment, just to say the little cliff notes of it.

654
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,370
Not an opening day Epcot attraction.

655
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,290
It was a little bit late, but in that first year.

656
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,970
And we'll talk about the specific stuff in this and the history of it.

657
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,570
But I ask you now, Derek, why emotionally of all the things you could have picked?

658
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,810
Why Journey into Imagination?

659
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,570
It's the first ride or I would say first event.

660
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:40,810
I remember being with my family and feeling like I was somewhere else.

661
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,170
Whatever that does.

662
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,790
But I remember the music.

663
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:51,950
I remember his face and they had a Dreamfinder and a figment walking around the park and getting your picture taken.

664
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,290
It was actually this hand that figment.

665
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:54,790
Oh, yes.

666
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,250
Your pants.

667
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:55,610
Yeah.

668
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:01,290
Where he was like, yeah, the Dreamfinder has to be puppeteering and he's got like a fake arm bed to hold.

669
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:01,810
Right.

670
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,370
Incredible.

671
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:09,970
But I think there also is like almost like a Sesame Street feeling like where we're being entertained, but we're also being educated.

672
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:22,710
When I was like, yeah, this again, I'm six or seven, but I still think the brain registers like, oh, yeah, imagination is the coolest thing that we have the capability of doing.

673
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,090
And there's a ride and there's this guy flying like it really felt like you were flying.

674
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,790
And I like puff the magic dragon.

675
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,250
And he reminded me of puff.

676
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:32,650
Oh, sure.

677
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,070
Sure.

678
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,530
Yeah.

679
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,010
Not just the dragon qualities.

680
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:43,770
But and then you go back and you're like, oh, and it probably was because when we all got off the ride, I saw my family happy.

681
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,810
Let's be honest.

682
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,970
It probably was that.

683
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,490
Whoa.

684
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,750
Yeah.

685
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,130
Yeah.

686
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:56,630
I never hide that barrier of like, yeah, you're not 44 and you still like a purple dinosaur because like it's cool.

687
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,070
It did something.

688
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,730
And I love that.

689
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,070
They get fully opposed to this like clinically.

690
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,410
I've this is a cool thing.

691
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,770
Yeah, there's got to be an emotional.

692
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,310
Yeah.

693
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,230
But also it's not like no offense to small world.

694
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,590
Like there's like actual like arc that went into it.

695
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,310
Like it's very like, you know, when you're a kid, you're just seeing colors and stuff.

696
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:28,890
And then you watch this as an adult and you're like, man, they were really like educating you on like your brain, a dream finder that goes around and collects things that inspire your dreams.

697
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:33,210
No musical notes ideas like they're like colors.

698
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,310
And I don't know.

699
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:42,190
I just think whether you know it as a kid that that shapes you of going, OK, I don't have to like work in business.

700
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,250
Yeah.

701
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:43,610
Sure.

702
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,950
I don't have an imagination.

703
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,370
Do you feel like you can trace like a creative career back to like this and things like this?

704
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,170
I think.

705
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:52,610
Yeah.

706
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,530
I think without knowing it was just like, oh, yeah, this is when I feel good.

707
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,210
This is where I feel like, oh, I'm escaping whatever I'm in and getting this great joy.

708
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,130
And yeah, I also the music of this was so good.

709
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,430
The Sherman Brothers and then all right, we can't talk about the other one.

710
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,830
But it was 12 minute ride.

711
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,530
No, yeah.

712
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah.

713
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,770
I think it's it's just part of it at this point.

714
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:24,870
This like that there was this like crazy, ambitious, experimental, borderline psychedelic kind of ride.

715
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,070
And then ever since, there's been this strange impression of one.

716
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,570
It's a short.

717
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,890
Yeah, they cut it in half.

718
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,350
Yeah.

719
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,030
Who would.

720
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,550
Lengthwise.

721
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,830
I so bizarre.

722
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,750
And that was one of the goals, evidently, it was to like, I don't know, 12 minutes is a little long.

723
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,670
And now you're like, who is now in the age of Rise of the Resistance?

724
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,910
You're like, who is complaining about a long ride?

725
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,850
That's so weird.

726
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:44,910
Yeah.

727
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,390
I also think when you have a stuffed animal, you know, like I didn't live in Florida.

728
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,150
I lived in Maryland.

729
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,890
So I probably rode that ride twice.

730
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah.

731
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,010
Yeah.

732
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,630
Between 83 and 98.

733
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:55,970
Yeah.

734
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,730
But you have this like figment stuffed animal like pulls you back there.

735
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,790
Yeah, I love I love the ride and the leaping.

736
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,030
I think they're called leaping frog fountains.

737
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,030
They're still there, right?

738
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,150
They are still there.

739
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:17,290
Yeah, my I was showing them to my girlfriend back in like November and we're immediately like giggling like, like, I was like, no, you got it.

740
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,550
If you catch it, you can get soaking wet.

741
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,290
It was so hot today.

742
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,450
And I was like, you figure out where it goes and you put your hand up to block it.

743
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,850
And then people are walking by giggling with us.

744
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,630
And I was like, well, the fountains still work.

745
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,110
The fountains still do what they're designed to do.

746
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,870
The exterior last night, I was like thinking, I was like, oh, I want to bring this up and see what you guys think.

747
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,930
But now I feel different because you brought the aquarium that I was like, you know what?

748
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:52,690
If you look at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the design of the Hall of Fame.

749
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,230
Yeah, yeah.

750
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,850
I was like, is that the inspiration to their architecture?

751
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,310
I couldn't find anything.

752
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:05,310
But then when you said the aquarium in Baltimore, they both have a similar glass.

753
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:08,350
Yeah.

754
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,750
Yeah.

755
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,870
Yeah.

756
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,310
Where is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

757
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,690
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is 97.

758
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,290
OK.

759
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:13,810
OK.

760
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:14,710
Yes.

761
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:22,570
Well, sometimes one little spark happens when you see a building and it sparks the mind to make the same building, but slightly different.

762
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:36,830
There was so much in the air back then or like unbuilt, unrealized projects, like a lot of the video essays about Journey, of course, touch on the unbuilt Discovery Bay at Disneyland.

763
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:41,970
The original version of the Land Pavilion, which was going to have gigantic crystals.

764
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,430
Yeah, that design is really cool.

765
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,150
If you've never seen that.

766
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,370
Don't worry about trying to put like big crystals in Disney forever.

767
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,630
That's a big thing, too.

768
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,630
In addition to just Jules Verne shit, it's like big crystals is definitely something that comes up a lot.

769
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,610
I never knew that.

770
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:58,710
I guess so.

771
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:07,690
And like it also appears in other stuff, like even just like art from like Lucasport, which is going to be like the George Lucas overlay or whatever redo of Tomorrowland.

772
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,450
It's very crystal and these big buildings.

773
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,550
Which also might have there might have been something like that in Westcott.

774
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,590
Yes, for sure.

775
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,750
This idea just moved from the big indoor atrium that was very crystal.

776
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,270
Yeah.

777
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,970
Which like it's great.

778
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:31,410
It landed where it did because, you know, I'm recalling I feel like but at this point we're getting close to having covered like all the big original Epcot stuff.

779
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,450
Yeah.

780
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:37,430
And one of the last ones we did, I don't remember if it was maybe it was when we talked about Horizons.

781
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,290
I feel like I at some point declared this is my favorite looking.

782
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,210
Maybe I said Horizons was my favorite of the big austere original Epcot buildings.

783
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,390
Why did I not say journey into imagination?

784
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,770
Of course, it's this right?

785
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,130
Isn't it just like architecturally, aesthetically pleasing?

786
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,950
It feels future proof.

787
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:02,410
Like I do think it doesn't feel like an out of it's like kind of forever 80s, but forever future.

788
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,710
That thing, you know, is certainly the vibe I want.

789
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,690
Yeah, it doesn't feel dated in a way.

790
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,390
Even like, you know, like that land building is like a little unfriendly.

791
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,010
I think it's cool.

792
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,090
I think all I look I love all of the big like blocky Epcot.

793
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,390
Yeah, but a lot of early Epcot was like, I hope you like brutalism.

794
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,250
Yeah, yeah.

795
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,130
Which I did and I do.

796
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:34,790
And then I've like any time I see that in Warner Center and Woodland Hills or wherever, I'm like, oh, it's like Epcot.

797
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,750
But this, I don't know, Journey, this building is aged so well.

798
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:46,710
The thing Journey is going forward is that it feels it feels very much of like a sister to Spaceship Earth to me because of the like whatever like.

799
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,670
There's some whimsy in the architecture.

800
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,870
So it does feel like it's built from the same like material or something and Horizons feels different.

801
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,970
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,270
I guess I do.

803
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:56,850
I think Journey.

804
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,130
Yeah, I guess you're probably right.

805
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,090
I don't mean to dictate.

806
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,590
No, but I like Horizons a lot too.

807
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,510
If I had ever said this one was the best, unless it's the best Spaceship Earth, does that count?

808
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,450
Well, if that counts, then that's my favorite.

809
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,030
Yeah.

810
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,550
Yeah.

811
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,050
Do you have a leaning favorite Epcot building?

812
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,270
I mean, yeah, Journey.

813
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:22,290
The other thing I was going to say is like you also now when you get older and you get off a ride and there's like, you know, the toys to buy.

814
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:34,450
But like with Figment, you went into like, you know, the image works like you were kind of you now like learn something on the ride that you got to like do it.

815
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,330
So it's almost like its own separate park.

816
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:45,370
Like you had got to do what Figment taught you in that rainbow corridor that you walk through like that.

817
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,270
It was just it's just magical.

818
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,990
And that's what all we love of Disney and stuff.

819
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,690
And it just felt like, yeah, I don't know.

820
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,830
I just forever love it.

821
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,870
And Figment's funny.

822
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,010
Yes.

823
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,110
Yeah, absolutely.

824
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,150
Well, you want to you want to talk characters a little bit.

825
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,470
Let's just like and we can go look, we'll do a little Dream Finder, too.

826
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:12,230
But let's make sure we devote enough time to just like we've not really had just a big talk about Figment on the show.

827
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,710
We have not had a big talk.

828
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,790
Yeah, we haven't had.

829
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,290
We haven't had the talk about Figment.

830
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,110
That will be my the talk with my son.

831
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,070
You should know there is a purple dragon and he's wonderful.

832
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:23,750
Yeah.

833
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,730
Oh, my God.

834
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,510
Figment's great.

835
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,890
I don't know.

836
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,690
This is going to be the most intellectual talk, but it is wonderful.

837
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,110
Visually appealing.

838
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:30,910
Yes.

839
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,690
Kind of a great shade.

840
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,650
Well, so much.

841
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,170
I think purple is going to be good, but I love that.

842
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,830
That like the very 80s.

843
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,290
I feel like the building they did some of in that color, too.

844
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,110
That kind of like light periwinkle.

845
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,770
Oh, yeah.

846
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,590
Great purple.

847
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:55,410
That's I really like, especially being like having all these toys of like stuff when I was a kid, like just visually speed like Dream Finder, Figment just perfectly like like appealing to a child.

848
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:59,830
Like just from the colors to just the juxtaposition of the two characters.

849
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,250
Like almost that.

850
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:12,630
Like over anything else, the ride probably could have been half as good, but just those two characters seeing them as a kid to me, at least it was like, oh, yeah, like I like these guys like immediately like very good.

851
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:12,990
Yeah.

852
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,890
Do you know why Figment was red and yellow?

853
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,910
His outfit.

854
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:18,750
Well, I'll sweater.

855
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,390
Yeah.

856
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,070
Yeah.

857
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,430
Wait.

858
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:20,790
Yeah.

859
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,710
But yes, go ahead.

860
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,830
I did find that you did.

861
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,190
Yeah.

862
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,690
Also, we're real quick.

863
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:28,890
A good note of red and yellow makes you hungry.

864
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,670
Technically, though, that combination.

865
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,930
Because it's like mushroom.

866
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,250
Think about McDonald's in and out.

867
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,230
Wendy's like, oh, they've done studies that that combination makes you hungry.

868
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:40,730
That's interesting.

869
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,090
But Figment has it because it's Kodak that is the Kodak logo.

870
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:52,430
That is a thing about this ride as a kid immediately endeared the Kodak company.

871
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:52,810
Yes.

872
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,970
I was like, Kodak is good.

873
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,270
They're important.

874
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,390
They're powerful.

875
00:42:59,350 --> 00:42:59,650
Reading.

876
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,470
I it was funny reading about the late 90s Kodak.

877
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,230
They were just like, we're not going to do any digital.

878
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:12,350
We're putting our foot down like they they had the ability, but they were very resistant to it.

879
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:19,250
And that was the kind of death knell of a lot of photography companies is just not not going with the.

880
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:19,490
Yeah.

881
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,450
Not immediately embracing.

882
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,110
Sure.

883
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:22,550
Yeah.

884
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,350
Oh, yeah.

885
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:39,870
And I think that is I think they could have done it digitally in Kodak was like, no, this has to be done in like the slides, whatever their current technology was.

886
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,170
I could not do any demonstration of digital photos.

887
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,970
There is a long interview with Tony Baxter on this old blog called the MacGyver Project.

888
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:58,230
And he says, like, I mentioned once, like, well, we could sell these photos and they immediately gave me a death stare.

889
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,590
Oh, what?

890
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,750
Yeah, I don't know.

891
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:07,090
Apparently, it took a lot to take those digital like those photos for just a second.

892
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,950
Like they had a room of computers.

893
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:09,490
Yeah.

894
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,090
To manage that at first.

895
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,550
Wow.

896
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:11,910
Wow.

897
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,950
Just having a photo that you look at for three seconds on your way out.

898
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:21,690
But they didn't sell photos and they didn't sell videos at the blue screen in the image works.

899
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,210
The blue screen like acted like movie area.

900
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:24,830
Oh, yes.

901
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,070
Yeah.

902
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,450
Right.

903
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,850
The the colors also come from the original.

904
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:38,090
I think they went more like, you know, A to B with him being a green dragon originally.

905
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,490
But green is the color of Fuji film, which was in the park.

906
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:48,930
It was in Epcot elsewhere or like they were trying to be or they were they like going to be part of the Japan.

907
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,930
Well, the idea that the rumor was that they got the Mount Fuji Coaster canned.

908
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,950
Oh, my God.

909
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,570
That supposedly there was going to be a Mount Fuji Coaster in World Showcase.

910
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,890
And then they were like, no, Fuji.

911
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,850
No, it's the mention of the freight.

912
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,410
Yeah.

913
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,590
We're Fuji Coaster since I'm glad they got us this.

914
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,890
But shit, Fuji Coaster sounds really good.

915
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:20,170
Yeah, because the original because because the Dreamfinder and Figment were from the original concept of we just said it and I can't think of the name of it.

916
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:28,270
The original 70s Tony Baxter Discovery, Discovery, Captain Magic, Captain Marvel and his dragon.

917
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:28,670
Yeah.

918
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,670
And it was like Green Dragon.

919
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,290
They're like, no green or no green allowed.

920
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:32,610
Yeah.

921
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,150
But that also sounded cool.

922
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,270
Carousel progress with like some crazy.

923
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:36,530
Sure.

924
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,430
Oh, yeah.

925
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:37,830
Yeah.

926
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,230
I yes.

927
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,610
So this is this this is Captain Marvel.

928
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:42,770
I wait, Professor Marvel.

929
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,730
It's not Captain Marvel.

930
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,050
Captain Marvel.

931
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:45,450
Professor.

932
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,090
Yeah, that makes sense.

933
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:48,710
Yes.

934
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,730
Professor Marvel.

935
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,310
That was going to be part of that Discovery land area that never got built to Disneyland.

936
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:59,330
And then Tony Baxter had an idea for the land pavilion where there was a guy named the Landkeeper.

937
00:45:59,610 --> 00:45:59,930
Yeah.

938
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:07,570
And he was not quite well, Landkeeper is a couple of he's in a he's in a white tux.

939
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:08,810
He's cool.

940
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:09,910
He is kind of neat.

941
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,070
He's a different vibe entirely, but he's sort of Colonel Sanders.

942
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:13,650
Oh, yeah.

943
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:14,150
A little bit.

944
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,590
Oh, yeah.

945
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,090
But then with Rainbow and he has the Captain EO Rainbow on his shirt.

946
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,090
That really feels like it did turn.

947
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,090
I'm sure that's what that is.

948
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,510
Yeah.

949
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,470
Yeah, absolutely.

950
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,410
This whole thing, everything that happened in this pavilion, these were a lot of stuff that was just floating around.

951
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:33,070
It just all feels like like they were all talking to me as a five year old.

952
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,430
Well, what do you want to see on his chest?

953
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,670
You want a rainbow?

954
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,270
They're like, great.

955
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,710
What color should the dragon be?

956
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,590
Purple is my favorite color.

957
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,790
And they're like, great.

958
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,650
This kid is just deciding all the things that will make other kids like it.

959
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,090
Yeah.

960
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:46,470
Yeah.

961
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:47,830
It's smart.

962
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,790
Figment, I think, is I mean, OK, a few things.

963
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,730
It takes very little to like on board with him.

964
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,910
You kind of understand what he is as soon as you see him.

965
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:03,670
And then this the introduction scene and the ride, you kind of like, all right, I get it.

966
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,650
He's this whimsical thing of your imagination.

967
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,150
That's that's very clear.

968
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:22,850
He also just visually, because in the ride, he has to work as animatronic cartoon, his original animation of him in the ride and then puppet for all the videos at the end.

969
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,590
And he translates from medium to medium really well.

970
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,270
Yes.

971
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,750
Yeah.

972
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:28,750
I think that's true.

973
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,410
Yeah.

974
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:35,390
You mentioned, you know, thinking the animatronics were real in that ending scene as a kid.

975
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,050
I remember like figments of mountain climbers, super heroes, this and that.

976
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:47,350
And then reading the reality of that in the one that Tony Baxter interviews like, oh, that is we wanted to animate that.

977
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,870
We couldn't get it animated in time.

978
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:57,070
So that puppet is actually an animatronic with the guts removed and a puppeteer doing it.

979
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,810
And it is so cumbersome.

980
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:05,930
They could only do like five minutes at a time because they had to rest because animatronic skin is so thick and heavy.

981
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,870
It's not like it's not it's not Kermit.

982
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:09,530
Yeah.

983
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,170
Whoa.

984
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,590
I never knew that.

985
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,650
That's so cool.

986
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:13,390
Yeah.

987
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:18,810
Little sequences like how adorable is it like figment like lifting a little barbell?

988
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,850
And now we know that was figments lifting a little barbell and then the guy under figment is like really struggling.

989
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,150
Yeah.

990
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,750
Just like begging for a cigarette break.

991
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,470
And it's better because it's not.

992
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,330
I look the animation would have been cool, I'm sure.

993
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,070
But it's better that it's not.

994
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,550
Yeah.

995
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:35,790
I think.

996
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,210
Yeah.

997
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:36,710
Yeah.

998
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,610
I remember Dream Finder is teaching.

999
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,910
Figment is asking questions as the audience.

1000
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:54,430
So like we're learning from figment on what who Dreamcatcher is and figments asking questions like, oh, we can anything is possible.

1001
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:01,170
Like we can come up with anything like I always thought that's a good teaching tool to where he's speaking for the audience.

1002
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,510
Like an Elmo fashion.

1003
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,810
They want to get scary.

1004
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:08,690
You can turn the word cat in the bat like the number the thunder.

1005
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:16,350
I read that they were going to have fog machine smoke machine to make you feel like you're on a cloud.

1006
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,210
Oh, well, when he's flying, but they didn't want to mess up the design.

1007
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,690
Yeah, I read that.

1008
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:21,850
Yeah.

1009
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,510
So they don't have the good haze machines that we have now.

1010
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,150
So like that would have been really cool.

1011
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,470
They haven't perfected fog technology or they hadn't.

1012
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,150
Yeah.

1013
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:30,610
Yeah.

1014
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,550
What a time.

1015
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,650
I appreciate what a time we live in fog wise.

1016
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,830
Yeah, this is a golden age of fog.

1017
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,290
Yeah.

1018
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,430
Curing diseases, whatever.

1019
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,270
That is what it is.

1020
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:43,370
But the we can like Six Flags Six Flags Fright Fester on the forefront.

1021
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,690
Yeah, they won't destroy sets anymore.

1022
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,110
Yeah.

1023
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,390
And a teen can breathe it in.

1024
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,030
No problem.

1025
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:50,470
Right.

1026
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:50,850
Yeah.

1027
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,510
Yeah.

1028
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:58,330
The what has there ever been another ride where it was refurbished but the main character was gone.

1029
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,750
I don't know McDonald's without cheeseburger.

1030
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,910
I don't know why.

1031
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:17,850
Well, it is similar to in a way to like McDonald's becoming kind of these like bland McCafe kind of like aesthetic free just like cold surfaces and the characters are kind of gone.

1032
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,470
Yeah.

1033
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,350
And then they're bringing the characters and ads lately.

1034
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,770
They are bringing that.

1035
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,170
It's always it's never a good idea.

1036
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:25,730
I don't think.

1037
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:31,970
Well, they got rid of the original McDonald's mascot too, which was what Speedy was that like little character that was before Ronald.

1038
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:32,850
Oh, yeah.

1039
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,090
Oh, I mean, I forgot about him.

1040
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,950
You see him occasionally.

1041
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,490
He pops up once in a while.

1042
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,550
He's always confused me, I think.

1043
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,130
Why is he only at like one out of every 100 McDonald's?

1044
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:42,590
I'll say this.

1045
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,910
When I see him, I don't feel joy like I do with these other characters.

1046
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:46,310
Speedy that is.

1047
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,030
Because he's from like these from the 50s.

1048
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,650
Yeah, I don't have a connection to Speedy.

1049
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:53,190
I see joy when I see Birdie and Ronald.

1050
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:57,350
Do you like Zippy, the United States Postal mascot?

1051
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,310
I like him, but I have no deep affection for him.

1052
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,110
You don't dislike him.

1053
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,830
Don't dislike.

1054
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,330
I feel like you love him.

1055
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,150
I love Zippy.

1056
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:05,910
Yeah, of course you do.

1057
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:12,610
Zippy was a little cartoon guy introduced with the advent of zip codes to get people to use zip codes.

1058
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:13,850
He's about zip codes.

1059
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,090
Zippy.

1060
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,850
As a kid, you loved zip codes and you loved the US Postal.

1061
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,050
Show me my zip code again, mom.

1062
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,790
Well, that was getting the zip code right before bed.

1063
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,370
I feel like it was like, okay, I learned when my birthday was.

1064
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:38,670
I specifically remember around the time probably of Figment, the most paid attention, most like Figment, like first grade.

1065
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,890
Our teacher asked me, when's your birthday?

1066
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,630
I was like, I don't know, March.

1067
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,470
My birthday is in October.

1068
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:46,590
I have no idea.

1069
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,710
That's weird.

1070
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:47,890
Why?

1071
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:48,870
You got it way wrong.

1072
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,290
But I got it way wrong.

1073
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,050
And at that point, I had already celebrated my birthday, I think.

1074
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,830
It's like, wait, that was just a few.

1075
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,090
I don't know why.

1076
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,910
Did you get nervous?

1077
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,950
I think I got nervous.

1078
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:06,690
But tying shoes and learning zip code, I think they were late coming for me.

1079
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,530
I got the first start of the address with zip code.

1080
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,830
It took a while to learn those numbers.

1081
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,430
I did Velcro for a long time.

1082
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,050
I did Velcro for a while.

1083
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:17,830
Kangaroos.

1084
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,770
I had a lot of Velcro with X-Men or Ninja Turtles on them.

1085
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:25,950
Oh, cool.

1086
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,470
And then you're like, I don't want to do shoes that tie because the X-Men aren't on them as often.

1087
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,390
Well, I still agreed.

1088
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,610
Looking back, I was like, well, they were more efficient to do the Velcro.

1089
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,470
Are you going to go back to Velcro?

1090
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,030
I don't know.

1091
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,810
Every now and then I see a Velcro shoe.

1092
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,450
I see a running shoe without little Velcro.

1093
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,610
I'm wearing slip-ons right now.

1094
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,450
Oh, so you are.

1095
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:44,910
Yeah.

1096
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,670
You don't have to worry about any of it.

1097
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,110
Yeah.

1098
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,570
I don't always do slip-ons, but for a record, you know, comfortable.

1099
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,230
For a work of comfort-building.

1100
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:54,810
Here's aâ€¦

1101
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,170
Well, okay, how about that?

1102
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:00,310
Let's clear this one out of the way because we can't not say it.

1103
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:04,370
There is a story about why Figment is Figment.

1104
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:04,970
Of course.

1105
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:12,230
And I think it's, you know, okay, we love Tony Baxter, creator of this ride and creator of Figment, very much on the show.

1106
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:20,750
And I think it's, does maybe, does that just maybe answer why this show is so perennially devoted to telling the same stories over and over again?

1107
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,550
Oh, perhaps.

1108
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,170
Because it is what our man Tony likes to do.

1109
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,590
There are these tales in any setting.

1110
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,710
With us in real interviews, he will always tell.

1111
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,510
I think this guy does.

1112
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:46,550
Well, he said he stumbled upon the word Figment because there's an episode of Magnum P.

1113
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:46,910
I.

1114
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:48,650
Where Magnum P.

1115
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,550
I.

1116
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,430
's friend Higgins?

1117
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,370
His butler.

1118
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,270
His butler, yeah.

1119
00:53:52,390 --> 00:54:00,850
Butler was really mad about a goat eating his prized flowers.

1120
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,750
Yeah, of course.

1121
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:09,950
And he went on like a little rant that he's like, I know it's real, it's not a figment of my imagination.

1122
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,910
Yeah, we said figment doesn't eat, figments don't eat flowers.

1123
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,890
Is that the correct line, something along those lines?

1124
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,870
Technically, Tony shortens it.

1125
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,290
But the real line is, don't, and don't tell me it's a figment of my imagination.

1126
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,350
Figments don't eat rare tropical flowers.

1127
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:24,390
There you go.

1128
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,230
This is the actual full line.

1129
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,090
But who told the story?

1130
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,430
But he was talking about a goat.

1131
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,570
What's that?

1132
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,590
He's talking, he's referring to a goat.

1133
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,490
But why would he say a figment doesn't eat?

1134
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,670
He's saying don't tell me it's not real.

1135
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,850
I think Magnum, I don't know the full context of the episode.

1136
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:41,690
Honestly, that's research.

1137
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,330
I probably should have brought into this affair so that I would actually know.

1138
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,810
But I believe that Magnum P.

1139
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,250
I.

1140
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,590
This is what happens on Magnum P.

1141
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:51,790
I.

1142
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,330
by the way.

1143
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,250
He's hiding a goat in the yard.

1144
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,890
I think this is the B plot.

1145
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:56,770
It's fun.

1146
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,330
Higgins is a stuffy guy.

1147
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,790
And he's got to deal with a ridiculous goat eating his beloved tropical flower.

1148
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,210
It's not that Magnum has chosen a goat as his new partner.

1149
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,130
But he's going to keep it off the books.

1150
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,090
But I wouldn't put it past Magnum.

1151
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,650
Crazy ideas from the loose cannon.

1152
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,930
But yes, that is what it is.

1153
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,910
Hearing figments.

1154
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:19,810
Oh, no, no, no.

1155
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:20,030
Please.

1156
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,930
Has he ever?

1157
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:28,010
Because I know that story, but like they knew Kodak was going to be the sponsor.

1158
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,490
He's trying to come up with this stuff.

1159
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:36,170
And I thought Kodak was really heavy on imagination and color.

1160
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:42,430
So I'm like, I think the word imagination was probably what triggered him half listening.

1161
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,050
Oh, true.

1162
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:47,210
Like trying to find things that are like cool with the word imagination.

1163
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,690
Associated with imagination.

1164
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:49,670
That's a good point.

1165
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,110
Because yeah, why are they doing any of this if not for?

1166
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,490
And yeah, it did all come from Kodak is interested.

1167
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,550
They want to do something.

1168
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,510
And they don't want to do one of these stuffy Avkat pavilions.

1169
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,630
They want it to be.

1170
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:05,950
And it doesn't matter what it's about so long as it is something imaginative.

1171
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,190
That is what they said.

1172
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,710
And they Disney said, how about imagination?

1173
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,670
It's pretty imaginative.

1174
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,790
They gave a lot of room.

1175
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,670
I feel like Baxter says like, well, figment was a it's a known word.

1176
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,250
People know it, but I feel like it's not used a lot.

1177
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,270
So there's a uniqueness to it.

1178
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,790
But like a million dollar where everybody nobody's grabbed that.

1179
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,290
Yes, like as like IP.

1180
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:29,650
Yeah.

1181
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,950
Basically, is this the was the last time he watched something current?

1182
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,870
This Magnum P.

1183
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,030
I.

1184
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,910
episode probably.

1185
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:44,950
My question, because this all comes from me asking him if he's ever like watched an episode of Seinfeld and thinks, oh, I can make a right out of this.

1186
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:47,450
And he goes, well, I watch old movies or something.

1187
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,870
He said something along those lines.

1188
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:56,310
Oh, so I was the last the last piece of media that he ever that maybe question for interview number two with us.

1189
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:56,810
Sure.

1190
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:57,850
This is Magnum P.

1191
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:57,970
I.

1192
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,850
The last current show you watched.

1193
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,190
You have made me think of a theme park.

1194
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,930
It's just like, so how did you come up with a ride?

1195
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:05,710
Balke.

1196
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:11,110
Well, it's all right from watching a show.

1197
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,850
This read these idea of these characters who are perfect strangers.

1198
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,090
Where did that phrase enter your head?

1199
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,290
But OK, he Brewster.

1200
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,950
It's a dance club.

1201
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,930
And yeah, but a pretty broad assignment.

1202
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,790
I don't want to be imagination.

1203
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,730
Well, like Kodak seemed reasonably hands off.

1204
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,450
Yeah, I think so.

1205
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:40,030
As long as nothing green is in it and not as long as it's about imagination.

1206
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:49,770
And I do think actually with that, like them just saying exactly what given Kodak exactly what they wanted, I think that they then they determined here's what the rooms are.

1207
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,510
Like we explore performing arts and literature and that.

1208
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,130
And I I don't think I'm pulling this out of nowhere.

1209
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,710
I think that Kodak saw the presentation and said, what about science?

1210
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,390
And then you watch a ride through and Dream Finder says, what about science?

1211
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:07,110
I think they quoted Kodak back to them.

1212
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:07,450
Wow.

1213
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,230
I also feel like I'm hallucinating.

1214
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,170
That's a figment of my mission.

1215
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,470
I don't know.

1216
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,270
Maybe I got that from somewhere.

1217
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,090
That's how to win friends and influence people.

1218
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:23,030
Trek, I think you say someone's words back to them or you say like three or four of their words back to them and they go, oh, wow, they were listening.

1219
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:29,330
That science part, by the way, I think that was the part that scared me as a kid.

1220
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:29,810
Really?

1221
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:30,310
Sure.

1222
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:35,990
That creepy music and the time lapse flowers and melting snow and stuff.

1223
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,330
Yeah, I feel like I was just scared.

1224
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,990
I was scared of like certain types of film.

1225
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,410
Does that make any sense?

1226
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,650
Like I could tell the difference.

1227
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:48,210
I'd watch Sesame Street and I would know when it goes to film as opposed to video.

1228
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,310
Oh, video is friendly and where my friends live and film is scary.

1229
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:52,750
Yeah.

1230
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,230
And I don't know what I was.

1231
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:54,610
Yeah.

1232
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:05,630
But I swear I have this that like frame rates and like the quality of lenses just would like and then it would scare that like Sesame Street is on video and then follow that bird is on film and follow that bird is very upsetting.

1233
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:13,890
And I think part of that is that like, well, now it's now my character, my favorite characters are being shot the way, you know, like Midnight Cowboys being shot.

1234
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,630
Film is for grownups.

1235
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:19,190
Film gives you like a little surreal quality versus just video.

1236
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,470
Video feels like I'm just looking through a window and film.

1237
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,670
I agree with that.

1238
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,730
Yeah, you could feel that.

1239
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,550
You couldn't articulate it probably at five.

1240
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,650
No, I don't think but I did.

1241
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,590
It's one of those things I give.

1242
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,670
I feel the feeling.

1243
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,450
I felt it.

1244
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:31,650
No, I hear you.

1245
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:32,550
Film, video.

1246
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,710
It felt like there was no weight to it.

1247
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,170
If you were watching something that was on film.

1248
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:36,690
Absolutely.

1249
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:40,790
Like it felt like, yeah, yeah, there's also the Sesame Street films.

1250
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,210
There's also the audio.

1251
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,010
I remember like it sounded completely different.

1252
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,210
Like, yeah, just like, I don't know.

1253
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,330
I'm yeah, I'm feeling you.

1254
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,610
At first, I want to say you sounded like a dick as a kid being particular.

1255
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,850
But that I was a film snob.

1256
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:56,310
I think.

1257
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:56,950
Yeah.

1258
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:59,410
What kind of lens is this, mother?

1259
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,570
Another wide angle.

1260
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,090
Interesting choice.

1261
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,590
But we like what we're used to.

1262
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

1263
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:12,950
But also what in figment that there's so much happening.

1264
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,850
Your brain just can't digest it.

1265
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,610
There's film.

1266
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,610
There's there's animatronic.

1267
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,770
There's video.

1268
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,610
There's I don't know.

1269
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,490
And the colors.

1270
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,750
Like I just think.

1271
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:29,170
Yeah, I wonder how many times we wrote it as as kids that it still stays with us.

1272
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,090
Like, it's pretty other things.

1273
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,810
Probably didn't.

1274
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:39,890
I probably like you probably did seven other rides on those same trips that don't like stay with you.

1275
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,270
I don't remember any of them.

1276
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,350
I only remember figment.

1277
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:42,990
Yeah.

1278
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,070
Well, it was also I feel like it was easy.

1279
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:52,010
Not that the you know, there was never any lines, but just the modified Omni movers set up.

1280
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,350
It was an Epcot ride.

1281
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:59,070
You could go in and get on a dark ride like in five, maybe 10 minutes.

1282
01:00:59,070 --> 01:00:59,410
Sure.

1283
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,250
There's not a big pre show.

1284
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,210
There's not exhibits to walk through.

1285
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:04,430
There's not a post show.

1286
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:12,090
You got to like the post show is fun and it's built into the ride and you get to see the Rainbow Corridor.

1287
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:21,990
You know, yeah, I'm repeating myself because we've said this on multiple Epcot episodes, but also my memories of all going on Epcot stuff in the 80s all blend together.

1288
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:24,170
Because they all feel like they're of a piece.

1289
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,430
All the Epcot rides are an experimental rock and roll album or something.

1290
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,410
And like you remember pieces here and there.

1291
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:35,110
But I'm watching like World of Motion as an adult on YouTube and I'm like, I don't know any.

1292
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:40,230
I don't I'm sure there's parts of it I maybe remember, but like I can remember some things about Horizons.

1293
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,810
Remember some things, but it all really blends together.

1294
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,070
And I think that's part of design.

1295
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:46,710
Yeah.

1296
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,750
I have it all feel like a one piece.

1297
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:53,650
I'm embarrassed to ask, but like the caveman blowing his feet.

1298
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,310
That's Spaceship Earth.

1299
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,630
That's the one there.

1300
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,310
I remember.

1301
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,910
Wait, are we wrong?

1302
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:03,210
Are they blowing their feet because they don't have vehicles to?

1303
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,650
It's not because they have to walk like Flintstones on the ground.

1304
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:13,910
Yeah, because there's a Tundra scene sort of on Spaceship Earth before you get into like obviously the different.

1305
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,650
Yeah, but maybe that's what you're doing.

1306
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,030
Nothing embarrassing about that because now I'm questioning where.

1307
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,390
I know there's cavemen in Spaceship Earth, but are there also?

1308
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:28,110
I'm questioning it now because I'm just picturing this guy blowing his feet.

1309
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,070
I remember that was like a memory.

1310
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:30,870
That's what I think.

1311
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:31,850
It's World of Motion.

1312
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,430
No, you're right.

1313
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:32,910
Look here.

1314
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,990
This is at from some like auction.

1315
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:35,770
Oh, yeah.

1316
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,730
That is a caveman blowing his feet.

1317
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,470
There you go.

1318
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,110
I don't think we talked about this in World of Motion.

1319
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,590
We did see that's one of those.

1320
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,950
That is one of those weird things because there's multiple rides with cavemen in Epcot.

1321
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:50,030
There's multiple things where you go into the Renaissance and different futures and the futures all feel very 80s.

1322
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,050
And which ones have horses?

1323
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:53,170
And yeah, it's really.

1324
01:02:53,170 --> 01:03:01,410
And I guess imagination probably feels like the outlier of all of them too because I feel like or I guess Horizons and imagination feel a little more unique.

1325
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,270
Well, imagination I think is the most ethereal.

1326
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,270
Horizons.

1327
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:06,610
Yeah.

1328
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:11,610
You know, if you're latching on to set pieces, Horizon was like, well, you get to pick the ending.

1329
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,570
You get to pick the ending.

1330
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:12,670
Sure.

1331
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:13,050
Yeah.

1332
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,210
And that was a big thing for me as a kid.

1333
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:22,590
But even watching watching imagination, it just the start is unique.

1334
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:26,930
That carousel, which I had totally forgotten about.

1335
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:35,910
I know I knew this at some point, but it's like, oh, a lot of the money went to building five dream finders and dream catchers and figments.

1336
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:47,070
And you would slowly rotate around the scene like you're watching like a three minute scene basically to start the ride.

1337
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:55,310
You pull into a turntable and you're moving exactly along with the scene that you're watching to where it might feel like you are not moving at all.

1338
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:01,290
Like you're it's and I I have to say I didn't know this ever that they're that they built five identical.

1339
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,110
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1340
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:03,370
This scene five times.

1341
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:03,890
I didn't know that.

1342
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:14,890
So it's like a miniature carousel progress like within your own Haunted Mansion type ride that goes into a carousel progress with this trippy so that everyone can get that experience at once.

1343
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:16,090
And it doesn't slow anything down.

1344
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:24,210
And five of not just nothing, five big flab traction flying machines that are full sized.

1345
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:28,570
There's I saw a photo of an Imagineer sitting in one who's the same.

1346
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,150
It is not smaller for Dream Finder.

1347
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,490
Right.

1348
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:37,690
That is like that is a full adult sized flying machine that they had to build five times.

1349
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,110
Yeah, they it's seeing the overhead of it.

1350
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:44,010
I'm like, oh my God, like, yeah, I never even watching any of these videos over the years.

1351
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,770
I never even put it together that that's how that was achieved.

1352
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:52,630
One of those for a long time was in the mouse gear shop in the center of that car.

1353
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:58,670
You could look up and see it see the rustic rustic dream catcher.

1354
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,350
They kicked out of the ride.

1355
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:07,950
Do you guys all feel this way a little bit where like, OK, I have I've had like affection for this.

1356
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:11,430
I know I've watched a ride through here and there, but I'm not even full of things we've covered.

1357
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:15,550
I'm not close to having this memorized or I wasn't before.

1358
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:19,150
It's like all stayed in that hazy kid brain.

1359
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:31,090
I for sure remember seeing from my vantage point as a child the big like the big flying machine and Dream Finder because that was so striking and scary.

1360
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:35,810
But the rest of it, I'm like I have like like bits and flickers.

1361
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,170
But like it's all really in a in a childhood haze for me.

1362
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,030
You guys feel similar?

1363
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,210
Yeah, 100 percent.

1364
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,270
I'd often it really feels like a dream.

1365
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:51,290
It really feels truly like I can't remember anything outside of those just big iconic images from it that lasted.

1366
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:58,390
Yeah, re re watching videos the last few days and then reading text descriptions of it.

1367
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:07,390
There would be stuff I missed from the videos and then I had to go back and find right pictures where it's like, wait, there is a teapot.

1368
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,930
There's like a weird teapot art piece.

1369
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,350
Right.

1370
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:15,230
Like right when you start to pull into the actual attraction part.

1371
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:15,890
Yeah.

1372
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:20,110
And that's like just, you know, it's just set dressing.

1373
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,470
It's not even like, you know, it's not important to eat on.

1374
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:24,810
Yeah.

1375
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:25,150
Right.

1376
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:35,030
It is like seeing the the two big moments, the big moments of like the Edgar Allan Poe like Phantom of the Opera like organ.

1377
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,190
But it's a keyboard and he's writing mystery story.

1378
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:45,430
And then that goes into figment wanting to put on a little show and he's in a tux and tails with a top hat.

1379
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,570
I'm like, well, that's my adult.

1380
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:53,070
Like, that's just my brain was just molded at six and it just never changed.

1381
01:06:53,970 --> 01:07:03,990
You know, yeah, it is so it's such a it's a fun blend of like, yeah, like, I just put this cute character in like a tux, which obviously is, you know, we've seen Bugs Bunny in the tux.

1382
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,810
As a kid, I don't know that I knew what that really meant.

1383
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:06,910
Right.

1384
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,270
Yeah.

1385
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,230
But I like it.

1386
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,530
Yeah.

1387
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:12,310
And then it's mixed with like really heady like colors and weird noises.

1388
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:18,150
And it doesn't I think it's interesting that it doesn't translate so well to even old footage.

1389
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,310
Like I know it's a lot of the upcast stuff, I guess doesn't.

1390
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:27,570
But it just doesn't you can't really feel it in watching even the best quality like Uprised footage.

1391
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:28,050
Yeah.

1392
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:36,390
I feel like I'm like I know I can see it and I can imagine I can imagine it, but I cannot feel it necessarily from these images of the same video.

1393
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,870
Yeah.

1394
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:43,650
I just remembered when you like you couldn't capture everything that was going.

1395
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,430
You're constantly.

1396
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:44,690
Yes.

1397
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:44,930
Yes.

1398
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:53,050
Look, there were so many things to see that I also think that's why it's harder to remember because there's not just like one journey.

1399
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:59,830
There's like again when you see all the figments doing characters, all this music and rainbows, it's like I don't know.

1400
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,170
I just yeah.

1401
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:11,450
Well, like juxtaposing and even just with watching like a VH or like camcorder footage of Haunted Mansion or Pirates from the 90s or something, you're like, well, I can tell in this footage what it is.

1402
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:19,310
Obviously, it's not giving you all the feelings of it, but it was very dark and it's yeah, it has like a lot of like trippier things going on.

1403
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,090
Yeah.

1404
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:32,190
Do you want to like hear a little like let's just let's just get a hit of like which one I don't know about some one little spark just to give us a give us a little vibe here.

1405
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:32,670
Sure.

1406
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:33,290
Yeah.

1407
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:45,810
One little spark of inspiration is at the heart of all creation right at the start of everything that's new.

1408
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,550
One little spark lights up for you.

1409
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,510
Oh, hello there.

1410
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,230
So glad you could come along.

1411
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,670
I am the dream finder.

1412
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,910
Musical notes.

1413
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:04,230
What delightful melodies those will make.

1414
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:13,050
I love these flights of fancy searching the universe for sounds, colors, ideas, anything that sparks the imagination.

1415
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:18,910
I mean, just to get a little hit of that like sound is a lot of it.

1416
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:26,990
This is a real like obviously the song is great Sherman Brothers and then the but the what I couldn't find is where the instrumentation comes from because it's like that.

1417
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:33,160
There's a real like I mean, there's there's it's a big like synth festival for sure.

1418
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:42,170
And you're and when when since and keyboards and digital sounds were not everywhere when you're a kid, you're like, there's a future heads or tails of it.

1419
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,750
I don't know what these sounds are.

1420
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:50,030
This feels like it's all types of the areas like harpsichord mixed with just like weird like texture stuff and that's that.

1421
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:50,510
Yeah.

1422
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,190
Oh, yeah.

1423
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:52,110
Yeah.

1424
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:53,330
Yeah.

1425
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:54,110
Yeah.

1426
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,550
Electronic fart.

1427
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:05,030
This is I really if anyone out there knows who like because I don't think Sherman Brothers are up at the they aren't like you don't think they were at the patchwork on the mini mode.

1428
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,190
You got a huge discogs entry.

1429
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,510
I looked I wanted to know.

1430
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:17,410
I played on this Dick Dick Sherman out with marauder on a speedboat somewhere just chatting about what's going on.

1431
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,850
What's the new tech like what you're using these days.

1432
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,910
Did you guys hear the original song for.

1433
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:24,310
Yeah.

1434
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:28,610
It's the guy that let's hear it for the land.

1435
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,090
Yeah.

1436
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:29,410
Yeah.

1437
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,290
Wait.

1438
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:31,170
Yeah.

1439
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,910
That's where I guess another song is called Journey to your imagination.

1440
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,690
But it's but it's not good.

1441
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:36,690
No, it's not.

1442
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,610
It's very much.

1443
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,890
Let's give it to the land.

1444
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,010
It's that same kind of like like mellow seven years.

1445
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:44,470
Yeah.

1446
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,910
Like, you know, James Taylor.

1447
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:47,510
Yeah.

1448
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,830
It didn't feel like you'd fall asleep to you.

1449
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,670
You try very hard with it either.

1450
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:57,210
There's no offense to him as opposed to like the kind of the the bounce and the like.

1451
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:57,470
Yeah.

1452
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:00,190
This is kind of like a not not in a round.

1453
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,650
What am I said?

1454
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:07,270
But it like it is sort of the same thing over and over in a small world way, which is probably effective in a ride.

1455
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,810
Right.

1456
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,210
Like that.

1457
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,830
It's like all of it.

1458
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,850
It's every bit of music is different permutations of the same melody over and over.

1459
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,650
So you come out and you know it for sure.

1460
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:31,070
But whoever this man or woman was that did those sounds, I would say they came from composing movies or shows because I think the bull, that's the sound of the dreamcatchers.

1461
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,010
What do you call it?

1462
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,990
Like it's like the exhaust pipe or whatever.

1463
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:44,730
When he's getting something, they're sounding like like the sound that the idea comes in to the dream.

1464
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:45,510
Yeah, sure.

1465
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,410
His machine is making the music.

1466
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:47,590
Yeah.

1467
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:48,230
Kind of.

1468
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,490
But they don't say that.

1469
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:54,170
Like like like word sense, beliefs and bloops are also hitting all of these like sound moments.

1470
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:03,650
Yeah.

1471
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:10,130
When you go in this for the first time, but it kind of gives you their personalities and their whole vibe at the beginning.

1472
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:17,110
But like once you can bag a bunch of times, I'm like, oh, it also sets up the rest of the ride.

1473
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:19,190
Like music notes come into play later.

1474
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,070
Lightning comes into play later.

1475
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,050
Oh, the things they grab here.

1476
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,370
Everything shows up in the dream port.

1477
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:27,890
Yes, that's all.

1478
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:32,690
That they capture in with that the dreamcatcher catches.

1479
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:33,330
Wait.

1480
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,690
OK.

1481
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,730
Now we've said what is the dreamcatcher?

1482
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,310
Dreamcatcher is the airship.

1483
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:41,970
Now this is confusing because I've also seen it referred to as the dream ship and the dream mobile.

1484
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,510
It seems like there's not a definitive one.

1485
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,210
Yes, because they don't even know or they all had different.

1486
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,330
OK, so it's one of those.

1487
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,630
It's the dream something or other.

1488
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,070
And then you put that.

1489
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:59,950
But either way, it's not the dream port, which is where the dream machine or dreamcatcher goes to drop off the dreams.

1490
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:00,390
Yeah.

1491
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:03,350
And Dreamfinder is the man.

1492
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,850
Yeah, Dreamfinder is the man.

1493
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,570
But the good thing is with your imagination, it can be whatever you want it to be.

1494
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,770
Yeah, that's a good point.

1495
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,050
Yes, they probably wouldn't box it.

1496
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:14,030
And then there's also there's some separate device called the imaginometer.

1497
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,370
So that at least you remember that separately.

1498
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:18,630
It lets you know how good your imagination is.

1499
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,070
Yeah, I think so.

1500
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,370
Yeah.

1501
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,990
Is it a quantity or a quality thing?

1502
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:23,190
Oh, I don't know.

1503
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,130
I'd have to look at the machine again.

1504
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:26,510
OK, I should look it up.

1505
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,570
I'm wondering if that's the second one.

1506
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,670
The wait, you mean the other version of the ride?

1507
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:38,490
The Eric Idle journey into your imagination where they then tell you your imagination is dog shit.

1508
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:38,790
Right.

1509
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,370
You get it.

1510
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,170
Oh, wow.

1511
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:53,790
Compare the openings of these meeting this whimsical man and then he makes up a friend for you as opposed to a character from another movie who you don't remember even if you just saw it saying you have no imagination.

1512
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,370
Your imagination is shit.

1513
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,630
A guy who's just who is so much like not to say he didn't.

1514
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,910
I think Eric Idle's the performance is not the issue.

1515
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:06,510
He's also like he came up on Twitter recently.

1516
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,670
He doesn't remember what this is.

1517
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:14,710
He's somebody somebody's photo of like a dragon and he's like, oh, yeah, quest for Camelot was fun.

1518
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,970
And they're like, no, that's not that is.

1519
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:17,930
That's from Disney.

1520
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:19,870
He just didn't.

1521
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,550
He doesn't even.

1522
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:22,750
And I admit it was like one day for him.

1523
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:22,930
Yeah.

1524
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,510
And then nobody probably nobody likes it.

1525
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:28,590
So nobody's ever nobody's saying to him day to day like, hey, I love that Devcott ride.

1526
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,810
That just pisses me off.

1527
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:33,110
I know it does as opposed to the love.

1528
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:43,550
And maybe that's a good tie into the talk about the voice talent of this attraction a little bit because these are both fascinating people to talk about.

1529
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:52,930
So Dream Finder is Chuck McCann, who is a like perennial voiceover guy and kids show host.

1530
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:55,690
A lot of stuff that was local and we didn't grow up with.

1531
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,710
But he did big national things that we know.

1532
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,250
He's the original Sonny the Cuckoo Bird.

1533
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:01,990
He did.

1534
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:07,550
He is the first that ever Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs was said later.

1535
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:13,510
Duckworth, the butler in DuckTales, among many other Disney voices.

1536
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,470
And of course, we can all say it together.

1537
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:29,370
He starred in and created the series Far Out Space Nuts, which was a Sid and Marty Croft nightmare starring him and Bob Denver.

1538
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:31,650
They were the I've watched this.

1539
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:32,730
You've watched Space Nuts.

1540
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,470
I've watched the titles familiar to me.

1541
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,010
I never seen a lick of.

1542
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,670
How'd you like Far Out Space Nuts?

1543
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,550
I don't.

1544
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,410
You know, it is pretty far out.

1545
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:45,610
I don't know if it's something that I would recommend everybody watch, but it's certainly interesting.

1546
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,110
I would say watch the opening credits.

1547
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,150
OK, and you can get the vibe from it.

1548
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:52,130
OK, so far out.

1549
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,570
They get the song or anything.

1550
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,090
At least I don't remember the song.

1551
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,090
OK, maybe it was all right.

1552
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:00,030
Anyway, to talk about his voice for a minute.

1553
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,870
I mean, how like was this?

1554
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,730
This is the first thing that's like this because it's so familiar.

1555
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:16,970
And I pondering visiting all this, I was flushing to like sketches I've done, things I've done here and there where I've done the voice that is like, why hello, I'm a big performative old timey man.

1556
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,030
And like, is it purely from this?

1557
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:23,290
It's because I love I love this voice.

1558
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:26,490
Yeah, I've been in the suit and the beard and the hat.

1559
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:30,270
I think is there a Santa Claus before this because he's very Santa like extremely.

1560
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,750
I always mention that everywhere that he's very like Santa.

1561
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:37,610
He plays Santa in something like some Mickey Christmas thing.

1562
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,670
I'm not sure what, but he's he's all if you can imagine he was also Santa.

1563
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:46,170
Yeah, so it's in the zone of like, like, obviously, like I'm trying to like Miracle on 34th Street.

1564
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,310
That's Santa Claus.

1565
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,790
Oh, he was a little like the twinkle in his eye.

1566
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:53,550
It's not quite as maybe boisterous, but he's got the vibe going.

1567
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:58,110
Yes, when he like reached like he sits like, like puts his hand on a child's shoulder.

1568
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:02,610
It's possible for them to call you stupid like, no, you didn't understand that.

1569
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,310
This is the way you do it.

1570
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:09,670
And you're like, oh, that's a better way of responding to me than like you idiot.

1571
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,990
No, that's not what that equals.

1572
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,090
You find that like that's like a nurturing type.

1573
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:14,730
I find him.

1574
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,030
Yeah.

1575
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:19,550
Nurturing father figure rewarding to the imagination.

1576
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,110
Yeah.

1577
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:22,610
I mean, lay, let's bring that up.

1578
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:27,890
Don't we all identify as figment wishing we had someone that's like encouraging our imagination?

1579
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:29,510
A dream finder.

1580
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:30,450
Oh, interesting.

1581
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,110
Yeah.

1582
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,030
A mentor figure.

1583
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:34,190
Whoa.

1584
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,330
Do you feel like you found them?

1585
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,470
Has anyone found a dream finder?

1586
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,830
Big boisterous.

1587
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,010
That's interesting.

1588
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:41,750
Yeah, I don't know.

1589
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,010
I think identify our dream finders.

1590
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:49,030
Genuinely, somebody you know, Tommy Blutcher, showrunner of Moobim City.

1591
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,150
I love him.

1592
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:54,170
He was like this older brother figure to me who took me through this scary experience.

1593
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:58,610
And he doesn't sound like dream finder, but he is a big larger than life boisterous person.

1594
01:17:59,250 --> 01:17:59,950
So there's one.

1595
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,330
But I do think there might be.

1596
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,890
And if I told him that, he'd say, what the fuck is a dream finder?

1597
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,790
He'd put me on blast for 10 minutes.

1598
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:08,650
Yeah.

1599
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:08,730
Yeah.

1600
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:09,570
Yeah.

1601
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,270
He'd call figment something else.

1602
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:12,110
Yeah.

1603
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:13,430
I love him.

1604
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,350
But yeah, I don't know.

1605
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:20,490
I just thought of that right now that there's another identifying quality of like what you relate to as that dream finder.

1606
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,550
Someone older than you encouraging.

1607
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:25,710
Because I don't I don't think of figment as like not real.

1608
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,910
It's like or a dragon.

1609
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:31,350
I'm just like, oh, yeah, I know figment figment.

1610
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,550
He's not a dragon.

1611
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:33,070
Yeah.

1612
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,070
Well, he's a figment.

1613
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,430
He reads as a kid.

1614
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:35,870
Yeah.

1615
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:36,210
Yeah.

1616
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,630
And he's like we're saying dresses up like all these different things.

1617
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,750
So yeah, how is he not us?

1618
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:49,910
Which likely I think endeared me as a kid because it's like, well, he's got his own personality.

1619
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,270
He's like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

1620
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:58,110
Own personality can also be a superhero or an astronaut or whatever.

1621
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:01,690
Like can be a cipher, can be other jobs.

1622
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:07,550
Now, isn't it curious that we do we say childlike and he's a kid.

1623
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:07,930
Yeah.

1624
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:15,390
Even though he is voiced by do I have that at the time of the recording, he was voiced by a 58 year old man.

1625
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,190
Of course.

1626
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:16,490
Yeah.

1627
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,310
It's kind of weird.

1628
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:21,710
Billy Barty was 58 when Billy Barty the voice of figment.

1629
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:21,930
Wow.

1630
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,670
Billy Barty.

1631
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,010
He did this at 58.

1632
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:29,590
He is he was a three foot nine inch tall man.

1633
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:30,130
Yeah.

1634
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,750
Which I guess there was the calculation.

1635
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:41,170
And I think in that Baxter interview you've talked about somebody was like, well, if there's this quality we're going for, why not like get a little piece?

1636
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:43,770
He's going to be little when I get a little person to do it.

1637
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,450
They try.

1638
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,270
He said Connie Stevens tried.

1639
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:47,630
They tried a zillion people.

1640
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,570
His women, they couldn't figure it out.

1641
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,030
But Billy Barty just had that quality inherently.

1642
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,530
I think they pitched him up.

1643
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:54,990
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

1644
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,130
Something's tweaked a little.

1645
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,670
Yeah, not a ton, though.

1646
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,710
It's like he gets it most of the way there.

1647
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,090
Cool.

1648
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:05,030
And a little bit of credits for him.

1649
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,250
Billy Barty was let's go back to Sid and Marty Croft.

1650
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,770
He is Sigmund from Sigmund and the Sea Monsters.

1651
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:12,790
There's something where he's Rumpelstiltskin.

1652
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,970
He was in Mickey Rooney shorts when he was three years old.

1653
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:21,390
That's how he straddles that much like all the way back to old Hollywood like that.

1654
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:23,390
There's some I saw some sketch.

1655
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,550
What was it?

1656
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:25,250
Something with him.

1657
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,790
There's something with him and Don Knotts on the Donnie Marie show.

1658
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:28,910
I think I've seen that.

1659
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,690
We know it already.

1660
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,810
He's Gwildor in Masters of the Universe.

1661
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,050
Oh, wow.

1662
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:36,290
Okay.

1663
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,010
And UHF.

1664
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:39,310
Oh, UHF.

1665
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,870
That's right.

1666
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:40,910
What is he in UHF?

1667
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,090
He's a film.

1668
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:43,510
He's the camera guy.

1669
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,430
Okay.

1670
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:45,290
Oh, gotcha.

1671
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:49,630
So like a guy you've probably seen in things here and there.

1672
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:56,090
What maybe nobody has seen is his own show, which was on maybe Los Angeles local television.

1673
01:20:56,090 --> 01:21:00,130
This seems to be a prank show called Short Ribs.

1674
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:04,990
And just so you can get Billy Barty outside of his figment context.

1675
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,630
Here's Billy.

1676
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:08,970
Hey, this is Billy Barty and Short Ribs is coming your way.

1677
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,090
Hey, Kevin, have a seat.

1678
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:14,350
Oh, hey, that was just fun, boys and girls and ladies and gentlemen.

1679
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,270
We're going to have fun on Short Ribs.

1680
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:18,410
Don't you do what we do, right, Kevin?

1681
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:18,870
Right.

1682
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:22,130
And we're going to be doing all kinds of crazy things on Short Ribs.

1683
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:24,750
But we're going to be doing it, not you.

1684
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,410
Right, boys and girls?

1685
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:27,270
Right.

1686
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:30,550
So don't forget, Short Ribs, coming your way.

1687
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,950
And all kinds of crazy things like, pow!

1688
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:42,210
For the listener, he's with a taller man who he pulls the chair out from under and he falls on the ground and then later hits him.

1689
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,230
But that's aâ€¦

1690
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,110
what a rant.

1691
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:47,370
It's an awful lot of like, do not do.

1692
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:53,630
He does the mildest prank you've ever seen and then says, so we're going to do that, but don't you do it.

1693
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:56,410
And we're going to do it, but when we do it, you don't do it.

1694
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,910
So sit there and don't do it while we do it.

1695
01:21:58,910 --> 01:21:59,570
Here we go.

1696
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,810
I was pretty confused by the end of that.

1697
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,510
Extremely.

1698
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:03,930
Yes, I really was.

1699
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:05,830
But you do understand that he's got the juice.

1700
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:06,750
He's got the energy.

1701
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:07,910
That's why they went to.

1702
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:08,530
Oh, yeah.

1703
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:18,550
But I also, watching that, I'm thinking, yeah, he probably would have a worse response than Eric Idle on, do you remember Figment?

1704
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:21,690
I think maybe.

1705
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,830
Just like grouchy character actor.

1706
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,350
I don't know.

1707
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,690
Old Hollywood guy.

1708
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:30,650
You don't think he cares about the magic of the Disney theme parks?

1709
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:31,670
I don't know.

1710
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,030
That little fucker.

1711
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,830
The power of that curtain.

1712
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:40,330
I just, to this day, I always say I never want to see the Pirates of the Caribbean with the lights on.

1713
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,010
Like that isâ€¦

1714
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,950
Oh, you said this about after the, behind the attraction.

1715
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,490
You were like, I don't want to see the stuff.

1716
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,590
They show too much.

1717
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,290
Yeah, yeah.

1718
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:48,030
Wow, wow.

1719
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,270
We got to have the curtain.

1720
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,550
You want the mystery still.

1721
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,150
Yeah.

1722
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:56,990
But still, watching, there's a great video essay about this.

1723
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:00,630
This is Kai Martin's vids, who does it about all these attractions.

1724
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:05,630
And he always gets the blueprints and usually adds in some animation.

1725
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,070
And I'm watching it and I'm like, still doesn't read to me.

1726
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,330
This looks like nonsense from above.

1727
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,170
I can't square this with my childlike wonder.

1728
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:16,850
There's not a mat.

1729
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,370
It just was manifested.

1730
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,610
Nobody had to build and think about a layout.

1731
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:22,730
It just was.

1732
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:26,130
It was dreamed up, like out of the Dream Finders mind.

1733
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:31,410
And it makes what, another thing Tony Baxter had said when they went to redo it.

1734
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:36,630
He's like, look, they spend a million dollars to gut it when you're flossing up aâ€¦

1735
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:42,050
You don't usually just start spending seven figures still like trash.

1736
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,250
What did they spend their entire time?

1737
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:46,670
Like taking out the carousel and redoing the track.

1738
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,510
To take out the opening.

1739
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:52,550
Which is where you meet, it's like where any of the heart of it comes from.

1740
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,810
That was the first move.

1741
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:55,310
Like, we're all gonna get that out of there.

1742
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:59,510
Which still, like 40 years later, seems like a technological marvel.

1743
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:06,470
Just thinking about like, oh, multiple sets of people are seeing this at slightly different times.

1744
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,310
And the only thing in the defense of the removal of it.

1745
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,430
And I'm not saying I was for it and I don't like that new ride.

1746
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,010
But apparently it did break down all the time.

1747
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,190
It was very, very unreliable.

1748
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,150
Yeah, I remember some breakdowns.

1749
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,590
But like, yeah, I didn't know about that.

1750
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:28,790
And then even when it was like the new one came on board, I would have been like 14, 15.

1751
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,590
And I would have been like, oh, it's a Monty Python guy.

1752
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:32,870
Oh, sure.

1753
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1754
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,790
Well, it like takes you out of it almost.

1755
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:35,570
Yeah, yeah.

1756
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,210
I've seen him.

1757
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:38,010
He's from Casper.

1758
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,290
He's from Life and Brian?

1759
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,090
Is he in Casper?

1760
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:41,150
Yeah, right?

1761
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,530
He's helping Kathy Moriarty.

1762
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,330
He's a bad guy, right?

1763
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:44,410
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1764
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:47,030
Yeah, that's kind of a small part for him.

1765
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:47,810
But whatever.

1766
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:51,450
Anyway, one other thing about Billy Barty.

1767
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,550
I'm so excited to read this phrase.

1768
01:24:55,110 --> 01:25:04,670
At the same time in 1983, when this opened, he was in the middle of operating a roller rink in Fullerton, California, not just a few miles from Disneyland.

1769
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:08,790
His roller rink was called Billy Barty's Roller Fantasy.

1770
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:10,770
God bless that.

1771
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:16,610
And that's something you could have in the same night popped down to Disneyland and then gone to Billy Barty's Roller Fantasy.

1772
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:22,250
And the other thing about that is it was not just a roller rink, but a concert venue.

1773
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:29,530
And I'm like, I'm looking up like, well, what dumb concerts happened at Billy Barty's Roller Fantasy?

1774
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:30,970
What kind of bands would they book?

1775
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:34,030
Oh, the answer is New Order and Metallica.

1776
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:38,010
New Order and Metallica played there in 82.

1777
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:42,470
Metallica opened for Rat when they're like a new band.

1778
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,950
They were like an important early concert.

1779
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,350
And then New Order, you can look this up on YouTube.

1780
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,930
You can find the full New Order set from Billy Barty's Roller Fantasy.

1781
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:55,250
And the first song is Blue Monday.

1782
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,950
They start with the big one, doing it then.

1783
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:04,970
So this Billy Barty's Roller Fantasy was a fully legit new wave ska metal venue.

1784
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,410
Like absolutely good.

1785
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:08,970
I hate to call a shot, but that sounds like an episode to me.

1786
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:11,530
Yeah, I mean, I'd agree, except there's almost nothing more.

1787
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,150
There's like three flyers.

1788
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:17,730
Unless listeners and again, send us all your Captain Andy stuff.

1789
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,470
Send us all your Billy Barty stuff.

1790
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:23,650
If anyone has a dead drop or a cache of Billy Barty's Roller Rink.

1791
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:24,450
Yeah, yeah.

1792
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:25,690
Is that nuts though?

1793
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:28,830
Figma had a roller rink that Metallica played?

1794
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:35,970
But the title of that roller rink makes me take back that maybe he didn't like imagination because.

1795
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:36,770
Maybe.

1796
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:37,390
Yeah.

1797
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:38,370
Because it's fantasy.

1798
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:45,890
You wouldn't put your name on top of, if you had any like, you know, like, like, like, that's sissy stuff.

1799
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,030
I don't want to put that word in there.

1800
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:47,770
You would have just said roller rink.

1801
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,550
Yes, exactly.

1802
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:48,830
Yeah.

1803
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,830
That's whimsical though, roller fantasy.

1804
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,490
Yeah.

1805
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:52,070
Yeah.

1806
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,170
Boy, I love it.

1807
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:53,830
That is great.

1808
01:26:53,950 --> 01:27:00,270
I was just reading too Barty was sued in small claims court by two of the writers of the canceled comedy television show Short Ribs.

1809
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,510
He went to court for short ribs.

1810
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,390
Yeah, he lost the cases.

1811
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:04,890
Oh no.

1812
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:14,890
And he said he claimed the lawsuit news was the most publicity he ever got and compared it to similar press that celebrity Jaja Gabor received for slapping in Beverly Hills police officers.

1813
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:16,970
Oh my gosh.

1814
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:17,510
Is that right?

1815
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:18,930
I don't know.

1816
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,610
I'm just, yeah.

1817
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,390
The best thing you'd ever happen to be.

1818
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:24,750
Sue me again, guys.

1819
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:32,790
He had an interesting career and I don't know that we call the shot on his roller rink, but we call a Billy Barty type shot.

1820
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:33,370
Yeah, there you go.

1821
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:33,770
For sure.

1822
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,850
We'll try to find more if we can.

1823
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,070
Billy Barty's life, I mean really cool.

1824
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:43,990
Figment seems like maybe that ends up being his legacy, like his main thing in a way.

1825
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:49,630
I'll pitch also you guys doing an episode of all those guys, like the voiceover guys of that era.

1826
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:50,870
Oh, we've talked, yeah.

1827
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:55,390
We're behind on, honestly that's one of the things we thought we would do from the beginning and then we haven't really.

1828
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:57,510
Who comes to your mind though when we.

1829
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:58,670
Oh, now you gotta put me on the spot.

1830
01:27:58,670 --> 01:27:59,350
Oh, not on the spot.

1831
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:00,830
You don't have to name them.

1832
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:02,150
Thorol.

1833
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:02,550
Thorol.

1834
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:10,370
I'm blanking on his name, but well, in the Haunted Mansion, he's also.

1835
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:12,230
Paul Fries?

1836
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,030
Yeah, yeah.

1837
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,690
Because he was also Tony the Tiger, right?

1838
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:16,470
Isn't he the same guy?

1839
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,730
That's Thorol Ravenscroft.

1840
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:18,910
That's Thorol Ravenscroft.

1841
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:22,430
He's come up as many times as I can make him come up.

1842
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:26,130
What a cool guy, cool voice, looked crazy.

1843
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:29,230
Yeah, Paul Fries is the ghost host in the Haunted Mansion.

1844
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,730
Yeah.

1845
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:36,010
And then how about the VO who did, was it Jack Wilson?

1846
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:39,590
Do you mean the guy, what did he do?

1847
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:43,170
Is he the like voice of the park guy?

1848
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:43,670
Yes.

1849
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:45,770
Jack Wagner.

1850
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,030
Wagner, thank you.

1851
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:52,150
Who is the permanent ser sentados, I'm forgetting the first words wrong.

1852
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:52,910
I'm not gonna try.

1853
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:54,110
If you say it fast, nobody knows.

1854
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:55,210
Permanent ser sentados.

1855
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:55,850
Por favor.

1856
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:56,710
Tapos.

1857
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:57,290
Crap.

1858
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:58,310
Ah, you caught me.

1859
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,010
Yeah, those are on the list.

1860
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:03,170
I don't know, that is one where we thought we would have done those by now and we haven't.

1861
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:03,550
I don't know.

1862
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:04,370
Do them, Derek's calling.

1863
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,470
Do them, do them.

1864
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:11,850
I just think that era is so, I don't want, it just, I wish that still existed.

1865
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:16,870
I like that idea of like, oh, that's the same voice that, I'm not saying it should only

1866
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:20,350
be five actors like working, but I don't know.

1867
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:25,410
I think that era of like these guys could be Tony the Tiger and then also be in the

1868
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:25,990
Disney world.

1869
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:31,730
I just think, I don't know, I'm fascinated by that era of the voiceover world because

1870
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:33,190
I feel like they did so much.

1871
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:33,710
Yes, thousand percent.

1872
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:37,970
I've tried to get like a Billy West episode going because he can do impressions of all

1873
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:42,190
those guys and he's also one of those guys who like, I go, oh my god.

1874
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:42,830
Just need contact info.

1875
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:45,590
I've tried multiple, oh wow.

1876
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:46,470
I have tried.

1877
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:50,450
Who's the way, Derek, you were into the guy, is it the Christmas story voiceover guy?

1878
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:51,070
Who's that?

1879
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,810
Gene Shepherd.

1880
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,570
Gene Shepherd.

1881
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:53,950
Who else is Gene Shepherd?

1882
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:55,390
Or is he, I mean, he's that guy.

1883
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,910
Well, he's Carousel of Progress.

1884
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:59,190
Yeah, the redone Carousel of Progress.

1885
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:00,590
Oh, oh god, right.

1886
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,570
Wow, wow.

1887
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,570
Okay, gotta get to him, gotta get to Carousel.

1888
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:10,650
But the grandfather at the last scene of the current Carousel of Progress is the original.

1889
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:11,650
Oh right, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:17,330
Who's the country singer, Ray, I don't know if you get it.

1891
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,970
It's a country singer who's the voice.

1892
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:21,810
Oh god, who is that?

1893
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:23,230
Everything's going out of my mind.

1894
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:26,710
When you got Billy on the brain, when you got Barty on the brain.

1895
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:28,070
I got Billy Barty on the brain.

1896
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:28,690
What can I tell you?

1897
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:34,170
But I also, when you brought that up, but Jeff Bergman is the best voiceover guy.

1898
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,610
That's, I think, I played you, this friend of mine does these voices.

1899
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:41,690
Oh, you know, well, he's, wait, he's Bugs, or he has been Bugs.

1900
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,690
Yes, oh, you knew his name just by.

1901
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,050
I did, yeah, yeah.

1902
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:53,210
Yes, well, we had Eric Bauza on the show who is a current Bugs, and I know, like, sometimes it's him, and so he was going through, he's able to do the, all right, now you're going to do the Bugs.

1903
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,470
And now I'll do Mel Blank Bugs.

1904
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,110
Now I'll do Jeff Bergman Bugs.

1905
01:30:56,370 --> 01:31:00,090
But Jeff Bergman's also, was he Trump in that Trump cartoon?

1906
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,230
Yes, yes.

1907
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,930
And what, has he been Fred Flintstone?

1908
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:04,630
Fred Flintstone, yeah, Barney.

1909
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,550
He's your friend, really, wow, wow.

1910
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:06,550
And Yogi.

1911
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:07,690
Oh, yeah, wow.

1912
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:08,350
Oh, jeez, wow.

1913
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:14,090
He did Drunk History to do the, when we did the Unsolved Mysteries parody.

1914
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,830
Oh, right.

1915
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:19,670
So he did, like, the best Robert Stack at I Live, Sank, and I was like.

1916
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,270
Wow.

1917
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:42,390
And, but real quick, there was a Drunk History story, I wanted to remember that, we did this episode called Are You Afraid of the Drunk, and it was about the creation of Frankenstein, and there was this one doctor that, I'm blanking on his name, but there's a doctor in the scene, and they were like, what do you want him to wear?

1918
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:48,390
And I was like, well, he should, like, it should be known that he's rich, but he should also be, like, weird.

1919
01:31:49,030 --> 01:32:01,410
And I'm like, like a mink stole, like, I don't know, like, I don't want to do taxidermy, somebody wearing, like, a mink coat, but like, what about, and then I just saw it, I was like, a fig mink.

1920
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:02,630
They're like, what?

1921
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:14,370
I was like, okay, it's fig mink, it's face, but it's the body, like, a mink stole, you know, like, they're like, okay, we'll try.

1922
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:30,530
And then they made it, and it was really, really cool, but then Disney was like, you got to, like, take off his eyes, you got to make them have green spots all over them, but I still have them in my closet.

1923
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:31,170
Wow.

1924
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:35,830
You had to defigmentify the fig mink a little bit.

1925
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:43,090
But it never really, you see it, like, for a second in the show anyway, but I think it was my way of saying I would like a fig mink.

1926
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:52,150
Is that not exactly what the Dreamfinder, you took figment from your imagination, you added, like, when he's holding the blocks and the mystery part.

1927
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:52,450
That's right.

1928
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:55,990
Yeah, you tipped it over to Kay, and now it's a fig mink.

1929
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:57,430
Rex Allen.

1930
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:58,830
That's right.

1931
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:01,310
Yeah, Rex Allen is the grandfather in Carousel.

1932
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,650
How do we all mess that up?

1933
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:03,910
We'll let everybody do it.

1934
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:06,370
We'll have our info straight when we get to Carousel.

1935
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:17,150
Is this a good time, because you have that item, but you also have, you have another item, which is part of what brings you here for this attraction.

1936
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:26,090
Well, yeah, I mean, I'll just say that I was very, I have been very lucky in my life.

1937
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:35,050
I got to go to a Disney auction, and there was a figment there from the original ride.

1938
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:39,590
Figment nerds believe he was the upside down figment.

1939
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:43,450
In this footage, I can't, it's very hard to see.

1940
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:45,830
I couldn't find it.

1941
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,670
I was really, I really wanted to come in.

1942
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,210
Same.

1943
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,530
Here it is.

1944
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:49,990
Yeah.

1945
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,550
Now, I don't think I was scammed.

1946
01:33:54,990 --> 01:34:06,170
But there are parts of me sometimes where I'm like, maybe he was outside of the ride to let you know it was under construction.

1947
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:09,410
Either way, an Imagineer made this figment.

1948
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,970
And it's figment on a little board looking over.

1949
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:22,270
And yeah, I decided to sell a Shohei Otani card, baseball card.

1950
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:27,250
He's going to give, having trading Otani for a figment.

1951
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,130
Like figment will inspire me.

1952
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,810
Otani is really cool.

1953
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:37,890
But if I'm going to be able to decide between the two, I'm not going to stare at a baseball card all day.

1954
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:42,990
I don't stare at figment, but knowing like, because it represents art inspiration.

1955
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:47,790
And I just, anyway, I'm making an excuse for why I would spend money.

1956
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:48,930
Awesome.

1957
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:52,030
It's an amazing thing to go for and to get.

1958
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,510
I do.

1959
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:56,870
I have a picture of your because it was at the gallery in the Burbank Mall.

1960
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,310
This was the Joel McGee collection.

1961
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:02,470
I was so excited to hear that you got it.

1962
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:04,610
And he's like fused into a little block.

1963
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:06,510
So it's just his head and hands.

1964
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:09,630
But if you hold it upside down, that's what I think it was.

1965
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,850
Hold the thing upside down.

1966
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:11,290
Yeah.

1967
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:12,830
Hold the image upside down.

1968
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,130
Oh, you literally put it on the wall.

1969
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:17,190
Yeah, like there's like, Denny's on the wall.

1970
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:20,950
It's like, why would his hands be up like right now?

1971
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:22,930
Did you like put it in the ceiling?

1972
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,170
Originally I was like, that would be so cool.

1973
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:30,010
But I have some people that I don't want touching that.

1974
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:31,370
Okay.

1975
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,930
Anyway, I'd say no.

1976
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,530
But I have a case that people I like, you touch it.

1977
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:38,070
I was like, you got to feel his fingers.

1978
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:43,270
Like there's a butt upside down on a ceiling is where I would love it.

1979
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:44,930
But I'm just afraid of.

1980
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:46,190
Yeah.

1981
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,030
It's also from 1983.

1982
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,630
Like he's just hanging on.

1983
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,630
That might shatter as soon as anything.

1984
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:53,170
Yeah.

1985
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:54,070
Does it feel that way?

1986
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:57,050
Because you did have to like handle it to put it in the case.

1987
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:57,850
So like.

1988
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:58,290
Yeah.

1989
01:35:58,290 --> 01:36:03,270
Well, I got nervous because it came without the, what I learned this week,

1990
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,130
the horns of a steer.

1991
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:11,850
Those weren't on when I picked it up and I was like, oh no, oh no.

1992
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:14,550
And I'm like, I can't like, I don't want to mess.

1993
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,150
I don't want to mess this up.

1994
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,570
This is like, this is my child.

1995
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,510
I dropped this.

1996
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:20,370
I'm dead.

1997
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:22,070
This is my inspiration.

1998
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:22,910
Yeah.

1999
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:24,530
It could dissolve in your hand.

2000
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:27,270
It could crack the whole thing.

2001
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:28,750
Like I thought about it.

2002
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:36,050
I was like, whoa, let me just think if someone came in here right now with a baseball bat and cracked it in half,

2003
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:37,750
what would I do?

2004
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,650
I know it's just a material item, but what would I do?

2005
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:45,450
And I just, I don't, I don't think I could move.

2006
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,170
Like I think it like has repers.

2007
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:53,090
I think it was like, it represents something so strong to me that it's like, I don't know.

2008
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:55,350
It's your rosebud or something like.

2009
01:36:57,370 --> 01:37:08,590
Let me ask, because so many, so much mixed media used in this attraction and some materials used in the past,

2010
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:13,650
they didn't know how it would withstand a few decades of time.

2011
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:14,930
Does it stink?

2012
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:17,250
Does it smell?

2013
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,930
I did not see that question echoing that way.

2014
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:29,970
It's very funny because it's been since April last year that I have not gained my scent of smell or taste.

2015
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:30,710
Oh no.

2016
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:32,230
Oh my God.

2017
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:34,150
That's a COVID thing.

2018
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:34,510
Right.

2019
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:34,770
Right.

2020
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:35,610
COVID thing.

2021
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:36,230
Whoa.

2022
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:40,630
And it's very funny to say that because I'm like, what if it fucking smells?

2023
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,930
I would have no idea.

2024
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:43,610
Geez.

2025
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,210
That sucks.

2026
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:45,810
I was so, you showed it to me.

2027
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:51,690
I don't think it smelled, but I think it had the case on so I couldn't, at least it stayed basically.

2028
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:52,750
I can smell.

2029
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:55,630
I just can't tell what it is, if that makes sense.

2030
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:59,090
So if there was an odor, I can get it.

2031
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:06,910
I only ask because I've been at like antique stores or comic conventions or collectible shops.

2032
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:08,850
And I'm like, oh, this is really cool.

2033
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:10,770
It's like from such and such year.

2034
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:15,630
And I'm like, this kind of smells and I don't think I want it in my house.

2035
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:18,870
I know there's the good mildew, which is the ET ride.

2036
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:19,570
We know that.

2037
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:21,130
That's the good mildew.

2038
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:29,390
But I remember this guy, Joel, that I got it from, which I also realized this is why he does this.

2039
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,970
And I was like, how do you do, why?

2040
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:34,470
We all want to be able to have all these toys.

2041
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:45,190
But then getting rid of them, what my reaction to him made me go, oh, I am very excited to be in his shoes someday because I was near tears.

2042
01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:47,550
Saying how much this means to me.

2043
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:52,050
And I was like, where did you keep this?

2044
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:56,910
He's like, oh, in storage spaces like some of this stuff I've never even seen.

2045
01:38:57,010 --> 01:39:01,450
Now, that part definitely I didn't like because I was like, all right, that's too much money.

2046
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:10,490
But I guarantee you that thing has been around like crap and rainy storage unit.

2047
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:12,370
But now it was well kept.

2048
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:14,170
But that is a really good question.

2049
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,590
I just get a ridge.

2050
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:19,530
I got an original Splash Mountain watch.

2051
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:20,370
Wow.

2052
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:23,310
Or their opening day Splash Mountain.

2053
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,330
Oh, yeah, you should.

2054
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:30,150
Would that like where it's like the comic kind of font instead of like the folksy Critter Country font.

2055
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:34,930
But that that wasn't in that that that one might smell.

2056
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,610
It is.

2057
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:37,370
You play whatever.

2058
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:43,210
I love that question because we don't think about that when we look at something so.

2059
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:54,210
Perfect in our mind of like this animatronic of Dreamfinder like that mustache glued on probably fucking reeks again.

2060
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:55,450
Oh, you're right.

2061
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:55,870
Yeah.

2062
01:39:55,870 --> 01:40:02,910
And then failed fog experiments made like bad shitty old fog soak in a mustache that probably never came out of it.

2063
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,710
Well, it covered in lead paint.

2064
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:11,050
How many of those old animatronics had like hydraulic fluid fluid going through?

2065
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,690
They had a big open wound.

2066
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:20,670
Now, do we think we have to have this conversation?

2067
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:26,350
But with what I said about Captain Well, we talked about Captain Andy at the top, why they had to shut it down.

2068
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:28,970
Do you think there were too many figments?

2069
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:32,850
Like, how can you take figment off the ride?

2070
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,250
I what do you think it was?

2071
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,970
I think there was an unfocused.

2072
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:46,350
It will be cooler and the new I think they were trying to shake money out of Kodak and they did, but not enough to do something good.

2073
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:55,350
And I think Kodak in some unfocused manner of like this silly cartoon character is not the modern cutting edge.

2074
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:59,570
Two thousand look Kodak will continue for decades to come.

2075
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:00,710
No problem.

2076
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:02,990
It's going to be a grand twenty first century for Kodak.

2077
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:06,050
And we can't have the face of our thing be this silly cartoon.

2078
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:08,010
I think it was some like odd.

2079
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:20,950
Tony also implied without saying a name, but one of those good little like Tony Baxter shots where he's like this was somebody else's opportunity, the management at the time to prove that they're creative and they could come up with a different thing.

2080
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:24,350
And I don't know if he means I don't think he means Eisner.

2081
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:27,150
I probably maybe like somebody at the parks at that time.

2082
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:28,430
I wouldn't know where to begin.

2083
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:37,850
But I think it was that I think it was some like lame sterile late 90s cartoons aren't cool, which you saw at that time.

2084
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:41,190
So like a cute goes away and earnest goes away.

2085
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:44,610
And then I think we all kind of reclaim it and want it.

2086
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:49,290
But that's my as much as none of that makes any sense.

2087
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,250
I think that's why they took them away.

2088
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:52,870
It seems like there were five reasons.

2089
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:54,230
It's politics.

2090
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:56,230
It's the new head of something.

2091
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:59,570
It's sponsor and it's the issues.

2092
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:03,650
Other pavilions that have kept losing sponsors.

2093
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,730
So then that would lose a lot of that.

2094
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,010
We can't do it again.

2095
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:07,450
Yeah.

2096
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,390
They got rid of the thing that tech probably broke down the most.

2097
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,110
They did.

2098
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:18,150
And they want to make sure they had some sense that like some kind of probably unfocused like well, Tower of Terror is like a short ride.

2099
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,070
And that's how you thrill.

2100
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:20,150
And so we got it.

2101
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:22,010
Are this can't we can't have a big long ride.

2102
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:26,250
Insane, insane that you would cut down by like 35 percent.

2103
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,150
They cut down the ride length.

2104
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,870
Yeah.

2105
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:29,710
Strangest thing.

2106
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:30,110
Wow.

2107
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:37,330
I'm so glad we're going to mostly put this in its own episode because I thought there'd be some real joy to talking about this.

2108
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,410
And I love that.

2109
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:39,910
I love it.

2110
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:42,710
Stink of the new one can will close the door.

2111
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:45,390
That smells culturally.

2112
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,610
The new ride smell.

2113
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:50,870
But also, wasn't there another Honey, I shrunk the audience reference that that was another thing.

2114
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:53,090
Yeah, they were kind of linking it all together.

2115
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:54,910
Eric Idle shows up into that.

2116
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:58,030
And then they were trying to link in like flubber.

2117
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:03,370
And then some really old Disney movie computer war tennis shoes.

2118
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,470
I think was referenced very right.

2119
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:08,450
That'll get that'll that'll hold them.

2120
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:11,110
The kids, they'll love that computer war tennis shoes.

2121
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:19,750
I'll say this as a 14, 15 year old, I liked all the like shared characters showing up in other attractions.

2122
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:20,350
Yes.

2123
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:21,530
I like that.

2124
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,070
And then I like that.

2125
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:27,890
Eventually, Professor Brainerd won the inventor of the year award in the past.

2126
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,530
The only thing I like about any of this.

2127
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:39,090
I I don't hate the third version as much as some people where they put a bunch of figments back in.

2128
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:41,710
Yeah, because there's at least a bunch of figments.

2129
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:45,850
But if I look at it in the context of like, oh, and this replaces.

2130
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:47,390
Oh, I despise it.

2131
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:47,910
Yeah, of course.

2132
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:52,870
The fact that you went on it because we didn't go on it when we were down there a couple of months ago.

2133
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:54,270
Oh, yeah, I don't think I would.

2134
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:56,510
I don't think I want to go on this new one ever again.

2135
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:57,550
Figment or no figment.

2136
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:00,210
Yeah, it's just I don't know.

2137
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:00,850
But you're right.

2138
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:03,950
Keep it alive because if you don't go, it's dead.

2139
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:06,630
It's like, all right, it won't be the same.

2140
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:09,390
But we got to make a movie because no one goes there.

2141
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:10,290
That's the only way.

2142
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:14,050
Well, doesn't as of, you know, development things come and go.

2143
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:18,850
The last anybody heard about any of this, Seth Rogan and his company had the rights to a thing.

2144
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:20,890
I have zero clue.

2145
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:25,390
Maybe somebody listening knows where that's at or if it's already not happening.

2146
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:31,630
But that's like, OK, well, there's a name that would, you know, do something cool with it.

2147
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:33,110
Probably a question.

2148
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,770
I've seen the question of like figment.

2149
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,870
Maybe there's hope for more figment.

2150
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:39,610
Is Dreamfinder dead?

2151
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,570
Is Dreamfinder gone forever?

2152
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:42,510
Because I don't know.

2153
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:46,550
I think they can recontextualize like and you could do them with you could do figment with new animation.

2154
01:44:46,590 --> 01:44:50,550
It doesn't feel like culturally here in the 2020s that we're after.

2155
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,270
Like, why hello there?

2156
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:53,770
Well, we've talked I want it.

2157
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:54,630
That's all I want.

2158
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:59,810
We've talked about the comic a couple of years ago that they put out with Hot Young Dreamfinder.

2159
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,770
And it starts in 1901.

2160
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:04,870
I don't know.

2161
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:10,030
I'm not saying we have to use that canon, but I'm just saying if you look, I'll take like Hot Young Dreamfinder.

2162
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,170
If that's the option on the table.

2163
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:20,030
Yeah, I think also, too, people always like, you know, fantasize of like, well, they should rebuild Horizons.

2164
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,870
They should rebuild it.

2165
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,310
And it's like that's never going to happen.

2166
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,110
I don't know.

2167
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:26,090
But Horizons is a whole other building.

2168
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:27,250
This they have.

2169
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:28,990
Well, that's what the vehicle is.

2170
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,710
That's what I was going to say.

2171
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:32,470
It's like you could reboot this.

2172
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:38,030
Yeah, this hasn't changed much in function, like in in grand schematics.

2173
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:40,810
I mean, it's changed, certainly.

2174
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:49,550
And Image Works taken away is just a DVC club lounge now, I think, upstairs.

2175
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,790
Some amount of it, but not as much as it used to be.

2176
01:45:53,190 --> 01:46:02,230
But like this and then this was always getting like the rumors were like, oh, it's going to be like Phineas and Fur meat figment and teach about imagination.

2177
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:04,730
I've never heard that in my life.

2178
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:08,270
We're going 10, 15 years ago at this point.

2179
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:11,490
But like Inside Out was floated.

2180
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:12,570
I've got that.

2181
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,030
And I've come to really like Inside Out.

2182
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:16,470
It's been on the ass a lot.

2183
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:19,310
I would accept and and figment.

2184
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:23,250
There's a picture of figment in the movie with Bing Bong.

2185
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:24,030
There's a show there.

2186
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:25,250
They hit a little thing.

2187
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:25,770
Easter egg.

2188
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:29,950
So clearly they're like there's thought about tying those things together.

2189
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,790
So I'm sorry for although I couldn't find the image.

2190
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:34,910
But it's a figment and Toy Story 4.

2191
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:35,270
Yeah.

2192
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:35,790
Whoa.

2193
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:37,290
I don't know about that one.

2194
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:40,930
Well, yeah, I saw our people seem like real parks people.

2195
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:42,530
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

2196
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:46,870
There's other works references in Inside Out to his mission breakout figment.

2197
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:47,970
Oh, that's right.

2198
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:48,350
Oh, yeah.

2199
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,090
You seem in the yeah.

2200
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:51,170
Have you seen him in the Guardians line?

2201
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,550
Oh, yeah.

2202
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,490
Yeah.

2203
01:46:52,670 --> 01:46:52,950
Yeah.

2204
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:55,710
He's in a cage like Captain Andy's pals.

2205
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:56,190
Yeah.

2206
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,170
I frozen like is that the idea that he's frozen?

2207
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:00,970
I don't know.

2208
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:01,510
What is it?

2209
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,070
He doesn't know.

2210
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,610
He doesn't know.

2211
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,630
You know, I don't think he is frozen because the Guardians are not frozen.

2212
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:07,370
They're things there.

2213
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:07,610
Yeah.

2214
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:08,730
So he's probably in there.

2215
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,670
It's just he's being tortured now.

2216
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,510
He's just he's got no air.

2217
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:13,710
Zapping him.

2218
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:14,250
Yeah.

2219
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:15,130
Figment is in the Guardians.

2220
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:15,430
Right.

2221
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:16,670
And he's hurt.

2222
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,210
Do you guys sorry this feels like I'm on drugs.

2223
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:19,630
I'm not.

2224
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,270
But Flight of the Navigator.

2225
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:22,990
This just came in my head.

2226
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:30,450
There's some little critter that's on that spaceship that when you were saying that,

2227
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:33,410
I was like I was picturing this little like it's not a dinosaur.

2228
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:39,390
It's like a little like I just remember like I think I connected that to figment.

2229
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,750
Who is that?

2230
01:47:40,970 --> 01:47:42,110
You know, I know there's the pole.

2231
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:44,650
You're not talking about the robot or not the robot.

2232
01:47:44,650 --> 01:47:45,370
They're talking about this.

2233
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:47,970
There was like a little like this thing.

2234
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,450
Yeah.

2235
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:51,390
He's a lot like Captain Eos pals.

2236
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,970
Yeah.

2237
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:53,090
That all kind of ties together.

2238
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:53,730
Anyway, sorry.

2239
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:54,470
What is his name?

2240
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,390
Do we know his name?

2241
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:56,230
Little critters.

2242
01:47:56,390 --> 01:48:00,310
I think we're all prepped for a little critter renaissance.

2243
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:08,070
But do you remember that figment is an alligator face?

2244
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:14,830
It's an alligator mouth with horns as a steer like that.

2245
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:16,470
I never knew until research.

2246
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,470
It's an alligator mouth.

2247
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:17,690
Really?

2248
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:18,970
It's an alligator mouth.

2249
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:25,150
That seems like one of the things where there's so many pieces in the set, which by the way,

2250
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:32,830
hearing Tony Baxter talk about it, there's like stuff they didn't get in there from like running out of time, running out of money.

2251
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,590
He's like, I wanted this effect.

2252
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:40,890
Like he was still in 2015 going like, I would redo this part if I could do it again.

2253
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:44,290
Or it's like this would have been even better if this worked 100 percent.

2254
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:47,590
He's like, why did they not just update this put in the digital age?

2255
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:52,290
Because all these things could have been done with current projection and instead of just ripping it out coldly.

2256
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:53,890
I really cannot find the name of this critter.

2257
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:54,390
It's OK.

2258
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:57,990
I just was like, oh, I think all the critters like you're saying look the same.

2259
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:00,770
There is a real style of critter.

2260
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,390
All these mid 80s things.

2261
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,430
Goblins.

2262
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:06,730
I feel like we're sort of like on the way up.

2263
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:17,930
But do we want to shout out anything else like in terms of that stuff, like the details to note in this, anything where it's like we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about this or that in this thread.

2264
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,550
Oh, gosh.

2265
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:20,690
There's so much.

2266
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:25,890
Like the song itself, you're saying like I didn't I didn't realize that.

2267
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,230
I guess I've heard that.

2268
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:31,750
But like, yeah, he's got like a horns of a steer eyes, two tiny wings eyes.

2269
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:32,350
But wait, do I?

2270
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:33,050
Oh, wait, I have a spirit.

2271
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:37,610
Let's just but but but what would what fellow what is it?

2272
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:39,390
But a lovable fellow.

2273
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,050
Yeah, thank you.

2274
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:42,170
Thank you.

2275
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:43,870
Eyes big and yellow.

2276
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:45,690
Horns of a steer.

2277
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:47,490
But a lovable fellow.

2278
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:49,350
From head to tail.

2279
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:51,350
He's royal purple pigment.

2280
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:58,250
And there you got a figment of figment of imagination.

2281
01:49:59,450 --> 01:50:02,490
I feel like they're trying not quite.

2282
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:06,290
I'll throw in a dash of childish delight.

2283
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:08,850
Oh, geez.

2284
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:14,230
I feel like they're trying to tell you like, yeah, look, he may look like he's a demon from hell, but don't worry about it.

2285
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:15,150
He's friendly.

2286
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:18,530
He's nice because they're saying he's got the horns of his dear, but I the level.

2287
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:19,570
Don't worry about it.

2288
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,470
Oh, worry that the but is I think.

2289
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:28,790
Yeah, I think but is the the word but in there means like, yeah, he's got horns, but don't worry.

2290
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:29,770
Yeah, he's good.

2291
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:30,530
He's fine.

2292
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,150
He's not a he's not the devil.

2293
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:33,950
He's not the devil.

2294
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:34,430
Not a freak.

2295
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:35,950
Don't throw sodas at him.

2296
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,150
Yeah.

2297
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:36,470
Yeah.

2298
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:39,250
But things do get scary.

2299
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:39,970
Not sure.

2300
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:41,070
I'm playing clips.

2301
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:45,830
I did I have zero memory of the scary mystery part, and this is a this is nuts.

2302
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:46,970
This part.

2303
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:08,110
Yeah, I loved it.

2304
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:08,950
I love that.

2305
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:10,210
Yeah, killer.

2306
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:12,330
They say in this ride and blood.

2307
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:13,490
It's an organ.

2308
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:16,170
But again, it's it's not keys.

2309
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,210
It's letters.

2310
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,570
It's like a typewriter.

2311
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:18,690
Right.

2312
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:20,030
Yeah, that's a hell of a piece.

2313
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:20,990
That's really cool.

2314
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:22,270
And then everything you pass.

2315
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:25,830
So figment with the blocks, the change cat to bat, the raven.

2316
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:28,070
There's scary animation.

2317
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:35,890
That's like the Tony like Claude Coats influence, which is the one I think I'm saying, but like Snow White Scary Adventure.

2318
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:40,330
But even like when you're up going up the hill on Splash Mountain, you're like, it's scary.

2319
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:48,130
Like, he's making sure he's got a little little piece in there that's scary, because that is a fun I think of being a kid and conquering something that feels scary.

2320
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:53,370
And then you're out and then you're out and then it feels like you account like it really feels like you did something there.

2321
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:57,950
Like you really went through something if there was a little period of like extreme uncomfortableness.

2322
01:51:58,830 --> 01:51:58,930
Sure.

2323
01:51:58,990 --> 01:52:01,430
Why are the bats there at the end of the pirates?

2324
01:52:01,950 --> 01:52:03,870
I always was like, why are you there?

2325
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:05,610
At the Pirates ride?

2326
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:07,010
Yeah, the end of the pirates.

2327
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,930
Like those are bats.

2328
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:09,190
Perfectly about the bats.

2329
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:12,830
Well, I'm just thinking about your point like the like surviving something.

2330
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:15,170
I was like, yeah, but then the ride's over.

2331
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,270
Like, I guess you get a little like.

2332
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,250
Well, Pirates has a weird.

2333
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:19,390
You're talking about Disneyland Pirates.

2334
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:25,510
Right.

2335
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:27,210
Because like space outro.

2336
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:28,870
Because yeah, the whole thing's on fire.

2337
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:31,410
The pirates have like destroyed the town.

2338
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:36,190
And then you're like you're getting in the middle of a gunfight, but it still feels like you're going so slow.

2339
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:36,510
Right.

2340
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:37,250
And you're going up.

2341
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:41,950
It just feels like you're really easing back into reality versus like, oh, my God, we got out.

2342
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:45,410
So there's like scary elements after the town has been burned down.

2343
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:47,670
But I feel like they didn't.

2344
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:51,170
Well, what's the is it the Paris one that like the drop is at the end?

2345
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:51,710
I think so.

2346
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:51,910
Yeah.

2347
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:59,010
Because like the correct tone, the corrected corrected, quote unquote, like the problem in the sense that like, well, the end should probably be the drop.

2348
01:52:59,010 --> 01:53:01,950
But this one wasn't scary until just there.

2349
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:03,770
I think that's the middle of the ride.

2350
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:04,230
Yeah.

2351
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:04,450
Yeah.

2352
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:05,590
This wasn't like the climax.

2353
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:06,110
Yeah.

2354
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:06,530
Yeah.

2355
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:12,690
And then this is where it goes to him, like in a little dressing room in a Toxin Dales.

2356
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:14,070
A brand new show.

2357
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:14,910
Showman champ.

2358
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:15,770
I did.

2359
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:16,770
I did think of you.

2360
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:18,790
I was like you took the words out of my mouth.

2361
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:22,190
This must have been adjacent to the idea of like putting out like a little vaudeville.

2362
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:23,410
Putting on a show.

2363
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:23,790
Yeah.

2364
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:29,450
In Epcot and especially in MGM studios, they were like, it's time to put on a show.

2365
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,510
Show must go on.

2366
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:31,690
Time to put on a show.

2367
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:32,790
Tales and Top Hats.

2368
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:47,930
It's kind of the only it's like we're all the sweetness.

2369
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:48,730
Yeah.

2370
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:54,350
The thing that they ripped out especially like the the birth of figment moment and the whimsical machine.

2371
01:53:54,910 --> 01:54:00,370
They took out the only like real kid lightness in original Epcot, I think.

2372
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:00,850
Yeah.

2373
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:09,910
And it's also they took like I mean the ride's still there but like they took out and I forget I'm going to put this in the like shittiest way because I can't remember exactly what people were saying.

2374
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:13,650
But they're like all the other things we were trying to teach people about.

2375
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:18,590
We also wanted to have something that said like, well, this is like imagination where all of that stuff comes from.

2376
01:54:18,990 --> 01:54:27,990
Like the imagination pavilion is where we kind of try to explain to people that we cannot have any inventions without somebody coming up with something in a creative way.

2377
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:34,030
So then you got that and then the whole thing is kind of lost because you get like the engine of it is gone.

2378
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:35,630
It's like it sucks.

2379
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:39,270
Kind of like cynical 90s like sarcasm.

2380
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:41,030
Yes, exactly.

2381
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:46,970
For that like really unpleasant like era that we talk about where it was like, yeah, this is out of date.

2382
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:47,850
Ten years later.

2383
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:52,570
The only spaceship Earth there.

2384
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:53,870
So I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

2385
01:54:54,150 --> 01:55:05,010
But at the time it's like, oh yeah, that's kind of like lesson number one for explaining how like somebody comes up with an idea or somebody comes up with inventions and stuff and learns about science.

2386
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:05,790
Whatever they have.

2387
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:06,570
They have a theory.

2388
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:07,390
They have an idea.

2389
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:09,830
And now that's all gone.

2390
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:10,570
That's done.

2391
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:14,570
So it's like the park is never truly.

2392
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:17,650
If this are we calling this the heart of Epcot Center?

2393
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:19,150
Especially after I heard that.

2394
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:20,810
It hasn't had its heart since 1998.

2395
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:22,550
Yes, that's what I thought now.

2396
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:23,610
I think so too.

2397
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:30,410
And I was just thinking like do you like Figment is the logo, the mascot in my head.

2398
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:31,030
Yeah.

2399
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,650
Of the park.

2400
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:33,610
But who is the mascot?

2401
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:43,650
And would that have been a problem that Mickey was, you know, like that there's a different mascot at Epcot than there is.

2402
01:55:44,530 --> 01:55:45,290
Would that be?

2403
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:46,030
I don't know.

2404
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:50,110
I'm very confused why you get rid of someone so likeable and loved.

2405
01:55:50,290 --> 01:55:51,970
They tried to make them all live together.

2406
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:57,150
You can find art of like here's Mickey and Minnie and Figment all as equals hanging out.

2407
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,150
And then you wouldn't buy mouse ears.

2408
01:55:59,290 --> 01:55:59,650
Right.

2409
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:06,390
At Epcot you would buy a Figment hat where is like beak is the brim.

2410
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:07,630
Those are cool as hell.

2411
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:08,710
I'd like to know those.

2412
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:25,470
And I feel like it encountered what is now a very modern problem, which is like it's not making money hand over fist immediately.

2413
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:31,870
Like it's not making like Avengers in-game opening weekend, you know, midnight.

2414
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:37,070
Like it so quickly they seemed like they got very insecure at Epcot.

2415
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,710
I mean, you have the living seas.

2416
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:43,410
But how quickly do you like, all right, put a bunch of Sega games and Barbie in there.

2417
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:44,950
Stupid children.

2418
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,830
These children are stupid when we need their money.

2419
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:52,050
And then Figment's like everyone's imagining.

2420
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:54,730
It's working.

2421
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:56,770
Children are smart.

2422
01:56:57,710 --> 01:57:03,270
The only thing in their defense is that Epcot did cost a ton of money and it didn't do well at all.

2423
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:06,130
And the rest of the company was right before Eisner.

2424
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,970
Like and the movies aren't good.

2425
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:10,670
That's a real part of the magic too.

2426
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:18,730
Looking at like these nice little Figment animated pieces that are from 83, a totally dark time for the company where the animated films aren't good.

2427
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:21,770
And the feature other than like drawn is cool.

2428
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,530
Everything like it's a weird grim time.

2429
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:28,450
And then through it all, like the one, the beacon of light is Figment.

2430
01:57:28,630 --> 01:57:29,150
Yes.

2431
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:32,930
And he's still like they're still trying to have their cake and eat it too.

2432
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:37,230
Because like all the popcorn buckets they sell and people go nuts for it.

2433
01:57:37,230 --> 01:57:37,490
Yeah.

2434
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:43,350
And they just had like debuted a new character spot where you take photos with them and people going nuts for it.

2435
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,710
Like and he keeps falling.

2436
01:57:44,830 --> 01:57:45,990
Has he stopped falling down?

2437
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:47,010
I mean, those are so.

2438
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:48,410
There was a famous poll.

2439
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:50,210
It's been more than once.

2440
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:51,290
Did it have more than once?

2441
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:51,670
Yeah.

2442
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:52,730
I don't think they got it.

2443
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:54,110
They work on the eyes.

2444
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:57,550
He's not meant to be tall.

2445
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:58,190
It's weird.

2446
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:59,290
He's really tall.

2447
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:02,970
He reminds me, you know, part of me last night going like, where do I think it also?

2448
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:04,790
I was like, Jeffrey, Toys R Us.

2449
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:08,630
I was like, there was a little bit of Jeffrey in or vice versa.

2450
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:09,010
Right.

2451
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:09,810
We've never done that.

2452
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:11,310
We never talked about Jeffrey.

2453
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:13,110
Oh, we have not talked about Jeffrey.

2454
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:14,330
We need that.

2455
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:14,410
Yeah.

2456
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:28,130
The there's a restored like right through and like all around Pavilion and they get some of Walk Around Dream Finder and Puppet Figment.

2457
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:33,530
There's a he's doing a really funny bit where Figment keeps knocking kids hats off.

2458
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:36,790
Like he just keeps biting onto the hat and throwing it away.

2459
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:39,590
And everyone's having so much fun.

2460
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:42,330
One day we haven't said Ron Schneider.

2461
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:44,850
Who is the one in the park?

2462
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:45,590
Yeah.

2463
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:47,210
Walk around Dream Finder.

2464
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:47,550
Right.

2465
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:48,490
For a lot of stuff.

2466
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:49,230
Yes.

2467
01:58:50,330 --> 01:58:50,970
Who had to.

2468
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:56,170
So he's doing the walk around and doing the puppeting and they who did not Figment would not talk.

2469
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:59,650
That was one confusing when he was out on the do a ventriloquist thing.

2470
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:04,690
There was some specific calculation of why that's maybe the only bad thing about that.

2471
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:08,890
There's a great clip on the Today Show of Brian Gumbel talking to Dream Finder and Figment.

2472
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:11,730
And it is weird that Figment's not saying anything.

2473
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,230
Yeah.

2474
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,890
Brian's just like, oh, well, what do you do?

2475
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:15,350
Oh, you have imagination here.

2476
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,390
Well, what about your friend here?

2477
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:20,230
But he also says he's my right hand man.

2478
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,390
And he's on his left.

2479
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:26,010
And I guess he forgot they had to move over for the camera.

2480
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:28,430
That's either an oversight or a great joke.

2481
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:30,590
Yeah, that's a good point.

2482
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:32,410
A little more clearly.

2483
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:38,730
If they really want to get people excited, I feel like this is a Figment costume, but like bringing back the puppeted.

2484
01:59:38,730 --> 01:59:39,830
Dream Finder and just do it.

2485
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,670
They have the small things.

2486
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:42,450
They do like baby Groot and stuff.

2487
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:46,570
I'm like, that is the ultimate if he's just a smaller like little puppet character.

2488
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:50,030
And you go up next to a table and they're doing like Zootopia stuff.

2489
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,910
Like, have you seen that thing they wheeled out on stage for Zootopia?

2490
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:54,710
They have a like character.

2491
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:56,170
I don't know if it's a puppet, though.

2492
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:58,530
There's a character that can kind of climb up.

2493
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:00,730
It's a free roaming animatronic.

2494
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:02,830
Yeah, it's really wild.

2495
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:05,310
Now, I don't know if they're going to put the money into Figment for that.

2496
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:08,310
But still, they have little things you can take pictures with.

2497
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,350
I would love to do parkour.

2498
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:10,090
I want Figment.

2499
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:12,370
I would love Figment to do parkour.

2500
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:17,590
They should have like a spot to like Mickey's a magician and you go in and you meet him in his dressing room before the show.

2501
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:19,790
Wow, I would love that.

2502
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:25,090
You know, I just thought, you know, I think Dreamcatcher and Figment are just Walt and Mickey.

2503
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:30,970
Like, I know that they had said like Dream Finder had like Walt inspiration.

2504
02:00:32,150 --> 02:00:34,610
It's impossible for any character there not to.

2505
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:39,050
But I'm like, oh, it's that relationship that it's like, I don't know.

2506
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:41,550
The creator and the creation.

2507
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:45,090
Yeah, like really has got the spirit and the childlike wonder.

2508
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:49,830
And then, yeah, if we could bring it back, all it takes is as long as they're making money.

2509
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,930
I hate we hate the reality of that.

2510
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:56,430
Yeah, it's like if that's not making money, they have to get rid of it.

2511
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:58,450
And that really bums me out.

2512
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,270
What do we do?

2513
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:06,070
Is there a way to keep Dream Finder and not have to meld it into Inside Out?

2514
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:10,290
Like, no, I mean, just the way the company is.

2515
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:11,430
I will accept an inside out.

2516
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:12,390
I like inside out.

2517
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:15,290
I think the spirit does combine with Figment decently.

2518
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:19,370
I'm not against that, but I would miss at least just have can Dream Finder be outside?

2519
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:21,070
He doesn't need to.

2520
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:22,330
I don't need a flying machine back.

2521
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:24,870
I know that's hard to do, but can he be outside?

2522
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:29,710
And then if Figment needs to go meet anger and sadness in the ride, that's OK.

2523
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:30,850
I like them.

2524
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:35,390
Yeah, they should they should pony up for the real cast like they didn't do for the movie.

2525
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:40,230
But the sequel and Figment said, Bing Bong to hell.

2526
02:01:40,650 --> 02:01:44,570
Like, not every idea is a good idea.

2527
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:46,370
You've been outgrown.

2528
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:48,810
There's an idea of fire.

2529
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:49,890
I don't know.

2530
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:57,710
I don't know why they don't do more like photo op stuff that's like a little bit more like elevated, like a Halloween Horror Nights maze.

2531
02:01:57,790 --> 02:02:06,990
Just like give me like a little rainbow tunnel that leads to just a kind of a dream, whatever catcher, whatever the name of his vehicle is with a guy and a puppet.

2532
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:11,910
Like I just like that doesn't feel like it would cost more than I'm going to say 50 grand.

2533
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:14,290
I don't know what it technically cost to build anything.

2534
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:22,830
But add a damn hashtag above dream, you know, like have just do the dumb wings that people get their picture.

2535
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:23,810
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2536
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,330
Oh, yeah.

2537
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:26,890
Like you would be I don't know.

2538
02:02:27,150 --> 02:02:31,070
Just it makes me so sad knowing there's so much unused space in there.

2539
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:34,470
Yeah, that is a big empty box that waiting.

2540
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:36,110
Yeah, yes.

2541
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:38,170
That still looks as good as it did.

2542
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:42,410
It is like I it's not it hasn't been decimated like other Epcot things.

2543
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:47,810
It's breaking Dreamfinder and the original figments heart that they have.

2544
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:48,310
Yes.

2545
02:02:48,810 --> 02:02:50,730
Imagine what I don't know.

2546
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:52,790
They just we got to trade them.

2547
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,610
We trade what they taught us.

2548
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:54,910
Right.

2549
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:55,390
I know.

2550
02:02:55,450 --> 02:02:56,670
We got to bring them back.

2551
02:02:56,790 --> 02:03:02,610
This is like 50th down the list of things they need that they're like on the internal list.

2552
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:05,110
I bet of stuff Disney needs to do.

2553
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:06,910
This is so far down the list.

2554
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,410
It's just making me sad about it.

2555
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:09,830
They keep it.

2556
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:11,490
They'll do these D23s.

2557
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:13,810
They were like they're trying to hurt our feelings.

2558
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:14,550
They're going.

2559
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:18,450
They'll say like and it makes us think about what's going to happen tomorrow.

2560
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:20,630
And then they tell us nothing about Tomorrowland.

2561
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:23,550
And then like we just took sakes a little bit of imagination.

2562
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:24,270
Right.

2563
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:25,090
Never go nuts.

2564
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:25,630
Yes.

2565
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:27,790
Well, we got a new character suit.

2566
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:30,090
There's a new suit we bought for figment.

2567
02:03:30,230 --> 02:03:32,330
And you're like, no, we wanted to ride.

2568
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:32,770
Right.

2569
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:33,550
Yeah.

2570
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:38,970
They know that's that's the twisted thing about all of this is they know exactly what that crowd wants.

2571
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:42,930
And then they will they will give them the just the littlest crumb.

2572
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:48,830
And the people there are excited and they want to be excited because it's fun to be in a big room like that with talking about something like.

2573
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:50,790
But then it's out about the crumb.

2574
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:52,830
Everybody lines up for six hours for a few.

2575
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:59,750
I've been in these rooms and you get worked up in a lather by these charismatic, handsome people that do these presentations.

2576
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:07,150
And yes, you want to cheer for things that people say on stage, even if after the fact you come out of a haze and you're like, wait a minute, that wasn't.

2577
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:08,550
What was that?

2578
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:09,450
Oh, we got a suit.

2579
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:10,890
There's a new suit for figment.

2580
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:11,950
That wasn't a ride.

2581
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:13,790
So like you want to be there.

2582
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:15,110
They're having fun in the moment.

2583
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:19,450
But yes, it's if you're watching on a live stream, you go, fuck.

2584
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:20,570
This sucks.

2585
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:21,110
Come on.

2586
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:21,970
You weren't there.

2587
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:22,530
Yeah.

2588
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:22,890
Yeah.

2589
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:24,290
I don't.

2590
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:26,730
Derek, do you are you then cynical about the idea?

2591
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:32,470
Do you think this is just going to will they just operate this cruddy version of the ride or will they close it?

2592
02:04:32,770 --> 02:04:37,530
Or do you hold on to any hope of the possibility that they they fix what's wrong?

2593
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:38,630
I always have hope.

2594
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:43,910
And I think it's always who is running the company at the time.

2595
02:04:43,930 --> 02:04:51,610
And all I can say is that we should pray for the next one in line grew up when we did.

2596
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,030
Oh, interesting.

2597
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:55,970
Like, I really think that would be the way it's going to happen.

2598
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:59,330
Unfortunately, it's like someone else has this.

2599
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:00,730
A lot of people have the same nostalgia.

2600
02:05:01,690 --> 02:05:02,250
We do.

2601
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:06,550
Just hopefully the next one in line is like, yeah.

2602
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:17,210
This is why it's important for things to age down and for not for all of our leaders and cultural leaders and big figures to all be 70 years old and older.

2603
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:17,790
Yeah.

2604
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:23,830
So that we just get somebody of a couple generations down who knows it's important to bring back Figmen.

2605
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:26,550
No, it's always got to be very old politicians.

2606
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:27,910
Bob Iger's got to come back.

2607
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:30,490
Disney, John Stewart's got to come back to the Daily Show.

2608
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:32,150
Everything old is new again.

2609
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:33,790
Old is the new.

2610
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:35,830
What about Jason being the CEO of Disney?

2611
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:38,010
Oh, Jason for CEO.

2612
02:05:38,230 --> 02:05:39,930
Start peeling out the floorboards.

2613
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:43,930
Oh, you want to make some money?

2614
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:46,450
Well, let's sell some of this copper wire in the walls.

2615
02:05:46,490 --> 02:05:47,770
We don't need all this.

2616
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:53,110
How many activist investors would be coming at you in the first six months of your tenure?

2617
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:56,870
Nelson Peltz.

2618
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:58,990
I wondered when you'd show up.

2619
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:01,450
You're dressed as the dream finder in the boardroom meeting.

2620
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:02,750
That's my CEO.

2621
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,530
Oh, hello there.

2622
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:06,730
Would you like a generic seltzer?

2623
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:09,670
We've gotten off name brands here.

2624
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:11,510
We're buying both at Costco.

2625
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:12,950
We put the money back into the park.

2626
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:15,150
Jason is the cheapest CEO Disney ever had.

2627
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,790
He's like, we have to save a dollar.

2628
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:19,750
Don't you understand?

2629
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:22,910
Do you want imagination back or do you not?

2630
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:25,310
You're on the stage.

2631
02:06:25,310 --> 02:06:27,670
I've got to do a shift in the park.

2632
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:30,190
I'm helping out.

2633
02:06:30,190 --> 02:06:33,350
I'm being Dreamfinder and the Figmen puppet.

2634
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:37,990
There's just humans on the ride acting now.

2635
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:39,010
No robots.

2636
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:41,250
It's cheaper, you see.

2637
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,130
And I'm flying southwest.

2638
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,990
I walk the walk and talk the talk.

2639
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:52,350
Until the boys build me a dream machine to fly where I need to be, I'll go in a plane.

2640
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:56,590
Look, hey, don't lose hope in imagination, Scott.

2641
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,630
Dreamfinder and Figmen want you to hold on to it.

2642
02:06:59,630 --> 02:07:00,730
You're right.

2643
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:08,810
And that's probably the easiest for Derek to remember because you get to see our pal every day if you want to.

2644
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:11,650
And have you been inspired by him?

2645
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:17,310
Do you look in those yellow eyes and feel like you're in a Contra Dreams?

2646
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,250
Oh, yeah.

2647
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:21,390
And I'm also defending the question.

2648
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:22,630
So what the fuck is that?

2649
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:27,550
Well, amen.

2650
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:30,630
That's our whole lives as theme park fans, isn't it?

2651
02:07:31,070 --> 02:07:31,590
Oh, yeah.

2652
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:31,990
Yeah.

2653
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:35,290
It's that thing that like, yeah, he inspires me.

2654
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:44,630
I'm, you know, also was thinking like when we're talking about Figmen, I get in my head a lot of going like, all right, so we saw that at a specific age.

2655
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:51,250
There is something at Epcot right now that is hitting that same age for someone, you know?

2656
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:59,870
And so that's what I really hope for is that if it's not Figmen, there's something there that's hitting childhood imagination to like that.

2657
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:07,690
That is so educational and crucial to people like us that you're you you kind of know about it.

2658
02:08:07,690 --> 02:08:11,890
But I don't I don't feel like it's embraced of like, what?

2659
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:12,790
What did you just say?

2660
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:18,970
Like the worst thing you can ever hear as an adult or a child is like, where do you come up with this stuff?

2661
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:20,590
Fuck you.

2662
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:41,330
My imagination and creativity is sometimes looked down upon, you know, and I think that's for any enjoyment in like a conservative world of like, hey, look at these things that can happen if you use your brain and not just like, you know, or I should say using your heart over your brain.

2663
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:53,190
I just I just think there's so much to figment and more than we know why we like it that it allowed us to feel like, oh, to be creative and to yeah, to be accepted.

2664
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:54,630
I think there's a lot.

2665
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:57,570
Yeah, like I think maybe Tim Burton was talking about kids.

2666
02:08:57,770 --> 02:09:07,190
I've said this before on the show where kids like second graders or first graders will say something like, I'm not good at drawing, which in hindsight, I remember the kids would always say that in school.

2667
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:07,870
I'm not good at drawing.

2668
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:08,950
You're like, wait a minute.

2669
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,230
Those are first graders.

2670
02:09:10,230 --> 02:09:11,850
Of course, you're not good at drawing.

2671
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:12,810
Like, yeah, yeah.

2672
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:17,290
You're like, like, there's already a roadblock for certain kids as far as arts are concerned.

2673
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:17,710
Yeah.

2674
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:26,750
And it is probably pretty important to have things because if they're not getting a support from family or whatever, it's good to have some things in the world like that where you're like, you just be creative.

2675
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:28,670
There's no you don't have to be self-conscious about it.

2676
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:32,490
But I remember that all the time because like I like to draw and I was okay at it.

2677
02:09:32,490 --> 02:09:34,210
And then kids would be like, oh, you're good at drawing.

2678
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:34,690
I'm not.

2679
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:36,490
And I remember being like, yes, that's correct.

2680
02:09:36,590 --> 02:09:37,950
I am good and you're not.

2681
02:09:37,950 --> 02:09:39,830
But like not in a weird way.

2682
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:42,310
I just remember like, well, obviously, like I'm the one who's good at drawing.

2683
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:44,090
But we're in second or third grade.

2684
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:44,690
Yeah.

2685
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:47,570
And I wasn't that good at drawing.

2686
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:50,570
But in hindsight, you're like, oh, that is bizarre.

2687
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:53,810
That is a really weird roadblock that kids have in their mind.

2688
02:09:53,810 --> 02:09:56,710
I'm sure it's about any creative thing, music or whatever.

2689
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:57,530
Wow.

2690
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:58,610
So we got to tap into this.

2691
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:02,990
I mean, it makes me now I'm like, how can I reflect this into into my kid?

2692
02:10:03,110 --> 02:10:03,510
Sure.

2693
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:05,870
I watched it like let him just because they're boy.

2694
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:06,950
Yeah, you see it every day.

2695
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:12,490
There's this there's this imaginative spirit that is so strong that doesn't have confines.

2696
02:10:12,530 --> 02:10:12,830
Yeah.

2697
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:13,310
It yet.

2698
02:10:13,850 --> 02:10:14,790
And that's good.

2699
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:17,130
I'm not going to use that mean voice like you use, Derek.

2700
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:19,970
Say, what do you want to come up with that?

2701
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:21,030
That's what we want to be.

2702
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:21,370
Voice.

2703
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:22,710
You say you your character.

2704
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:26,410
Yeah, you portrayed a person who was like judgmental of creativity.

2705
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:27,970
Oh, no, no, no.

2706
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:28,170
Yeah.

2707
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:32,430
I also think taking your son on the ride would be good for both of you

2708
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:34,750
because that's what he's going to remember.

2709
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:35,790
Sure.

2710
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:44,350
And it will change your feeling on not liking it because he's going to see something that you didn't, you know, and be like, oh, wow.

2711
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:45,770
I like my figment to that.

2712
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:47,330
You know, yeah, it's true.

2713
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:51,450
Well, you got to get if you can't have the perfect figment, you got to go with the figment you have.

2714
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:52,550
Completely agree.

2715
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:56,050
And then when he's 16, 17, you sit him down, you have the talking.

2716
02:10:56,170 --> 02:11:00,170
So, you know, that ride you like the ride is not as good as it used to be.

2717
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:03,230
I know you like it.

2718
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,210
I'm not a father.

2719
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:11,890
I have to show you this pruder film of the old ride and you'll never get to experience this.

2720
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:12,670
Oh, geez.

2721
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,110
That's the talk.

2722
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:16,590
We'll gear up for it.

2723
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:17,510
That's the big talk.

2724
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:24,770
It is so nice to just deal with the good times and everything you everything broader you tied it into.

2725
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:25,470

We should do like if we need to like set up the photo booth or something.

2730

That creative imagination has been wandering.

2747
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:09,410
And a couple of sparks got a goddamn bonfire going on over here.

2748
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:12,190
Hey, well, actually not the fire.

2749
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,730
Just a bunch of sparks.

2750
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:15,770
But that's what we know.

2751
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:16,210
What now?

2752
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:17,070
What that turns into?

2753
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:18,070
That's the light.

2754
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:18,530
Yeah.

2755

Oh, boy.
