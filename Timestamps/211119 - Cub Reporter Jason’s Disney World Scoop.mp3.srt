1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Warning, the following podcast contains important updates fresh from Orlando, Florida.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,880
You'll hear breaking news about slightly inconvenient marathon routes, new kinds of dessert moose,

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,600
the functionality of apps, and the relaxing lure of the bench outside of the hall of presidents.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,880
It's Disney World Scoop with Cub Reporter Jason on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,680
For an episode that will make you say, Jason had more treats than I would have, but less

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,120
than I expected him to.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Yes, I'm here.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm going to take a quick guess and don't tell me if I'm right because I want to be surprised

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
during the story because I don't know anything about this.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm going to guess you had an average of 1.5 treats a day.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
I think that's about accurate.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Oh, is it?

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
All right, great.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
But not evenly distributed.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Like some days, like maybe one.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
One day it was six.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah, something like that.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,400
And one day you had like four salads that were healthy to offset it.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
That doesn't sound right.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
In Disney World?

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I don't think so.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm just kidding.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
It was for a comedy, Scott.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Scott Garner.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
That's that's his voice.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
OK, interesting.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,080
So, yeah, some days retreat plentiful and some you just didn't have time.

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
You're rushing around.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,360
There's so much to do.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
You had no you had no idea.

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm still very sore.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,360
So are you in theme park shape yet now or not?

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Yeah, I am.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
He is.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
He made it.

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,280
By the grace of God and the fact that I walked, I clocked it 60.1 miles in one week.

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,760
I will say this.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,520
We don't know anything about your trip, really.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,200
I will say I clocked like a mood from you as you came in that you might be like still

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,680
tired from the trip, maybe irritated from the trip.

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Am I correct?

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,320
Yes, but not from any of my traveling companions.

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,120
OK, that's but the trip itself was stressful to you in some ways.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
The trip was wonderful.

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
This was folks.

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm freshly back from Disney World.

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,800
As of Sunday, I was down there with family with my dad, my brother and Jane.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
And we had a very nice time.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,680
It is a little nuts down there right now.

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
It's a little wild.

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Gotcha.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,600
OK, so there was aspects that were stressful.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,840
Yeah, totally out of our control, out of the front line cast members control as well.

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
They were all wonderful as always.

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
OK, the front line.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,440
Front line cast members, we thank you for your service.

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,800
It's like a war zone at some point.

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,880
Gosh.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,600
Oh, my God.

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Did everybody come back with all their limbs?

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm getting concerned now.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
Well, oh, no.

70
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Yeah, everyone did.

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,400
But I well, where to start?

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,440
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
I was down there for a week.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,360
I was down there Sunday or just on Sunday to Saturday.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,320
And a lot of stuff was going on down there.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,720
There was a marathon the day we got there, which played a role that we did not,

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,760
a number of roles we did not foresee.

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Did you accidentally find yourself in the marathon running it?

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
We accidentally found ourselves.

80
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Jane and I got in on a red eye at five in the morning Orlando time.

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
I thought it was interesting that you did the red.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,480
I remember you saying you were going to do that.

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
And like, I don't know, that doesn't that seems like something that would make

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,600
Jason Osegan irritable.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,560
No, I actually you think that, but I actually sleep better

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,280
on the red eyes than sleeping like the six a.m.

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,080
to two a.m. or two p.m. on the East Coast.

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
OK, OK. So you did sleep.

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
Do you sleep on the plane?

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,040
I slept a little and then I was up for like 15 hours on two, three hours sleep.

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,240
And that was too ambitious.

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,680
Yeah. But we yeah, we were staying at the beach club and we got down there and

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,920
found out that, you know, the beach club, you can walk to the boardwalk on the one

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,680
side and then you can actually walk to the boardwalk on the other side of the

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,600
building, too. And both sides were coned off because there is a run dizzy marathon

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,880
going on. OK, so so yeah, to illustrate this, to re-illustrate this,

97
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,520
you're you're talking about the place where the Abra Kedab bar is in the former

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,280
Ample Hills. That's the boardwalk.

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,920
That's the boardwalk right by Epcot Center.

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,360
It's on the lake, which I'm blanking on the name Crescent Lake.

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Thank you very much.

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,640
It's named something very boring and not Disney Crescent Lake.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,920
Let's all learn it. It's by the Swann Adolphin, a little bit in the distance.

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,280
And normally you can easily get everywhere from a big loop of all the Epcot area

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
hotels and how you can walk to Hollywood Studios, too.

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,520
It's a little bit of a trek, but you can walk to it.

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Right. So you're saying there were cones and runners preventing you from getting

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,080
to from what? Give me a point A to point B that was blocked off.

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,520
From like from the the pathway to the international gateway of Epcot.

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,320
OK, there's a little hill after the like as you leave the Beach Club,

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,680
you walk up a little hill that is coned off.

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,640
OK, so you can't get to International Gateway or just not get to the international.

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
So you can't enter Epcot Center.

114
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
But that turned out not to be a problem because Epcot didn't open until 10

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
or 11 anyway because of the marathon.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,360
Oh, OK. And he had that.

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
You didn't check times when Epcot Center opened?

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,560
I checked times, but I like early early on, like I made park

119
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,520
reservations back in the summer.

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,680
And that was the other big thing.

121
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,520
That was a big point of contention in my family.

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,360
Like this park reservation system sucks ass because it's so like you can park

123
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,120
copy after 2 p.m.

124
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,800
But if you run into a thing where like, oh, this park is super crowded.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,440
I think my dad said, oh, normally we would leave and go somewhere else.

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
But it's like, oh, we don't have the flexibility anymore.

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Yeah, we don't have the flexibility.

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,040
So OK, so that first day, this is what you're describing the first day.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,640
You had the expectation we're going to get up pretty early and go to Epcot Center.

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Or we were going to go to Disney Springs.

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
Also didn't open until 10 or 11.

132
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,720
Right. So did so what happened was, did you what time did you get up

133
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
and what time were you?

134
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,920
You literally discovered that Epcot was not open by trying to walk to Epcot.

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,680
By trying to walk.

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,160
Well, no, we were just trying to walk to the board.

137
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,400
We were just trying to kill time because it's like 6 a.m. at this point.

138
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,640
You're just wandering around.

139
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
We're just wandering around.

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
Or very early in the morning. Very early.

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
What's there to do? Nothing's open then.

142
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,360
No, I mean, we had gotten coffee at the airport like we had coffee.

143
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
We had some breakfast.

144
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,600
And so we just thought we'd, you know, wander around.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,240
And that was my mistake.

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,160
As we said, you know, on the Toy Story episode,

147
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
don't don't ruin your arm trying to play the practice games.

148
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,040
My knees started to hurt before we stepped into any part.

149
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,960
And been in a park.

150
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,440
Jason, the first two and a half days, my knees were just awful.

151
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,600
Both knees. Yeah, both knees.

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,840
What happened to the other one?

153
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,360
Because it started it started to take all the weight.

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,680
It started to do all the heavy lifting.

155
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
What about your lower back?

156
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
My lower back was actually fine all week.

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
And that was the other thing.

158
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,240
The third day I woke up in my right knee felt the most normal it has in 2021.

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,800
We're going to need to start doing like, you know, the news will do.

160
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,360
It used to be what what terror level alerts are we at?

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
And then it was it was covid and how much we're going to have to start.

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,680
Like on the Twitter, we need like a map of your body and where are the red zones?

163
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Or it's just orange today.

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Well, that's the thing after this week.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,480
I feel terrific.

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,120
Now we're green. It's all green.

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Great. Yeah. All right.

168
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,880
So listen right now, it's full green.

169
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,560
But last I don't want to alarm you, but last week, major areas of red.

170
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,840
Yeah. So, I mean, I still like did pretty long days at the parks.

171
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,200
I was just taking a lot of breaks and like pounding Tylenol.

172
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
And how many Tylenol?

173
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,880
How many Tylenol a day were you pounding?

174
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,000
Two to four. But it's like the eight hour.

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
It's like taking a handful of Tylenol.

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,920
It's for like arthritis and back pain.

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,920
Oh, gosh.

178
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,120
So wait, so you would have two to four, but they're extra strength.

179
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah. OK.

180
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,120
Are they big? Are they comically big pills or anything?

181
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
They're a little big.

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,680
Like a horse, a salt lick or something.

183
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,720
You're only supposed to take them like every eight hours.

184
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,520
So like, yeah, I think the max I would take them was like twice in a day.

185
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,760
And you're like an old like an old cop in a movie or at least like popping pills

186
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
to get through a shift.

187
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,800
I am. Conversely, my father, 68 in the best shape of his life.

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,000
You said that before. I thought about that.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I kept thinking about that after you said it the first time and how it's

190
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,920
you said like he walks 10,000 steps a day.

191
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,760
And I was like, I mean, the average that they recommend for any human being.

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Yeah, I that's should be a pretty low bar.

193
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160
I feel I'm happy he's in very good shape.

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
Not bad. Well, I don't know that.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah, but I don't know that like a lot of people do that.

196
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
I don't know that. I think a lot.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
I think a ton of people do 10,000.

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,280
That's like a very famous thing that like most people do.

199
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,200
I don't know that everybody gets that every day.

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
No, no, no. But it's a thing to aim for and it's by and I mean, it's not so insane.

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Do right.

202
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,840
It's it's yeah, it's not.

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,480
I mean, if I look at mine, I probably only hit it once or a couple of times a week.

204
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah, I feel maybe I'm just saying because I said this because during

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
covid height, it was like what else in the world is there to do?

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,240
I feel like by getting those step counts is like this is the only activity

207
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,920
available to any human being.

208
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,520
You're just revealing to us that you do 10,000 steps every day.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,880
Well, I was walking the you know, I'm walking the baby.

210
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,720
I mean, running around with him and taking him on to there's an update for the listeners.

211
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,320
My son is into turbines,

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
he which are the spinny things on the top of your house.

213
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
They look kind of like a chef's hat.

214
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
I think he likes it because it's on the top of Cookie Monster's food truck.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
So I'll take him around and show him all the turbines that there are to see.

216
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,280
And this is, you know, I hate to compare.

217
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,840
I think he likes the turbine tours more than you could even like Disney World.

218
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I think it's about the same.

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
Everyone is an E.

220
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
It's beyond an E ticket.

221
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,920
It's a what's a K ticket.

222
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
It's a P ticket.

223
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
That's great.

224
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,440
You told me he was in a turbines like two weeks ago and I was like,

225
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
oh, he's going to grow out of that fast.

226
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
I bet. But no, he's still he's still in.

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,240
It's a little on it's a little on the decline.

228
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,520
Now he's there's a new phase, which is I bought a bag of pebbles.

229
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
You might have passed on your way in.

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,200
It's in the yard. Oh, I didn't notice.

231
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
He picks up pebbles, moves them from one spot to another.

232
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Now, watch out turbines.

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
Pebbles are hot on your tail.

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Anyway, when I was little, I took a bunch of pebbles and threw them in my mouth

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
and tried to eat them.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
Be careful. Whoa.

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,600
That's the story my mom tells where I'm like, I take my little child hand

238
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,800
and just shove it in my mouth.

239
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,080
Wow. Yep.

240
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,280
Is she at all worried with the new Ghostbusters film coming out

241
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,720
that you might get some new ideas about where to put some Ghostbusters

242
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
and what kind of sheets to give?

243
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
Oh, that's a good question.

244
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,160
Is she worried all over again?

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,840
Is she worried that I've bought the new Hasbro Plasma series

246
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,240
Ghostbusters figures and I have Trevor and podcast

247
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,760
the characters from the new movie Ghostbusters Afterlife and that I've used

248
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
napkins or paper towels to make them a little bit.

249
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,720
She hasn't mentioned it.

250
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,640
But look, there's been advances.

251
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,480
There's better thread counts and there's more, you know, crimping

252
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,040
in paper towels here and there than then when you were a child.

253
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,880
But basically the same materials, you could burn up Trevor

254
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,360
just as easily as you could burn up P gone.

255
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Good point. You know, you're bringing up a lot of

256
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,320
Trevor's essentially the same as Spengler, right?

257
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,120
I can tell you I'm going to I'm going to get I'm going to get, you know,

258
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,880
in so much trouble, but I will.

259
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,200
But I'm going to do is I'm going to get like really cheap toilet paper and do it

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,440
like the flimsiest, most flammable toilet paper and rap podcast

261
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,640
the character from afterlife in that toilet paper and then pretend

262
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
he's sleeping a little bed.

263
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,880
And that's my rebellion.

264
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,360
I feel bad. I feel a little bad for podcasts, not getting the

265
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,560
the level of thread count that your friends from the 80s got.

266
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah, the cartoon podcast.

267
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah. Sorry, podcast.

268
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,000
You're part of my mid to late 30s rebellion.

269
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,280
Whatever you want to call.

270
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,320
Flimsier, possibly more flammable.

271
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,320
Yeah, possibly.

272
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,680
If there are still many steps removed to actually being a flammable problem.

273
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
Good point.

274
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,800
She hasn't brought it up, though.

275
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,280
We'll see. Be careful.

276
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's all be careful.

277
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,880
Anyway, that was that came off of walking.

278
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,400
I carry my kid around to see turbines walking your dad.

279
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,240
Where were we?

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
You're so he walks a lot.

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Yeah. Your knees are in.

282
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,040
Are shot already. It's day one.

283
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,760
It's six a.m. You're wandering.

284
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,400
You can't even get to the front of Epcot and your knees are shot.

285
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,560
Yeah. So I as the week went on, I learned like, oh, it's not

286
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,760
it wasn't the like quantity of walk.

287
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,800
It was the uninterrupted walk.

288
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
I could walk a lot all day long.

289
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
I just had to take some breaks.

290
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,760
I just had to like stretch when we were in line.

291
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,560
I had to sit down and that sort of thing.

292
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
And that was helpful to learn.

293
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm seeing a new physical therapist who's a lot more on the ball.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
OK, encouraging me to track these sorts of things.

295
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,880
Was he saying did he give you any tips before?

296
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,800
Like, you know, do missions, stretch while you're on mission space?

297
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,280
Because like you're going to go.

298
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
I told him I was going down and he's like, is that Disneyland?

299
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm like, I don't really want to get.

300
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,480
I feel like I feel like Mr. Physical Therapist.

301
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
This is work for me. This is work.

302
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
Don't make me do it.

303
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Vacation, you know.

304
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah, no, I did.

305
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,320
He gave me a lacrosse ball and a resistance band

306
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,640
because he's doing a lot of foam roller kind of stuff.

307
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,440
Lacrosse ball kind of serves the same purpose, but easier to pack in a suitcase.

308
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
I got to go to a physical therapist for my Achilles tendons.

309
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
So I mean, I'll give you the info.

310
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
OK, let's see if it covers my insurance covers it.

311
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
You all shouldn't make fun of me for walking.

312
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,080
Look at me here.

313
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,400
Hey, I've been playing highly competitive tennis all summer.

314
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,480
You know, I'm trying to stay fit.

315
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
I think you mentioned that.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
Yeah, maybe I did.

317
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,720
I think and I think I do how you blow out your Achilles tendon.

318
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Andre Gregory and I were playing tennis.

319
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,800
Up at his cottage.

320
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,720
Perez walked up to compliment you and Andre on your tennis.

321
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,400
That's correct.

322
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,120
You said, sir, you'd be interested maybe in hearing about a certain plane.

323
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
A certain plane.

324
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,440
And he said, that's a wonderful.

325
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,800
Andre said, it's a wonderful plane.

326
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,240
Anyway, the debut of the Andre Gregory.

327
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
It's wonderful.

328
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
There's arm gestures with it.

329
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
The little gesture is more.

330
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
Let me just tell you, it's more about it.

331
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,000
Perfectly Andre Gregory.

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Yes, I guess.

333
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,360
I've never seen this man.

334
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Yes.

335
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,680
OK, anyway.

336
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,720
So, yeah. So, yeah, my knees like loosened up as the week went on.

337
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,760
And and then just kind of fell into the like normal, like

338
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,800
we get theme parks kind of fatigue.

339
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,520
Yeah. So you so that was good.

340
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,840
So that turned out to be the normal fatigue.

341
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah. So there is still an error that you like.

342
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,880
Mike's initial question was, are you coming in?

343
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,360
You're coming in a little irritated.

344
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,680
And a lot of the things you've said have confirmed Mike's suspicion.

345
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah. I mean, I came from I had physical therapy a few hours ago

346
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,960
and I feel like I got my ass kicked.

347
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,480
So that might be causing the irritation.

348
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,840
Was it because you had to explain Disneyland versus Disney World to the therapist?

349
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,800
No, that's all right.

350
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,320
No, he gets it at this point.

351
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,480
It's the tall castle.

352
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,240
I don't know. I don't want to do this.

353
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,280
And you, it was gray.

354
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,680
They're both pink now.

355
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,240
Don't get me started.

356
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,440
It's the 50th, 50th goal.

357
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,840
That's why there's the gold Dumbo in front of Dumbo.

358
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
That's why there's all these weird golden idols everywhere.

359
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,760
The 50th was going on.

361
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,840
I don't I don't know what they decide some limited food items.

362
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,880
And the, you know, the space

363
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,360
where Earthlights looked terrific in person.

364
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,840
The Tower of Terror, like lit up in like its glory as it was.

365
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,600
You know, the hotel looked great.

366
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,480
The castle looked fine.

367
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,440
I knew Hots Tower, Knots, Gassel.

368
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Is Tower of Terror a new lighting package?

369
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,280
It's got the because they're like they're projecting.

370
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
They're projecting.

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,440
Oh, is that the icon?

372
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
All the weenies get a projection.

373
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,480
Got it.

374
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,920
The gold, it's the golden icon celebration.

375
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,560
Right. I don't know.

376
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
There was a real there was an official name for it

377
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,280
that we said on the show like six weeks ago, and none of us remember it.

378
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,720
That left real quick.

379
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

380
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,400
OK, well, I guess I like that.

381
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
So that's a castle like shit and the other ones look good.

382
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't see the tree of light.

383
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes. Yeah.

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
I don't know. It was fine.

385
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,040
I saw like a little bit of that new like the fireworks show at Magic Kingdom

386
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,520
that everyone was complaining when that premiered. Right.

387
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Right. Why? Huh?

388
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,840
What happened? Why was I?

389
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,040
I just think like people really liked the previous one.

390
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,880
And this one just happily ever after was the previous one or no.

391
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,520
Well, Wishes was like two or three.

392
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,960
Wishes is a forever.

393
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,160
It was forever ago. Yeah.

394
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Happily ever after.

395
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
Believe, believe you're in chance.

396
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,360
It was believe you're in chance.

397
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,680
The celebration of your beliefs.

398
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,000
That that show was fine.

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,480
But my I'm going to this is the first of a few hot takes.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
Let's hear it. I liked Harmonious.

401
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,520
Oh, the Epcot show.

402
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
Right. The new Epcot.

403
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
And that's the one that people were really cranky about.

404
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
And people seemed cranky about it.

405
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,240
Jane legitimately moved by it both times.

406
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
We saw it because there's three hunchback songs in it.

407
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,120
Is that hunchback heavy?

408
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,760
Is that hunchback heavy?

409
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,160
And they're like very nice arrangements.

410
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,040
And it's it's still pretty like abstract and ethereal.

411
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
Like there's there's a bunch of stuff.

412
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,560
There's there's a Latin that some countries kind of like one to one.

413
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,960
Like hunchback is France.

414
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,000
Coco is Mexico.

415
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Then it starts to break down and it's like, well, there's Lion King in here.

416
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,040
And there is it's still the Africa refreshments next day.

417
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,240
Or like, oh, Aladdin.

418
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
Here's a song from Aladdin.

419
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,480
For Canada. Yeah, I.

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,440
Do they play the John Resnick song from Treasure Planet?

421
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm sorry, Michael.

422
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,480
We didn't. Or the Jennifer Love Hewitt song from Hunchback 2.

423
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,520
Did they do that either? No.

424
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,680
No. Can I ask you that I

425
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,600
sorry, listeners, the sorry, certain type of listener.

426
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
What's the show? I don't know what.

427
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
I know that there's big barges that people don't like in World Showcase.

428
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,760
And it's like illuminations where they light up all the World Showcase

429
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,960
provisions. But beyond that, what's different about it?

430
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
I mean, it's still kind of got like

431
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,880
a message of we're all one people sort of thing.

432
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,640
It's like, like, what is but what physically is it?

433
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Is that like the the barges and the like squid

434
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,680
arms that move?

435
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,880
Yeah. These big arms that come out of the water and they they shoot water

436
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
fountains and they shoot fireworks.

437
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,680
One of them like rapid fire shoots fireworks.

438
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,480
This what I really liked about it.

439
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
I thought the music was pretty good.

440
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,520
There's so much pyro like they shoot pyro over you.

441
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,960
Like you were surrounded by fireworks and so much go off throughout the show.

442
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,880
I was like, oh, this is awesome.

443
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Like, OK. Yeah, I just thought an improvement in on whatever was

444
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,360
was it still a limit?

445
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,480
Is that got forever?

446
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,320
Ever was after illuminations.

447
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,440
Yeah. I've got forever.

448
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,640
We saw when we were down there a couple of years ago.

449
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah, it kind of sucked.

450
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah. The one time I saw it, I think I was standing with you.

451
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,480
We were it was so smoky.

452
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Like we were by one of the like explosion.

453
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,680
Well, we were we were passing a joint back and forth.

454
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,640
Oh, yeah. We're. Yep.

455
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,120
I could have called that.

456
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,840
I know how you guys roll all that talk of what kind of pill was Jason popping.

457
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
Fucking time.

458
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Oh, man. Where do I get that?

459
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
Is that like this?

460
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,840
Like, do I need a dealer for that?

461
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,200
Take a leave when you go to bed and when you wake up,

462
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,240
takes them from your Nana's house.

463
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Oh, geez. You guys, I've been living.

464
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
I've been you know what I've been doing.

465
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,920
I've been taking extra strength melatonin and biting it in the middle.

466
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,640
So I only get half. Oh, wow.

467
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,160
Yeah, that's how Scottie's been rolling these days.

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,320
I've been doing a little of that, too. I'll be honest.

469
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,640
I've been that's it's own podcast.

470
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
The pill boy pill boy.

471
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,040
Gummy boy.

472
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,920
Gummy boy.

473
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,520
Gummy boy.

474
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,840
It's the chalky.

475
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
It's not the fun kind.

476
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,880
Just the, you know, chalky tasteless.

477
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,600
I have a theory why you liked the Upkot show with all the pyro

478
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,520
because you felt cozy and warm because of all the heat.

479
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,600
Well, I guess it was a little heat.

480
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,680
I just they I thought there was just some very unique like fire.

481
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,760
Like I'm I don't I feel like I don't have a palette for like I like fireworks.

482
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,720
But I don't do people are like shows good.

483
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
This shows bad.

484
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,160
Like, yeah, I don't I don't know.

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,440
I don't know art, but I know what I like.

486
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,080
And I like this one.

487
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,880
I always like the illuminations. Yeah.

488
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
But yeah, no, I thought this one was good.

489
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
The barges, too.

490
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,200
They put the 50th logo on them, like on screens during the day.

491
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,280
So they looked a lot less like imposing like 2001

492
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,200
monoliths in the middle of the lake.

493
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,520
Not scary industrial equipment.

494
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,320
As I said, when I went down there, there were people on my trip

495
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,840
who pointed at those and said, what ride is that?

496
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,680
That is not a ride.

497
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,680
That is a not functioning yet light show.

498
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,040
Yeah.

499
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,520
These squid arms sound cool.

500
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,800
I know I like the squid.

501
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,680
Yeah, they were shooting water around.

502
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,680
They were shooting fireworks like, yeah, I thought it was cool.

503
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Yeah. Well, you're one of the first people in theme park media

504
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,440
that has given us a good review, I feel like.

505
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah, I guess I just enjoyed it.

506
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
I mean, I was with someone who was like tearing up,

507
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
like when the Hunchback Q started. Right.

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,840
Take it back.

509
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
But she was very sincerely into it.

510
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
I was like, well, great. It's working.

511
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,800
It worked for someone.

512
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,080
It worked for one person, at least.

513
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,600
And it gets through to just one guest.

514
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,920
It got through to one guest and I enjoyed it too.

515
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,200
So you got to.

516
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,480
Well, call me when I'm not here or I'm still here.

517
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
John Resnick song is playing in Epcot.

518
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,400
I'll be I'll be moved as well.

519
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,120
Well, that's good.

520
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,440
I mean, so so that was a nice surprise.

521
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,520
It sounds like. Yeah, it was a nice surprise.

522
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
Less nice surprise.

523
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,040
The crowds are back.

524
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,920
The holiday crowds are here.

525
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

526
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,280
And I think when we we initially had this booked for

527
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,040
same week in November 2020,

528
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,280
and we pretty quickly canceled it in like April of 2020 or May of 2020.

529
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,760
And early November, we had gone down

530
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,800
like when I was elementary school and it was very different

531
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,760
Disney World at the time, and it was pretty deserted.

532
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,200
But early November, often still a slow season.

533
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,600
Usually, usually, I think we would have hit less crowds

534
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,480
if it had been the week before.

535
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,280
But who's to say it seemed like all the crowd predictions were like

536
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,840
this time of year, it's not going to be too crowded.

537
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
And then as it got closer, every blog I was reading was like,

538
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,000
maybe a little crowded this week.

539
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,200
And and anyone we talked to a few people who live down there.

540
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
And they're like, yeah, there's a lot of people here this week.

541
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,240
Right. Like that was the conversation

542
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,240
we kept having the marathon crowds

543
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,480
that first night at Epcot.

544
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,680
It was so crowded and the crowd was getting sloppy and sloppy drunk.

545
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,960
I seemingly just rowdy and wow.

546
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
These marathon scumbags.

547
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,800
So wait, the people the people watching the marathoners

548
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
know doing the marathon because we're drunk.

549
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,880
Well, because between 10 p.m.

550
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,960
and midnight, they get Epcot to themselves.

551
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,520
That night.

552
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,320
So like around nine p.m., like people are already like

553
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,280
they had going all day.

554
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,480
So they had a lot. It's going right to their head.

555
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,760
So they're they're they're all having major ego trips.

556
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,200
So they know they're getting hammered all day.

557
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,480
They ran and ended at like 11 a.m.

558
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,760
OK, so they've been drinking around the world all day

559
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,080
and they have free rein and Epcot to do with whatever they want.

560
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,920
They're allowed to do whatever it's like a purge and Epcot for them.

561
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,360
I guess those two hours. Yeah.

562
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,480
They can have sex on its face.

563
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,560
You've heard they can do whatever they want.

564
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,120
I'm in it on and on top. Sure.

565
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
They're very athletic.

566
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
They could run up the side.

567
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
They're so fast, like Sonic the Hedgehog running up a structure.

568
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Oh, yeah. God. Yeah.

569
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,600
So these zombies, you got to watch out for these guys.

570
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,520
Yeah. So swim across the lake and by the end of the neck.

571
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,120
Did you do they have the numbers on still so you could identify like,

572
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,960
oh, there's no no, I think they might have had wristbands or something.

573
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,600
But like, no, I don't think you could knock them out.

574
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,160
Wait a minute. But when were they?

575
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,320
OK, they have got to themselves.

576
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,520
But where are you? Where are they annoying you?

577
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,640
Because they're if you're not in Epcot, they're already like,

578
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
well, no, the marathon was going on in the morning

579
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
and then just threw out the day at Epcot.

580
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,400
It was so packed because they were just like stuck around

581
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,080
or came back for like the marathon, you know, exclusive party.

582
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,960
OK, so it was just packed.

583
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,560
And we went back to Epcot later in the week.

584
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,560
A second day and it was it was so crowded.

585
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,080
There was a line to get in the Mexico Pavilion, which I had never seen before.

586
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,920
That's what it was over the summer for sure.

587
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,160
What's that? Definitely that way over the summer.

588
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,320
Was it? Yeah, I think that's saying it's been that way.

589
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,400
With like wraparound. Yeah.

590
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,520
We had like a lunch reservation and we got to get inside.

591
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,440
And yeah, it was it was my brother had gone on ahead to check in.

592
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,480
And he's like, oh, I saw a cast member and they let me in the side

593
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
or like they they were like, oh, you can just cut through that door

594
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,760
if you have a reservation.

595
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh, OK. Yeah.

596
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That was that was the only time where,

597
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,080
you know, I didn't really feel like covid skittish.

598
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,120
But like that pavilion with those crowds was a little like this.

599
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,800
This ride, relaxing ride next to the rest

600
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,160
next to the restaurant we were eating in that restaurant.

601
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
This whole vibe is usually a little more chill

602
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
this like shoulder to shoulder.

603
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,320
Sure. Yeah. Well, and also, I think everybody still is like adjusting to

604
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,520
the certain things and level of crowds that, you know, a lot of us haven't done,

605
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
even though things have been reopened.

606
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,280
So, yeah, I'm sure it'll like it'll, you know, mess.

607
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah, I feel like I definitely had that when I was there

608
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
over the summer, just like, boy, I haven't been in a crowd like this

609
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,880
in a room like this and a lot of that.

610
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,960
Well, better get extremely drunk.

611
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,040
That'll that'll be my way of not thinking about this.

612
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,800
It was good exposure therapy.

613
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll say that, like just getting thrown into it.

614
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,880
And like it was very easy to fall back in Disney World routines.

615
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,080
People pretty good about the masking indoors.

616
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
Usually some walked in without a man.

617
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,880
They they, you know, people are telling, hey, please put that on.

618
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,720
And usually it was just someone being like, oh, God, I forgot. So sorry.

619
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,160
OK, you know, defiance, not defiance.

620
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,960
Other than these marathoners, other than the marathoners.

621
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Fucking I don't know.

622
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Deviant sickos.

623
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,520
I don't know who the rest of the sickos were the rest of the week. But like

624
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
wait, can I get a quick question?

625
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
I don't know. I'm sure you would tell us you did it.

626
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,800
But Scott, I believe in this pavilion you had black ant salt.

627
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
Is that right? I bought it outside.

628
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
That's the pathway and then there's the one closer to the lake.

629
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,880
Yeah. Yeah.

630
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,480
Salt with actual black ants ground up in it, which I talked about on the Patreon.

631
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Yes, I've been thinking about this because we just bought the dog

632
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
treats made out of crickets. Oh, OK.

633
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,640
So that makes sense.

634
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,840
It seems like the thing a dog would want to eat.

635
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,000
And then there's the nutrition. Yeah. Of it.

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,120
You haven't thought about lining a drink with it.

637
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,120
I haven't thought about it.

638
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,160
But I did. I did say to Lindsay when she was like, oh, yeah, they have like cricket food.

639
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,320
I mean, we all Scott eight ants. Yeah.

640
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,920
But without realize, I really thought it was a theme.

641
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,560
It's like interesting black ant.

642
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,960
And I guess the theme of this salt also is that it tastes terrible.

643
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,040
So is it so thick?

644
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,480
And like I pointed out, I ended up with like a unibrow of like I drank it

645
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,760
in such a way that like black ant salt connected my eyebrows.

646
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
Looked like Bert.

647
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
So you did not have any salt.

648
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,920
I did not have the answer.

649
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,040
No, honestly, I had forgotten about the answer until this very moment.

650
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,080
Well, do you want some of Edwin's trick cricket treats?

651
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,840
If it's human grade, I'd give it a shot.

652
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,840
I got to check the package.

653
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,040
I don't know if I've ever eaten cricket.

654
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,400
I think they've got like a lot of different like insect things in that Mexico pavilion.

655
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,560
I think you can get in that tequila bar.

656
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,160
If you pay like a bunch of money, you can get like crazy drinks

657
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,920
and like some different bugs.

658
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,320
Yeah. The whole spread things.

659
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
But a bug drink.

660
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,160
I think I could totally be wrong, but I'm pretty sure Mr.

661
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,400
Morrow did a YouTube on this.

662
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,320
I see. Paging Mr.

663
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,400
Morrow, and I think he got to like sample tequilas, and then they had different

664
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,520
like bugs as well.

665
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,440
They have them were any of them alive and then flew into his pocket.

666
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Not on this episode, which that would have been amazing

667
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
if one had turned out to be alive.

668
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,360
Didn't it happen again?

669
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,800
I heard it. Yes, it did happen again.

670
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,880
I forgot which episode.

671
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
We have a second Mr.

672
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Morrow bee pocket. Yes.

673
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,600
Incident. Did you see Mr.

674
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,640
Morrow? I didn't see.

675
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
We were all looking out for like Mr.

676
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,720
Morrow or or any of the many professional wrestlers who went into Orlando area.

677
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,600
Half of them do.

678
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I love the parks.

679
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,640
No, we saw I got recognized a couple of times.

680
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
Shane and Soren.

681
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,040
Very, very good.

682
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,600
Shane was working at Soren.

683
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,880
We did the Deluxe Hotel guests.

684
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
We got out, got 10 to midnight another day of the week.

685
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,760
And that was awesome because then the park was empty.

686
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,720
Yeah. Oh, good.

687
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
There were no dirty runners around.

688
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,720
No dirty runners.

689
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
No, just one.

690
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Who are they kidding?

691
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
Just one 36 year old man limping.

692
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,920
But you forget how big Epcot is.

693
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,600
Halfway around, I think we clocked it.

694
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,360
Limping. I'll get to it.

695
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,640
But yeah, we're still on day one.

696
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,320
Stats. I'm jumping around.

697
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,680
Yeah, Shane from Soren.

698
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,560
He was working Soren during that.

699
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Hello, Shane.

700
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,480
Garret's event.

701
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank you for taking care of Jason and taking him on a thrilling adventure

702
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,800
over the different parts of the world.

703
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,480
A cast member at Runaway Railway who popped out of a side door

704
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,400
asked me if I had a podcast and I said, hi, how do you do it?

705
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,120
We talked for a second and then he disappeared as quickly as he

706
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,480
appeared the first time.

707
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,320
I didn't catch his name.

708
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,400
I unfortunately missed.

709
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
It wasn't goofy. I wish it was.

710
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
What's wrong with your knee, Jason?

711
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,040
I walked through Pizzeria Rizzo.

712
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,760
I've seen Pizzeria Rizzo now.

713
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
It does look very cool.

714
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,200
I missed Malia.

715
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
They were not working.

716
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
They were at Epcot or not Epcot.

717
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,000
They were they were working at another park.

718
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,560
What I I messaged them to see if they were around.

719
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,640
There's a very there's a very supportive listener and fan of the show.

720
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Works at Pizza Rizzo, which is the Muppet themed restaurant in Disney.

721
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,960
So it's been been debate about whether Pizza Rizzo is good.

722
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,120
Would you say Pizza Rizzo is good?

723
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,960
Oh, I didn't need it. I mean, I walked around.

724
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,080
Yeah.

725
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,360
Had a Mama Melrose reservation, a Sheridan family favorite.

726
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Next time I'm in Disney, I will I will eat it.

727
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,320
Yeah, I'll try it next time.

728
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,880
And then we'll do an episode.

729
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,400
Hmm. I think we should settle this hash.

730
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,200
Yeah, we should finally settle that debate.

731
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
So you had mama.

732
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,560
You had Mama Melrose.

733
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,920
Mama Melrose. That was good.

734
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,880
And you've had that. Is that a regular tradition?

735
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,600
That is a regular tradition pretty much since I was like a child.

736
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
Really? You feel like? Yeah.

737
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,760
And is it a say you get a different thing each time?

738
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
Or is there a thing you've been ordering?

739
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
Yeah, I feel like the menu has gotten pretty paired.

740
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,480
A lot of the restaurants had kind of smaller menus right now are kind of paired down.

741
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,720
OK, so what did you get there?

742
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,320
Chicken Parmesan. OK.

743
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,800
Do they have pizza? They have pizza.

744
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,000
Pizzas. Yeah.

745
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,320
I've actually never been there.

746
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,200
So Mama Melrose, you've been maybe when I was a kid.

747
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,440
Yeah, I don't think we did.

748
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,120
We went to the bron.

749
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,600
Lindsay, I went to Brown Derby now, like a couple of years ago.

750
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,680
I forgot I was trying to get in last time I was there.

751
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,320
And then some runner came by, pushed me down, made me drink water from the from a puddle.

752
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,040
It was such a flash. I don't even know.

753
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Then I looked up the sun number.

754
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Watch out for runners, folks.

755
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,000
So so wait. So, yeah, you're I know you're jumping around here.

756
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,240
So this is Hollywood Studios.

757
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,400
Is that the second day?

758
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,800
So the first full day. Yeah.

759
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,040
That my my my idea was that like my my dad and brother hadn't seen

760
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,600
Star Wars yet.

761
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,280
It's the galaxy's edge. The galaxy's edge.

762
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,840
They hadn't seen it at all.

763
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,720
So I was like, OK, we'll get up early.

764
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,760
Resort guests get in to the park half an hour early.

765
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,600
Yeah. And so I was like, all right, we'll just go back and stand by.

766
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,200
Rise of the Resistance. It won't be that bad that early.

767
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,280
Right. Two things happened.

768
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,160
One, I forgot there are thirty six thousand roughly hotel rooms on Disney property.

769
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,920
Oh, right. Yes.

770
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,160
So the crowds at eight thirty, eight forty in the morning were already like

771
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,360
pretty substantial to get in that park.

772
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,960
I think as we were going the turnstile, I looked

773
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Rise of the Resistance had like a 70 minute wait.

774
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,080
It's like, OK, there's no virtual queue in here.

775
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,560
Well, there's no virtual queue. Right. Which sucks.

776
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,320
Because what happened within like the time it took us to get in the front gate

777
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,720
and get towards Star Wars, it broke down.

778
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,240
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

779
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,840
The breakdowns are so bad on this thing that it breaks down.

780
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,920
And every time we would look, it's like, all right, should we try?

781
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
OK, it's it's broken down again.

782
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,160
And so by that point, by the time it was up and running,

783
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
it was already like 90 minutes or two hours.

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,560
Yeah. And all the individual lightning lanes were gone.

785
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,160
So we tried to buy a lightning lane for it two days later.

786
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,320
Two or three days later.

787
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,920
And the lightning lane is what just in case anybody doesn't know.

788
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,680
That's the new version of Fastpass for e-tickets.

789
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,200
High. The big rides where you have to pay an extra what?

790
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,440
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty dollars.

791
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,320
You'll tell us in a second. What's the price?

792
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,600
It was.

793
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Per ride.

794
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,560
So you now piecemeal have to purchase right.

795
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,720
That of a free thing, let you cut lines before. Right.

796
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,120
Jeannie, you individually.

797
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,160
And there's two things.

798
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,040
Jeannie Plus is just for like the mid level rides.

799
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,560
Rides that are mid, they say.

800
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,840
That's what the kids say.

801
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,520
But high level rides like Rides of the Resistance,

802
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,480
you have to pay an additional fee per ride.

803
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,360
And really quick, when this when we're starting, Mike,

804
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,640
you asked us to test the microphones, just to make sure your levels are OK.

805
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,960
Jason's test of his microphone was, yes, yes, lightning lane.

806
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,200
And I shuddered like, oh, right.

807
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,920
This we have to talk about this now.

808
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,400
I he's in a lot to say.

809
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,960
So I'll jump all the way to the last day we were there.

810
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,200
Yeah, we bought a lightning lane for seven doors, mine train.

811
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,400
OK, am because that I've never I've been now to Disney World

812
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,520
twice when that's been open.

813
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,800
I've never even been in the ballpark of being able to do that ride.

814
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,480
So it is really oddly bonkers.

815
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,040
Yeah. Or I'm just there.

816
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,080
There's just I just have other priorities and I don't have the two hours to do it.

817
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah. And it.

818
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,120
Very long wait.

819
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,080
It is fun. It's more fun than you think.

820
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,360
But it's not worth that wait.

821
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,240
OK, it was worth, you know, I think we just wanted to do it.

822
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,080
We had the time.

823
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,000
So my dad, like I showed him how to do it.

824
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,640
And he got up, had no trouble buying it at 7 a.m.

825
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,280
for like a 10 or 1030 return time.

826
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,120
Mm hmm. Like for the day before, I was up at 7 a.m.

827
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,280
to try to buy Rise of the Resistance Lightning Lane.

828
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,360
It showed me 9 a.m.

829
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,080
I didn't think we'd get there in time, but I hit it anyway.

830
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,280
When it refreshed or like took me to the next page and said,

831
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
did you mean two o'clock?

832
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,160
And I was like, I didn't mean to know.

833
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
Let me refresh it again.

834
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,400
It's like, ah, you wanted to buy five o'clock.

835
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,360
And I'm like, oh, my God.

836
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,360
Like so by 705, the resort guests access ones were gone.

837
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,080
I tried again at 9 a.m. and just nothing.

838
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,840
I just couldn't get anything.

839
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Now, does it? So does it say what price or you never even got to that part?

840
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
It was about $15 per person.

841
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,800
They changed. So there's not a price that they give to all of these.

842
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,200
So on the right, it's like the universal thing.

843
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,680
It's the plane ticket.

844
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
That's what I was saying a couple of weeks ago, or it's like it,

845
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,400
depending on how popular things are.

846
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,280
We are getting into health insurance territory.

847
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,440
That's where all this is going, where it's like dense systems

848
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
you have to learn. Oh, right. Right. Right.

849
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Expenses impenetrable.

850
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
What's that? Why did that go up?

851
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,240
And Scott, you're preaching to the choir because by day two, I was like,

852
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,480
I hate that. Like, this is driving me insane.

853
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,680
And I think I'm pretty reasonably knowledgeable about this stuff.

854
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,680
Pretty reasonably. Yeah.

855
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,920
Well, I loved the detail that Jane, your girlfriend,

856
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,920
that declared that you have been talking about this too much

857
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,960
when we were out at a party.

858
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,720
I needed like, please, can we talk about something that is not Jeannie?

859
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,040
I yeah, she probably thought I was talking about it.

860
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,040
Too much there.

861
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,560
Well, I'll say, OK, so that's the lightning

862
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,400
blade kind of a crapshoot for that.

863
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,160
So they're they'll probably come out to visit

864
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,400
in next year or the year at some point.

865
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,120
I was like, we'll just do it in an hour.

866
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,520
Like a lot of stuff we just ran out of time on.

867
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,960
I'm like, whenever you come, we have it in Anaheim.

868
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,520
We'll just do it there.

869
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,080
Would you pay for Mind Train, then?

870
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,440
I think that one was about $11 a head.

871
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,080
And it's it's they go to these obscure amounts like.

872
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,680
All right. So Big Thunder today is 1290.

873
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,640
Like this is this is crazy. The stock market.

874
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,040
It's trying. Yeah, it is a stock. It is. Yeah.

875
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,920
But something was only seven.

876
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,040
Maybe it was a runaway railway.

877
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,240
I'll say that that first time.

878
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,360
So the first full day when rise went down, we did stand by for runaway railway.

879
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,720
And that was a pretty smooth wait.

880
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,600
I think it was posted like we might have waited 50 minutes.

881
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,640
It was posted 60 or something like that.

882
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,480
The wait times kind of all over the map.

883
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Some very inflated, some right on accurate.

884
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,360
I had also paid the 17, 18 dollar annual price for the touring plans.

885
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,200
Like right. Wait time app, which shows you like this is what's posted.

886
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,920
You'll probably wait close to this.

887
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
That was usually pretty accurate, too.

888
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,600
And their crowd calendars.

889
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Were also accurate.

890
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,480
I just didn't know a six out of ten meant like, stay the fuck away from this park.

891
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,360
Sure. So so so touring plans, which

892
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,120
they'll have a do they have they have like people in the park that are guessing

893
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,400
or not guessing that are actually they're just going through and clocking it.

894
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,320
And then they also have like users submit it times. Right.

895
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,160
So they're giving you the real shit.

896
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,360
So they're giving you the real time.

897
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,400
It's like having a man on the inside. Exactly.

898
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,960
The corporation's not lying to you. Right.

899
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,520
Yeah. Len is like deep throat.

900
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,480
One test is touring planes. He's given you the real shit.

901
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,400
But so the first day we rode that, it was fine.

902
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,920
The second time we met went back to Hollywood Studios.

903
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,960
It was we we were just all so tired.

904
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Like we waited an hour for Tower of Terror.

905
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,320
And that was a bad sign with Tower of Terror and Rock and Rollercoaster.

906
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
We're both an hour.

907
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,680
And it's like these never like it's really crowded.

908
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,680
These are pretty old rides at this point.

909
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,160
You know, sure. Sure. But this is all I feel like I was there in the summer.

910
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,760
It was all everything was north of this.

911
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,200
You're saying in November you were not expecting this.

912
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,800
I kind of wasn't expecting it.

913
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,840
My family has often gone in the hottest part of summer

914
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,680
because they usually have like they're

915
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,120
no one wants to go to Orlando with that temperature.

916
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,640
Sure. Sure. So but we do. We're used to it.

917
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,200
So this was this was a change of pace for us.

918
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,320
We want to see it all decorated for Christmas. But

919
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,920
so you you were correct.

920
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,360
You would warn me the extended queue for Runaway Railway is brutal.

921
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,920
It's the cement outside.

922
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,080
So it's boring.

923
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,000
And that so that was Friday.

924
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,120
We did that. And that was like my brother tapped out.

925
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,080
He was like, I'm not he's like, I'm just going to walk around the park

926
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,280
and then just maybe ride something, maybe go back to the hotel.

927
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,760
Jane, by Friday, she she fell into

928
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,680
I guess my family goes pretty hard.

929
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,920
I guess we do pretty long days.

930
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,640
But by Friday, he was like, I don't want to be rude.

931
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,560
I want to go to the pool.

932
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,800
And she was. Yeah.

933
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
So I was standing in this little miserable, like cute like my

934
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,760
did it solo. I know I did.

935
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,840
I did do it with my dad.

936
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,560
Your dad at least said company.

937
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,040
And and my that was the only time I lower back started to her

938
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,880
was just standing on the concrete.

939
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,520
And then while Jane is texting, I'm going to the lazy river.

940
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,760
I'm doing the water side and storm along Bay.

941
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm going to take a bubble bath.

942
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,880
And it's like she made the right call and did it.

943
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,080
This is a lot of this has been occurring to me throughout this episode.

944
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,800
Really, anytime anybody goes, I love going.

945
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,280
I spend I do this podcast.

946
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,400
I spend the whole year thinking about Disney World and watching Disney

947
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,280
World videos. Yeah.

948
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,920
But there is something about I this this is not a relaxing place to go.

949
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,200
I don't know if it ever was really.

950
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,320
But now today with your lightnings and your genies,

951
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,360
yeah, your COVID protocols and your book at 90 days in advance.

952
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,040
I it's all so like you have to be like Jane and just declare this is relaxed.

953
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
I will carve relax time out of it.

954
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,360
No, and it took her a couple of days to she she was like her family vacations

955
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,680
were that she'd be like, it'd be so it would have been rude growing up if like

956
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,520
I had split off from my family and my families were like,

957
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,600
yeah, if you want to go get a coffee, by all means, just meet up with us later.

958
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,560
Or like, you know, oh, if you want to go back to that's fine.

959
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,960
Yeah, go have some rest.

960
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,360
So she felt like she couldn't say it.

961
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,720
She couldn't say it from six when she was wandering around at six a.m.

962
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,800
and didn't get to go to the get to go to bed.

963
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,520
Yeah. Probably wanted to be like, can I go to bed? Yeah.

964
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,840
And I was I thought I was slowing down too, because I was like, yeah, my

965
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,200
I cannot clearly go as hard right now with my knees.

966
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,960
Can I OK, so you were saying by the end of the trip, your knees were better. Yeah.

967
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,760
Is it because we've talked about this much like Superman gets his power

968
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,560
from Earth, Yellow Sun.

969
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,240
We've talked about before where Jason has never as more energy

970
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,560
that we've ever seen, like when he's on Orlando, he is the most energy

971
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,600
you ever see him.

972
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,920
So were you actually be charged by the humidity and the certain air

973
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,920
conditioning smell and all the rides? It just took a couple of days.

974
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I think it was probably that.

975
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,320
And just like after like so much time at home after two years, you know,

976
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,600
like there was a number of factors. Sure.

977
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,720
So all of that combined to heal you. Yeah.

978
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,040
OK, that's good.

979
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,160
Here's my other take.

980
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,080
I don't think this one will be disputed, though.

981
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,000
I run away. Railway rocks. Yeah. Yeah.

982
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,400
We obviously I do the episode, but Mike, I guess you got to do it first.

983
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,280
Of course I will.

984
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,840
That'll be a glowing episode, I think, unless we're now putting you in a corner.

985
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,960
But I I don't know.

986
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,440
It's one of those two that you like it never sounded

987
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,040
obviously never sounded bad to me.

988
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,480
I feel like I read a synopsis of it and went like, oh, sounds nice.

989
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,520
And I was like, when you set the bar at like pretty good,

990
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,960
I think it's better than pretty good.

991
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
It's sort of like I was shocked how much I loved it.

992
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,160
I think it's a fantastic.

993
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,760
I was too. There were so many neat little tricks.

994
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,840
There were so many fun moments.

995
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,920
I mean, Rise of the Resistance is its own sort of blockbuster production.

996
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,720
But this one was just kind of more fun,

997
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,880
but also has a lot of technology and and cool stuff.

998
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,680
Yeah, it still gives you I think it's cool that families and kids

999
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,280
can have an attraction that's less scary, but that still has what rise has,

1000
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,240
which is like a ride can do this, this and like I got on this

1001
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,880
and I thought it was this kind of ride and then this happened and that happened.

1002
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,520
It's just cool. There's like a friendly one of those two.

1003
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,160
Yeah. And so and so the other newish ride

1004
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,480
a ratatouille.

1005
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, yeah. I I I liked it.

1006
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,960
I like the vibe.

1007
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,760
It's kind of where I was at with it.

1008
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,560
I really like the vibe.

1009
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,440
I liked a lot of the theater tricks.

1010
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,720
I like I like the size tricks like going under the stove and stuff like that.

1011
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,880
But I rode Runaway Railway first, and then I rode this.

1012
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:40,520
A few days later, I rode the clone of a ride built in 2012 or 2013.

1013
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,480
You know what I mean?

1014
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,920
Like it always if I had done Ratatouille and then Runaway Railway,

1015
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,240
I think I would have thought highly of it.

1016
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,280
Yeah, I think.

1017
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,480
Yeah, I don't want to like play down Ratatouille.

1018
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,440
But from my experience doing it in Paris,

1019
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,120
it's like, I don't know, having I think it's

1020
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,040
you're doing it post Runaway Railway or post Rise.

1021
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,600
It's just it doesn't top, though.

1022
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,200
You just have to expect that it's you.

1023
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,680
You can't expect it to top those in terms of trackless rides.

1024
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,760
And I don't think it really gives you the thrill of those.

1025
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,160
It's neat. It's interesting.

1026
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,240
It's worth going on.

1027
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,400
But I might venture to say it is the lesser of the track,

1028
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,920
the Disney trackless rides.

1029
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,880
I didn't get to do Pooh's Honey Hunt, but that seems pretty spectacular.

1030
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Mystic Manor have not done, but obviously that's an incredible ride.

1031
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,920
Beauty and the Beast looks pretty amazing.

1032
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,360
Like, I don't know. I think Ratatouille is pulling up the rear, unfortunately.

1033
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,600
I'll say the the extension of the France Pavilion is very charming.

1034
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,840
Oh, that's that was when we when we did finally get into Epcot Center

1035
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,920
on that first like half day.

1036
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,120
I guess it ended up being a full day for me inadvertently.

1037
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,480
The very first thing we went back there and got like crepes and hard cider.

1038
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
And like that was nice.

1039
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,160
That was nice after sitting around on the beach.

1040
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,400
At in the cold, waiting for the marathon.

1041
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,680
Yeah, it was right there.

1042
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,560
Now, imagine Remy having to run around with a bunch in the middle of a marathon.

1043
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,040
They would pay no heed to the genius rat of our times.

1044
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,080
They'd stomp on his brains if they had to.

1045
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah, they didn't have to. Right.

1046
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,640
They would point him out and they go, everyone run over there.

1047
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,640
That's what they would do.

1048
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,720
Willingly get a lower score. Yeah.

1049
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,560
Low score.

1050
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,040
Get a worse time in the marathon so that you can stomp on a rat instead.

1051
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,200
Right. Hey, we did get to use what there was a Alice in Wonderland

1052
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,760
photo spot by the the Boardwalk Hotel that was set up for the marathon.

1053
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,080
And we definitely got to take advantage of it for the movies.

1054
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,480
No, the the original movie.

1055
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,040
Oh, OK.

1056
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,560
Oh, then who cares?

1057
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,680
Cartoons. That's not my Alice, man.

1058
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,080
I want to trip out with the M.H. himself.

1059
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,160
You want to go in through the looking glass with the M.H.

1060
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,360
He's now known on this podcast.

1061
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,720
Yeah. Yeah. Good old M.H.

1062
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,040
with the brilliant original Johnny Depp voice.

1063
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,880
That's right.

1064
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,440
The same voice ever.

1065
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
He we must protect this man at all costs.

1066
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,960
I keep I keep getting talent.

1067
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,000
If you scroll like Instagram, like like, I don't even know what you.

1068
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,760
Sometimes you scroll like Instagram stories or something.

1069
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,080
You get stuff that like is just recommended to you.

1070
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,200
The amount of times I get a close up video of Johnny Depp playing

1071
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,320
in the Hollywood vampires on Instagram, two or three a day, I feel like.

1072
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,400
I'm not getting that one.

1073
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,840
Sometimes a duplicate.

1074
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,040
It's the it's I'll tell you what's causing this.

1075
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,760
It's Mike saying bad boys of Boston so often.

1076
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,680
That's part of it.

1077
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,200
Phone is like, I know, I know what it like.

1078
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,240
Joe Perry, Johnny Depp playing guitar.

1079
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,520
Well, Joe Perry's in the band.

1080
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,320
He's one I thought he was one of the OK.

1081
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,200
He's one of the three more Hollywood vampires are Cooper three.

1082
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,560
The big three, the Trinity, the Holy Trinity,

1083
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,680
Burr, M.H., Cooper, M.H. and bad and bad boy B.

1084
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,400
So, yeah, I get like Johnny Depp with like ten scarves hanging out of his pocket,

1085
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,840
like with the guitar strap real low.

1086
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,560
And he's just like playing some blues.

1087
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
I get videos of that almost every day.

1088
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,480
If I start scrolling, it might be YouTube gives that to me, too.

1089
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,600
At some point with all those scarves, he's asking for an accident.

1090
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,200
If there is like a wet stage for any reason, somebody spilled a beer

1091
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,840
or something or Joe Perry's sweat all over the stage and the wrong

1092
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,960
the scarf goes into an amp or like Depp is going to get electrocuted

1093
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
doing one of these shows.

1094
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,760
He should not have that much dangling off of him while handling an electric

1095
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,600
implement. And then these Twitters are going to go saying that it was cancel

1096
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,080
culture that killed him.

1097
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,400
It wasn't it was the scarves playing guitar.

1098
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,160
It was the scarves. Yeah.

1099
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,880
And you'll get a video recommended to you of it happening gritty as it may be.

1100
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,040
So you can prove that that's how M.H. died.

1101
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
Michael, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1102
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,440
I did not get a chance to see the bad boy.

1103
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,720
That was my next question.

1104
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,200
And I knew it. I could feel it.

1105
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,480
I could feel it that you didn't get to go see Aerosmith.

1106
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,280
I didn't go see Aerosmith.

1107
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
They were I think they'll be around for a while.

1108
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,920
They were refurbishing the big guitar.

1109
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,280
I saw that the big guitar was being refurbished.

1110
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,160
They're putting in they're investing money.

1111
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,080
Are they still playing the song pink outside of the ride?

1112
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,320
I couldn't really tell. I tried to ride it once.

1113
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,320
It had a 60, 70 minute wait.

1114
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,880
I looked I had looked up.

1115
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,560
There is usually a single rider.

1116
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,680
I walked up and I said, can I do single rider?

1117
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,560
And they said, no, it's so long.

1118
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,800
Single rider would actually be longer than the regular line right now.

1119
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,520
Oh, my gosh. That's great.

1120
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
I mean, look, it's very popular.

1121
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
I would do it again.

1122
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,720
It's better than Tower of Terror.

1123
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,280
And I would do it.

1124
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,440
Excuse me. I would do it.

1125
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,680
Over Tower of Terror any day.

1126
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,920
So I get that. That's all I'm saying.

1127
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,560
I think that was a take that wasn't in the episode we did about it.

1128
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,560
I think you're so bad boys of Boston drunk now that you're like

1129
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,440
you've notched it up year by year on the show.

1130
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,640
It is a very good.

1131
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,600
It's great. I like it. It is great.

1132
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm not sure Aerosmith is the reason I like.

1133
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,240
Although I don't know.

1134
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,120
I mean, that pre show is pre show is so fantastic.

1135
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,160
Yeah. Yeah. And the ride is great.

1136
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,880
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1137
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,000
Hey, wait, wait a sec.

1138
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,840
But we'll get to our fans like that.

1139
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,000
Well, we do we care.

1140
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,520
We're band cares about our fans. Yeah.

1141
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,880
Yeah, that's right.

1142
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,960
Oh, we got going to take it with all this me.

1143
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,880
And they're stuck in the like, don't want to miss a thing.

1144
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,400
Armageddon like era forever,

1145
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,760
like they're that version of the band forever. Mm hmm.

1146
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,520
Aren't they mixing? They're mixing.

1147
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,480
They're mixing walk this way for some reason.

1148
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,120
Now they have this way. Three.

1149
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,040
Well, yeah, right. The third version of Walk This Way.

1150
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,960
Wait fourth, because if you count the Super Bowl one with Brittany and in sync.

1151
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,040
But is that later? Nelly.

1152
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
Or is it the same year?

1153
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,760
Yeah, it was Nelly, was it?

1154
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,840
Oh, that might have been after. Oh, you're right.

1155
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,200
OK, so if you're tracking the Walk This Way

1156
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,480
sequels, three is rock and roller coaster remix.

1157
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,200
Four is Super Bowl with Nelly.

1158
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,280
Exactly. Yes. So.

1159
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,600
Wait, does the kid rock one cat?

1160
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,160
Oh, which way run DMC at the VMAs?

1161
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1162
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,760
They burst in the back.

1163
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,960
They walked all the way from the back of the opera house.

1164
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,120
A lot about Aerosmith.

1165
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,200
They do. I guess I know every iteration of Walk This Way.

1166
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,160
Oh, wait. And you have to count the one that they did with Moe at Moe's

1167
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,600
Tavern at Flaming Moe's. Yes. Yes.

1168
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,280
You do have that number three. All right.

1169
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,560
So there's six relevant versions of Walk This Way. Right.

1170
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,320
And the fourth is in the Disney Park.

1171
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,560
Jason has checked out and checked his notes long ago.

1172
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,880
I think he took a big yawn too, I was talking if I didn't if I my eyes

1173
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,480
didn't deceive that way down to his laptop. Very tired.

1174
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,320
That's right. It wasn't because of what we were saying was boring.

1175
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,800
It was because you're tired.

1176
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,280
I want everyone to have their fun.

1177
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,040
I want to get your fun in.

1178
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,640
All right, boys, get your jolly.

1179
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,480
You were conserving. Let's talk about my knee.

1180
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,280
You were conserving your energy to go on.

1181
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,240
I was conserving my energy.

1182
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,360
You're rusting your eyes.

1183
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,880
So you can stretch. What else? What else?

1184
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,680
I mean, yeah, I so the crowds were were a bit of a dance.

1185
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,040
I mean, we still had a great time, like I said, but it was like,

1186
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,160
I think we were I had to remind myself a few days in.

1187
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,280
It's like, oh, my dad and brother really like this stuff,

1188
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,600
but they are much more willing than I am to go like, oh, yeah,

1189
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,440
we don't need to do that.

1190
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,200
Jane is like, yeah, I don't need I could skip that.

1191
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,160
I sure. Does that tear you apart?

1192
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,120
Is it tough when that's your be your ganged up on?

1193
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,840
No, because I was I mean,

1194
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,640
no, because I was ready to skip like walking back to things like

1195
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,120
that was one of the reasons I was like, I do not want to walk all the way back

1196
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,600
to Sunset Boulevard to see Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy.

1197
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,280
Even though that would be very funny if I as a solo 36 year old man

1198
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,120
said to Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy.

1199
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,640
Let me get can I just throw some questions out right now?

1200
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,720
Sure. Yeah. Abra Kedare bar. Did you do it?

1201
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,160
Didn't know. OK. Was there any talk of it?

1202
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,480
We talked about it at one point.

1203
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,400
Jane, Jane, we met up with a few friends of hers

1204
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,080
at various times when we were down there, because she lived in Orlando

1205
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,480
for a long time, still knows a lot of people down there.

1206
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,760
But we I think at one point I talked about meeting

1207
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,400
her her friend Kathleen and her husband, Eric. Hi.

1208
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,000
I know they're listeners.

1209
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,080
Hi, Kathleen. Hello, Eric.

1210
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,600
We met them at Geiser Point over at Wilderness Lodge,

1211
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,680
which is another recommendation I have. I haven't been there.

1212
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,560
That is an outdoor bar, outdoor restaurant bar.

1213
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,680
I like the sound of this.

1214
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,320
And the electric water pageant

1215
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,760
parks in front of it.

1216
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,440
Great. Oh, yes. All right.

1217
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,480
I'm there next time. So that's great. It was great.

1218
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,880
I mean, they were wonderful dinner guests.

1219
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,520
And then they were like, oh, the show star.

1220
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,560
You should get over the end.

1221
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,880
Like, I've never hobbled faster.

1222
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,800
But it was delightful.

1223
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,960
It was like a perfect view.

1224
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,160
Yeah, you had a perfect view right of the pageant.

1225
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,400
It was all the classic floats.

1226
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,080
And then they had a little fiftieth display.

1227
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,640
Oh, there's a new thing at that.

1228
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,760
Yeah. Wow. That's so and the some stuff in the app works

1229
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,800
good like they had.

1230
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,320
If you looked up the electric water pageant, it told you, OK,

1231
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,360
it'll be at the Polynesian at eight twenty.

1232
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,800
It'll be at the contemporary at eight forty five.

1233
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,760
You know, it told you each time.

1234
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,840
And I was a little surprised by that because like

1235
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,480
the app is a pain in the ass

1236
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,680
and an additional pain in the ass with all the genie stuff.

1237
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,480
Yeah, yeah, like it.

1238
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,640
So but Kaiser Point.

1239
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,480
Yeah, we like that a lot.

1240
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,560
That was very fun. OK. OK. OK.

1241
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,280
What? Oh, another friend of hers we met up with was doing the Monsters

1242
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,440
Inc. Laugh Floor show, which is a show where they control like live

1243
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,920
animation and they're improvising.

1244
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,360
And I had never seen it before. It was delightful.

1245
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,040
It was really fun. And the crowd loved it.

1246
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,760
All week, all the shows I saw Hall of Presidents, Carousel of Progress,

1247
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,600
let's show Carousel of Progress, Country Bears.

1248
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,240
The audience were into them.

1249
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,240
OK, good, good.

1250
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,680
The audience were a little sleepy at Carousel of Progress.

1251
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,600
But Carousel of Progress running great.

1252
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,840
Country Bears running great. OK.

1253
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,680
That means none of the robots heads fell off.

1254
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,240
Nothing fell off.

1255
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,240
You know what? This is, I think,

1256
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,560
almost boring enough that we haven't even addressed it on the show.

1257
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,840
Old old Joe's in the hall now.

1258
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,200
Old Joe. Forty six himself doing kind of nothing, right?

1259
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,280
He gives the oath of office.

1260
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,400
He just he does less than Trump.

1261
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,600
I think so.

1262
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,080
Trump said a little something in the video.

1263
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,000
Maybe Biden said about that.

1264
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,920
But like, yeah, they definitely Trump has now been moved to the very back

1265
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,520
behind noted psychopath Andrew Jackson.

1266
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,960
His dream that they hang out together.

1267
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,600
They just talk shit in the corner.

1268
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,920
Then there was, can you believe what they're doing to a beautiful hall?

1269
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,120
Never seen anything like it, frankly.

1270
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,240
And frankly, you're seeing it a lot these days.

1271
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,120
You're hearing it more and more.

1272
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,560
And you're hearing it more and more.

1273
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,320
And you don't love to see it.

1274
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,880
But other things you do love to see.

1275
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,520
I was waiting for the I believe you

1276
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,320
coined the term cheering and booing.

1277
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,480
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh huh.

1278
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,320
Damn.

1279
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,040
As they finished saying Donald Trump, one party real quick went like

1280
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
like to get it in.

1281
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,560
But not because now his name is said because previously

1282
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,040
they went out of their way to have him say his name and not write the narrator.

1283
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,480
And they still say like, we are saluting the idea of the president.

1284
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,240
That's what Walt liked was the idea.

1285
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,360
So Walt didn't necessarily support and wouldn't necessarily support

1286
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,240
all the men on the stage be there from the past or very recent.

1287
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,240
But

1288
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,760
so they that's very well, you know, we're going to do, you know, we got to do.

1289
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,240
OK, great.

1290
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,880
And nobody can stop us.

1291
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,920
It was so fast.

1292
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,400
I was like, was that sarcastic?

1293
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,280
And I asked Jane, like, do you hear that clap?

1294
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
Were they joking?

1295
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,920
And she's like, oh, no, they didn't have masks on the whole show.

1296
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,760
No, that was very sincere.

1297
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,840
They a lot of patriotic attire on.

1298
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,480
And they were clapping for him for sure.

1299
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,880
I will say that I because I was down there in that

1300
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,880
window of time before kind of the spike happened again.

1301
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,640
And it probably got a little bad as I was leaving Florida in a way.

1302
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,600
And I was a little disease concerned sometimes,

1303
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,080
sometimes from the attire of the people around me.

1304
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,840
And which because no mask sometimes married with a shirt that, you know,

1305
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,920
yeah, has like, I don't know the American flag, but with different colors,

1306
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,800
like where a stripe is blue and the rest is not.

1307
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,640
We'll come back to that.

1308
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,680
Oh, boy. Oh, wonderful. Oh, great.

1309
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,240
But I you know what?

1310
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,800
At the time, I was like, well, this is making me a little stressed out.

1311
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:34,000
But I in a way, I appreciate that they identify themselves with this clothing.

1312
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,920
They let me know to try to stay away unless I'm in, say,

1313
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,760
the line for runaway railway and have no choice but to pass by them

1314
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,200
10 or so times.

1315
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,080
I made it back without issue.

1316
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Sure. Yeah, that's that's a new it's a new stress, isn't it?

1317
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,200
Down there. I get. Yeah.

1318
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,320
I mean, like I said, the the we just kind of fell back.

1319
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,720
I think we all kind of fell back into it.

1320
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,680
Like even Jane and I had been very like anxious and cautious

1321
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,960
for like the last 19 months or whatever at at this point.

1322
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,440
And I guess, right. Crickets falling back into it.

1323
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,000
Yeah, I know. We've we've all the cricket.

1324
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,360
Found out about the treats.

1325
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,680
Oh, all right. Oh, no.

1326
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,080
Mm hmm. Anybody getting hungry?

1327
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,200
Oh, which crickets coming to get me?

1328
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,680
Honestly, it's mad.

1329
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,600
You ate my brothers. Yeah.

1330
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,720
And we yeah, we've tried to.

1331
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,000
It doesn't seem like the other distractions in the garage have been an issue.

1332
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,080
But I think people can hear this cricket.

1333
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,480
Is there a way to stop the cricket if I go like, hey,

1334
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,880
you just kind of like hit the wall like I hit it?

1335
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,120
Yeah, maybe.

1336
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,360
Well, you did.

1337
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,360
It did work.

1338
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,120
You did. You think you're on a whore.

1339
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,120
Quiet down, you goddamn cricket.

1340
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,960
Now, if only there was a trick like that for those marathon runners.

1341
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Yeah. The only thing I can think of is just putting them in jail.

1342
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,160
That's the only thing I can.

1343
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,400
Hey, some of us have been awake since five.

1344
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,200
Some of us got in cartoonishly early.

1345
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,360
You were mad because they were like

1346
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,200
they were bragging about how their legs worked that day.

1347
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,240
Well, they were showing me up. Yeah, I did.

1348
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,400
They did eventually.

1349
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,440
I mean, we walked around the boardwalk a little that morning.

1350
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,880
Yeah. But yeah.

1351
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,920
So shows were working well.

1352
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,000
There were a number of times where it seemed like all these added fees,

1353
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,360
all these additional costs they were not putting into ride upkeep

1354
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,320
because Carousel did break down the first day we were at Magic Kingdom.

1355
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,400
People mover broke down a lot.

1356
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,280
Splash Mountain was down the one day.

1357
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,200
The Wi-Fi for carts were down in Tomorrowland at one point,

1358
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,880
like food carts or like we can only do cash.

1359
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,960
And there was a number of times I either had experienced this

1360
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,120
or overheard like we can't take magic bands right now.

1361
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,760
And it's like you spent a billion dollars on these fucking bands

1362
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,120
and you can get the Wi-Fi to work.

1363
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,000
And also they have ramped up selling, you know, the magic bands

1364
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,440
in in shops because they're not free right anymore

1365
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,880
or they're about to not be free anymore.

1366
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,560
I hope that magic band access is part of the Biden infrastructure bill.

1367
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,400
I hope that that'll be addressed.

1368
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,520
Oh, sure. Money that's been allocated for that.

1369
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,920
We all split here.

1370
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,560
This is I got the one.

1371
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,720
This is Goofy has a lot of ice cream.

1372
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,960
Oh, and then Donald dropped his ice cream.

1373
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,560
Oh, wow. So that's what that is.

1374
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,960
As a story. Yeah.

1375
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,680
Yeah. Mine has a story.

1376
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,320
When we were able to pick them online back in the summer.

1377
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,720
Extra charge.

1378
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,440
There was an extra charge, but everyone in my family was doing it.

1379
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,080
And I was going to get Yacht Club Mickey because he looked very jaunty

1380
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,880
and his yachting gear.

1381
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,800
And everyone in my family was like, are you going to get there's a Goofy ice

1382
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,000
cream? Are you not going to get the ice cream one man?

1383
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,800
Like your family was saying my family was getting grief for not.

1384
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,720
Come on, ice cream boy.

1385
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,160
Get the ice cream on the ice cream one.

1386
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,640
Come on. Just don't try to lick it off your wrist.

1387
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,520
It's not real. Yeah.

1388
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,800
Mike, an unfortunate turn of events in terms of things that had to be sacrificed

1389
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,680
did not make it to beaches and cream.

1390
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,320
My thinking was that this is open to the public,

1391
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,640
you know, so I can get into it.

1392
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,000
But like you can only get to storm along Bay.

1393
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,680
You can only get to the pool area if you are still along.

1394
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,560
Storm along Bay.

1395
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,160
Storm along Bay next to Crescent Lake.

1396
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,880
Yes. Yeah.

1397
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,440
We all know geography.

1398
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,520
Yeah. So I.

1399
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,240
But you had OK.

1400
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,720
But are you saving treats for the end or can we get or because like,

1401
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,920
did you have ice cream? Can we talk ice cream?

1402
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,560
Yeah, we can talk ice cream.

1403
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,640
I also did not make it to Gideon's because we didn't go to Disney Springs.

1404
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,600
Bang, bang the door again.

1405
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,960
It might start the cricket, but it'll get your anger out.

1406
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,840
Now, that is generally very upsetting to me.

1407
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,600
I you know, it was high on my list.

1408
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,160
But by like Friday night, we we did.

1409
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,520
We needed the boathouse.

1410
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,800
I was texting you texted me a photo of the boat outside.

1411
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,560
I was there in my mind.

1412
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,400
I loved it.

1413
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,800
I was telling you the setlist of the dueling piano.

1414
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,000
Thank you for that as well.

1415
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Playing.

1416
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What was it?

1417
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,560
I forget.

1418
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,560
Definitely got Layla in there.

1419
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,360
Yeah, yeah. Layla was definitely in there.

1420
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Great time.

1421
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,120
Slow one or fast one.

1422
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,640
That was after they played the new Eric Clapton anti-lockdown song.

1423
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,840
Yeah, I assume.

1424
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,520
They started with a jaunty version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah.

1425
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,360
You can do a jaunty?

1426
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,840
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

1427
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,760
And that went into a party party like it's 1999.

1428
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,760
OK, great.

1429
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,360
Then too much words.

1430
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,760
It's 1999, but sure.

1431
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,760
Yeah.

1432
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,160
That that was nice.

1433
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,200
It was a little maddening when we were outside on the dock

1434
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,200
and there was a stage like next door.

1435
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,800
And so at one point we could hear the dueling piano,

1436
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,440
the Christmas carolers and the aqua cars getting launched into the water.

1437
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,960
So that was a little bit of a cacophony, a cacophony of noise.

1438
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,760
You could take a number of those things out and just if the story was

1439
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,240
I was near a dueling piano bar and it was maddening, I would buy that 100 percent.

1440
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,000
I mean, we weren't too I mean, yeah, we were outside.

1441
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,680
We were excited.

1442
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,760
We hadn't really eaten outside that much.

1443
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,160
So why didn't you go to Gideon's?

1444
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,480
I don't understand this because I was just because there was a line

1445
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,480
like down the block at Friday at like 1030 at night.

1446
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,600
Is Gideon's the Gideon's is the Disney Springs one.

1447
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,680
It's the cookie place.

1448
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,000
Sorry, certain type of listener.

1449
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,960
Harry Potter type kind of fun like a cult book.

1450
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,240
Oh, yeah. We have stuff.

1451
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,400
And yeah, giant crazy cookies with a lot of chocolate chips in them.

1452
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,320
Yeah. And Mr.

1453
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,560
Morrow goes there a lot.

1454
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,960
Sometimes he doesn't get in because it's too long of a line.

1455
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,200
But I watched the I try to look for those videos specifically,

1456
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,360
the ones where he goes to Gideon's or anyone else.

1457
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,600
We were looking at other vloggers going to Gideon's.

1458
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,880
And I thought about going like at the first day at Disney Springs,

1459
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,120
but I didn't want to be a situation where my dad and brother's plane got like landed.

1460
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,640
And they're like, we're on our way to the hotel.

1461
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,000
It's like, OK, I'm in an hour long cookie line at Disney Springs.

1462
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,360
Sorry. But would would this is your family.

1463
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,840
Would they have been surprised?

1464
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,200
You get them cookies?

1465
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,560
No, I don't think they would have been surprised.

1466
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,520
They have limited time cakes there.

1467
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,240
They have like only like, you know, cake will be available maybe just one day.

1468
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:37,040
And then they like supposedly the way I know about this from these vlogs,

1469
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,080
they have like they don't even tell everybody they're the recipes for the baked goods.

1470
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,760
It is like they leave stuff out for the people making it

1471
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,520
because they want to preserve whatever the magic of Gideon's recipes.

1472
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,240
You watch a number of vlogs about a cookie

1473
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,200
and cake place across the country. Yes, correct.

1474
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,880
So imagine what it would be like to have recipes that you could not.

1475
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,120
And yes, you got on a plane.

1476
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,440
Yes. And sometimes I don't like it because they don't do a good job

1477
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,840
of showcasing what they bought.

1478
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,560
Sometimes they're just sort of eating it and they don't do give like good glamour

1479
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,560
shots because I like it when they go.

1480
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,520
They order like they'll order like Mr.

1481
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,800
Morrow does a very good job.

1482
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,960
He orders like a big peanut butter coffee and a big cookie or a big piece of cake.

1483
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,120
And then he goes out and he watch a video of a man with to have with a coffee.

1484
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,600
How good could the shot of coffee not as big as good as like when you do

1485
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,040
the chocolate chip cookie where you have a peanut butter coffee on draft?

1486
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,920
Yeah, that's what I say. Yeah, that's pretty fun.

1487
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,080
That sounds good. I was just saying visually.

1488
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,640
Yeah, I know that it's not as visually interesting with the coffee.

1489
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,640
But but you do want a little bit of a close up, a glamour shot of,

1490
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,840
you know, like when you do a fast food commercial, you get that great look.

1491
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,680
Got the water on the outside of the cup.

1492
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,680
Real laugh. You know, the condensation is gathered. Sure.

1493
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,080
Well, what I need, I need in any movie, I want to see the main character

1494
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,040
getting ready for the day and I want to see an insert of a little and the coffee

1495
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,880
pouring in and maybe a quick shot of the egg fry, because otherwise, how do I know?

1496
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,360
How do we get there?

1497
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,400
And how do I know this is an artsy film?

1498
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,680
It's true. And with the close up of the delicious or if one of my favorite

1499
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,200
comedians has taken some of his favorite comedians around in cars,

1500
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,200
I need to see a bunch of close up shots of that coffee that is not the coffee

1501
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,320
that then they're drinking at the time. A different coffee. Yes.

1502
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,360
The filter goes into the machine.

1503
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,960
Many Lovazza shots and then cut to Jerry.

1504
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,720
Martin Short and Jerry Martin Short drinking not remotely the coffee

1505
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,960
that they showed in the inserts. Exactly.

1506
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,560
That's my Andy Rooney.

1507
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,480
Sure. That show.

1508
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,920
You make me the real coffee.

1509
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,320
They should have shot for the real coffee.

1510
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:48,520
I was watching Jerry Seinfeld's show, not the Seinfeld show, his new show.

1511
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,560
And I like it better.

1512
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,080
First of all, the old show was annoying.

1513
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,600
These characters that no one they were unlikable.

1514
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,600
They fought all the time and were never made up and were friends.

1515
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,480
These stories are easier to follow.

1516
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,960
A car goes from one location to another.

1517
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,760
Coffee is purchase.

1518
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,560
A good time is had by all.

1519
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,760
Yeah. So Jason, of course, does Andy Rooney, you know,

1520
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,560
we're stealing his spit here.

1521
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,160
We can all we're all Rooney's for our own.

1522
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,400
We're all areas one way or another.

1523
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,680
The Rooney enter the room.

1524
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,160
The charm of this show is Clifford's and we are Rooney's.

1525
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,480
We're Rooney's. Oh, I like this.

1526
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,800
The Rooney verse.

1527
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,280
It's like, well, let me explain how it works.

1528
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,800
The listener you see is

1529
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,960
as you probably guess, it's about theme parks and themed entertainment.

1530
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,240
For all the Andy Rooney and Aerosmith talk, I'll be

1531
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,520
the Martin Short and the.

1532
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,800
The unsuccessful Martin Short movie from.

1533
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,160
Why aren't there Aerosmith robots on the ride?

1534
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,680
The rock and roller coaster.

1535
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,760
It would be much better if you saw them at the end and not just on a video screen.

1536
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,520
I don't like it.

1537
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,360
People want to see Bradley Whitford playing his instrument, whatever that may be.

1538
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,800
And why isn't Joey Kramer's coffee being sold at the gift shop afterwards?

1539
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,840
Joey worked hard on that coffee and it's not being carried in stock there.

1540
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,000
I mean, if they have celebrity endorse like products,

1541
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,960
they should be selling them at that gift shop.

1542
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,720
Let's be real. I want to see a nice close up shot of Joey Kramer's coffee

1543
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,520
going into a cup and then different coffee being.

1544
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,200
Why won't Jerry Seinfeld drink Joey Kramer's coffee?

1545
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,840
What devil's bargain has Disney made with Joffrey's?

1546
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,920
Whatever that coffee is, why are they every 10 feet?

1547
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Who is this Joffrey anyway? Joffrey.

1548
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,600
And it won't return, Mike.

1549
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,320
I tried. I picked up my phone and type Joffrey into it and

1550
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,960
I pressed dial and no one picked up.

1551
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,920
Why do the in-room packets claim they make a full pot, but it's pretty weak?

1552
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,120
Well, that is the show. Yeah.

1553
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,840
You've made I mean, coffee grips.

1554
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,760
Look, we'll get to Gideon's.

1555
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,960
I mean, you've reignited my excitement for it.

1556
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,400
But like just now or. Yeah, just now.

1557
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,760
Do you feel regret now?

1558
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,160
No, because I was very tired.

1559
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,080
Like I was pretty exhausted

1560
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,280
and I had to wake up the next morning and pack and then try to get to the Magic

1561
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,200
Kingdom to make sure we got that lightning.

1562
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,560
Like we had purchased.

1563
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,680
Oh, that's what I haven't talked about yet.

1564
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:21,680
The so Monday we went to Hollywood Studios.

1565
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,200
Tuesday went to Magic Kingdom.

1566
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:29,320
I bought a Genie Plus for everyone that day to test it out.

1567
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,840
To see how it went over roughly 64,

1568
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,160
sixty three dollars for four people.

1569
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,000
OK, which is like a steal.

1570
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,120
Yeah, I get I mean, it it does.

1571
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,480
Imagine doing that like every we were there for seven days,

1572
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:53,480
like every day for four feet, like on top of hotel and airfare,

1573
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,280
airfare and tickets.

1574
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,320
So, yeah, and I didn't I didn't use any of the like

1575
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,720
I'll tell you some stuff and we'll make you a day because I knew like this

1576
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,680
would drive my family insane like they again, they're not maniacs like I am,

1577
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,800
but they are old pros.

1578
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,640
They've they've been a number of times, you know, since we were very young.

1579
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,440
So they like know the score and like, excuse me.

1580
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,040
So Genie Plus, you're saying also as the element of Genie where you can tell it

1581
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,760
what you like and it will try to plan stuff for you.

1582
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,920
Yeah. So that's free.

1583
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,760
Like anyone can do that.

1584
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,720
And that's what I said.

1585
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,920
I will I will mess around.

1586
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,400
I will let that plan a day at Disneyland for me.

1587
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,520
But I was not going to subject my family on every few year vacation.

1588
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,520
Well, it hasn't come out here.

1589
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,600
It's not even launched yet.

1590
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,560
It's not launched yet.

1591
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,320
But I'm looking for the challenge.

1592
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,240
It will be because they pulled the virtual queue from web slingers.

1593
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,760
Right. I hope they don't pull it from Rise of the Resistance because,

1594
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,400
yeah, it was just such a shit show.

1595
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,280
That seems like such a mistake, because I even think about that with the rise

1596
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,720
where it's like because it breaks down so much, having just that is like a fast

1597
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,720
pass then to get it if you were in a time when it was down.

1598
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,120
Yeah.

1599
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,800
So it seems much easier if the thing's going to go down a few times a day.

1600
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,040
You know, it's the issue, though, the one issue with the virtual queue when we

1601
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,680
we did it for Ratatouille, it called us back.

1602
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,320
We were watching the groups, you know, get called.

1603
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,040
And I was like, I think we'll get called at like 110.

1604
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,800
It seems like like we could see it counting down.

1605
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,680
They're calling them very quickly.

1606
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,600
They called us around 110, 115.

1607
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,240
We had two o'clock lunch reservations

1608
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,200
at the Mexico Pavilion, which I mapped.

1609
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,040
That is a half a mile to get to.

1610
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,160
And so we got off Ratatouille at like one fifty five.

1611
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:43,320
So like you kind of got a haul at like the app is not smart enough

1612
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:48,880
yet to not schedule like conflicts.

1613
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,680
It sounds like I'm going to beat the shit out of this app when I'm doing my

1614
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,480
you probably versus.

1615
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,400
Yeah. So it sounds like, yeah, there's a lot of bugs still to be worked out.

1616
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,680
Yeah, it is. But you're going to crush it like a bug, like a cricket that you devour.

1617
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,920
Never shows up in this garage again.

1618
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,920
And that quiet a cricket down. I can eat a cricket.

1619
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,320
I can do anything.

1620
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,200
Conquer a powerful. Yeah.

1621
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,640
So when we were at Magic Kingdom, what I used ended up using

1622
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,720
the Genie Plus for was

1623
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,840
Jingle Cruise.

1624
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,680
I'm trying to I've forgotten now what I use it on search.

1625
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,720
I used it on Jingle Cruise, then Pirates right after that worked great.

1626
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,880
Like the one expires.

1627
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,600
We use the one was able to get the one next door immediately.

1628
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,680
So, OK, real quick, that works like Max Pass or Fastpass

1629
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,160
plus where you're scheduling times you're doing.

1630
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,360
You have to do it on the fly.

1631
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,880
So you get a window fly.

1632
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,960
So in the morning.

1633
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,400
Hotel guests could do it starting at seven a.m.

1634
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,240
Regular guests could do it at nine a.m.

1635
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,640
And it's just like the old original Fastpass first come first serve.

1636
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,520
So it just as seven o'clock is gone, eight o'clock shows up.

1637
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,800
And so in the morning, it was great because, yeah, we did Jingle Cruise.

1638
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,280
That was very fun.

1639
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,360
We had a very fast talking skipper.

1640
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,760
He had some good jokes.

1641
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,480
I don't know how he talks that fast all day long.

1642
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,400
So we got off that and then we were able to get another one.

1643
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,520
And then like for five minutes later for Pirates of the Caribbean.

1644
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,680
But then the next thing available was like Hornet Mansion or

1645
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,160
no big thunder like three hours later.

1646
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,800
And then so two hours after

1647
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,600
I booked that one, I could book Hornet Mansion.

1648
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,960
So ended up doing like later in the day, doing Big Thunder Mountain Railroad

1649
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,960
and then Hornet Mansion.

1650
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,000
OK. Were you checking?

1651
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,960
I was checking. OK.

1652
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,360
And stuff was showing up and going away.

1653
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,480
Good. We're still checking.

1654
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,080
Because you can. Yeah.

1655
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,800
Because with that old system and I assume the new system, you can like refresh,

1656
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,360
refresh because people get rid of the attract, like get rid of their reservations.

1657
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,160
Yeah. So you can sometimes score enough for is hard to as much easier for people.

1658
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,680
Harder to get because there's just a lot less.

1659
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,440
It's just a lot more people. Yeah.

1660
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,920
So but then it was a matter of like, well, now we have to kill Todd.

1661
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,040
Like I think there was a slight gap between

1662
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,000
one, a couple of like Big Thunder and Hornet Mansion.

1663
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,640
We're like, well, we have to I guess we'll see all the presidents.

1664
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,760
We need to kill a little bit of time.

1665
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,040
Yeah. You have to go pay your respect to.

1666
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,040
Got to pay the respect.

1667
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,640
Forty six great men.

1668
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,520
Every one of them.

1669
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,400
My brother went, I will sit in this rocking chair next to the thief.

1670
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,720
He was like, this is not worth it.

1671
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,160
Wow. To wear a mask for 25 minutes indoors.

1672
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,360
To watch this show.

1673
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,640
I don't want to see.

1674
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,600
I like this. I like this opinion.

1675
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,800
I respect this opinion.

1676
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,080
He called it just because, yeah, I mean,

1677
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,360
I don't know that that park.

1678
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,720
It's funny. I think Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, where the I guess we went on

1679
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,560
Tuesday and Wednesday. So, yeah, less crowds those days.

1680
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,560
Magic Kingdom, you you realize when you're there, like, oh, there's so much to do here.

1681
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,240
Animal Kingdom, you have the opposite reaction where you're like,

1682
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,720
there's so very little to do here.

1683
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,680
And we just kind of bucked up and, you know, waited in the Avatar standby lines.

1684
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,760
OK. And then it started to rain very hard.

1685
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,720
And that Pandora, huh?

1686
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,600
On Pandora. Yeah, it rained.

1687
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,160
Yeah. When you were on Pandora, it rained.

1688
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,240
Yes. Are you trying to clarify?

1689
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,320
Is there a joke you're getting?

1690
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,840
I was just wondering, is it you said it rained when you were waiting in the Avatar?

1691
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,120
As we were walking into the line for

1692
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,800
I was wondering for Navi River Journey, it started to pour rain.

1693
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,520
Yeah. OK. So I just wonder, like, does it does it rain there?

1694
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,480
I just want to know what's the climate like?

1695
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,120
Yeah, I guess because the way of water is part of it is going to be part of it.

1696
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:07,160
It is. And oh, we got to use the halfway through the flight of passage line

1697
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,040
bathrooms were real. Oh, I didn't do that.

1698
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,640
Yeah. How were those?

1699
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,360
They were they were serviceable.

1700
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,080
They were very practical and a godsend for me, at least.

1701
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1702
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,880
Well, I just remembered I just remember that I got to do the secret star

1703
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,760
tours bathroom when I went. Oh, yeah.

1704
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,200
That VIP tour. Where is that?

1705
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,200
You did not access the public.

1706
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,080
There's like a little door on the side by like the overflow queue.

1707
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,400
You can just go in there for employees only.

1708
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,600
And then the guy let us use the secret little bathroom.

1709
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,480
C3PO. Yep.

1710
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,080
Peed on C3PO or peed in our 2D2.

1711
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,840
Isn't that already? Yeah, wait, that's not a runner.

1712
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,760
That's our history with. Yeah, we had the P rope.

1713
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,560
I already there was a. Yeah. What was it?

1714
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,280
What was the name of it? I don't know.

1715
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,960
It was a good joke. Go back and listen to it. Yeah, you'll find it.

1716
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,720
Jason, something that you we were not texting you a ton on this time.

1717
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,160
We're giving you so can you bang the wall for the cricket?

1718
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Oh, yeah. Yes. So sorry. Here.

1719
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,720
Wow. Now, it didn't work that time.

1720
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,000
Didn't work that time. Hmm.

1721
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,360
Do it louder.

1722
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,200
Nope. I think like one big one, maybe is OK.

1723
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,200
May hmm.

1724
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,080
This is a real genie situation where sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

1725
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,680
One of the one of the few text messages that was exchanged involves the Epcot

1726
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,640
so does location club cool.

1727
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,480
Oh, which resulted in the in the text exchange where

1728
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,920
is there is discussion of maybe we do an episode about Club Cool.

1729
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,080
And so I was curious if you had done it that way, that would refresh your memory

1730
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,480
of the soda attraction.

1731
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,360
And what you text back was, oh, yeah, we did it.

1732
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,720
We you know, we made it by the skin of our teeth,

1733
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,760
which I just I just immediately responded.

1734
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,040
I like that getting to Club Cool is a skin of your teeth scenario.

1735
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,320
I mean, I was a white knuckle.

1736
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,160
Guys, I'm the do.

1737
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,320
Have I not said it enough?

1738
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,160
These are sodas from around the world.

1739
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,920
If we don't haul ass, we're only going to drink two or three of them.

1740
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,880
I mean, look, like everything else, when we were down there, there was a line

1741
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,640
to get in because, you know, there were still lingering covid protocol.

1742
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,280
There were still some spacing or like

1743
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,360
the Tower of Terror TV room was pretty empty when they sent us in.

1744
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,840
But Club Cool, your party got its own soda fountain.

1745
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,800
And there was like soda fountains.

1746
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,480
Everyone was kind of spaced out.

1747
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,160
This is so you could kind of take your time. Wow.

1748
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,200
But you can put your mouth on the thing.

1749
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,320
I just did load up on sour plum.

1750
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,600
Yeah, China's sour plum juice.

1751
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,360
It's just sour plum.

1752
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,800
Delicious sour plum.

1753
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,960
We'll get into that more on a future episode.

1754
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,160
But get ready to get a special VIP

1755
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,800
invite to a certain cool.

1756
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,800
We really shouldn't have done that.

1757
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,520
People are like running their cars off the road.

1758
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,160
Now they got so excited. Sure.

1759
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,680
When when?

1760
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,760
It wasn't even I mean, the park was open for a few more hours.

1761
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,400
We were just all exhausted.

1762
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,360
And it started raining again.

1763
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,720
And the crowds had kind of picked up.

1764
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,600
So it wasn't a skin of your teeth situation.

1765
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,280
It was the end of our patience, I guess.

1766
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,240
My dad had already bailed like 30 minutes before.

1767
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,200
He had already gone back to the hotel.

1768
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,160
Explain to him that you get to drink sodas from around the world.

1769
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,160
I could I could I don't I think his eyes would have glazed over

1770
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:39,560
as soon as I said, did you know, though, I had to deal with 36 years of me going,

1771
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,240
like, did you know, like the facts?

1772
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,520
Well, yeah, that's what like if you asked my dad, if my dad walked in

1773
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,880
and you said, what are your feelings about Disney World?

1774
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,560
He would say positive things.

1775
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,520
Boy, wonderful trips we all had as a family.

1776
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,760
And that boy just what a sprawling operation.

1777
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,760
It's great.

1778
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,480
And then you peppered him with like one percent of what we talk about

1779
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,680
every week on this podcast.

1780
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,400
He would just fall asleep on the concrete.

1781
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,400
He would drop like a fly and say,

1782
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:13,160
likes Disney World, but oh, my God, the the the Mundania, the Arcania.

1783
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,200
But that's but that's dads.

1784
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,280
That's not for them.

1785
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,000
That's just their generation didn't get caught in this stuff.

1786
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,480
They were busy being successful.

1787
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,240
Oh, no, my dad and mom definitely got caught in this stuff a little.

1788
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,640
But but I mean, his complaints were more like, you know,

1789
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,640
it was a pain in the ass to be on hold for two hours to make dining reservations.

1790
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,640
30, 40 days before we left.

1791
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:48,080
Yeah, it was like there was some stuff with the the hotel.

1792
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,240
I mean, the beach, we were in the beach club villas,

1793
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,280
which was the vacation club, like the the suites.

1794
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,560
Just just to have a little extra space.

1795
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,840
And it's an odd thing at Disney.

1796
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,360
Like you may as it's usually often less to book a suite

1797
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,640
than book two hotel rooms next to each other.

1798
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,640
That makes sense. Yeah.

1799
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,280
Yeah. So there's just not that many of them.

1800
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,000
That's the only thing you kind of limited availability.

1801
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,760
Grab them way ahead of time. Sure. Yeah.

1802
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,320
And the the vacation club members get them first dibs on them

1803
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,960
and then whatever inventory is left, they put up on sale.

1804
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,680
So so like there was some weird like,

1805
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,640
I don't know, some finagling with that.

1806
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,800
I mean, we figured it out.

1807
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,360
But like, I think housekeeping, housekeeping was not making the beds.

1808
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,680
They would like put in new towels and like,

1809
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,400
I think they referred to it as a light cleaning.

1810
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,680
But it's like, oh, we're not making the beds right now.

1811
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,920
And it's like, oh, oh, OK.

1812
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,160
That's a pretty common.

1813
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,280
I don't know if it's a covid era thing or just or a waste thing.

1814
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,240
I feel like I've encountered that before.

1815
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,920
Well, I heard Disney would like they don't change the sheets

1816
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,400
unless you're there for like a really long stay.

1817
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,320
But like I had usually like encounter like they at least made.

1818
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,520
I don't know. But but it's beds.

1819
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,640
Shit list one runners, shit list to make the beds.

1820
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,240
There are three.

1821
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,800
Castle doesn't look as good as tower.

1822
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,280
You want that tuck on the side?

1823
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,200
You want that talk on the side?

1824
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,280
You love to get tucked in.

1825
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,080
You try. You wish Snoopy was there.

1826
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh, also the towels.

1827
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,440
I think this is common across all the hotels.

1828
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,840
The towels are awful, like sandpaper.

1829
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,560
Yeah. Treats, treats.

1830
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,720
Yeah. I think I ate.

1831
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,560
Wait, I'd like to back up and do tells like a lot longer

1832
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,520
and then a little more about the Tylenol.

1833
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,240
No, no, no treats.

1834
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,920
The three T's of the episode.

1835
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,840
I'm trying to think what we ate at Topolito Terrace one night.

1836
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,480
More tea.

1837
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,840
That's very good.

1838
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,880
That's on the roof.

1839
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,400
That's on the top floor of the new Riviera Hotel. OK.

1840
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,720
We had like salted caramel gelato.

1841
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,520
OK, then like deconstructed like.

1842
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,560
I think it was like a peanut butter pie or deconstructed like.

1843
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,000
Oh, it was pumpkin mousse.

1844
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,280
It was deconstructed.

1845
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,480
So it's the same like crumbs and then like a sauce.

1846
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,520
And then like little puddles or little.

1847
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,000
Make your own basically.

1848
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,440
They basically make your own.

1849
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,520
Should be called the ingredients of as opposed to like deconstructed,

1850
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,680
which sounds cooler. Yeah.

1851
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,960
OK, so those are do you split as a group?

1852
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,360
Yes. OK. Yeah.

1853
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,960
Kind of split, split those.

1854
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,360
When Jane and I were at Animal Kingdom,

1855
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,880
oh, saw kite tails, saw the infamous.

1856
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,120
Oh, kite tails.

1857
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:42,960
Which they run.

1858
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,520
They do run in moderate rain and light drizzle.

1859
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,080
OK, it was fun.

1860
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,720
It is. People love kite tails.

1861
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,880
Yeah, because they kind of dive bomb.

1862
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,280
They're these big kites and they kind of die.

1863
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,560
They get to the ground.

1864
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,040
They look like Disney characters.

1865
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,760
I think I didn't know what the kites are.

1866
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,720
OK, they look like Disney.

1867
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,440
Puma's in the air and he's flying around

1868
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,920
because he's attached to the back of a boat of a jet ski.

1869
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,480
Yeah, like a jet ski.

1870
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,080
Excuse me. Jet ski kite flying.

1871
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,720
And then to get the thing out of the air, they just let it crash

1872
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,080
into the ground, basically lands really hard.

1873
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,320
Gently. And this has been noticed.

1874
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,600
And people love it.

1875
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,560
But people seem to like the show too.

1876
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1877
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,680
So and you saw them.

1878
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,600
I saw them.

1879
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,600
And also we went to Chester and Hester's Dinarama,

1880
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,200
the big carnival game area.

1881
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:33,440
OK. And I won Jane Stuff Triceratops.

1882
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:38,280
Hey, looks like the ride vehicle of the Triceratops spin

1883
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,040
ride. OK.

1884
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,480
And I got it on my first ball.

1885
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,640
That's Primo boyfriend shit, man.

1886
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,520
Pretty good. That's what you want.

1887
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,480
Well, on that day, Jason had big dino energy.

1888
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Big dino. Hey, there we go.

1889
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,720
You know, she tried the second gate.

1890
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:57,680
She didn't she she bought a ticket, didn't win anything.

1891
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,360
And I was like, I'll try.

1892
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,520
And I got it all.

1893
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,680
And I surprised myself. Played it cool.

1894
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,880
Let me try. Let me do a little this.

1895
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,800
Oh, look at that.

1896
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,000
I just won you something.

1897
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:13,160
Well, she she she did make the mistake when we were walking through that area.

1898
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,160
She was like, do you want to play a carnival game?

1899
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,480
And I went, no, not really.

1900
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,920
And it started to keep walking.

1901
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,880
And she's like, I was like, pause for a second.

1902
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,640
I was like, do you want to play a carnival game?

1903
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,600
Very good. Very good.

1904
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,720
Look at these two.

1905
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,840
She had put a lot up with a lot of my belly aching about my knees at that point.

1906
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:35,920
So I felt I my my emotional intelligence was slowly starting to come back after the

1907
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,280
sometimes excruciating pain.

1908
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,920
Oh, my God. You're like Terry Funk and Beyond the Mat.

1909
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,760
Oh, yeah. Getting assessed by the doctor.

1910
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,880
And they're like, I mean, I rallied.

1911
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,120
Hey, I know. I I shook it off after a day or two.

1912
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,200
So wow. It's like I've heard a lot about your knees.

1913
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,200
Can we talk about something else? Yeah.

1914
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,000
Well, Disney Genie, I don't think the system works at all.

1915
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,840
It actually did work.

1916
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,200
Genie Plus worked in his old lightning manes were mixed bag.

1917
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,440
But I didn't like paying for it.

1918
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,320
I mean, that was my dad's big complaint is it's the complaint everyone has.

1919
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,000
Like this used to be free.

1920
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,720
This used to be included.

1921
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,000
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1922
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,240
And now you have to pay for it.

1923
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,720
And we were like biding our time where it's like, well, we're staying at the deluxe

1924
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,320
hotel like, do you think they'll they should just toss it in if you're buying a package

1925
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:29,960
or at least maybe this is coming during the slower times like, you know, like the park

1926
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,680
hopper where it gets cheaper the more days you buy.

1927
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:38,400
It's like maybe by a discounted version of Genie Plus, it might make the you know,

1928
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,760
I think all as I said, I probably said this before this all the systems are being set

1929
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:47,280
up now to make them flexible enough to get as much money as possible out.

1930
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,520
So if that's to keep selling, I feel like maybe they won't do something like that.

1931
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,160
But we'll see. Maybe.

1932
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,240
Yeah, we'll see what the backlash was.

1933
01:29:55,240 --> 01:30:01,200
There were a lot of there were a lot of guest relations.

1934
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:07,120
Blue umbrella stands set up everywhere and everyone was having problems or was confused

1935
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,160
by Disney, Genie.

1936
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:15,520
OK. And the guest relations at the front of the park, because I I knew I went I went to

1937
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,400
the guest relations on the last full day we were there to cancel a dining reservation

1938
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:26,000
because I knew the trick. If you told them it was due to a health issue, they won't charge

1939
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,120
you the fee for canceling.

1940
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,320
So did you say my knees hurt?

1941
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,600
Well, I was saying what Jane was hip was hurting at that point.

1942
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,280
And then my dad had a stomach ache.

1943
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,760
We all had started.

1944
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,560
You guys.

1945
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,920
The deconstructed from the deconstructed.

1946
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,240
Make it back in one piece.

1947
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,760
This was a one piece.

1948
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:51,680
I mean, by the end of the week, we were just like, I don't have an appetite to keep eating

1949
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,600
theme like the mix of theme park food and nice food.

1950
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,240
It was just like that's bullshit.

1951
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:04,360
That's when you stand up and you say, I will take one colonial dinner for four for one.

1952
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,800
We're all getting that's even though we're all at one table before the flight.

1953
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,120
We're all. Yes.

1954
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,520
That's when you that's when you go.

1955
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,680
You were there for work.

1956
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,160
I was there for work.

1957
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,840
And then you don't even use stuff.

1958
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,280
They aren't a bread meant for four people.

1959
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,480
I opted for something.

1960
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,960
A plate of fried clams and a side of macaroni and cheese.

1961
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,680
Something healthy.

1962
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,520
Fried clams.

1963
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,640
Does that count as a treat?

1964
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,000
Fried clams.

1965
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,400
They're fried.

1966
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,640
So fried, though.

1967
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,080
They are fried.

1968
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,440
Yeah.

1969
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,680
So that's a less healthy way to prepare anything.

1970
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,680
We had.

1971
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:43,720
OK, this was a 50th anniversary special in one of the animal kingdom stands.

1972
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,960
I think it's at a few stands.

1973
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:50,560
They take a Mickey ice cream bar and then they dip it in like a blueberry, like a crispy

1974
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,000
shell on top of that.

1975
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:52,720
I like that.

1976
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,240
And then cover it with sprinkles.

1977
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,640
Oh, give me a show me a photo of that.

1978
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,840
And then give me a bloggers video of that.

1979
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,760
I realized, uh, Mr.

1980
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,160
Sheridan, Paging Mr.

1981
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:09,880
Sheridan, they had cinnamon, cinnamon sugar pecans, which I'm a sucker for cinnamon

1982
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,840
sugar pecans.

1983
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,640
And they're like, sorry, we're all out.

1984
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,520
We only have almonds.

1985
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,920
But if you go to this stand and like down the way, they might have them.

1986
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,640
And they did.

1987
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,360
What a story.

1988
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,760
What a thrilling story.

1989
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,800
I'm a sucker for cinnamon sugar pecans.

1990
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,600
But when I get there and they only have almonds, that's worse than the coffee inserts

1991
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,840
not matching on comedians and cars getting coffee.

1992
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,960
Almonds are utilitarian, not and not meant as a treat like the sweet, tasty pecan.

1993
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,640
Almonds are functional.

1994
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,120
Almonds are functional.

1995
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,640
Sad news.

1996
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,440
Here's my here's my real Rooney.

1997
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,800
When I tried to get the Uncle Whirlpool bathtub Sunday, I was informed it was sold out.

1998
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,240
It had been for a while.

1999
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,360
Oh, man.

2000
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,760
That's the reason you went down there.

2001
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,640
That was brutal.

2002
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,080
That was brutal to find that out.

2003
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,920
That was so excited for the Uncle Whirlpool bathtub Sunday.

2004
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,080
Yeah.

2005
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,600
So Uncle Whirlpool, the character from Carousel of Progress had his own Sunday.

2006
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,360
It was just a bathtub with ice cream in it.

2007
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:05,720
Yeah.

2008
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,240
A little plastic bathtub, but I guess it was very popular.

2009
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,040
I settled for a Christmas sugar cookie milkshake.

2010
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,560
Oh, wow.

2011
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,160
Pretty good.

2012
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,600
So settle.

2013
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah.

2014
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,920
So was it crushed sugar cookies in a big vanilla milkshake?

2015
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,080
I think so.

2016
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:24,040
Or it's a little it had a little bit of something.

2017
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,840
I think it was mostly like sugar cookie, like soft serve.

2018
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,400
Was it in it?

2019
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,440
Was it in any fun thing or anything or no?

2020
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,360
No, it's just a cup.

2021
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,320
Oh, it had a big like cardboard, like like a boba straw, but it was like thick cardboard.

2022
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:42,320
It didn't melt like those straws sometimes are like so thin.

2023
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,640
Sometimes the paper, they have a lot of paper straws.

2024
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,000
Yeah.

2025
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:51,600
One day I had a Mickey pretzel and I asked for a sprite, settle my stomach.

2026
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
One large sprite, please.

2027
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:01,480
Well, no, I just wanted a bottle that I could reach like a bottle.

2028
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:04,080
And he went, it's a 30 ounce cup with no lid.

2029
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,320
Is that OK?

2030
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,320
Oh, because you wanted a plastic bottle.

2031
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,520
I want a plastic bottle.

2032
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,320
OK.

2033
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:09,800
You should.

2034
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,440
Did they sell ginger ale anywhere?

2035
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,680
Well, I kept I did.

2036
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,880
I had that thought, but no.

2037
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,480
Not really.

2038
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,640
Outside of the bars, maybe.

2039
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,560
Why doesn't Disney World have ginger ale anymore?

2040
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,560
I have ginger ale.

2041
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,120
Could be pecan flavored.

2042
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,720
I'd be a sucker for that.

2043
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,920
When I was a boy growing up, we had pecan flavored ginger ale every morning for breakfast.

2044
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,640
We milked it from a cow.

2045
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,160
It would settle our stomachs.

2046
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,680
Two or three mornings in a row, I had a baked good called a chocolate twist at the hotel.

2047
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,680
That was delicious.

2048
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:40,480
What is that?

2049
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,160
It was like chocolate chips and it was like a kind of like a chocolate croissant,

2050
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,560
like long croissant kind of thing.

2051
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,200
But then it also had like a glaze on top.

2052
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,040
So chocolate chips, a chocolate glaze on some sort of like a pastry.

2053
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:55,520
Yeah.

2054
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,280
OK, seems pretty good.

2055
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,360
Yeah, that was a breakfast.

2056
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,040
Hmm.

2057
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,160
That was your breakfast.

2058
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,440
That was breakfast with coffee.

2059
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:01,880
Yeah.

2060
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,080
OK, regular coffee.

2061
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,840
Uh, I drink my coffee with cream.

2062
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,520
OK, but not like peanut butter coffee, I'm saying.

2063
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,840
No, not peanut butter coffee.

2064
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,760
Don't don't take the knife any further.

2065
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,320
I want you not to sleep well tonight because you're regretting that not going to Gideon's.

2066
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,280
Do you understand?

2067
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,640
I spend every day watching videos.

2068
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,440
Pouring to live through your Gideon's experience.

2069
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,720
Well, I guess I'll just have to go home and drown my sorrows in Reese's Christmas trees

2070
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,320
and white chocolate Oreos, which I purchased at Target.

2071
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,200
Oh my God.

2072
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,760
It came back from the strip.

2073
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,360
But I didn't have any sweets in the house.

2074
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,280
How big of a bag of Reese's did you get?

2075
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:43,760
Huh?

2076
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,560
Reese's trees, those little trees.

2077
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,440
Like, yeah, yeah.

2078
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:47,760
Yeah.

2079
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,960
The shape ones are like surprisingly, I like regular a lot too.

2080
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,160
The shapes are better.

2081
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:52,600
Yeah.

2082
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,680
Is that because of the different distribution between?

2083
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,480
Scott, you know, we're talking about the distribution between Reese's.

2084
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,680
You know how they have like around Halloween, they have like a Easter,

2085
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,960
they have like an Easter egg shape.

2086
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,280
Reese's peanut butter cup.

2087
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,960
Yeah, I guess so.

2088
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,480
And they have a tree at Christmas.

2089
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,160
And those are for some reason more delicious than the regular cups.

2090
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,960
You're talking about distribution.

2091
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,440
I mean, peanut to chocolate distribution.

2092
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,000
It's more the eggs are superior.

2093
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:20,240
I if you'll recall, I came back from a break in recording once with like three

2094
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:27,120
packages of Reese's peanut butter eggs because Carly was Carly was on this second

2095
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,280
one. I was like, would you like a Reese's peanut butter egg?

2096
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,000
We get it.

2097
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,520
Being a gentleman again, being a gentleman again, winning prizes left and right,

2098
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,000
taking my girlfriend on the family vacation.

2099
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,760
Oh, the ultimate man.

2100
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,640
Well, you've seen it.

2101
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:44,720
You're a gentleman for us seemingly because it seems like something is in a bag.

2102
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,520
Oh, yes.

2103
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,920
I had to bring you both gifts.

2104
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,640
Oh, boy.

2105
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,920
I like that we do this.

2106
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,480
If it was a Gideon's cookie and it was a fake out, I would like I would like scream

2107
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,120
like I was an Oprah's favorite things.

2108
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,160
Of course I went, Michael.

2109
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,120
Do you think I'm a fool?

2110
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:01,920
As if Oprah said, yeah, you got a car.

2111
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,480
The same.

2112
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,000
Well, before we get to the end, we'll say that's more positive now.

2113
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,800
More towels.

2114
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,240
So I've got a top five prepared.

2115
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:13,960
Oh, go ahead.

2116
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:18,320
Yeah, this is the top five reactionary clothing items I saw.

2117
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,960
Oh, no, no, I see.

2118
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,280
I see what's going back.

2119
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:29,640
Number five shirt with a vertical American flag that just said relentlessly patriotic

2120
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,080
under it.

2121
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,040
Okay, good.

2122
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,400
Right.

2123
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:31,720
Yeah.

2124
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,920
If you're that, then why are you hanging the flag the wrong way?

2125
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:40,280
Number four shirt with vertical American flag with the thin blue line stripe.

2126
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,080
And next to that, it said the word grandpa.

2127
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:55,280
Number three, the two guys with masks that said this mask is as useless as Joe Biden.

2128
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,320
Okay.

2129
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,400
You wear it and bought it.

2130
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,960
They wore it because they needed their treats.

2131
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:02,600
They need it.

2132
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,640
They had to have this.

2133
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,400
They couldn't.

2134
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,800
They still had to get to Disney World.

2135
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,160
They suffered through.

2136
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,120
We are that.

2137
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,880
We basically are the Boston Tea Party.

2138
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,120
This country is founded on rebel rousing, like going to a place where masks are

2139
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,240
required and getting the mask because we have to.

2140
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:24,800
But there's protests on the mask of the president and the mask that I paid for

2141
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,200
with my own dollars.

2142
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:26,720
Yeah.

2143
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:26,960
They were.

2144
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,160
What a statement.

2145
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,400
They were so proud of themselves.

2146
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,800
They were so proud of themselves.

2147
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,440
They high fived all day.

2148
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:33,880
Probably runners.

2149
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,320
Yeah.

2150
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,520
It sounds like runners to me.

2151
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,600
That was the funny.

2152
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,000
That was the additional funny details.

2153
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,400
Those two guys wearing those masks looked busted.

2154
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,280
They look like shit.

2155
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,320
Number two.

2156
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,880
Is the guys Borat lived with?

2157
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:54,640
Number two, the tween girl in an I survived liberal indoctrination t-shirt.

2158
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,120
Wow.

2159
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,320
Gee, Jesus.

2160
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,200
Just thinking about the whole process of like, gotta make sure to pack this for

2161
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,480
my Epcot day.

2162
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:05,960
Yeah.

2163
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,120
They probably right for inside the magic.

2164
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,000
Also,

2165
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,320
why do I not name it?

2166
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,080
What did I never.

2167
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,440
I love harassing.

2168
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,840
If you don't know, there is this right wing Twitter account that used to cover

2169
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,880
theme park stuff, but now exclusively treats about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.

2170
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:28,680
And I think I now exclusively reply to their tweets and I can't stop.

2171
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,480
And I don't know why they don't block me.

2172
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:36,480
I love when my likes get so I get so many more likes than their original post.

2173
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:36,880
Right.

2174
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,720
I feel like I'm at Gideon's.

2175
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,040
What?

2176
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,360
I feel like I'm at Gideon's.

2177
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,640
I feel like I'm at Gideon's.

2178
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,640
I feel like I'm at Gideon's.

2179
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,640
I feel like I'm at Gideon's.

2180
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,640
That's that's my magical moment.

2181
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:51,360
They had one the other day that was because the news story was like Kathleen.

2182
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:58,360
No, Patty Jenkins and Ryan Johnson Star Wars projects have possibly stalled due

2183
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,920
to difference created differences with Lucasfilm.

2184
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,320
And her headline was like, fans are celebrating.

2185
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,720
At these projects have stalled.

2186
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:11,760
And I'm like, at the end of the trilogy, the ding, ding, ding, ding, cut to every

2187
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,320
planet.

2188
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:21,240
And the number one reactionary clothing item I saw at Disney World, the shirt that

2189
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:28,440
read family, faith, friends, flag, firearms, five things you don't mess with.

2190
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,160
As if just the list would have been fine.

2191
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,400
You don't need further.

2192
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,560
I my my guess is that at the end of that list, it's not going to say things I hate.

2193
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:46,320
Things I could easily live without.

2194
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,840
Like, I get that you like the family and the firearms.

2195
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,280
Just just in in line.

2196
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:56,520
And I'm just like, have my phone out, like in the notes at just trying to get this

2197
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,880
down. Jane, like, looks over, sees what I'm doing and she's worried.

2198
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,320
She also starts just to make sure we get it.

2199
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,080
I'll go from the front.

2200
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:05,880
You go from the back.

2201
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,320
Go for it.

2202
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,240
No, this is all a copy to cover.

2203
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,480
I mean, yeah, I.

2204
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:17,360
I don't know. I mean, truly, what you said before, all of these people, there was a

2205
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:22,160
moment with every shirt or mask that you described where it's being gingerly folded

2206
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,160
into a suitcase.

2207
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:27,520
Can't forget this like a vacation.

2208
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,520
Can't wait because I will say I was down there on Veterans Day.

2209
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,400
This wasn't just Veterans Day sightings.

2210
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:38,800
You know, some people had normal like just a basic American flag or an army shirt.

2211
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,280
Like, no, this was throughout the week.

2212
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,520
I would see these things and I wrote, oh, I'm sure.

2213
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,480
Hey, look, I saw stuff like this at Universal Studios Hollywood on, you know,

2214
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,160
June 3rd.

2215
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,240
Yeah, like this.

2216
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,880
It's around here, too.

2217
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,400
Sure. I mean, there were other like unique shirts, like the person who had a drinking

2218
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:01,840
around the world shirt with each pavilion and a checkbox and what looked like very

2219
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,080
fresh Sharpie marks on each checkbox on the back.

2220
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,760
Well, they're there. My salute.

2221
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,120
That's that's a patriot.

2222
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:08,960
Those are the heroes.

2223
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,640
The shirt that said talk Disney to me instead of talk dirty to me.

2224
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,280
That one. Well, that's a shirt for all of us, I'd say.

2225
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,960
Yeah, great. Disney does.

2226
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,240
How about that? Good.

2227
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:23,520
Great. You can go to any Disney gift shop and buy it because they're the ones selling

2228
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,960
it. Wow. Really?

2229
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,560
Like a crap Etsy thing.

2230
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,760
Well, now I'm a little bit afraid of what Disney is becoming.

2231
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:35,600
Yeah. Even it's a little it's innuendo for them.

2232
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,120
Yeah, it's innuendo for them.

2233
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:44,960
And the larger merchandise overview that I got, it was pretty much everything was

2234
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,520
available. It was a little more homogenous than we were down there a couple of years

2235
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,480
ago. Right.

2236
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,960
Yeah, you were. But that said, I couldn't come back empty handed without stuff for

2237
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,080
you guys. Oh, boy.

2238
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:04,720
So, you know, as I said earlier, happy of late at Disney Plus Day.

2239
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,120
Oh, you were there for Disney Plus Day.

2240
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,800
Oh, yeah.

2241
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,800
It's a pin. It's a really big pin.

2242
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,600
Now, Disney Plus Day.

2243
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:23,600
Now it'll be written about in the history books, but in case you don't read, in case

2244
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:30,400
you're avoiding being indoctrinated, like that shirt where the this was if you are a

2245
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:33,920
Disney Plus subscriber, you got an extra half hour in the parks.

2246
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,920
And that was that in Disneyland, too.

2247
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,840
Oh, yeah. I'm not sure.

2248
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,440
But I thought about that.

2249
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,840
You know, you're there for this thing.

2250
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,560
It's probably going to make it even more crowded.

2251
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:48,760
Oh, yeah. Because then what happens is because they don't want to leave the hotel guests

2252
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,520
out. The hotel guests got in an hour early.

2253
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:55,720
OK. And then the Disney Plus subscribers got in half an hour early.

2254
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:01,160
So that means by the time you get into the park, Rises of Resistance is already 120

2255
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:07,000
minutes. So, yeah, so that that was probably why it was especially bad at

2256
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,840
Hollywood Studios that second day was that all the Disney Plus Day stuff.

2257
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,760
I heard an interesting thing.

2258
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:23,160
The Star Wars stuff at the merchandise out sells like the the rest of the merchandise

2259
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:27,880
like three to one, I think, at Hollywood Studios of like the regular park.

2260
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,600
You're. Yeah, the regular park.

2261
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,800
It seems right. Sure. Yeah.

2262
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,400
Very popular.

2263
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,960
But we now we can always remember.

2264
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,920
Never forget.

2265
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,720
Eleven, twelve.

2266
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,000
Never forget Disney Plus Day 20.

2267
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,760
Yeah. Twenty. Never forget to celebrate the stories you love.

2268
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,800
And you know what?

2269
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,360
If there's a story you love, tell them now in case anything happens.

2270
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,480
You don't get to celebrate it.

2271
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:54,680
Leave a review date if something happened, you can celebrate the stories

2272
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,280
you love anymore. Leave a review of prop culture before.

2273
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,400
These are just as prop culture Mickey stickers.

2274
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,560
They were given out a lot of Mickey stickers everywhere.

2275
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:05,640
I think. OK. Mitigate the crowds.

2276
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,240
Calm down. You got to hand those to us directly.

2277
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,200
Give some give those to your child.

2278
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,360
Oh, thank you, Mike.

2279
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,600
You can give them to yourself.

2280
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,280
Not a sticker fan, honestly.

2281
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,120
But then, of course, the the PSD resistance.

2282
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,360
I got to the rise of the resistance.

2283
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,080
You each got one of these. Oh, oh.

2284
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,520
We had wrapped up.

2285
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,560
Is that Star Wars packaging?

2286
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,040
Hmm. Hmm. Can't tell.

2287
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,240
Just looks like, OK, let's see.

2288
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,600
Yeah. Oh, OK.

2289
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,640
Oh, God, Jason almost.

2290
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,080
Oh, and you know, I've done something in the on a random.

2291
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,840
Yeah, that's another thing my son likes is random PVC pipes.

2292
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,760
Yeah, I get that out before we started recording.

2293
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,680
Oh, yeah, I can feel this is OK.

2294
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,640
Oh, boy.

2295
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,040
I haven't gotten to it yet.

2296
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:58,160
It is a little bell.

2297
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,160
It's bad. Oh, you tweeted about that.

2298
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,640
Oh, this is red, actually.

2299
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,320
So what the good merchandise

2300
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,040
that they had going, it's called the vault collection.

2301
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,960
It's all like replicas of like early merchandise.

2302
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,960
Yeah, yeah, this is good.

2303
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,160
So I had to bring back the gift you would either receive from

2304
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,200
or give to your grandmother

2305
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,680
when you went to Disney World in the early days of the park.

2306
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,760
Absolutely. Yes.

2307
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,440
This little it's a white bell with gold trim

2308
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:32,560
and a side view of the castle that feels very 70s in its design.

2309
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:36,920
And you know what this like I often think about like, where did I

2310
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:41,720
where did this like endless fascination with Disney World come from for me?

2311
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:45,400
Like, when did I just like fall in love with the place

2312
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,440
or know I needed to go there?

2313
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:49,680
And I remember that I had disposable Dixie cups to wash,

2314
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,600
but brush my teeth and then rinse with.

2315
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,400
And there was there are Dixie cups with essentially this picture

2316
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,920
and this style of picture, like kind of like,

2317
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,280
you know, limited color scheme side view of the castle.

2318
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:05,760
And I just I would brush my teeth every night when I was six and go,

2319
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,040
what is that place, mommy?

2320
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,440
And well, we'll take you there someday.

2321
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,160
Truly, it was these cups.

2322
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:15,360
I'd flip out if the cups existed, if if if these

2323
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:22,040
were ebayable. But so this this kind of gift just takes me back to that

2324
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,360
where I first was like, I must see this castle and I must go

2325
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,360
and then go again and again and again and then have a podcast

2326
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,560
where we like complain about the things that they're

2327
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,240
they're doing near the castle that we don't like.

2328
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,200
And anyway, all that to say, thank you.

2329
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,760
This is thank you very much.

2330
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,920
Very much. Yeah.

2331
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,880
Oh, no. A great trip.

2332
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,160
Some, you know, crazy crowds.

2333
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,720
And some crazy app stuff.

2334
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,600
But we had a nice time overall.

2335
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,160
Yeah. And some crazy appetizers as well.

2336
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,720
You're about the clams. Oh, oh, yeah.

2337
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,880
I think we try to add Topolino. We had appetizer.

2338
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,320
Escargot. Oh, really? Yeah.

2339
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,960
Well, ooh, la, la. Look at this. Pinkies up.

2340
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,600
Look at this.

2341
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,800
I didn't know we were nailed to it.

2342
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,240
You can say had at the the food and wine.

2343
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,200
Oh, so you didn't blink at all when I said cricket.

2344
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,560
Yeah, we're talking about bugs here.

2345
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,280
Yeah, I would ask. I've never had Escargot.

2346
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,720
I'm in there twice in this trip.

2347
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,120
Yeah, well, they had a little

2348
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,880
the the France Food and Wine booth

2349
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,760
had a little croissant with Escargot and her butter baked into it.

2350
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:32,520
Oh, how would you treatify Escargot?

2351
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,920
How do you is there if you if you're in a chopped scenario

2352
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,680
and it's the dessert round and you have to incorporate Escargot?

2353
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,360
Well, I think I essentially had the treatify version

2354
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:47,760
at Topolino Terrace because they baked a puff pastry on top.

2355
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,240
So it's soaked in herb butter on the bottom

2356
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,160
and you pull it out of like a muffin tin, essentially.

2357
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:56,040
And then the snail is like on the bottom.

2358
01:48:56,360 --> 01:49:00,200
And then there's a puff pastry on tops and it's like very buttery.

2359
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,200
Wow. Wow. Sounds pretty solid.

2360
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,160
What about Escargot cookie at Gideon's

2361
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:09,360
where it's full of Escargot chunks of Escargot baked into the big cookie?

2362
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,320
I think I think you could.

2363
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:16,240
I mean, if it kind of reminds me the texture of like some mushrooms.

2364
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,640
So I think you could work with that in like a chopped scenario.

2365
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,680
I don't think that would be the worst thing to be given.

2366
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:26,760
OK, it doesn't have an overwhelming flavor on its own,

2367
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,040
but it absorbs flavors. Right.

2368
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,560
So you play around with it.

2369
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,240
Hmm. Do you think we've done it?

2370
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,880
I guess so. Why don't they have Escargot?

2371
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,800
They should have it in everything these days.

2372
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,520
We used to have it in everything when I was a boy.

2373
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:45,000
And the YouTubers need to film the Escargot cookies better.

2374
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,160
I need to see a close up of that mushroom like surface.

2375
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,760
That's what I like.

2376
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:55,360
I want to see the mushroom like sheen from the Escargot in their YouTube videos.

2377
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:00,200
YouTubers, make sure to film the bread surface when you go to these restaurants,

2378
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,760
because that was definitely a high point.

2379
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,880
Numerous places doing interesting bread right now.

2380
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,760
Mr. Morrow needs to eat more interesting bread.

2381
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,720
He's been eating the same type of cupcake for over three months now.

2382
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:17,680
Why don't they sell interesting bells at theme parks anymore?

2383
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,680
Well, what's this? You got it.

2384
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,760
I almost bought the spoon and thimble set, but I thought it was a little busy.

2385
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,520
The spoon was a little over designed.

2386
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,640
That's extreme. That's a ton more grandma for sure.

2387
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:33,160
Yeah, I wanted it. Rooney's not grandma's.

2388
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,280
I wanted a more boring spoon, although I was impressed.

2389
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:40,440
They did have a Disney pin of the spoon and thimble

2390
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,440
and they sold the back scratcher.

2391
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,200
If you remember, they used to have the plastic back scratchers,

2392
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,320
which my grandmother had in her house.

2393
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,840
And so they sold the plastic back scratchers

2394
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,200
and then they also sold the pin of the back scratcher.

2395
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,000
My family's crest was a spoon and a thimble.

2396
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:59,720
Why don't more people have family crests?

2397
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,040
I don't understand it.

2398
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:05,080
You know, in my time, they used to end podcasts by saying,

2399
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,360
you survive podcast the ride.

2400
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,440
Why don't they do that anymore?

2401
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,960
Why don't people find us on the socials at podcast the ride

2402
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,120
or buy shirts at our tea public store? They should.

2403
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,920
And why do why do people never subscribe to our Patreon

2404
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:26,240
at podcast the ride, the second gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast the ride?

2405
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,560
I guess people are just cheap these days or they've spent too much money

2406
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,000
at theme parks on Jeannie and lightning lanes.

2407
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,080
Nothing left to give to the little guys.

2408
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,040
Yeah. Theme park broadcasters and podcasters.

2409
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:42,560
And why don't and why does 75% of the people listening

2410
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,520
do not know that person we're impersonating?

2411
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,480
Why are they not know why?

2412
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,320
We're doing I don't know.

2413
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,280
Why don't people get what this is?

2414
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:55,120
Just because this voice hasn't been on television in 20 years.

2415
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:58,240
I've been in the ground for 20 years.

2416
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:01,080
For some reason, people haven't read up on me.

2417
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,560
I used to be on television weekly.

2418
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:07,880
People are typing old crank into YouTube like they should be

2419
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,200
because of the podcast, the ride curse.

2420
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,280
There's a chance I'll be killed again.

2421
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,920
Somehow people die twice anymore.

2422
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,000
I guess they used to and I was it.

2423
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,080
I wasn't killed the first time, but I just died of natural causes.

2424
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:31,200
All right. Why don't people in podcasts when they're over?

2425
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,280
Why do they keep going?

2426
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,800
Forever.
