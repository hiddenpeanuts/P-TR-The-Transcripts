1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,880
The following podcast and this warning were recorded right before the 2020 election.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,560
You listener are hearing this on Friday.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,780
And no matter where things are at by then, we truly wish we could all process the news

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,000
by doing one thing.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,680
Drinking at Disneyland.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,400
Kate Raft helps us rosÃ© the day away on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,480
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by, well, at least one guy who today is talking about

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,560
the thing he misses literally the most on earth.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,680
That being drinking at Disneyland, I'm Scott Gardner, I'm that guy.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,760
Mike Carlson, I don't know where it lands on your list but I'm sure it's on it.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,400
Mike Carlson It's on it.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,780
It's a nice little parsley on the plate, certainly, but it's maybe not.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
It's not the main course.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
I don't know.

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,300
I want to say it's better than parsley.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Parsley is really superfluous.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,360
Dr. Josh Birk It's not bringing a lot to the table.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,160
It's like mashed potatoes, a good solid mashed potatoes with butter on the plate.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,960
You don't need it, but oh, you're so excited to have it when you're eating dinner.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,380
Mike Carlson Sure, sure, sure.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,080
Not the primary course, but it's there and it's doing its part.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,600
Jason Sheridan, meal analogies or whatever.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,560
Jason Sheridan What was that?

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,760
Mike Carlson Meal analogies or however you feel.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,520
Jason Sheridan I'm just marveling at the upgrade from parsley to mashed potatoes with gravy

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,200
and butter.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Very skyrocketed up the charts.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, I mean, I like it.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,600
I feel like in quarantine, I've become practically a teetotaler, not by any choice, just because

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
it was depressing me or just putting me to sleep.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Jason Sheridan What's teetotaler?

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Mike Carlson Like doesn't drink.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Jason Sheridan I see.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,760
Mike Carlson I think I've had a couple glasses of wine and some white claws and that's been

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
the extent of it.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Jason Sheridan Well, because, you know, sitting in your place and drinking is not as exciting

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:33,080
as wandering around a space, you know, breathing fresh life into this themed environment that

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,760
you love to go so much.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,840
You know, that's the way to do it.

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,720
That's the way to consume alcohol.

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
It's not stuck on your lonesome.

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Mike Carlson Yeah, at the Uva bar outside at 3pm on a weekday afternoon.

46
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,320
Jason Sheridan Hell yes, the greatest.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,000
I should say that this topic comes courtesy of our guest who is from the podcast Hot and

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Rich the podcast.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,800
This podcast is self care and from Jack AM.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Please welcome Kate Raft.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
Kate Raft Hi guys.

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,680
Thanks for having me here.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Jason Sheridan Thanks for coming.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,920
Kate Raft I love drinking at Disneyland.

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,360
So this is a passion of mine.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
Jason Sheridan Is it a meal like for you?

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Is it mashed potatoes?

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,960
Is it a different type of food on the plate?

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,480
Kate Raft I feel like I would say it's like the appetizer.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
It's the appetizer.

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,240
It's a tasting menu of alcohol.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,520
It's like you have to pair it with every aspect of Disneyland.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,320
I would say it's like, you know, it's a hearty appetizer.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,680
Jason Sheridan Oh sure.

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,520
It can eek into dinner that can make you have to order a smaller dinner.

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Kate Raft Exactly.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Like a too big appetizer.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Like wings maybe.

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,920
Jason Sheridan Oh sure.

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,600
That can be sort of inconvenient if you also order the bigger.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Kate Raft Right.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
It's like a wings appetizer.

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
Jason Sheridan Or like a sampler with like the wings and the mozzarella sticks and the

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,640
potato skins and you're like, well I want a little of each and it's like, oh I feel

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,200
disgusting as the entrees.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Kate Raft Right.

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,520
It's like jalapeno poppers too which like you didn't really want but they're in the

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,840
platter so you try a couple and it's heavy.

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Jason Sheridan Those appetizer hangers on.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,720
The ones that like would not fly on their own.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,240
But they know the right friends to get into the appetizer party.

82
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Kate Raft Exactly.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,960
Jason Sheridan Yeah that makes a lot of sense.

84
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,480
I think depending on like Kate would you say when you go to Disneyland it's like is this

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
a like how do you do it?

86
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
How do you structure your day?

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
Kate Raft Okay.

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,880
So like I've had many evolving eras of drinking at Disneyland because I am from Southern California

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,840
so I used to go a lot as an underage person and that so that routine is different than

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,160
my current drinking routine.

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,640
So I guess I should start with the past and just quickly say that I used to bring like

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,200
we would get diet coke bottles and fill them with whiskey and bring them and like go to

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,240
the bathroom and like chug whiskey and like do like shots of it and then go on rides as

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
like teenagers.

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,880
And it was so disgusting but it was really a big part of my life.

96
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
Big part of my youth.

97
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Big part of my youth.

98
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,000
Also sometimes like buy sodas in the park and then secretly they go pour a little flask

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
into it.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,280
That was our method.

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,000
It got really elaborate where I would like sneak alcohol in in new and fun ways.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,100
So there was this one time where I put a flask of whiskey inside a flaming hot Cheetos bag

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,240
and I made like a fake lunch that I packed like a banana into like stuff I wasn't even

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
going to eat but just so that if I had to open my bag or you do have to open your bag

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,880
so they would just see lunch and not a flask and it worked and it was great.

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Oh yeah.

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,960
Now looking back are you like was this overkill?

108
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Was this more about the thrill of the chase?

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Definitely didn't need to do all of that.

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It was not necessary.

111
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Sure.

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
But fun.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
Super fun to do.

114
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Covert operation.

115
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
So fun.

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,640
But I would say like my current thing I love just like a rose starting off with a rose

117
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
in California Adventures.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,320
I like the Lestel Rose that they have there.

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It's like the cheapest one.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
It's great.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,980
Now which are we talking about from that like outdoor from that like Napa area you order

122
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
at the counter.

123
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Yes.

124
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
The counter.

125
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Or is this a sit down situation?

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
The counter is where it's at.

127
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
I like that.

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,260
I also like to go to Carthay, circle the bar there and have like whatever their seasonal

129
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,260
cocktail is they have like different ones for like different holidays.

130
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:57,020
So like the Halloween one is like some apple cider old fashioned type thing.

131
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
That's pretty good.

132
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,620
I don't think I know about the seasonal ones.

133
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,900
They have a Christmas one too I think.

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,620
Do you get different like are there like non drinkable decorations in these typically?

135
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,620
Yes.

136
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,020
I still have them in my freezer.

137
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,060
The Halloween one has light up pumpkins that they put in.

138
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,660
Little mini little jack-o-lanterns that they put inside the drink.

139
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
It's great.

140
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Yes.

141
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,980
I have had this drink and you do get a little plastic keepsake.

142
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
Or is it a skull?

143
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,660
It might be a skull actually.

144
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I can't remember.

145
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
I think it is a skull.

146
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,820
I think it's like a melted little skull or it looks like a candy apple skull kind of

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
a thing.

148
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Yes.

149
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Yes.

150
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,940
You get a lot of, I feel like Disney does a lot of, you get a little toy with your alcohol

151
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,940
sometimes.

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,020
That's a nice thing about Disney.

153
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
I love that.

154
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
For the children.

155
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,620
I mean I feel like Disneyland is not for children personally.

156
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,300
I feel like it is for the drinking aged adult.

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
And I'm fine.

158
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,860
Do you think it's like better even for the drinking aged adult than a child?

159
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,060
I feel like yeah.

160
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,940
I mean I don't have children.

161
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,060
So who's to say if I'll change my mind on this if I ever do.

162
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,260
But I think it's like it rules to be a childless adult.

163
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,820
I know there's so many people that talk shit about childless adults who go to Disneyland

164
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,580
and get drunk.

165
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,260
But I have to just own that that is what I am and it's what I enjoy and fuck off.

166
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Okay.

167
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm going to get wasted and buy like a $20 cocktail that comes with a toy and then I'm

168
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,580
going to keep the toy as a memory of my fun joy.

169
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Hell yes.

170
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,580
And who are you hurting with this?

171
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,100
Is there anyone making this observation?

172
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm always curious like how does this affect you?

173
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,940
Why is this bothering you?

174
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,100
Why are you raining on many parades?

175
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,500
People hate to see just like, people really hate to watch someone like piss their money

176
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
away.

177
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
And Disneyland is so expensive.

178
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:03,180
I think that just upsets people that it's just like a hemorrhage of money that you should

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,300
be spending it on a child, not your selfish adult self, I guess.

180
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,260
I don't know what it is.

181
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,940
I think it's like, I think that generationally as you go back the generations, I think you

182
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,980
know early and earlier when you were growing up you would have to shed anything you liked

183
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
as a kid.

184
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
You'd have to cut that off.

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Yes.

186
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
You'd have to cut off anything you liked as a child.

187
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,380
Like 80 years ago it was, at 13 years old you cut it off, you don't like it.

188
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,940
Then it maybe moved up average to like 15.

189
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,420
And we're maybe like in the first generation where a good majority of people have not let

190
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,780
it all go.

191
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,020
So now we're incorporating an adult, an adult element into another fun thing we enjoy as

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
children.

193
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Yes.

194
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Which is nice, honestly.

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,100
As long as you're being, as long as you're not hassling children, I'm not like, I don't

196
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,740
have a jug of moonshine and I'm hassling some kids.

197
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,860
I'm just, I'm enjoying a nice buzz while I'm walking down Main Street.

198
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
It's lovely.

199
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Yeah.

200
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
That's great.

201
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,020
And I think it like, it's a way to refresh the experience.

202
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:11,060
If you've been there a zillion times and you need ways to make it new, then different alcohol

203
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,780
pairings kind of help make it new and also kind of give you the like fuzzy swirliness

204
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,380
that you probably had when you were a little kid and didn't understand what it even was.

205
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
You know what I mean?

206
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,820
It like, it's, I don't know.

207
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,780
Like it's, yeah, it's, it's, it sets you back.

208
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
Like you feel like a three year old.

209
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, you got to, you have to kill enough brain cells that you're like as dumb as you

210
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,900
were as a child.

211
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,060
And then yeah, you start to question the reality.

212
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,780
You start to question if like maybe one of the pirates is real.

213
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Exactly.

214
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:53,980
Which I guess would be an argument for doing drugs there because which we are, we do not

215
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
typically do.

216
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
Kate, I don't know if you know this, we're good boys.

217
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
We're very good boys.

218
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
Yes, I know that.

219
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
We follow our...

220
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
I know that about you.

221
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Everyone says that about you guys.

222
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Sure, sure, sure.

223
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Yes.

224
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Oh yeah, yeah.

225
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
No, that's...

226
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
Sure.

227
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
If you ask just general reputation, that's the answer.

228
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,060
I think what if we had to go by each of us when we had our first drink of alcohol, it's

229
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,580
over 20 for all of us, right?

230
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Or no?

231
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,380
No, no, no.

232
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,500
No, I started like 17, 17.

233
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,980
Pretty good, Jason.

234
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,580
I think I had a shot at a college party at like 19.

235
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,820
Okay, I'm the old...

236
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,940
I think I was at least like 20 or 21.

237
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Wow, okay.

238
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I think it was 20.

239
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Wait, this is new information that's going on.

240
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
Yes, it is.

241
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Very wholesome.

242
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,100
I had my first beer with my dad on my 21st birthday on the outdoor patio of the rainforest

244
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,860
the now closed rainforest cafe at downtown Disney.

245
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Wow, oh my God.

246
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Wow.

247
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,180
That was your first legal drink?

248
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Was it the rainforest cafe?

249
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
I think that was my first...

250
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,980
Now that you say that, yes, I think that would technically be my first legal drink.

251
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,980
And it was the thing with the shortest wait.

252
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:12,100
He was visiting for the weekend and it was probably 60, dropping to 50 as our meal regret.

253
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,020
It was miserable weather in October.

254
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,820
This October, it's 90 degrees in Los Angeles.

255
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,900
That October, it was the appropriate fall weather.

256
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
You know what that makes me think of?

257
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,340
I don't want to sidetrack too hard here.

258
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,300
Scott and I saw a concert a couple years ago, a Mr. Ben Folds.

259
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,300
And there's a song he has, he wrote a song, Still Fighting It, about his son who had just

260
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,580
been born and he talked about how he was going to have his first beer with his son when his

261
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,660
son was older.

262
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,860
And I believe Ben said he had the beer with his son that night at the concert.

263
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Oh, that's cool.

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
If I remember correctly.

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
If I remember correctly.

266
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,980
Or if you're a fan of him, you certainly know that line.

267
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,060
And then we're like, everybody's like, that line, it happened this evening?

268
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
I love that.

269
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
I believe so.

270
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
Yeah, yeah.

271
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh, you better believe I listened to that song and thought about having that moment

272
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,740
with my son who's a baby right now.

273
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
And so maybe...

274
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
How long can we push it off?

275
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Maybe it'll be like 14.

276
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Does that seem like appropriate?

277
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
All right, great.

278
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Celebrate him starting high school.

279
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Are you going to do it at the rainforest?

280
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,420
Oh, I guess it's not there anymore.

281
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,140
But are you going to do it at downtown Disney?

282
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
It's closed.

283
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh, it seems pretty likely, right?

284
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Given the history.

285
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Yeah, the uva bar.

286
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
The uva bar.

287
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,300
Yeah, uva bar will outlive us all with that funky 90s font.

288
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,180
I will say that uva bar was also a big part of my drinking routine for a while.

289
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,980
I think before, they used to only have beer and wine for a long time at California Adventures,

290
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,980
right?

291
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,820
Or they had other stuff, but it was always really...

292
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,700
They would serve really weak margaritas or something.

293
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,380
This was probably 10 years ago or something.

294
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,240
I think they've always had margaritas over by the Wharf, that area with the Chinese food

295
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
and with the Mexican food.

296
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,940
I feel like my friends and I decided that those margaritas weren't strong enough, so

297
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,140
we would leave California Adventures, go to the uva bar and each take double shots

298
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,940
of tequila and then run back into the park and be slightly more buzzed.

299
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,380
Yeah, I think that it just is a rule of thumb for drinking tips, I guess, at Disney.

300
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,660
In park, fruity, colorful drinks don't have as much alcohol.

301
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,500
You probably should go to an actual bar to get the full alcohol content for a drink.

302
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,700
Because I think, yes, oftentimes it's just covered by sugar.

303
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,740
And that, of course, doesn't bother me that much.

304
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,260
But if you're looking for an actual full shot of something in a drink, I think your best

305
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,860
bet is the bar somewhere, an actual bar.

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,620
It's very clear in my mind at a time Mike and I went down on a Friday, early evening,

307
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,420
and went to the mad tea party bar stand.

308
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,180
I think we ordered mojitos and I watched them pick up what looked like a milk jug and dump

309
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,700
it over ice in the cup.

310
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,540
And then they plopped the plastic light up ice cubes on top.

311
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,900
And I was like, oh, the drink was already mixed in the jug.

312
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,700
This is what we just paid $16 for.

313
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,620
Yeah. Jason, are you talking about the mad hito?

314
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,180
Because I think that's what you're talking about.

315
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,620
It was not a regular mojito.

316
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,420
It was a mad hito.

317
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm looking at the menu right now.

318
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,420
The madness comes from even a lightweight like me felt nothing from that drink.

319
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,380
Yeah.

320
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,580
And I think it's probably wise to have...

321
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,860
Because those are the spots where people are probably consuming the most alcohol.

322
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,180
So it's probably wise to give everybody, most people less.

323
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,220
That is probably smart.

324
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,060
Disney has stumbled upon the best way to control drinking.

325
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,460
You just charge an arm and a leg for everything.

326
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,940
And even partyers will call it at a certain point.

327
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,300
Although Mike and I also were at the Steakhouse 55 bar once at the Disneyland Hotel.

328
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,900
And the older couple next to us were really tying a few on and talking about getting back to Pasadena.

329
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,500
And I was like, oh, I am worried about this.

330
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,980
Yeah.

331
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,380
Yes, that was scary.

332
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,460
I remember that. That was too intense.

333
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,580
And you guys offered to drive them back.

334
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Well, we did. Jason and I drove them back.

335
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,060
And then we came back to Disney.

336
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,060
It was unclear to whether they were husband and wife, brother and sister, what their relationship was.

337
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,380
If they wanted Jason and I to join them for a quad, a quad, is that what you call it?

338
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,980
I guess that's what you would.

339
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,620
Yeah.

340
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,660
Yeah, a Pasadena quad.

341
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,460
It was a real chaotic energy that night.

342
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,620
They were just hoping you had a hotel and that you might set like,

343
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,420
do you guys want to, if you want to just relax a little before that drive or not drive home at all.

344
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,140
If there was a like a free hotel room, he could have spent some time in, Jason would have done it.

345
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,860
You know, I never look a bargain in the eye unless they turned and was like,

346
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,780
can you get us a lift? We're staying at the Knott's Hotel up the road.

347
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,460
Oh, but then Snoopy could join for a be a fifth.

348
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Well, that's true.

349
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,140
That's an Anaheim quad.

350
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,860
I mean, Buena Park.

351
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,740
Buena Park.

352
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,860
Buena Park.

353
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,940
Well, you're discussing Anaheim quad and then it becomes a Buena Park quad.

354
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,820
Yeah. Or Quint, if Snoopy.

355
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,260
Quint.

356
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,940
Becomes a Buena Park Quint.

357
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,020
Right. That's absolutely right.

358
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,620
So Mad Hito's.

359
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,460
We're talking about Mad Hito's.

360
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:54,460
So, yeah. So Kate, your Rose seasonal cocktails, do you are you're not probably as insane as we are about,

361
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,220
like, knowing all the maybe like spots to do stuff, but you go to the hotels.

362
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,420
Do you ever go to Trader Sam's?

363
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,300
I do. I know. I know most of the spots as well.

364
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,500
I mean, like I'm a theme park person like you guys, you know, I mean, I didn't mean to insinuate you.

365
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm in the trenches in the trenches, finding the hotels to drink at, you know,

366
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,060
depending on where you park, which parking lot you get shoved into, there's different options.

367
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,980
But I love Trader Sam's and Trader Sam's is like where I go at the end of my way home,

368
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,180
like like the end of the day with like a tiki drink at Trader Sam's.

369
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,220
It's always so fun.

370
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:40,380
It's like when you order certain drinks, like certain animatronics, it's like very rainforest cafe

371
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:48,900
because they have like little shows that happen in the in the bar, like little like thunderstorms and shit like that.

372
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,860
Like it's the best.

373
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,620
But like an intimate rainforest cafe, like a little more like like

374
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,940
a crafted black box theater version rather than a broader.

375
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,700
Yeah, if you order the shipwreck, that's what a volcano erupts.

376
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,860
And then there's that drink that you have to get.

377
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,940
It's like I forget what it's called, but it's for like four people and it has like a fire

378
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,180
and you like flick cinnamon into the fire or something.

379
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,140
Have you forgotten that?

380
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,940
I know what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name of it.

381
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,020
And it comes in the big like ceramic and I forget what it is.

382
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:29,340
I got a version of it in Orlando and I got the Nautilus, the Nautilus, I guess, cup, you'd call it

383
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,980
that it came with and I have it. It's on the mantle downstairs.

384
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,780
I know the cup.

385
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,780
It's like a punch bowl. Yeah.

386
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:43,460
But that yeah, Trader Sam's is really, how can I say to make myself not sound so lame?

387
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,380
Very special.

388
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,420
It's very special.

389
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
It is very special.

390
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,620
It is very special.

391
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,980
And yeah, it's it's it's a great end of the night.

392
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,220
They also have stuff like during the have you ever seen this during the holidays?

393
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,020
The volcano erupts and snow comes out the top of it.

394
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,700
Wow. I had no idea.

395
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,420
That's incredible. That's incredible.

396
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,380
That's art. Yes.

397
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,220
Be there. That's art.

398
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm sure they're I mean, they have a whole outdoor thing.

399
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,420
But you wouldn't get them.

400
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,620
You wouldn't get the experience if you sat outside.

401
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,780
Yeah. The outside is nice if the weather is nice.

402
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,900
Yes. Sitting outside is not bad.

403
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,700
You can hear the music.

404
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,660
But you don't get the show.

405
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,580
But you don't get the show.

406
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,940
There'll be a performer outside playing some flamenco guitar.

407
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,660
And they've expanded the back area now to have more drink service,

408
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,940
which Jason and I enjoyed while we were crashing the Theo Awards last year

409
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,580
or attempting to the theme park awards.

410
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,940
And there was just a bunch of people in dresses and tuxedos.

411
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,780
And then Jason and I like roaming around,

412
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,940
roping around, hoping to get noticed like two losers.

413
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,900
By hoping to get noticed by non famous.

414
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,060
Yes. Not by no way.

415
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Solidity like internal theme park industry.

416
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,940
Yeah. Now, yeah.

417
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,180
Like somebody like an accountant that works for the Walt Disney Company.

418
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,820
We were hoping maybe listen to one episode.

419
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,980
And looks at the Twitter to know what we look like.

420
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,500
There's two there's two factor there they have to follow.

421
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,340
A lot of steps to this plan anyway.

422
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,060
Steakhouse 55K.

423
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,420
Have you been? I haven't been.

424
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,820
Is that that's the one in the Disneyland Hotel?

425
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,060
Yes. Yes. And I have not actually been to the main restaurant,

426
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,420
but they got a little lounge going there and you can order off the main menu

427
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,260
and you also can get get drinks there.

428
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,620
And they those those are actual drinks.

429
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,500
That sounds great. Yeah.

430
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,940
I've been to the one at California at the Grand Californian.

431
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,020
They have like a lounge bar there.

432
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
I've been to that one.

433
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,380
Yeah, the Hearthstone Lounge.

434
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,980
I'll toss that out as like a dark horse favorite pick

435
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,020
because it's usually pretty empty.

436
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,420
And you can also just order a drink there and then just take it into the lobby

437
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,060
and sit on one of the big lobby.

438
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,540
This is the massive California Grand Californian lobby, often empty

439
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,380
and a very nice place to enjoy a drink.

440
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,820
But what's the sight of one of the most upsetting things?

441
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,700
I'm remembering this now.

442
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,660
I did that trick once and I witnessed one of the most upsetting things

443
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,340
I had seen on a Disney property,

444
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,500
which was someone just put a baby down on the couch

445
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,860
and started changing the diaper on the couch.

446
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
And I can see the bathroom.

447
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,540
I could see the entrance to the bathrooms like 20 feet away.

448
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,780
And I'm just like sitting there, just like holding a nearly finished beer.

449
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,380
And I'm like, OK, I'm going to finish this and get the hell out of here.

450
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Wow.

451
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,260
Scott, that was the traumatizing event.

452
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,220
Sorry, Scott, you have a baby like, is that normal?

453
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,940
To. Well, I don't know, because I've never been in public. Right.

454
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,740
This is not an option in the current time that what flesh to me, though,

455
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,220
is that you might, you know, like there's there's been the change of tide

456
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,260
where like, you know, if you gave side eye to somebody breastfeeding a baby,

457
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,100
that would be weird, like because we've accepted that happens in public.

458
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,580
And but changing a bit,

459
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,820
nobody finds anything like beautiful about changing. Yeah.

460
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,940
This is not like, yes, do it to wherever you please.

461
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,500
The fact that I was like finishing a beverage, maybe having a snack

462
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,100
and like other people around were eating and there's just like, ah, waste.

463
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,780
Hello. Human waste is fecal matter.

464
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,180
Yes. Very good.

465
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,540
OK. The thing making it is.

466
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,460
Did you see it? Did you see the shit? Did you see the baby shit?

467
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,860
I did not know.

468
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,300
You know, I looked away.

469
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,580
I looked away too quickly.

470
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,900
When I was that was my question, Kate, as well.

471
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,340
I did not want to know if you didn't see it, then, you know, it could have been.

472
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,460
Were you know, it's not it.

473
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,900
It definitely could have been.

474
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,180
Downplay your trauma, because like that is trauma.

475
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,700
What you went through.

476
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,060
I'm not. I was.

477
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,540
Yeah, I'm not so offended by somebody doing it in public,

478
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,340
but the idea that like a piece, a piece might fall out easily.

479
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,820
Yeah. And that's.

480
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,300
Well, this is again, I having been around a lot of baby shit.

481
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,500
I think you're not really dealing with pieces.

482
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,780
It's a little more. Yeah, you're right.

483
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,940
It's a little more squishy.

484
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,300
One. Yes. Like semi solid.

485
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,020
It'd be strange.

486
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,980
And if the piece like we're able to like roll or bounce or get near your beverage,

487
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,780
that seems like beyond.

488
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,460
I mean, it's just a little chaos where like I should have said, like, hey,

489
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,500
if you want to go to the band, I'll watch your stuff if you want to go like.

490
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,740
You would say that.

491
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,620
No, I know.

492
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,620
No, I just extricated myself from if they had said, like, hey,

493
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,660
can you watch our luggage and just go to go change the bait?

494
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,100
But then also like, well, at that point, why wouldn't you just have the bag?

495
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,860
Man, they're just cast members everywhere.

496
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,540
I don't know. It was. Why are they talking to you?

497
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,580
They did it. Thankfully, they did.

498
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,500
A man in his 30s alone drinking a beer

499
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,780
in a lobby of a hotel at a Disney resort.

500
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,020
Why not talk to him?

501
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,380
I mean, the truth is that there's shit all over Disneyland.

502
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,620
It's just that like usually like we don't see it.

503
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,100
And also, like, there's tons of people constantly shitting themselves at Disneyland.

504
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,820
We don't see it because it's there's adults.

505
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,460
There's adults that need a diaper change.

506
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,340
I mean, I was one of my like most

507
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,020
like traumatic Disneyland memories was I shit myself as a child.

508
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,300
And I like and I was so like embarrassed.

509
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,340
I was on a Girl Scout trip and I was like nine.

510
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,500
And I was like so embarrassed that I shit myself.

511
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,580
And I didn't tell anyone that I shit myself.

512
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,980
I didn't like want to deal with it.

513
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,100
So I just like left the shit in my underwear for like hours at Disneyland.

514
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,060
Because it went on all the rides.

515
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,420
Maybe I was younger than nine.

516
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,620
Nine now seems kind of too old for that.

517
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,700
But like it was bad. It was bad.

518
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,540
I like left the shit in my like pants.

519
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,900
And then like we had to like someone's mom had to like drive me home.

520
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,180
And everyone was like, what's that smell?

521
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,980
And I was like, it's my Disneyland shit.

522
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,820
Like I don't it was so embarrassing.

523
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,700
Wait, did you cop?

524
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,820
No, I didn't cop to it.

525
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,900
But like I feel like everyone knew, you know, like, you know, kind of like,

526
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,180
if there's like if there's like a minivan full of like four girls,

527
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,740
like, you know, who's the girl with shit in her pants?

528
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,820
Was there anything else about you that would have made them think, oh, yeah,

529
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,620
that's in line with Kate?

530
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,860
I think I was just like, I'm really like, I'm not a quiet person.

531
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,220
Like I was a very like extroverted child.

532
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,820
And I was not talking at all.

533
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,740
I was like, I was like, I'm sure they could tell because I just like wasn't talking.

534
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,820
I was like, I remember being like very silent.

535
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,180
Just like in my own shame.

536
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,340
That that has to happen at Disney 50 times a day.

537
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Constantly many times a day.

538
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,620
And I'm saying with like an older kid, obviously, it's happening with little kids

539
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,300
that still have a diaper, but like even like, yeah, kids in the seven to ten range

540
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,180
constantly. Oh, yeah.

541
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,900
In a way. Adults, too.

542
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,340
And do you? Yeah.

543
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
And adults, too. Yeah.

544
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Because you end up stuck in lines.

545
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,860
You're in places where you've put in the time you've put in the legwork.

546
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,660
You know, you don't even know where a bathroom is if you're not there all the time.

547
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,780
So now you're going to like not you're going to give up your spot and go deal with.

548
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,340
I mean, look, I wouldn't do this.

549
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm not justifying the doing of this.

550
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,580
I'm just getting myself in the head of someone who would

551
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,020
shit their pants and then go on the Matterhorn 15 minutes later.

552
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,300
Say you're in line. Yeah.

553
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,540
Rise of the Resistance.

554
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,620
I know there's a virtual queue, so it doesn't quite work.

555
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,820
But it's say opening day Little Mermaid.

556
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,340
It's four hour line. Wow.

557
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,580
You wait three hours, 45 minutes.

558
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,580
You're so close. You're alone.

559
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,340
You're a single man in his 30s and you shit in your pants.

560
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,780
Oh, God. I guess you could ask the person behind you.

561
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,860
But then. No, you're never getting that spot back.

562
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,020
Because they're going to be gone.

563
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,100
It's a long line.

564
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,660
I don't know. It's tough. I shit my.

565
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,260
Also, Rise of the Resistance maybe is good because you are like trapped.

566
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,700
You're on a resistance, not a resist.

567
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,580
You're on a what's the fake one? First order.

568
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,420
First order. Yeah.

569
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,100
Well, you're on a first order ship and you can't go backwards.

570
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,580
And Little Mermaid, you could technically leave.

571
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,660
That's true. You're right.

572
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,620
If you once you're once you're off world on Rise of the Resistance,

573
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,820
you have to just live with that shit. Oh, God.

574
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,420
OK, you have to get through the you have to get through the Star Destroyer

575
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,700
with shit in your pants.

576
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,260
Get back to Batuu, see Lieutenant Beck and then Lieutenant Beck

577
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,380
will allow you to go to the bathroom.

578
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh, my God. Lieutenant Becker Becks.

579
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,980
I can't remember back. I think back.

580
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,220
BKK. Yeah, BK.

581
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,900
I also also I was thinking about this when you're when you're at the grocery store,

582
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,260
if you use the front little thing that kids sit in, it's a it can be a shelf,

583
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,620
but it also is a seat.

584
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,780
How many kids are sitting in that with a shitty diaper?

585
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,220
Every every single one. Right.

586
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,100
So you so people put their bread in that like right after.

587
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,820
Hopefully it's not out of a bag, hopefully.

588
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,580
Although in some cases you maybe are getting like a sourdough

589
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,540
loaf where you sort of bag it yourself or it might like slip out.

590
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,220
Yeah. If it's not fully contained, if there's like one way out for the bread.

591
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,460
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's gross.

592
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,700
Not about any of this.

593
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,500
I use that for cans.

594
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,620
I use that spot for canned goods exclusively.

595
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,340
I've never used I'm not using it again now.

596
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,380
Yeah, I don't know. You put it in my head.

597
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,220
I thought about that. Yeah.

598
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,140
But it's good that we're all paranoid shit.

599
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,380
Yeah. Well, I think I am a little more germ-pair.

600
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,980
I'm a little more because of Covid.

601
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,620
I am definitely more aware of I think how things actually spread.

602
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,900
Yeah. That's the down that you say that.

603
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,580
Sam's might be one of the biggest psychological hurdles

604
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,860
once everything calms down a little and stuff opens back up

605
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,300
because Sam's is is that the most intimate like attraction thing?

606
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, yeah. You're getting droplets for sure. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

607
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,700
Sam is full of droplets.

608
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,140
There's for sure aerosol spread.

609
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,660
They do it. That's one of the things when you get a drink, they do.

610
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,860
Who's ready for some droplets?

611
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,100
Globules at you.

612
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,740
Yeah. Like a social distance, Sam's inside would be impossible.

613
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
It's not possible.

614
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,100
Yeah. Yeah. You couldn't put up barriers between people on on the actual bar.

615
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,180
So you end up with two customers.

616
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,780
Forget sharing like a fishbowl with someone else.

617
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,580
Yeah. I mean, I guess the alcohol kills somewhat.

618
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,740
But yeah, as far as a straw is concerned.

619
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,460
Are we never all going to share a big, a massive teaky drink again?

620
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,940
Well, have we before?

621
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,420
Well, we have maybe not.

622
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,500
Yeah, we have at Howl at the Moon.

623
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,980
Oh, yeah.

624
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,340
The Universal City Walk now closed dueling.

625
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,380
I loved Howl at the Moon. I loved.

626
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,300
Oh, were you out there?

627
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,460
Let's take a jaunt over there, Kate.

628
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Let's take a jaunt to City.

629
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,500
The best part about Howl at the Moon is that they convince you that you can like

630
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,580
like there's a raffle, like a fake raffle that they do when you come in

631
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,860
and you like give them your email address.

632
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,780
And every every single time you do it, you get an email back saying

633
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,660
you won the raffle, you and your friends get a free party at Howl at the Moon.

634
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,060
Like if you come like in this time period.

635
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,540
And so like anyone can just have a free party where like everybody gets

636
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,620
like half off drinks.

637
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,780
You just have to like they were doing this.

638
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,540
They were doing this grift to us last whenever we did this a year

639
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,660
and a half ago, two years ago, we all got the free party.

640
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,340
It's the best. I love it.

641
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,660
It's I've been to many of those free parties and they're great.

642
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,860
And I love the wood, love the dueling pianos, love the what don't

643
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,500
don't they have like bucket buckets of like beers there and stuff like that?

644
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,380
Yeah, it's a great place.

645
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,860
That's what yeah, that's what we were.

646
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,300
We were drinking a bucket of blue alcohol, slime of some kind,

647
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,860
like just thick sugar blue slime.

648
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,420
Love it. In a terrible, terrible stuff.

649
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,060
And I think I I don't think I'm rewriting history.

650
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,340
I think I even who I like, I like at least one or two sugary drinks.

651
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,860
I think I said this is disgusting.

652
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,380
Yeah, you called it.

653
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,740
And the other thing there were it was like four dollar,

654
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,620
like Stoli or Sky Vodka or something.

655
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,860
Yeah. So yeah, we had we had one night.

656
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,500
And then, yeah, when we went up to City Wall a couple of weeks ago

657
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,900
just to check it out and how the moon is closed there.

658
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,660
I think it was supposed to reopen on Hollywood Boulevard, though.

659
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,100
But it did for like a week and then it just closed for.

660
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Had so sad, I think they called it.

661
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,580
Yeah. So yeah, so we'll see.

662
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,460
Maybe that'll come back.

663
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,620
Kate, did you party at City Walk as a youth as well?

664
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,500
No, no, we were more Disneyland people.

665
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,780
I didn't party at City Walk as much, although, you know, I love City Walk as an adult.

666
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,980
I had my birthday at Bubba Gump last year.

667
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,820
Oh, gee. Yes, a great place.

668
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,220
We should have had you on one of our many, many episode series

669
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,260
about City Walker or downtown Disney.

670
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,380
Had we thrown that out, do you have a favorite place?

671
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,980
If you if you had to pick one to talk about at City Walk or downtown Disney.

672
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,100
OK, good question.

673
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,180
Downtown Disney, my favorite place.

674
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,100
It is the Uva bar.

675
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Like, I love the Uva bar.

676
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,620
I was pumped for the Uva bar.

677
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,700
I really thought, yeah, very excited.

678
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,460
Just go there for a while mentally.

679
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,500
Even though, like when you try to justify what's great about it,

680
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,380
there's like nothing in the list.

681
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,060
It just is a place where there are chairs and glasses of wine.

682
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,420
There's something so great about it.

683
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,340
Nothing you could say to just yes.

684
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,180
Yeah. No, I love it.

685
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,700
I think maybe for that reason, because you

686
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,100
maybe it is the lack of theming or anything.

687
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,780
It's nothing. It's nothing.

688
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,220
It's like a certain it wipes the slate clean.

689
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,660
If you're like getting tired of little kid stuff

690
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,780
and like cartoon characters and balloons in your face,

691
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,980
do they go be in the most vanilla place in the world?

692
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,380
Also, special shout out to the downtown Disney Sephora,

693
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,020
which is where I used to go and put sunscreen on for free

694
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,660
every time I went to Disneyland.

695
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,980
Wow, that's a good hack.

696
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,060
That's a great tip.

697
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,300
So really good.

698
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,260
Everyone do that.

699
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,060
You don't have to bring your own sunscreen.

700
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,540
Just go put it on it's for it.

701
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,140
They've got free trials of everything.

702
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,060
Wow, I've never heard this really excellent tip.

703
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,660
This this is might be a game changer because like if you

704
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,220
bring your own sunscreen, so you bring a big bottle,

705
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,660
do you carry it all day?

706
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Leave it in the car.

707
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,300
Oh, but plastic balloons that I don't know if you guys

708
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,180
have ever experienced this.

709
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,660
You leave like hand sanitizer sunscreen in a car

710
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,460
and then it just warps if the car is too hot.

711
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,020
It just like expands.

712
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,460
So like single service Sephora is a great.

713
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,980
Yeah. And you can really like you can use the free samples

714
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,060
of some very expensive sunscreen.

715
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,860
For free. Right.

716
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,740
So like celebrity.

717
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,220
Yeah. You get some like, you know,

718
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,780
celebrity brand sunscreen.

719
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,060
Some like some Kylie Jenner, Kylie Jenner shit over there.

720
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,860
Yeah. Yeah. Like some like Twitch star.

721
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,500
Has Andy Gerber sunscreen.

722
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Yeah. Yes.

723
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Casamigos, Casamigos, Casamigos branded sunscreen.

724
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,380
They should do.

725
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,260
Could you imagine?

726
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,540
They should do a sunscreen line.

727
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,700
Casamigos, him and George.

728
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,060
Oh, yeah.

729
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,460
Randy and George should do a sunscreen line.

730
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,660
Oh, yeah, because they're always out like talking to the workers

731
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,700
in the field who are making the tequila.

732
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,340
I need that sunscreen to protect them and the workers.

733
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
They're good friends.

734
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,580
And they're there.

735
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,740
Two guys with like, you know, wealthy looking skin.

736
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,100
I would I would buy some skin shit from them.

737
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,140
Yeah. Now, I think pretty accurate.

738
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,340
That is the way to describe that sort of like leathery.

739
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,580
Yeah, like like like a healthy, expensive leather.

740
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,900
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

741
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,580
Yeah, like a nice recliner.

742
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,860
Yeah. You could make a nice recliner out of George Clooney

743
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,900
or Randy Gerber's skin.

744
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,940
I like that. Or line your car with it.

745
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,780
Yeah.

746
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,060
Could my the seats in my car be made out of George Clooney skin?

747
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,380
I like that.

748
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,060
Mm hmm.

749
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,460
Would you wait that that implies that you were previously aware of Randy

750
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,820
Gerber, who comes up on this podcast nearly every episode.

751
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,540
I mean, I'm a big fan of the Gerber family.

752
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,940
Kaia, I love Kaia.

753
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,900
Cindy Crawford, love her.

754
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,780
The son has a bunch of has like a bunch of face tattoos.

755
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,220
Oh, yeah, there's love the Gerber.

756
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,620
We did we did an episode on Casamigos on our Patreon,

757
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,460
and we I only briefly touched on the family,

758
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,540
but the family has a lot of seemingly drama surrounding them as well.

759
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,140
Them.

760
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,580
Um, but I just tried to we just tried to focus on the business side.

761
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,580
Of the Gerber of the Gerber brand and the Gerber group, of course, the three,

762
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,780
the three men in the Gerber family who all are part of the Gerber.

763
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,020
The Gerber group. I didn't know about the Gerber group.

764
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,660
Yes. And I'm trying to remember.

765
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,460
I think there's Scott Gerber.

766
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,020
There's Randy Gerber.

767
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,780
Right. Yeah.

768
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,300
And there's a third there's a mysterious third part.

769
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,140
No, it's Casamigos as the mysterious third partner.

770
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Yeah, that's that.

771
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,700
He's the party boy of Casamigos.

772
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,100
But the Gerber group is a different thing.

773
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,940
Those are the three brothers in the Gerber family. Wow.

774
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,100
Scott, let me bring you back into the fold real quick.

775
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,020
I have a question since you brought up the Uva bar, which I

776
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,060
I know is one of your haunts.

777
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,780
I have only very briefly been there.

778
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,140
Have you been to Uva bar since downtown Disney reopened?

779
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,620
No, I haven't been there in general.

780
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,780
OK, I'm I'm certainly thinking about it.

781
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,380
I'm getting the I'm getting the hankering.

782
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,900
And, you know, we actually haven't recorded an episode since this new plan

783
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,620
that they are going to open some of California Adventure,

784
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,940
specifically for food, drink and merchandise,

785
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,380
which I'm very excited about.

786
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,140
I feel like I might give it a shot.

787
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,940
And this is maybe the way to finally get back to drinking at Disneyland,

788
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,180
even in the tiniest regard.

789
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,540
I don't know if you know about any of this, Kate,

790
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,220
but I think what they're saying is an outdoor version of Carthay Circle

791
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,740
and the smoke jumpers, the

792
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,900
aviation themed restaurant next to Soren will be open.

793
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,380
It serves the bad hamburgers.

794
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,140
That's like the worst. Why?

795
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,340
Why that one of all the of all the culinary experiences?

796
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,020
But why not bring why not bring the Food and Wine Festival back then instead?

797
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,980
I I agree with that.

798
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,100
I don't know if they're I don't know if it's just proximity.

799
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,580
Like there's some money reason why they only want to open that little area

800
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,020
right when you enter the park and why not?

801
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,940
That's like all they can like reasonably set up and staff and lights.

802
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,820
Because you have to have something sit down, right?

803
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,620
Like because you can't like have a bunch of people like walking around.

804
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,260
Yeah. Getting hammered. Yeah.

805
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,060
No, but they have the food and wine people are eating and walking around drinking.

806
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,420
Like, yeah, I'm not really sure the reason.

807
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,620
I don't. Yeah, I'm not sure.

808
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,060
I those Daily Beast, that big expose about outbreaks and doubt that Disney has me

809
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,380
so spooked like I don't know if I will try it out.

810
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,940
Wait, I don't know about this. Oh, no.

811
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
Oh, didn't it? Well, then I texted that.

812
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,180
And I think September, I think, wasn't it?

813
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,740
Was it September, September and August?

814
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,500
And basically like Disney is not like communicating about like if someone is

815
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,580
they're not doing a good job at letting other cast members know it's positive.

816
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,780
There are positive tests.

817
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,180
They weren't letting the union know in a timely manner.

818
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,820
And I was shocked this wasn't brought up when there were

819
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,300
everyone's complaining about Gavin Newsom's opening plans.

820
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,700
But there was a statistic about like

821
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,260
colleagues would disappear for days at a time.

822
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,700
And no one knew why 11 people from the 12 person horticultural irrigation team

823
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
didn't show up to work for a full week.

824
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,860
My God is a section of the article.

825
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,660
So, yeah, that combined with the lines we had been seeing at downtown Disney.

826
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,860
I think the thing that appealed to me going up the city walk was how empty it was.

827
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,980
Yeah, no, not at all.

828
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,620
Oh, no. But they're killing full horticulture groups.

829
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,340
I guess not killing them.

830
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,180
Well, yeah, it seems like people people were OK,

831
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,140
but it doesn't seem like they were doing a good job.

832
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,780
They weren't testing on site.

833
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,060
So, oh, man, yeah, we'll see about that.

834
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,220
I mean, I think if you go in the middle of the day towards these reopened

835
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,540
downtown days, I'm sure the crowds are a lot less.

836
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,660
Were you saying that there was no one at CityWalk?

837
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,780
It was when we went up there, it was pretty light.

838
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,980
There was as many security people it seemed.

839
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,380
I went and and it was crowded and it was scary.

840
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,940
To Universal CityWalk, it was like was the with the polling place open.

841
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,460
Do you think that you remember if that?

842
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,420
No, I went like months ago.

843
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,500
I went probably to I went probably too early in the pandemic.

844
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,180
Like it was like it was like one of the first places I went to

845
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,900
to just like see about going somewhere in public.

846
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,940
And Jack and I went we like got our temperatures taken and and it was like

847
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,540
I was expecting no one to be there.

848
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,980
It was like fully packed, like all the restaurants like were full.

849
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,620
Bubba Gump had all the outdoor seating like completely filled up.

850
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,980
Like it was it was scary.

851
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,540
There's like long line to get into Hot Topic, long line to get into Voodoo

852
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,140
Donuts. It was like I think, yeah, you may maybe went when like everybody was like,

853
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,540
oh, my God, it's open. We got to go.

854
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,340
I think I think that remember that time period when like restaurants

855
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,060
like fully opened for some reason in May?

856
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,900
Yeah, I think that's like when I went and it was like they weren't inside.

857
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,460
They weren't eating inside, but it was still like very scary. Right.

858
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,580
Did you just get out of there or did you try?

859
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,020
We did like one lap and then like immediately went home because it was too scary.

860
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,620
Wow. Wow. You know, I was thinking before this episode, I was like,

861
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,940
well, this is one where we're going to talk about COVID a lot and where we'll say

862
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,500
a lot of things like, you know, because when you go there and you know,

863
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,980
you get the wine and then, well, you know, not right now.

864
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,980
But and I was thinking how if only this is like this may be a little idea

865
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,820
of an invention or some tech or an app that somebody could make.

866
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,700
If there was like in three years from now when all this is, I hope, done,

867
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,660
if like there was some kind of app that could extract mentions of COVID

868
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,060
from every podcast episode where we all had to talk about it for a long time

869
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,380
so that they are listenable in the future. Yeah.

870
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,380
So we don't have this shadow on us.

871
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,380
I feel I mean, it would be it'd be a lot of work.

872
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,020
This this app would if it extracted all of the COVID references,

873
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,700
it would be just like over a year's worth of material between every podcast

874
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
that has to talk about it. Sorry.

875
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,820
OK, go ahead. You should just replace.

876
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,420
You should just like have some word that you say instead of COVID

877
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,700
that will be like evergreen.

878
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,660
Like we can't go right now because we all have, you know, a conference.

879
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,580
We're all at a conference.

880
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,540
We're all at a convention.

881
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,740
Like that'll be fine.

882
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,540
Like people will be like, oh, well, they had a conference.

883
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,780
They were out of town. Yeah.

884
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,060
What if you replace COVID with conference?

885
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,700
Like, well, we can't go because of the conference.

886
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
It works.

887
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,460
It does. It works because of the conference.

888
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,460
Trump's response to the conference has been horrible.

889
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,620
It's just some I just love.

890
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,300
Sorry, I've been sleeping really bad just because I'm scared about

891
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,500
where everything's going with the conference.

892
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,420
I hope we get a vaccine for the conference soon.

893
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,180
Hmm. Not as good.

894
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,940
Yeah, works for me.

895
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeah. Well, someone someone developed this.

896
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,140
I think a lot of people say the conference isn't real, but I mean,

897
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,980
people are going to the conference. Yeah.

898
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,740
A lot of people in Orange County deny that the conference exists.

899
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,780
The conference is the most popular event in American history.

900
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,700
That's my other thing that worries me about downtown

901
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,500
Disney, period, is the location in Orange County.

902
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,540
That was another memorable bar experience.

903
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,820
I had an Orange County at Disneyland once at California Adventure.

904
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,100
I like waited an hour to get into the Cove bar, sat down.

905
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,740
And before I could say hello to the bartender, some like

906
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,420
skeezy looking Orange County, Crestpunks walked up to the service bar,

907
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,820
ordered two zombies to go and got served before me.

908
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,980
And I was just like, no, please.

909
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,500
I've just been waiting, waiting in the sun for an hour.

910
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,420
I just got snaked by these guys with backpacks that are mostly straps.

911
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,900
I don't understand what's going on.

912
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,900
So you hate the whole county now.

913
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,740
I, you know, it's a strange two guys

914
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,580
caught in front of you in line and now the county's on notice.

915
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,940
I well, it's, you know, all the other there's other stuff in Orange County.

916
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,820
It's not a shortage.

917
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,460
I know the opinion is correct, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

918
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,780
Which, hey, that's one thing to talk about.

919
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,980
We all live, you know, sort of in like Valley, LA,

920
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,540
you know, this this part of the city.

921
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,700
Disneyland's way down in Anaheim, Orange County.

922
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,660
We love to go and drink a good amount.

923
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,020
But at some point, somebody's got to worry about the drive home.

924
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,460
How much do you wish there was a more reliable transportation back and forth?

925
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,980
How great would that be?

926
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,060
I would love if that existed.

927
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,460
Have you done the train?

928
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,140
I've always wanted to try doing the train, but it seems like too complicated.

929
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,300
You have to take a bus.

930
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,700
I've gotten. Yes, you have to get bus.

931
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,460
I've gotten so close to trying it.

932
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,140
And then it's always just like, but then you got it.

933
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,140
It's another 90 minutes on the trip, maybe both ways.

934
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,980
I think so. And it's just it's too hard.

935
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,700
My sister took a one time when my family was here and she was working

936
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,060
and she took a train down the train got delayed about five hours.

937
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,140
Oh, she showed up at like midnight.

938
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,700
It was crazy.

939
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,140
It's some of the risk.

940
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,180
Yeah, it's off. It's extremely off.

941
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,980
I've tried to figure this out on behalf of the company.

942
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,020
Like, is there just a shuttle bus that runs every 10 minutes

943
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,820
from some spot in L.A. from the lot or from the studio? Sure.

944
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,340
Mm hmm. Like that would be nice.

945
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,460
I mean, I'm I've rarely ever had enough to drink

946
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,260
that a nice five hour walk in the sun won't, you know, get me sober.

947
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,540
But it would be nice to go.

948
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,780
I could have a I could have two drinks at the end of the night

949
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,020
and get on a bus and be OK. Yeah, that would be. Yeah.

950
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,980
Usually I'm just eating so much food that like I can't ever really break through.

951
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Like, I mean, as a as a teen, we would get like blackout drunk at Disneyland.

952
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,700
But now that I'm like 30, I just I can't like ever really get that drunk

953
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,220
at Disneyland because like I just eat so much.

954
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,420
I mean, I love the food there.

955
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,820
The thing I love almost more than the drinking is the eating.

956
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,180
I mean, they're both they're tied. They're tied.

957
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,500
They're tied. But yeah, I never I can't get that drunk.

958
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,900
It's also yet so much walking and sweating.

959
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,020
Like you're just you can't retain any of the poison.

960
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,660
Yeah. On a like light day, you're getting those 10,000 steps,

961
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:38,860
at least pretty easily on a on a fairly typical day.

962
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,380
You're maybe getting like 26,000.

963
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,140
Like it's a ton of what's like way more than you do.

964
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:50,020
Regularly, like you'd never like actively go on that amount of hike or something.

965
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,460
I remember maybe somebody better than me would.

966
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,540
But yeah, you do so much exercise that counteracts it,

967
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,460
which I think helps you go for that, like long distance.

968
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,700
I've been drinking since 1030 a.m. or whatever.

969
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,220
Yeah. The hardest I've ever really got, I feel like the hardest

970
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,340
I'll go is like two Carthay Manhattans back to back at 2 p.m.

971
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,820
And then that's the best.

972
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,660
When you get like slight, when you get like a heavy buzz

973
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,740
at Carthay Circle in the middle of the day

974
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,020
and you don't have anywhere to drive anytime soon and you're just like,

975
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,620
that's the best. I miss that. I miss that feeling.

976
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,940
Oh, yeah. I guess, especially if I have a fast pass for mission breakout

977
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,060
and I'm leaving with two Carthays inside.

978
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,100
I mean, that's there's nothing better than that.

979
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,780
Yeah. Yeah.

980
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,300
Kate, one of my favorite.

981
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,180
Sorry, Scott, we were saying.

982
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,540
Oh, so it was one of my favorite experiences.

983
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,500
It made like this is way up there in the Disney and drinking was like

984
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,740
having a weird little Anaheim expedition with my wife, Erin,

985
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,820
on the way down, going to the Anaheim Fries Electronics,

986
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,420
discovering that it had a weird space video that played in a loop all the time.

987
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,180
It was a really rainy day.

988
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,860
And then we like raided in the rain and then got into like very warm

989
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,140
Carthay circle and then had a couple of Manhattans.

990
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,260
And by the end of it, I was like, I'm going to be the guy on the screen.

991
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,140
They like like what I was so fired up from the Manhattans.

992
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,020
I'm going to figure out a way that it's not going to be that old astronaut.

993
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,980
It's going to be me. And then I did it.

994
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,060
It happened. And this was the entire I don't know if you know about this.

995
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,860
I know all about this. I followed this very closely.

996
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,420
It's something I as someone who also loves fries like

997
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,100
this was big for me when this happened for you.

998
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,140
Oh, oh, wait, because we talked about this.

999
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,380
That's right. Because you you grew up near the is it El Segundo?

1000
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,460
Yeah, the Manhattan Beach, the Hawaiian one.

1001
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,620
Like Tiki themed, the Polynesian themed fries was my hometown fries.

1002
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,700
And I'm just proud to be a hometown fries girl.

1003
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,660
To be so lucky to grow up with one in your backyard,

1004
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,620
it's almost better than having a theme park.

1005
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,620
I'm very blessed.

1006
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,740
I had a very blessed childhood at that fries.

1007
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,660
It's where I got my first iPod.

1008
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,500
Oh, wow. It's a big fries for me.

1009
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,740
These do you remember like a they're still selling that generation?

1010
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,180
I know they stopped right after that one.

1011
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,660
It's a top notch fries.

1012
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,580
It's a great price.

1013
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,980
Mike, you were heading somewhere, though.

1014
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,860
Oh, I was just going to ask, because, you know, you're talking about blackout

1015
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,540
drunk, of course, this makes me retroactively as a kid, very uncomfortable.

1016
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:36,380
Like, was it in my kid brain, it was like, oh, like you.

1017
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,620
People were just looking at you and it was like you were danger.

1018
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,860
It was around every turn because of employees.

1019
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,020
Or was it literally no one cared?

1020
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,340
And like you just had a nice.

1021
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,940
No one cared. We would just like rage hard at like World of Color,

1022
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,940
like chugging like water bottles full of like Evan Williams.

1023
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,460
Like that was the vibe.

1024
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,820
It was great. It was pure teenage bliss.

1025
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,380
It was great.

1026
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,380
So it was just pretty.

1027
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,420
So, yeah, because because I would imagine the scenario is I'm whatever 13, 15.

1028
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,020
Even if somebody had like a little like travel size bottle of liquor,

1029
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,540
they like showed me before we went into security.

1030
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,820
I would have been sweating so profusely the whole day.

1031
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,180
I feel like. But it's obviously like no one cares.

1032
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,660
I think it's like I feel like it was different because we were like we were like cute,

1033
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,980
like teen girls and like you just get away with like so much when you're like,

1034
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,820
a privileged like teenage, like sweet looking girl.

1035
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,580
So we would like I don't think we like thought rules applied to us.

1036
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,780
I mean, it's a big problem.

1037
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,580
It's why a lot of problems in the world exist because of that phenomenon.

1038
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,580
But it worked really well for us at the time when it came to sneaking alcohol into Disneyland.

1039
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,940
We like weren't that scared about it.

1040
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,380
I guess like sometimes I would like, you know,

1041
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,060
when I stopped bringing them into the water bottles and started bringing them into flasks,

1042
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,460
then I would try to hide them and that would be a little more stressful.

1043
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,460
That's harder. Yeah.

1044
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,060
Yeah. But like Marissa Strickland has told us about like Grad Night shenanigans at Disney.

1045
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,740
I mean, Grad Night is lawless at Disneyland or.

1046
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,740
They banned it.

1047
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,580
By the time I was a senior, they banned Grad Night for my school because like someone OD'd or something.

1048
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,580
Wow.

1049
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,740
That's right. I remember that being a punishment.

1050
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,500
I don't think my class did it, but I think maybe a different class at my high school.

1051
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,020
That is the punishment if somebody, which is so crazy.

1052
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,060
No Disneyland for anyone.

1053
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,020
We had to do ours at Dave and Buster's.

1054
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,020
That was our Grad Night.

1055
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,020
It was at Dave.

1056
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Was that it was like in, I think it was like in Orange County somewhere.

1057
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
It was like a far away Dave and Buster's.

1058
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,020
I remember being on a bus for a long time just to go to Dave and Buster's.

1059
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,020
Not as good.

1060
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,020
Irvine or something.

1061
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,020
Probably like.

1062
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,020
It's not bad though.

1063
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,020
Jason, we were at a Grad Night and I do think there was a kid that was, am I wrong?

1064
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,020
Were you here?

1065
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,020
There was a kid that was, I think it was like a kid that was like a kid that was like a kid.

1066
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,020
That was, am I wrong?

1067
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,020
Were you here?

1068
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:59,020
There was a kid that was too drunk and there was a problem and a security, like security was trying to figure out what to do.

1069
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Yeah, someone had to intervene.

1070
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:07,020
We were trying to hang out at like a mad tea party or something and not be hassled by some drunk teen.

1071
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,020
Yeah, we just wanted to hear covers of songs for our youth.

1072
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:17,020
We just wanted to see wholesome covers with words cut out, I'm assuming.

1073
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,020
Yeah, so.

1074
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
I'm not sure I know an example of what you mean.

1075
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,020
This is the kind of thing that was at the mad tea party.

1076
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Well, there was a set list that they would do every night.

1077
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,020
Princess Let's Go Crazy was in it.

1078
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,020
It was like a Blink 182 song in there, I think, as well.

1079
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
We'll get to this on the mad tea party episode eventually.

1080
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,020
I'll find the full set list, but I think there would be a word or two.

1081
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,020
I think we would think.

1082
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
Word or two.

1083
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:46,020
Here comes an inappropriate line in one of these songs and they would like change it to make sure it wasn't offensive.

1084
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,020
I don't think it was like.

1085
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
I'm trying to think of a dirty Blink 182 song.

1086
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,020
I don't think it was.

1087
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,020
I don't think it was so bad, but I think they changed a little things.

1088
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah.

1089
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:16,020
I when you were when you were talking about like blackout drunk, I was I was recalling that there's there has been one time in my life that I was that at a Disney park and it doesn't fit with the topic, technically, because it was at Disney World.

1090
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,020
And I don't even know if blackout well, I don't know, like vaguely on the line.

1091
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,020
I'm saying blackout like pretty liberally.

1092
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,020
I mean, like just drunk, capital D drunk.

1093
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,020
That line where you know the difference.

1095
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,020
Yes, it's not like I remember how I got home and such.

1096
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:44,020
But yeah, but yeah, definitely the drunkest ever was which was started with a pregame at the California Grill, which is on top of the contemporary hotel in Disney World.

1097
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:48,020
And that's where you can like get the monorail from the hotel.

1098
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,020
You just go down into the lobby and it passes through the hotel.

1099
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,020
And there was a monorail ride that was so drunky.

1100
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
And I was just like, let me look at photos of this.

1101
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,020
And I just found one that I did not know existed.

1102
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,020
And I'm going to share the screen so you can see this.

1103
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,020
This this right here is the drunkest ever been on.

1104
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh, my God.

1105
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,020
I think it shows.

1106
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,020
Wow.

1107
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,020
That's so good.

1108
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:17,020
Ten years ago, I'm like swinging between like bars.

1109
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,020
I'm like dangling off of a we had the car to ourselves.

1110
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
There was nobody else in there.

1111
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,020
And I'm like my feet are up on the seat.

1112
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,020
I'm like swinging like a disrespectful teen.

1113
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,020
Really?

1114
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,020
There's no other way to say it.

1115
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:36,020
And I'm like, I mean, I'm given a very cool finger that is also between my legs.

1116
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,020
So it looks fairly sexual.

1117
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,020
What you're trying to do.

1118
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,020
I love it.

1119
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,020
This is this is Pete.

1120
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,020
This is peak.

1121
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,020
Cool.

1122
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,020
This is so cool.

1123
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
I am.

1124
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,020
It's pretty I felt cool.

1125
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
I certainly felt good.

1126
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,020
Look, here's some other I'm like hopping between.

1127
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,020
Wow.

1128
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,020
Cars.

1129
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,020
Teens do.

1130
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,020
Look at these.

1131
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,020
There's friends.

1132
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,020
These are people.

1133
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,020
Pirates of the Caribbean shirt.

1134
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,020
These were the yeah.

1135
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,020
The shout out to the Cadillac Brothers.

1136
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,020
So we came with them.

1137
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,020
But yeah, pretty pretty pretty.

1138
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,020
Wow.

1139
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:12,020
But if the worst thing that I did was like jump over some seats in a monorail car where

1140
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:17,020
we were bothering no one else, like it's not like I was like kicking children in the face.

1141
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,020
I'd say that's not so bad.

1142
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,020
Can you go back to that previous photo?

1143
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,020
Yes.

1144
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,020
Yeah.

1145
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,020
This one?

1146
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,020
Are you?

1147
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,020
I'm trying to figure out how many shirts are you wearing?

1148
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,020
That's a lot of shirts.

1149
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,020
It was cold.

1150
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,020
This is December.

1151
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,020
Oh, it's December.

1152
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,020
And since I'm from California, I don't have warm clothes.

1153
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,020
So this is always me in New York, too.

1154
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,020
I don't like have a nice thick coat.

1155
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,020
I just wear like six layers of regular clothes.

1156
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,020
And that's actually how they taught us in the Boy Scouts.

1157
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:50,020
That's how they teach you to dress for like cold weather, hiking and camping is because

1158
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,020
rather than one big coat layers so you can just take them off or put them on as needed.

1159
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,020
Oh, yes, indeed.

1160
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,020
You were being responsible.

1161
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,020
Yes.

1162
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,020
One sense.

1163
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,020
This is a this is a photo of a responsible person.

1164
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,020
So there's also me on the.

1165
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,020
Oh, wow.

1166
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,020
Oh, that's bad behavior.

1167
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,020
Pretty bad behavior from the good boy.

1168
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,020
When we started this podcast, you know, Jason and I did a lot of up up at research, opposition

1169
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:20,020
research type research on Scott and we did not find these photos.

1170
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,020
And I don't know if we would have started the podcast.

1171
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,020
I don't know.

1172
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,020
Yeah.

1173
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,020
We realize the whole thing entirely in a monorail.

1174
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,020
It's disrespectful.

1175
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,020
That's right.

1176
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,020
Yeah.

1177
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:39,020
I will defend I will I will proffer defense because we were down last year and I was on

1178
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:45,020
a bus once to Disney Springs last year and there were some retirees that were gone.

1179
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:51,020
So I had to say at Disney World, they kind of encourage the vacation spirit, the vacation

1180
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,020
indulgence, because let's be frank, they just care about the bottom line.

1181
00:57:54,020 --> 00:58:00,020
So there were some people who were you were the young person version of gone and they

1182
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,020
were the like used car dealership odor version of gone.

1183
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:09,020
So, you know, well, I didn't have to drive anywhere when you're in the vacation kingdom.

1184
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:14,020
You can just go crash at home and I made it back safe.

1185
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,020
And and I remember did Harry Potter for the first time the next morning with like the

1186
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,020
thickest hanging over.

1187
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,020
I had a very long.

1188
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,020
Oh, sure.

1189
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:27,020
What does it take for me to not do I just need to like in light of these recent photographs,

1190
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,020
I just want to say that I'm I'm learning.

1191
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:38,020
I'm progressing like wait, do I does the public apology do it or is there going to be to make

1192
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,020
a donation to Montero carpets?

1193
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,020
Yes.

1194
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,020
I will say I'll find out who cleans them.

1196
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:51,020
I'll find out if there's a service and I'll like invest in a new vacuum.

1197
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:57,020
You better hope, though, that those brothers you were with don't pull a bubble in ski and

1198
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,020
go on podcast, the ride and sell you out.

1199
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,020
And you better hope that there's a lot not a laptop floating around.

1200
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:10,020
Yeah, because if if more comes out, you will be punished with the you will no longer allow

1201
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,020
to be saying the phrase cocktail or alcohol on the podcast.

1202
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,020
You will only be allowed to say adult libations.

1203
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,020
No, don't make me do it.

1204
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:22,020
No, Kate, there's this thing I've been complaining about for a long time.

1205
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:28,020
I think that we are the first podcast about Disney parks where we'll say like we get drunk.

1206
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:34,020
We got drunk with drinks because almost every other one dances around the phrase for like

1207
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,020
like the longest little socially distant dance until they finally get to.

1208
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:46,020
I may have had a few special potions or two, perhaps an adult libation.

1209
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,020
I don't know. I won't say anymore.

1210
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,020
I see that that I mean both ends.

1211
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:56,020
This is a time where both ends of the spectrum are actually very tedious.

1212
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:03,020
So like I sucked upon an adult libation on one end and the other end of like, here's the places to get Jack Daniels at Disney.

1213
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,020
We're like, all right, guys, these guys.

1214
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,020
No, thank you. Not for me.

1215
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,020
Either of you. I found a picture.

1216
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,020
I found a picture of myself as a drunk teen at Disneyland.

1217
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:20,020
But it's not this is more wholesome coming of age.

1218
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,020
It's not as good. It's not as good.

1219
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,020
Hold on. OK, here's here's me.

1220
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,020
Yes. This. Oh, you have a mustache.

1221
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,020
So here's what we would do.

1222
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
Here's what we would do.

1223
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:38,020
We would we would get drunk and then we would make the face painters paint our faces at the face painting booth.

1224
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:43,020
But they have very strict rules for what adults are allowed to get or like non-children.

1225
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,020
So they can't give you a full face paint.

1226
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,020
They can only give you like a partial face paint.

1227
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,020
So we would just get the mustache from the pirate.

1228
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,020
Oh, which that that's good.

1229
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,020
That reads is like, you know, you got a porn.

1230
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,020
Yeah, it was truly annoying. It was like in that era.

1231
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:07,020
Remember when like mustaches were funny as like a thing as like a cultural thing that was like around that era.

1232
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:14,020
I am. There was an article recently, I think, in like Vulture or something that was about the people.

1233
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,020
It's like, well, I got a thing.

1234
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:21,020
I got a mustache tattoo on my finger in 2011 and I'm still dealing with it.

1235
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:26,020
Yeah. And that is the funniest thing I can like.

1236
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:31,020
I like Colin Oates, a ton, definitely one of my favorite bands, and I've seen them live a lot.

1237
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,020
And this this like dissipated a little.

1238
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,020
In fact, I saw them in Vegas and there was none of this.

1239
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:47,020
But then I saw when I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl one time, the amount of fake press on mustaches with these fucking irony hounds attending this show.

1240
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,020
This is not good. Don't like this mustache parade.

1241
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,020
It's not about the mustache. It's about the music.

1242
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,020
I've never been. I look, I'm on the record.

1243
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,020
I've never been a mustache, fake mustache guy.

1244
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,020
That's good.

1245
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:10,020
The whole memeifying of must that I know the cell over Tom Selleck, you know, I like Tom Selleck fine, except for his political views.

1246
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,020
But that's you know, the mustache.

1247
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,020
What I could take a dark period of history when we like memeified mustaches.

1248
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,020
I don't think it was a good era.

1249
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,020
But maybe maybe it was a simpler time.

1250
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:28,020
You know, it was like we weren't all so that was enough for us.

1251
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,020
Just like a funny mustache.

1252
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,020
We were at brunch.

1253
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,020
We were talking about must.

1254
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,020
We were at brunch and we all had mustaches and the cats videos.

1255
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,020
You know, those were the days.

1256
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:47,020
Oh, no, I found an actual picture of me as a teen black much more.

1257
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,020
This is a better.

1258
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:55,020
OK, there's I have a bunch of them from like this one trip where we got drunk as teens at Disneyland.

1259
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,020
Send us any you're willing to make public.

1260
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:05,020
And we can black out people's eyes if we can add a mustache to my friend.

1261
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,020
Her parents bought us a hotel room at the Grand Californian.

1262
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,020
Wait, can you see this?

1263
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,020
This is us getting wasted in the hotel room.

1264
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:21,020
Here's me like I'm front and center drunk with my mother, a different mustache, different mustic, clearly a different occasion.

1265
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,020
And I'm like, just gone.

1266
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:32,020
Gone. Here's me like also wasted on the big grizzly rapids rapids.

1267
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,020
Oh, these are great.

1268
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,020
Here's yeah, here's us at the Ariel's Grotto.

1269
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,020
Just drunk out of our teenage minds.

1270
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:47,020
Truly just for your having your having the best time jammed into a phone booth.

1271
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,020
The truly not an appropriate thing.

1272
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,020
Now that's old fashioned fun.

1273
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,020
Yeah, that's what we look around here.

1274
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,020
Doesn't work in the era of the conference.

1275
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,020
I would get fake.

1276
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,020
I would get drunk and I would get fake names stitched onto Disney hats.

1277
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,020
So I've made up a name that obviously isn't my name.

1278
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,020
I got it stitched onto a hat.

1279
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:14,020
Wait, in this in this case, the name is Moxie, which is like something a teenager would think is like a cool name.

1280
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,020
I feel like hilarious.

1281
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,020
Yeah.

1282
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,020
I was just wondering if you had a friend named Moxie.

1283
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,020
I had no I didn't I never met a Moxie.

1284
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:32,020
Is there a chance like Jason and I are like in the background of one of these photos like being probably probably I mean, look how annoying.

1285
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:36,020
Can you imagine like the level of annoying we would be as a group?

1286
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,020
There's like five of us.

1287
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,020
We all have different like face paints on.

1288
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,020
And we're drunk teenage girls.

1289
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,020
It's a great is a great vibe.

1290
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,020
But you spent money on property and that's the only thing that matters.

1291
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,020
That's the only thing that matters.

1292
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,020
There really is.

1293
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:58,020
Also, I feel like, you know, there's a level of public intoxication.

1294
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,020
But like, what's the worst you guys are going to do?

1295
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,020
You're going to like run around and yell.

1296
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,020
That's what everyone's doing.

1297
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,020
Exactly.

1298
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,020
Right.

1299
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,020
Yeah.

1300
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,020
That's yeah.

1301
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,020
You're doing that.

1302
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,020
You know, even at a concert, this would be a problem.

1303
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,020
You're not a sporting event, perhaps.

1304
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,020
But here it's what's the desire.

1305
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:19,020
Here's the poor employee that had to like indulge us with our face paint.

1306
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,020
How many times did you get a mustache?

1307
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:29,020
Honestly, like I had an annual pass and I did it every time for like a full like two years or something.

1308
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,020
Like it was a bit.

1309
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,020
It's not like a great part of my life.

1310
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,020
I don't I'm not proud of it, but I did it a lot.

1311
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,020
I did it like way too much.

1312
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,020
Like when I say that was a dark time in history, I mean, that was a mustache.

1313
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,020
Memes were a dark time in my personal history.

1314
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,020
I was very much like a mustache person.

1315
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,020
I thought mustaches were very funny.

1316
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,020
I thought it was funny that I had them painted on me.

1317
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,020
Looking back, I must cringe.

1318
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,020
I must cringe at my past self.

1319
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,020
But what are you going to do?

1320
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,020
I mustache.

1321
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,020
I don't think you should feel bad, though.

1322
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:04,020
I do think the volume that apparently exists of you with the mustache maybe does make it funny.

1323
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,020
Maybe if it was one off, you go, well, that wasn't the funniest thing in the world.

1324
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:11,020
But if you have like two years worth of pictures of it, I do kind of.

1325
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,020
I really have a lot.

1326
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,020
That's a pretty that's a commitment to a bit.

1327
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Yeah, that's a real.

1328
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:21,020
I mean, I am serious about committing to bits, so I guess I guess I haven't really changed.

1329
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:35,020
Which wouldn't you, though, you say it's a dark time if you were afforded the opportunity to safely go tomorrow to Disneyland, get a mustache and drink a lot.

1330
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,020
I mean, this this area you describe as dark.

1331
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,020
I can't lie.

1332
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:50,020
Do you have a recommendation of a restroom for a bunch of teenagers to take shots at the family restroom in the bugs world?

1333
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,020
Is it still there?

1334
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,020
Oh, it's gone.

1335
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,020
Oh, no, it's family restroom, though.

1336
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:01,020
If you can get one that's not like a main restroom, like one that you can lock the door and it's just you guys in there.

1337
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,020
That's the best place to go do shots.

1338
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:09,020
Well, that Tiki that Tiki room single single stall bathroom or is there maybe there's two.

1339
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:14,020
That's a little bit of a traffic area, though, but it is very small.

1340
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:20,020
I wouldn't I you can lock the stall in Carthay Circle, but you can't lock the door.

1341
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,020
Yeah.

1342
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:25,020
So I'm not sure I'd have to go do some recon here to find out.

1343
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:34,020
And you never encountered you never all came out and then had some employees say, wait a minute.

1344
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,020
What were you all doing in there?

1345
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:40,020
No one like ever said you smear week of booze and your name isn't Moxie.

1346
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,020
Is it?

1347
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,020
Show me your ID.

1348
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,020
Moxie.

1349
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,020
I'm not sure.

1350
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,020
I'm not sure.

1351
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
I'm not sure.

1352
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,020
I'm not sure.

1353
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,020
I'm not sure.

1354
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,020
I'm not sure.

1355
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,020
I'm not sure.

1356
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,020
I'm not sure.

1357
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,020
Moxie.

1358
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,020
Moxie.

1359
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,020
I knew I'd catch you again.

1360
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,020
You thought you would disguise yourself with that mustache.

1361
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,020
Nice try, Moxie.

1362
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,020
This is all what I thought would happen.

1363
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:09,020
If I was hanging out with you and I was a teen, I would have been like, oh, my God, they're going to know they're going to know you're not Moxie.

1364
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,020
I would like just be like freaked the whole thing.

1365
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,020
They fell for it.

1366
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,020
They thought my name was fucking Moxie.

1367
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,020
Those fucking losers.

1368
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,020
They believed every last word of it.

1369
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,020
Those fools.

1370
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,020
There's still people that go, you remember that Moxie?

1371
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,020
She was very nice.

1372
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,020
She had a mustache.

1373
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,020
There's a very special girl named Moxie.

1374
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:33,020
Another another fake name I got once was I just got Britannica on the back.

1375
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,020
Well, that's the long that they did it.

1376
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,020
Impressive.

1377
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,020
I picked a long one.

1378
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Yeah.

1379
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,020
Yeah, that's good.

1380
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
The stitcher.

1381
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,020
I'm it's like it's like Westworld.

1382
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:46,020
You know, you can go and have a new identity just for that day.

1383
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,020
It's a good point.

1384
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,020
We would do that.

1385
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:57,020
We would get drunk and like to talk to people in like British accents and stuff and like pretend we were we were just little annoying little trolls.

1386
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,020
But it was fun.

1387
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,020
That's yeah, that's a real teen bit.

1388
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,020
Yeah.

1389
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,020
Yeah.

1390
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:08,020
Or like the funny guy at the office just starts talking in a cockney accent for no reason.

1391
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,020
That would drive me up the wall of my old day.

1392
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,020
Just purely annoying.

1393
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:14,020
Like yeah, the opposite of charming.

1394
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,020
Yeah, I've had like guy who won't stop doing Stewie from Family Guy.

1395
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,020
That's pretty rough.

1396
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,020
Yeah.

1397
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:25,020
I've also had like guy who won't stop doing Jason Bateman from Dodgeball.

1398
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,020
Oh, specific.

1399
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,020
Why that one?

1400
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,020
Yeah, very specific.

1401
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,020
I was I was going to say, Scott, you bringing that up.

1402
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:39,020
I do have some pictures from when I went with the my my high school marching band at 18.

1403
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,020
I have my friend.

1404
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:46,020
Sober climbing all over like you were doing in the monorail.

1405
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,020
I mean, you might do that with even without.

1406
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:54,020
There are some alcohol for me to overcome my reverence for the place.

1407
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,020
That's really what it did.

1408
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:02,020
And knocked out my inhibition and my the inherent utmost respect that I have for monorails.

1409
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,020
Of course.

1410
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:09,020
And then I'm remembering because of Disney World, I actually think the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in my life is I've been in the

1411
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:19,020
I actually think the most drunk I ever was at a Disney park was two Disney World trips ago when I went with my friend Luke and his wife.

1412
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:27,020
I was a third in their vacation in there, not a quad, no sexual things, but a third in the vacation.

1413
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,020
And we were at the Abracadabra.

1414
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:37,020
And I think we may have had three Manhattans at the Abracadabra, which is right by a center right by.

1415
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,020
I can't think of the name of the entrance.

1416
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,020
Help me out here.

1417
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,020
The greatest entrance.

1418
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,020
The International Gateway, International Gateway, of course.

1419
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
And Kate, it's a magic themed bar.

1420
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,020
I know.

1421
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,020
Yeah.

1422
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,020
Thank you.

1423
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,020
Yes.

1424
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,020
It's fantastic.

1425
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,020
Could there be a magician doing a trick?

1426
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,020
Sure.

1427
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,020
But there's not.

1428
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,020
Oh, well.

1429
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:04,020
But Luke and I, Luke's wife had gone to the bathroom and Luke and I were sitting there and there's a woman with her husband and they had been drinking.

1430
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:10,020
And this woman came over and was significantly older than us.

1431
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:20,020
And in front of this man, and we assume was some sort of a partner, just started hitting on us, basically propositioning us.

1432
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:26,020
And like an insane and like kind of like insulting Luke's wife as well in the process.

1433
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,020
We were like in what regard?

1434
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,020
Like what?

1435
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
Like a day?

1436
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,020
Nothing.

1437
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,020
As far as insulting, like was nothing major.

1438
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:38,020
But like it felt like dismissive, maybe dismissive is a better word.

1439
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:43,020
Like kind of like, oh, like you both of you are very attractive, both of you are very handsome.

1440
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,020
Like who's that?

1441
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,020
Who's that?

1442
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,020
Who's that woman over there?

1443
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,020
And we were like, we were with it enough to know what was going on.

1444
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:58,020
And then the guy was just like in the conversation, like enjoying it or just helpless to stop it.

1445
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:05,020
And I remember Luke's wife came back out and like we just we bolted as fast as we could.

1446
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:12,020
And we're like trying to like instill to this day, we're trying to actually figure out the series of events that led to this.

1447
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:17,020
Like because we're trying to piece it together of like we didn't talk to this woman before because we were leaving.

1448
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:21,020
We just stood up and then this woman started to hit on us.

1449
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,020
And so we're still preventing this.

1450
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,020
There's one event in this series.

1451
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:29,020
The event is you guys being friggin hunks.

1452
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,020
Don't sell yourself short.

1453
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,020
All right. Well, thank you.

1454
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,020
I appreciate that.

1455
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,020
We're both about six three.

1456
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,020
We're both from the Midwest.

1457
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,020
I don't know.

1458
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,020
Yeah.

1459
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,020
Corn fed.

1460
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,020
Corn fed hunks.

1461
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,020
We're both corn fed hunks in our mid thirties.

1462
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,020
Hunks of corn.

1463
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,020
Yeah.

1464
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:53,020
They were fed so much corn that they got so so tall like a corn stock.

1465
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,020
That's my problem.

1466
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,020
I do.

1467
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:03,020
Every time I hear the term corn fed, I just think of like boys getting like force fed tons of corn.

1468
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,020
That's the picture it conjures.

1469
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,020
What feels like an animal.

1470
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,020
It was like a thing.

1471
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,020
And like milk.

1472
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,020
For some reason, like milk and corn.

1473
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:16,020
Like I picture like a big bowl of corn with like a big jug of milk and like that's all you eat.

1474
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:20,020
I definitely drank a lot of milk and ate a lot of corn.

1475
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:25,020
That's what it feels like being someone from like Southern California, like L.A. area.

1476
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,020
I'm like I've never I had never been to the Midwest.

1477
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:31,020
I just thought that's what corn fed meant.

1478
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,020
I don't think that's totally wrong.

1479
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,020
It's not.

1480
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,020
Yeah.

1481
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,020
School lunch came with carton of milk every day.

1482
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,020
Milk with cereal for breakfast.

1483
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,020
Milk with a glass of milk with dinner.

1484
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,020
Yeah.

1485
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,020
Sounds gross.

1486
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,020
Oh, yeah.

1487
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,020
Yeah.

1488
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,020
Would we ever you know, this episode.

1489
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,020
It's called drinking at Disneyland.

1490
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:55,020
And yet we've made the leap that this is about, you know, adult libations.

1491
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:00,020
We could have devoted a whole lot of this episode and still could to all the various milks that you could drink.

1492
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,020
So many milks.

1493
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,020
There's a lot of milk.

1494
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,020
Yeah.

1495
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:10,020
I don't mean that Star Wars stuff like that's that doesn't technically I want to I want like cartons of milk.

1496
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:18,020
Well, that's something we figured out a few years ago where if you just want a little snack, you can order the kids meal or once or twice a day.

1497
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,020
Once or twice.

1498
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:27,020
I've seen Mike order the toddler meal, which is usually just a scoop or two of mac and cheese and a carton of milk, maybe some apple slices.

1499
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Well, what I'll do is I'll I will order that if it's an app in app because I don't want to say toddler meal because I don't have a child.

1500
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:42,020
But if it's in the app and I can just like I can just place the order and then pick it up, then I don't have to actually like say it's a child's meal or the toddler meal.

1501
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:49,020
And if I get to go in a couple years, you can use my son as a cover and get your milk.

1502
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,020
Scott Scott Scott Scott.

1503
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,020
Give me the kid. Give me the kid.

1504
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,020
Give me the kid.

1505
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,020
Hey, here we go.

1506
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,020
You run.

1507
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,020
It's free.

1508
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,020
It's for him.

1509
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,020
Hey, it's for this this this thing.

1510
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,020
This kid.

1511
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:07,020
I hear him by one arm using the app with the other dragging him along the ground.

1512
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,020
Yeah, not for me.

1513
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,020
It's for him.

1514
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,020
Well, Mike, this is kind of breaking new.

1515
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,020
I just got this changes.

1516
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:18,020
Texted this to me coming to McDonald's Disney World Happy Meals.

1517
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,020
I know I know all about this.

1518
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:28,020
OK, there is a series of McDonald's Happy Meal toys to commemorate, I think, the 50th anniversary of Disney World.

1519
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,020
And it's you know, they very much they very much seem like stuff we collected when we were kids.

1520
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:36,020
But it'll be like Mickey and the Tower of Terror at McDonald's.

1521
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,020
Wow.

1522
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,020
Which is very exciting to see the parks represented at McDonald's.

1523
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,020
I think those are appearing soon.

1524
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,020
You know what they should have?

1525
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:52,020
You know what they should have as a Happy Meal is the the now non-existent McDonald's french fry booth outside of

1526
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,020
Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1527
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,020
They should have a toy.

1528
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,020
Yeah, like Westwood.

1529
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,020
They should have a toy of that of that little cart that used to sell McDonald's french fries.

1530
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:08,020
Yeah, I think at the time people thought that was a little odd.

1531
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,020
But now I think we're almost nostalgic for that.

1532
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:15,020
It was like I was so sad when that went away.

1533
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,020
But you know, they replaced it with like the they put the chimichangas there and those are pretty good.

1534
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:24,020
So, yes, correctly, it says Westward.

1535
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,020
I guess that's not it.

1536
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,020
That's not at Disney World.

1537
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,020
So it wouldn't count for the 50th anniversary.

1538
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,020
Happy Meal.

1539
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,020
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

1540
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,020
Yeah, this was this was my one of my favorite spots.

1541
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,020
This french fries stand.

1542
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,020
You could just get french fries and drinks.

1543
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,020
Yeah.

1544
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,020
Whoa.

1545
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:44,020
And it says there's gold in them.

1546
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,020
Darf.

1547
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,020
I didn't know that.

1548
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,020
Wow.

1549
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,020
That's great.

1550
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,020
Wow.

1551
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,020
Yeah.

1552
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:56,020
Well, if you want to do the the full episode about the french fry cart.

1553
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,020
Yeah, we're ready to go on and on.

1554
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,020
I have a lot to say about that cart.

1555
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:04,020
One of the best carts in all the land.

1556
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,020
It's that's also that's the era.

1557
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:11,020
And I like now Disneyland especially has gotten so crazy expensive.

1558
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:18,020
And I know like, you know, getting a drink and having annual pass all nice privilege we all have usually been able to afford.

1559
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:25,020
But ten years ago, it was such a different money landscape for Disney.

1560
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:34,020
Like the annual passes, they were just given away like you could basically get an annual pass and go a decent amount for like slightly over a day ticket.

1561
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:38,020
And now it's like 50 times that amount of money.

1562
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:45,020
So I romanticize that era, too, of when I had first come to L.A. and was going to SoCal resident.

1563
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:53,020
When my family came to visit like once or twice the first time, they would get like a few day park hoppers and we'd go down there.

1564
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,020
And then they're like, oh, you live here.

1565
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,020
You can turn this into an annual pass.

1566
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,020
I was like, what? And they're like, yeah, this pays like 30 bucks.

1567
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,020
I was like, OK, and then you just have an annual pass for a year.

1568
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:09,020
Yeah, it was it was fantastic that that era.

1569
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:12,020
It was like Six Flags where like they were cheap.

1570
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,020
Yeah.

1571
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:31,020
Yeah, I'm nostalgic for the time before I paid, you know, nearly a thousand dollars upfront for an annual pass to a place that now has been closed for eight months.

1572
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:37,020
Because of the conference, the conference, the conference.

1573
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:43,020
I like if I just hadn't gone that one day, I don't know what I mean.

1574
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,020
At this point, it's becoming it's like starting to loop around the full year.

1575
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:52,020
So maybe I just get it back or most of it or or I can go so far into the future.

1576
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:57,020
There's rumors now because Tokyo Disney is canceling annual passes.

1577
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:03,020
They're just canceling the program and people are thinking it's possible they do that here for a little while.

1578
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:07,020
So who knows? I'm not saying what comes of me.

1579
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,020
They're going to they just going to take my money to get it back.

1580
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,020
Probably broke. Aren't they?

1581
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,020
Aren't they running out of money?

1582
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:20,020
They've already have my money, so they're not going to give it back to me willingly.

1583
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:23,020
Well, Tokyo is refunding everyone with the passes.

1584
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Yeah, I mean, we'll refund here if that's what they're doing.

1585
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:33,020
But I think Disney is getting cash for the Oriental Land Company that runs Tokyo.

1586
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:40,020
Disney might have more cash on hand and the ability to just refund it, especially if they have like government subsidies.

1587
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,020
So, yeah, I don't know.

1588
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:49,020
I'm very curious to see if Disneyland would cancel the annual pass program because I feel like it would just make everyone even matter.

1589
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,020
They can't do that. I feel like they can't.

1590
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,020
They won't do that.

1591
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,020
I don't know.

1592
01:19:53,020 --> 01:20:04,020
Well, their business model out here at Disneyland is like 70, 30, 80, 20 locals going to Disneyland, which is what Florida has become.

1593
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,020
Usually it's the reverse in Florida. It's mostly tourists and a small percentage of locals.

1594
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:13,020
But, yeah, it'll be interesting when the parks reopen out here.

1595
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:19,020
Can I talk about a way that Disney could maybe get some of this money back in their pockets?

1596
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,020
And we've touched upon this here and there.

1597
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:36,020
The idea, this general thing of that you can drink in downtown Disney and you can drink in California Adventure, but you cannot drink in Disneyland Park proper unless you are sneaking it into a restroom.

1598
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:42,020
Doesn't it seem like if they're going to bring it back, isn't now the time?

1599
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,020
Like, why not?

1600
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:46,020
Obviously, they started doing it in Galaxy's Edge.

1601
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:51,020
That's the tradition is starting to crumble a little bit.

1602
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,020
Why not?

1603
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:58,020
I feel like people will be so ready and so excited to drink in Disneyland.

1604
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,020
And I wanted to bring up this question.

1605
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:07,020
Drinking spots, if you could put some spots into Disneyland proper.

1606
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,020
And, you know, space is limited.

1607
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:12,020
It doesn't always have to be a sit down restaurant.

1608
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,020
We know they can't build those super easy.

1609
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:18,020
But we were just looking at the Westward Home McDonald's fry cart.

1610
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:25,020
If there was this kind of thing for beers or adult sarsaparilla or what have you.

1611
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:31,020
I mean, like, are there places where you wish you could get a drink themed to the land that you're in?

1612
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:36,020
I mean, a Pirates of the Caribbean bar would be like so perfect.

1613
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,020
You could get like rum drinks and like.

1614
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:48,020
I mean, putting it, you could put that like in the New Orleans square, like where all the pins, pin shops and shit.

1615
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:53,020
Just knock out one of those overpriced jewelry stores and put in a bar.

1616
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,020
Yeah, yeah, yes.

1617
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:00,020
Yeah, I mean, they already have the like alcohol free mint juleps.

1618
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,020
That's an easy switch over.

1619
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,020
Once that white you want a non alcoholic.

1620
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:13,020
That just seems like I mean, if you're a youngster perhaps, but like just like to use the name,

1621
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:18,020
there's something about creating a new mocktail idea that's interesting.

1622
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:24,020
And but like to take something that you know is supposed to have alcohol and just not have it seems odd.

1623
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:30,020
It's we I think I've said all this before in piecemeal on the in the last three years of the podcast.

1624
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:34,020
But yes, it like mint julep with alcohol.

1625
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:40,020
You can get a beer at the Golden Horseshoe or at a restaurant over by Big Thunder.

1626
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:49,020
I think I've even proposed the idea of leveling that restaurant and making a like a double decker restaurant of some kind, like a saloon that you can overlook.

1627
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,020
Yes, indeed.

1628
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,020
Yes.

1629
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,020
Yes.

1630
01:22:54,020 --> 01:23:05,020
Some sort of observation deck in Tomorrowland where you can get a neon blue gloatini with a little cube that lights up and you get any overlook Tomorrowland in the park.

1631
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,020
That's a slam dunk.

1632
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:11,020
And then there's one more and I'm trying to think of what what it is.

1633
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,020
Jungle Cruise.

1634
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,020
Jungle. Yes.

1635
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:28,020
By the new area, the new tropical hideaway is a perfect place for a small variety of tiki drinks similar to Trader Sam's and do the mugs, do the sell the mugs as well.

1636
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,020
But they're different mugs.

1637
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,020
You got to go in park to get these mugs.

1638
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,020
This is all slam dunk stuff.

1639
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,020
And you don't have to don't let maybe don't allow it.

1640
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:41,020
Walk around if you really need to like ease ease into this more.

1641
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:45,020
You just have it be like local like in the in the actual.

1642
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:58,020
Do like similar to like Ogo's that method like you know sure if an hour in there or something if you need to if they're concerned about like IDing people or that sort of stuff.

1643
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:04,020
I mean, I recognize that there are a lot of minors and people underage who go to Disneyland alone or whatever.

1644
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:07,020
And and it's safe and it's comfortable.

1645
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,020
And so I get that concern.

1646
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:16,020
I think there's a lot of pearl clutching on the topic of like alcohol going in the park walk Walt walked in.

1647
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,020
But what was a lush?

1648
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:23,020
I mean, I've had a lot of his drink is like pure like gasoline.

1649
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:30,020
It's scotch over crushed ice with a twist of lemon rind.

1650
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:34,020
And it's it's like this is just drinking scotch.

1651
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,020
I thought it would be.

1652
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:40,020
I thought it's I just ordered it because like it said it was Walt's drink and I didn't even read the description.

1653
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:44,020
But it's like it's just drinking scotch.

1654
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:48,020
Yeah, it's just scotch over ice, which is is a drink I like to have.

1655
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:59,020
I am again a total lightweight so I can have one at Disneyland if I'm driving because I maybe if it may be a second if I'm like walking around and eating a big meal for hours.

1656
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:01,020
Kate, I do agree with what you said.

1657
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,020
I just eat all day.

1658
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,020
I just burn off the calories from walking around so much.

1659
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,020
I'm just constantly eating.

1660
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:15,020
I just started packing Clif bars more when I go to the parks because I'm like I cannot spend money on like a shitty sandwich.

1661
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,020
You know, they're not shitty.

1662
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,020
None of the food there is shitty.

1663
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,020
How dare you?

1664
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,020
Some of the food is magical.

1665
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:27,020
It can be magical and also like you got the best drunk food.

1666
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:35,020
While I'm thinking of it is the hot Cheeto esque mac and cheese cone at the.

1667
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:38,020
Yes, at the cozy cones.

1668
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,020
That's my go to like I'm drunk.

1669
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,020
It's the end of the day.

1670
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,020
I need to eat something.

1671
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,020
I love those cones.

1672
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,020
They're so good.

1673
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,020
And I like that.

1674
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:51,020
And they're like you can eat while you're eating them.

1675
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:59,020
I know how this could be 50 percent better, but there's something very satisfying about the texture of the bread in the cone.

1676
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:03,020
That's like very satisfying to eat when now it's like not the best tasting bread.

1677
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,020
But you do like there.

1678
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,020
I don't just something in your mouth.

1679
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,020
It's nice.

1680
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:12,020
The bread is so like pillowy and like yes, just good.

1681
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
It's so good.

1682
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:18,020
And I'll get like the chili in there once in a while.

1683
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,020
That's very good.

1684
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,020
Jack. Yeah, Jack.

1685
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,020
I like to get one of each and we try we try each other's.

1686
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,020
That's the cone method that we do.

1687
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:37,020
One of my sleeper favorite drinks is at one of those cozy cones, which is the the lime made with vodka in it with the.

1688
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,020
Our alcoholic cones.

1689
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,020
Yes.

1690
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:43,020
The pomegranate is like a pomegranate foam on the top as well.

1691
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:48,020
It's like a sugar foam that I love.

1692
01:26:48,020 --> 01:27:04,020
Scott and Kate, you guys grew up here and I don't know when California Adventure was opening where people scandalized by like this park across from Disneyland will have libations or was it just like, well, we know Epcot and MGM studios have it in Florida.

1693
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:07,020
So, yeah, I guess it makes sense if our second park has it.

1694
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:17,020
Well, I'm happy to say I was in high school and I was not in any source of place that would be scandalized by this idea.

1695
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:25,020
I'm thrilled to say I mean, I wouldn't put it past myself to be checking some lame message board, but it was certainly not in the newspaper.

1696
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,020
I don't think it was a big deal.

1697
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,020
I think it was my mom is like loves like Chardonnay.

1698
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:37,020
I'm sure like and I went with her and I think I remember her getting one and not thinking it was weird.

1699
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,020
Oh, yeah.

1700
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,020
What am I saying?

1701
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:42,020
They for the marketing of the first one was like we got Robert.

1702
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:45,020
It was very like it was very wine, California wine centric.

1703
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,020
Yeah.

1704
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:58,020
Although I have a I have a quick anecdote about the opening of California Adventures because I was like went there like before they I went there right when it opened with my parents because they got divorced.

1705
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:07,020
Okay, my parents like said that we have to have a family meeting and I like, you know, find out they're like getting divorced.

1706
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:17,020
And then as I'm like a crying like 11 year old child, I'm like I say like, I thought when you said we're having a family meeting, I thought we were going to go to Disneyland.

1707
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:22,020
And then my parents like stop like what they're doing and say, okay, well, let's go to Disneyland.

1708
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:32,020
And then as like freshly divorced couple, we all pile into a car with my like newly divorced parents and like go to Disneyland as like a family.

1709
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,020
And it was very awkward.

1710
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,020
It was the day that they told us.

1711
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:47,020
And as a weird like curve ball, we get there and Disneyland is like, well, if you go to California Adventures and go to Disneyland another day, we'll give you a free ticket.

1712
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:51,020
So because they were like trying to get people to go to California Adventures and not Disneyland.

1713
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:59,020
So like the first time I went to California Adventures, I was like crying the whole time because my parents had just told us they were getting divorced but still insisted that we all go.

1714
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:07,020
And it was like so fucked up and I like hated California Adventures for years because I like associated it with my parents divorce.

1715
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:13,020
And like really the only way I was able the only way I came back to it was as like a teen getting blackout drunk.

1716
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:18,020
So actually, I feel like I just had therapy and this all makes sense now.

1717
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,020
You know why you that's a very good reason.

1718
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,020
That's insane.

1719
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:24,020
Well, and what a weird you've been to like, all right, fine, we'll go to Disneyland.

1720
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:29,020
Well, you know, you could all come back again sometime, you know, all of you as a family together.

1721
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,020
Just come back.

1722
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,020
The second time my dad didn't go.

1723
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:34,020
So.

1724
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,020
So.

1725
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,020
Oh, man.

1726
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,020
Whoa.

1727
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,020
This is heavy stuff.

1728
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,020
It was just my mom that time.

1729
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,020
My newly single mom.

1730
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,020
Wow.

1731
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:52,020
That was the primary demographic of California Adventure the first couple of years was children of divorce and divorced dads going like, where do I take them?

1732
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,020
This one's cheap.

1733
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,020
This is like Disneyland.

1734
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,020
Is this right?

1735
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,020
I don't know.

1736
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,020
I got a lot of my mind.

1737
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,020
It wasn't like fully fleshed out as a theme park yet.

1738
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:05,020
Like it hadn't really it had like such a small amount of rides.

1739
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:12,020
It had the the roller coaster and then this ride called Mulholland Madness that they got rid of.

1740
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:17,020
And then like the the Ferris wheel had like almost nothing.

1741
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:21,020
It was just like a weird sad theme park.

1742
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:26,020
I was expecting to go to it was first of all expecting to go to Disneyland, then found out my parents got divorced.

1743
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:30,020
Then I found out then I expected to go to Disneyland again.

1744
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,020
And then it ended up being California Adventures.

1745
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:38,020
It's like a metaphor for the rest of your childhood.

1746
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:42,020
Like you thought it would be Disneyland and instead it was early California.

1747
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:47,020
It was first couple years without even the Tower of Terror California.

1748
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,020
No Tower of Terror.

1749
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,020
Yeah.

1750
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,020
That's wild.

1751
01:30:51,020 --> 01:31:00,020
I feel like I will always if I'm looking at photos of like barely themed scaffolding and a dinosaur thing sunglasses, I will think of divorce.

1752
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:06,020
Kate, do you remember a ride going on a ride that day called Superstar Limo?

1753
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:13,020
No, but I feel like that rings like some vague bell.

1754
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:24,020
It's a it's a it was very quickly changed, but it's one of the I guess probably one of the least or least liked rides in the history of parks.

1755
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:28,020
Yeah, it was a it's now the Monsters Inc ride.

1756
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,020
And it was basically like you're going through Hollywood.

1757
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,020
There's Drew Carey.

1758
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,020
There's Jackie Chan.

1759
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,020
And it's like there are like these weird caricatures.

1760
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,020
No, I didn't go in that one.

1761
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,020
I did do the the American Idol experience.

1762
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,020
I think was around that time.

1763
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:47,020
Yeah, was that in or was that in California?

1764
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:51,020
Do we have that in Disneyland or the American Idol experience?

1765
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:55,020
Yeah, that was definitely at MGM Studios.

1766
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,020
I was thinking millionaire.

1767
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,020
Oh, maybe a million.

1768
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,020
Yeah, maybe that's what it was.

1769
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:02,020
Who wants to be a millionaire at California Adventures?

1770
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,020
Yeah, that's what it was.

1771
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:05,020
That was that was there.

1772
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,020
That was there.

1773
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,020
That was that we did that when my parents got divorced.

1774
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,020
That that was there.

1775
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:20,020
You know, in Superstar Limo, you can pass by weird dummies of Melanie Griffith and Antonio Menderes, who are now also divorced.

1776
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,020
Wow.

1777
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,020
Oh, there you go.

1778
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:26,020
50 50 odds the last few decades.

1779
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,020
So, you know, what are you going to do?

1780
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:33,020
I'm trying to think before you go.

1781
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:36,020
Oh, can I add one more to the like what where there should be drinks?

1782
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,020
And I can't believe we hadn't thought about this before.

1783
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,020
The Mark Twain.

1784
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:46,020
If that if the Mark Twain was a booze cruise, dear lord.

1785
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,020
That's where you put the mint juleps.

1786
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,020
Yes, with alcohol, finally where it belongs.

1787
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,020
Do you think they sell on Mark Twain?

1788
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:58,020
I think for safety purposes, maybe you sell right outside.

1789
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:03,020
You buy it and then you board the Mark Twain because you don't want maybe for time purposes.

1790
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:06,020
There's not enough time to get everybody a drink.

1791
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,020
Right.

1792
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:12,020
And then also like old booze while you're waiting there, which is just this kind of weird corral anyway.

1793
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,020
That's very boring.

1794
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,020
Right.

1795
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,020
Yeah.

1796
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,020
Jason, are you offended by this notion?

1797
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,020
No, I kind of like that.

1798
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:22,020
That one, I think for safety's sake, everyone only gets one.

1799
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:25,020
Like that's the only time for one.

1800
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,020
Yeah, it's only like a 10 or 12 minute lap around.

1801
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:33,020
So but I'm saying the bartenders will only like a bartender who says I can only give you two.

1802
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:43,020
Like, you know, as if you were buying for yourself and your guest or your date or whatever, like some bars won't fill your like you take a tray of stuff.

1803
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:46,020
Like if they were like, I can only give you two, buddy.

1804
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,020
So that people aren't getting sloshed and falling off a riverboat.

1805
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,020
No deal.

1806
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,020
I want seven shots and I'm jumping.

1807
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,020
I'm swimming the rest of the way.

1808
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,020
I think it's a limited menu service bar.

1809
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,020
I'm sorry to sorry to break it to you.

1810
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,020
And you can't.

1811
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,020
Not if I get back there.

1812
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,020
Not if I bust.

1813
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:16,020
So I get one drink that gives me the confidence to go back and steal the entire bottle, run around the ship, take command of the ship, blow the whistle and then perfectly swan dive into the river.

1814
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:29,020
Well, that's what some message board like people are afraid of that they will be like when Flanders orders a single white wine spritzer and wakes up married the next day in a destroyed hotel room.

1815
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:39,020
Well, here let's that brings me to the last thing I wanted to bring up, which is the like when we talk about like where does all this come from this odd like like no, no, no.

1816
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,020
You cannot drink in the Magic Kingdom.

1817
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:51,020
Now you can if you pay for this expensive club or if you're a guest from someone there and you can drink right outside of the Magic Kingdom, but you cannot drink in Walt's special place.

1818
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,020
I was like, where does this actually come from?

1819
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:58,020
And this is discussed on some message boards and they find an actual quote.

1820
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,020
This is from 1956 and somebody is asking Walt Disney.

1821
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:06,020
Why is your park different than like a carnival?

1822
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:16,020
And he says, we got no liquor, no beer, nothing, because that brings in a rowdy element that brings in people that we don't want and I feel they don't need it.

1823
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:19,020
I feel when I go down to the park, I don't need a drink.

1824
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,020
I work around that place all day and I don't have one.

1825
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:28,020
After I come out of a heavy day at the studio, some sometimes I want a drink to relax.

1826
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,020
And then that's an odd out of context.

1827
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,020
It cuts off there.

1828
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:37,020
He may have just like gone on to talk about how much he loves drinking for several paragraphs and I don't know.

1829
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:40,020
But that's the source.

1830
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:53,020
This is what we've been picking apart for a long time, much like something out of the U.S. Constitution where we've spent decades like, well, what does it really mean and how can we stretch that?

1831
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,020
What did the originalists say?

1832
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,020
The originalists.

1833
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,020
These are like Amy Coney Barrett with Walt and Disneyland.

1834
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:07,020
These are the originalists who are trying to see that as gospel versus a document that should be changed or a philosophy that can be changed.

1835
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:12,020
I think that if what the stupidest thing I've said this before, I think.

1836
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:17,020
But like, OK, if you want to say this is a family place, there's no alcohol in the grounds.

1837
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:19,020
I really can't argue with that.

1838
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,020
No alcohol. Fine.

1839
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:27,020
But if you can get alcohol five at a five minute walk from the entrance to Disneyland, what are we doing here?

1840
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,020
What fake thing are we upholding?

1841
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,020
Yeah.

1842
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:32,020
You know, like the Uva bar is not far.

1843
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,020
California Avengers not far.

1844
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,020
What are we doing here?

1845
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:37,020
I agree with that.

1846
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:42,020
I agree even to some extent with the Walt Disney quote of like the park is rich enough.

1847
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,020
It's substantial enough.

1848
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,020
You don't need this.

1849
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,020
Of course.

1850
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:48,020
We we think, of course.

1851
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:55,020
On the other hand, it's it does feel like a quote of its time because it's like, well, you had a tobaccoist on Main Street.

1852
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,020
Like people were just smoking everywhere.

1853
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,020
You didn't have gum like this park was designed by your pet peeves.

1854
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,020
There was no gum.

1855
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:10,020
But God forbid if people couldn't have us light up a delicious Chesterfield, people had nicotine coursing through their veins.

1856
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,020
Women were getting fitted for brassieres on Main Street.

1857
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:16,020
Like it was crazy back then.

1858
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:22,020
The idea that you could have a sugar the craziest thing you could do a sugary cocktail in Disneyland.

1859
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,020
Come on.

1860
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,020
Yeah.

1861
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,020
Yeah.

1862
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:35,020
Also, and I'll credit this YouTube channel called Midway to Main Street that made actually a great video that proved that it lands kind of where we're landing.

1863
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:39,020
The video is called Alcohol at Disneyland, the letter versus spirit of Walt's wishes.

1864
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,020
Oh, my God.

1865
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,020
Come on.

1866
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:47,020
We really are in like not just Constitution, but like biblical territory.

1867
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:52,020
We're picking apart the old text, the sacred text and the sacred Jedi text.

1868
01:37:52,020 --> 01:38:05,020
And he makes the point that, well, if we're being countered to carnivals and carnies, apparently that's why Walt didn't want people to have facial hair in the early days.

1869
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:08,020
Was that like, well, because carnies have.

1870
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:11,020
Are you still not allowed to have facial hair?

1871
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,020
No, you can.

1872
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,020
No, you can now.

1873
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,020
Yeah, it has to be.

1874
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,020
Right.

1875
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:19,020
OK, I guess Disney didn't find anything funny about mustaches.

1876
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,020
So sad.

1877
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,020
So sad.

1878
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:31,020
I went, you know, when I worked at Universal Studios, they like I had some review where they docked me for facial hair, which I think is the most funny thing I've ever done.

1879
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:42,020
I've never had the ability to grow, but I was like, seeing if I could and I had some just some weird speckles and and they said, Well, yeah, you just can't have the facial hair.

1880
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:44,020
And I was like, wait, you have a full beard, though, right?

1881
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,020
Yes.

1882
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,020
And then are you or you could be clean shaven.

1883
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:48,020
Yes.

1884
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:50,020
So it's but what do I do in between?

1885
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,020
I don't know.

1886
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:52,020
You know, like, I don't know.

1887
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,020
I mean, yeah, it's a weird thing.

1888
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:56,020
You know, I mean, I'm like, you know, you know, I'm not like that.

1889
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:57,020
Yes.

1890
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,020
And then are you or you could be clean shaven.

1891
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,020
Yes.

1892
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,020
So it's but what do I do in between?

1893
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,020
Well, I don't know.

1894
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,020
I guess you just can't be here.

1895
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,020
Yeah.

1896
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,020
You have to grow the full beard before you can come back to work.

1897
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:11,020
I was so confused by that paradox.

1898
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:19,020
Was there like a Mr. Universal in 1930 said, you know, you can't have someone working here with an in between facial hair.

1899
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,020
You've got to figure out the spirit and the letter.

1900
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:28,020
Carl Lemley, Carl, somebody's picking apart his letter in spirit.

1901
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,020
Who cares?

1902
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:30,020
That's the thing about Walt.

1903
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:33,020
At the end of the day, like, who's he?

1904
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,020
We don't got to listen to him.

1905
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,020
He's an old racist guy.

1906
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:42,020
Like, much like the U.S. Constitution itself.

1907
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,020
Amen.

1908
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,020
That brings us back to that point.

1909
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,020
All right.

1910
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,020
Everyone make sure to vote this coming Tuesday.

1911
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,020
Yeah.

1912
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:53,020
Everybody who's listening to this, make sure that you get out there on Tuesday and vote.

1913
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,020
When's this coming out again?

1914
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,020
I think it's going to work.

1915
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:59,020
Let's check each other's calendars anyway.

1916
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:01,020
Get out there on Tuesday and make sure that you vote.

1917
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:05,020
Vote early, vote often, you know.

1918
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:12,020
Anything else we want to shout out in terms of on the way out here, specific cocktails, specific things we like?

1919
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,020
Yes.

1920
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,020
Yes.

1921
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:22,020
One of my favorites and maybe my favorite of all the fun, colorful drinks I like, Mickey's Fun Wheel.

1922
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:25,020
I believe you can still get it.

1923
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,020
It was at the formerly the Cove Bar.

1924
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,020
Now it's the Lamp Lighter.

1925
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,020
Is that right, Jason?

1926
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:33,020
Yeah. Lamp Lighter Lounge.

1927
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,020
Lamp Lighter Lounge.

1928
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:38,020
And that had multiple colors to it.

1929
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:39,020
Scott, do you know what I'm talking about?

1930
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:47,020
Yes, because I have it pulled up in a tab to Lamp Light Lounge.

1931
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:48,020
Gorgeous.

1932
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:51,020
It's a beautiful drink.

1933
01:40:51,020 --> 01:41:01,020
The thing that I, the story when we went there together is that the thing at the bottom, whatever it is at the very bottom, I think does not have alcohol.

1934
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,020
And maybe it's just pineapple juice.

1935
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:09,020
And you got the drink and just started sucking right from the bottom and then were saying, this is my favorite drink.

1936
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:12,020
And then the bartender came and said, oh, actually, you're supposed to mix it up.

1937
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,020
And then I think they might have done it for you.

1938
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:15,020
And then you were really disappointed.

1939
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:18,020
They probably did it for you.

1940
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:19,020
You're helpless.

1941
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:26,020
You're the large, you're the tall man, as we've established from the corn and your hands are clumsy sometimes.

1942
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:31,020
I like the idea that the waiter or waitress at the bar.

1943
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,020
I'll do it.

1944
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,020
And swirled it for me.

1945
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,020
Yes, I do like that idea.

1946
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:36,020
That may be.

1947
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:37,020
I guess that part doesn't seem accurate.

1948
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:41,020
But it must have been then that you swirled it and then you were like.

1949
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:44,020
Well, because the problem is, yes, I think you're right.

1950
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:47,020
I think the bottom is just sugar or something, juice or something.

1951
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:56,020
But I wanted to maintain the fun because basically it's like there's a very light blue at the top, like a thicker, more opaque blue under it.

1952
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,020
Then there's a red.

1953
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:58,020
Then there's a yellow.

1954
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:03,020
I wanted to keep that cool color look going the whole time I was drinking it.

1955
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:09,020
But to get a much more smooth taste, you should mix it all together.

1956
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:17,020
So I was trying to just go level by level, which probably you get less of a fulfilling experience that way.

1957
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:20,020
But you get to still get your color levels.

1958
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:32,020
I thought this was of the same ilk of thing as you having what you called one of your favorite drinks you ever had at Bubba Gump and then discovering there was zero alcohol in it.

1959
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,020
Yes. So that's true, Kate.

1960
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:39,020
So two years ago we went and I thought I had ordered an alcoholic drink with it with added fun colors.

1961
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:44,020
And it was, as Eva Anderson put it, you just ordered an ice cream smoothie.

1962
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:46,020
Wow.

1963
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:51,020
So, yes, I didn't realize it until later that there I was like, I don't think I'm feeling anything.

1964
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,020
I don't think there was alcohol in that.

1965
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:59,020
Oh, I had a drink I wanted to shout out, and I think you can still get it down there.

1966
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:06,020
But it was specifically kind of angled for when Cars Land was opening.

1967
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,020
And it's a beer.

1968
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:11,020
It's a racer five IPA.

1969
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:13,020
And that's pretty easy to find in California.

1970
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:20,020
I think it is a California brewery makes it and it's just a very solid beer, but it's got like a race car on it.

1971
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,020
So we're like, we'll serve this around the car stuff.

1972
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,020
And I was like, I admire that's a great attention to detail.

1973
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,020
You know what?

1974
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:29,020
I've been sitting on it the whole time.

1975
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:34,020
And since you bring it up, I did for this and I haven't been drinking due to a headache.

1976
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:36,020
That's that's how cool I am right now.

1977
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:42,020
But I do got a red trolley ale right here, which is my favorite thing to get what I miss so much having in Cars Land.

1978
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:44,020
I'll open it up at the end here.

1979
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:52,020
Also, I love that thematically that you can get on a red trolley in California Adventure and the and the rocks are red.

1980
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,020
I've said it many times.

1981
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:57,020
I don't have to keep saying that I like this beer in Cars Land.

1982
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:02,020
What I got to do is open it up and have some drink.

1983
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:04,020
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1984
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:06,020
Anything else you want to shout out?

1985
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:10,020
You know, I feel like it's all all the drinks I like have been covered.

1986
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:19,020
But shout out to to just the people that go to the Carthay Circle Bar and go by themselves.

1987
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:24,020
Because one time I did that and it was lovely and I just hung out of the bar by myself and had a drink.

1988
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:32,020
So shout out to all the the lonely Carthay Circle Bar bar hoppers.

1989
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,020
Bar bar bar flies.

1990
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:38,020
Same time, which we hope we can do again.

1991
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:40,020
Hello stranger.

1992
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:43,020
Well, can I briefly I'm sure I've said this before.

1993
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:48,020
I was at the sometimes I've done a show at WonderCon, which is over the convention center.

1994
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:51,020
And I'll take the opportunity to go down early.

1995
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,020
And like if I'm doing a comedy bit or something, I'll work on it at one of the bars.

1996
01:44:54,020 --> 01:45:01,020
And I went into Trader Sam's at noon and a guy came in and the bartender was like, hey, Joe, how are you?

1997
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:03,020
What do you have in the usual?

1998
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:08,020
And I was like, wow, that's all I want.

1999
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:10,020
Yes, boy.

2000
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:17,020
I saw that at Napa Rose once the bar at Napa Rose at the Grand California.

2001
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:21,020
And yeah, it was clearly the regulars going.

2002
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:25,020
That's a that's a big spender regular.

2003
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,020
He looked like he was ready to spend money.

2004
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:30,020
Yeah, they got fancy stuff.

2005
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,020
They got fancy stuff.

2006
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:36,020
And in looking up that place, they have a cigar menu.

2007
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:38,020
I did not realize.

2008
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,020
Wow.

2009
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:41,020
Oh, evidently.

2010
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,020
We're going to have to do cigars at Disneyland soon.

2011
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,020
You got to.

2012
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:48,020
That's the traditional spirit of the letter of the law.

2013
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,020
Yeah.

2014
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,020
Oh, yeah.

2015
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:51,020
He has no problem.

2016
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,020
Well, there's zero problem.

2017
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,020
I have I forgot.

2018
01:45:54,020 --> 01:46:02,020
I wanted to shout out the the hotel, like the off brand hotels that are nearby on that one street.

2019
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:04,020
I forgot what it's called.

2020
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:14,020
Yeah, I forgot the one that has like all the like shitty hotels like a couple of them have free happy hours.

2021
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:17,020
And you can just like go get like a free drink.

2022
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:19,020
But you have to walk.

2023
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,020
You're staying there.

2024
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:23,020
Pretend like you're staying there.

2025
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,020
That's a good tip.

2026
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:26,020
Look, I have not actually heard that tip either.

2027
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:28,020
That's like that's up there with the sunscreen tip.

2028
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:31,020
Yeah, I've got some good tips.

2029
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,020
I will look at any hotel.

2030
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:36,020
They have to look into that and find the wrong hotel.

2031
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,020
I went to one.

2032
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:41,020
I don't know if I got away with it or what.

2033
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:45,020
But if they've cracked down, I don't know.

2034
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:47,020
Or you ordered a drink and didn't pay for it.

2035
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:51,020
The hotel guests get you know how like some hotels have like free happy hours.

2036
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,020
It was like one of those.

2037
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:55,020
I think you get like you get like one free drink.

2038
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:57,020
I don't know if they I don't know if I did more than like one drink.

2039
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:59,020
But I mean, you got a tip.

2040
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:01,020
You got to look into it too much.

2041
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,020
It's free.

2042
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,020
Of course.

2043
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,020
Always tip if you get a free thing.

2044
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:07,020
Yeah, you're stealing from a hotel.

2045
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,020
You're staying at.

2046
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:09,020
Yeah.

2047
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:11,020
Can I ask one more question?

2048
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:16,020
If you if we're you know, like here I'm enjoying my favorite beer from Disneyland.

2049
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:22,020
If I or any of the listeners at home wanted to drink as you drink at 15 in a bathroom, what were you?

2050
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,020
What were you hitting?

2051
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,020
How do you make a cake?

2052
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:33,020
A warm like almost hot water bottle full of let's say Jim Beam.

2053
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,020
Jim Beam.

2054
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:36,020
Uh huh.

2055
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:37,020
Is it Jim?

2056
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,020
What is it?

2057
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:40,020
It's Jim Beam.

2058
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,020
Yeah.

2059
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,020
Beam.

2060
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:43,020
I'm on both.

2061
01:47:43,020 --> 01:48:04,020
It's a bottle of like a Jim Beam whiskey and probably like, you know, a watery Diet Coke chaser and just chug as much as you can because you're you only have a limited amount of time where you're going to be in the bathroom.

2062
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:10,020
And it will last you like probably, you know, 30 minutes or at least of walking around.

2063
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:17,020
So get a hearty chug and then wash it down with some watery Diet Coke.

2064
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,020
That's the 15 year old cocktail.

2065
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:23,020
And make sure you get some face paint accidentally in your mouth.

2066
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:32,020
Because it's because you're because you're sweating from the fake mustache that you that you thought was really funny to get.

2067
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:35,020
I might pitch that that cocktail is called the Moxie.

2068
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:36,020
There you go.

2069
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:40,020
That's how you make a Moxie and Kate Raft.
