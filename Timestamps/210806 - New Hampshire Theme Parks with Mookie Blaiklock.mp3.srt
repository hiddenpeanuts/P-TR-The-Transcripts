1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Warning, the following podcast may contain backwoods psychos raised by wolves, untrustworthy

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,400
hot dog magnets, and laser violence against Dickensian insects.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,280
Mookie Blakelock takes us on a cozy but disturbing journey through the weird wild theme parks of

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,000
New Hampshire on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast hosted by guys who love theme parks, but today we'll

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,280
determine if we also love weird facilities where bears play basketball.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm Scott Gardner and I'm joined by, let's go Jason Sheridan this time.

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Sure.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Yeah.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Yeah.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,840
I'm of two minds about like animal shows.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
You know, I feel like I've mostly seen bird shows.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,640
I don't know if I've seen a lot of bear shows.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,520
I personally have never seen a bear show.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,720
We're going to talk about a bear show.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah, I'm of two minds.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
I both like and love a bear show.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
So yeah, we will discuss it obviously more as we go along, but.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,240
I see you covered the two sides of my head and as far as this show is concerned.

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Yeah.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,120
Listen, everybody today.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,600
Here's a phrase I didn't think I would say on the podcast.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
Probably today we're talking about the theme parks of New Hampshire.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,040
I don't think this was ever on the board.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,960
I don't think this was like going to come up from us, but a guest has brought this to

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,600
us and I'm very excited about it because I love when we can explore an area we know nothing

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
about.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,520
We've got a lot of odd stuff that we figured out due to our guest.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,480
He is the host of the podcast.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,640
You are worthy with Lil Mookie B. He's one of the funniest guys around.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Mookie Blakelock is here.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Hi, Mookie.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Hi, guys.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Hello.

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Thanks for having me.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Of course.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
So happy to have you.

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Thank you.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,040
And yes, sorry.

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,400
This is look, it's all I could come up with.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I love it.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I built it up.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
Yeah, I got excited about it now.

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
It sucks.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
It's stupid.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
We can change it.

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
We could just kill this and do it later.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
We're just thinking new.

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
It's dumb.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
It's stupid.

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Do you want to do the Cars ride?

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
We'll talk about the Cars ride.

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I guess nobody likes me.

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I guess I'm just a dumb idiot.

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
No, don't say that.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
No, I guess I'm just a fucking loser.

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
No, come back.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I don't like it.

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,600
This is spinning out faster than any episode ever.

63
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,040
We've never had a spin out.

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,400
This is like a spin out on like Lightning McQueen's track on the Cars Land ride.

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,080
Clearly we should be talking about it and I know that, but that's not what we're talking

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
about.

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Look, we're here.

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm excited about it.

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Yeah, it's going to be great.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,840
Jason, I think you were psyched about what we've found.

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,240
You were saying you've got a ton of tabs.

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,600
You're overflowing with tabs.

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,640
Yeah, I think it was starting to slow down my computer earlier and then I lost them all

74
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,040
because I had to restart, but I got most of them back.

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,880
I have a book.

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
I was wondering how to start.

77
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
You have a book for this?

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,400
Well, I was wondering how to start researching this episode, which I think we should go the

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
other way.

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I think we should declare like a 50 state, you know, we should do the Soufian and go

81
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,040
like every state's theme parks.

82
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,560
But as I was one starting to research this, I was like, what park should I start with?

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
And then I happened by a little free library that had the Amusement Park Guide, a book

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
published in 1990.

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Whoa, whoa.

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,000
It gave me the two of the parks I'm sure we're going to talk about today.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,440
New Hampshire has two entries at this.

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,920
It is a state by state guide and New Hampshire's two parks listed.

89
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,640
And were two of them the ones that I had brought to you?

90
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,280
Canobie Lake Park.

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Storyland.

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Which I believe is part of Santa's Village.

93
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes.

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Oh, no, maybe not.

95
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Maybe not Storyland.

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
They are separate.

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,920
Storyland I believe is the one.

98
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,240
One of them is run by the people who run Kennywood in Pennsylvania.

99
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
They also run Storyland.

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Feels like the vibe.

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,840
There's some Kennywood vibes in these I would say.

102
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,720
But all the parks I read about were very charming, a lot of natural beauty, a lot in wooded areas.

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,680
And you don't get that every place you build a theme park, you know?

104
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
No, true.

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Not at all.

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
What's your...

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Ibuki, like what...

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,840
Well, I guess I have a couple of New Hampshire questions.

109
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,760
I don't think I know like the vibe of it in general.

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,080
I don't know what are the like, what are the stereotypes or like what you might regard

111
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,160
as what is like particularly New Hampshire-y?

112
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
What can you tell us on that on that front?

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Well, it's interesting because I feel like I kind of have a little bit of an outsider

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
perspective of New Hampshire as well.

115
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I grew up in Massachusetts.

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Oh, gosh.

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay.

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,200
And so we would...

119
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,440
So my family, I'm an only child, so it's just me and my mom and my dad.

120
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,880
And we would go up to New Hampshire every year for a week to the same campground every

121
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,560
year, McBurke Campground in Lisbon, New Hampshire, and we would go to one of these places every

122
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
year.

123
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,680
But it's the only place we literally ever went on vacation.

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,200
We literally never went on vacation to another place.

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
We didn't go...

126
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
We didn't like...

127
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,320
When I was four years old, we got on a plane and went to Florida and went to Disney World,

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
which I have no recollection of.

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,720
But other than that, my family is very like, we like things the way we like them.

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
And so we went to the same place.

131
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,160
And so I haven't even explored New Hampshire that much.

132
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,000
But New Hampshire and Vermont, I feel like, are kind of like the same vibe.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,720
I mean, they're right next to each other, but it's like, it's woodsy, it's like, cabiny,

134
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,860
there's lakes.

135
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,080
It's like a lot of...

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,320
It's very New England-y.

137
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,800
It's like, there's lots of like, lots of things are made of wood and there's like a lot of

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,880
brick walkways and cobblestone and stuff like that.

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
You know what I mean?

140
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Like it's very New England.

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
There's lighthouses and like...

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,480
Actually, I don't think New Hampshire is on the coast.

143
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I think Vermont is.

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
I could be wrong about that.

145
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,120
This is how little I fucking know about anything.

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,320
I can't even tell you like where towns in Massachusetts are because like I was so...

147
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,420
I never went far from my town or whatever, but like geographically.

148
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:42,060
But yeah, New Hampshire is like woodsy, New England, like brick and stone and wood and

149
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,180
like, you know.

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,660
Is it cozy?

151
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
It's cozy.

152
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,260
It's like fireplaces and little shops and like dads with their shirts tucked into their

153
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,000
shorts with sandals walking around, you know, getting ice cream on like a farm that has

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,220
cows on it or whatever.

155
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,260
That's my best description of like the New Hampshire vibe.

156
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,740
And then it's like, if you keep going up New England, north to like Maine, Maine is like

157
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,080
even more of that, but it's like even almost a little more like back woodsy and like everybody

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,500
has a fucking tractor and you know, like you catch lobsters off of the dock.

159
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
What's the word I'm looking for?

160
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
The dock?

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
The pier?

162
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,580
Yeah, the pier.

163
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
What's the harbor?

164
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
The harbor.

165
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
The harbor.

166
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,980
And like everyone has a boat and like, you know, that's like Maine is like where, you

167
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,300
know, that's where people are like, you know.

168
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh, up here in Maine, you know, that's the...

169
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Yes, yes.

170
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,860
No, I was walking down the beach or whatever.

171
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,280
And so that's the like, that's like New England, New England.

172
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,900
That's like the almost like Maine is almost like no man's land.

173
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,620
And then it's like you go down south New England and it's like Massachusetts and Connecticut

174
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,340
and Rhode Island, which is just a totally different vibe, but still kind of like, you

175
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,100
know, seaside town or whatever.

176
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:09,140
But like as you go up, like Rhode Island, Cape Cod, New England is like seaside, like

177
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
lighthouses.

178
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,220
And then you keep going up to like New Hampshire, Vermont, and it starts getting like a little

179
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,220
quieter and a little greener.

180
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,860
Is there an accent?

181
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,540
Is there a New Hampshire like, is it a dialed back Maine?

182
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,820
It's the New England accent.

183
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,700
It's like a Boston accent.

184
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
It's a Boston accent.

185
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Oh, OK.

186
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
A little.

187
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
A little.

188
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

189
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
OK.

190
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,860
Did you like the one place that you went on vacation or did you get tired of the one place

192
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
you went on vacation?

193
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I don't know.

194
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Somewhere in between.

195
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,060
Well, it's like so we went to so it was like one week a year we went to this place, McBruik

196
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,080
Campground in Lisbon, New Hampshire.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,020
It's some place that like an old friend of like my dad's like took him to once and he

198
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,460
fell in love with it.

199
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,060
And it's like this very, very quiet campground in the middle of kind of nowhere, New Hampshire.

200
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,860
It was like it's like a couple hours like up into like from the New Hampshire from the

201
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,580
Massachusetts New Hampshire border.

202
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,980
And we stayed at the same campsite every year like my dad would book it a year in advance

203
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,940
because he wanted the same site.

204
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,740
And you know, it was like us going and it was very quiet and it's like it's very woodsy

205
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,740
and there's like there's a brook that runs through it, the Mink Brook.

206
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,380
So that's why it's called Mink Brook Campground.

207
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
There's a brook that runs through it.

208
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,060
We had a campsite that was on the brook.

209
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,900
And like if you go to the front of the campground, it was like they had a pool and then they

210
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,580
had a little shop with like the office and like you could, you know, a little shop you

211
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,820
could buy like candy and like baseball cards and shit.

212
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,580
And then they had a little they're cool part about it is they had this big Airstream trailer

213
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,600
that they turned into an arcade.

214
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,400
And so there were like video games inside of it, like arcade games, which was just like

215
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,920
I would spend all my time there because it was just me and my parents.

216
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,000
I was an only child and my parents were there to get away from the hustle and bustle of

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,920
our lives and like read books.

218
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,520
So they would be reading books.

219
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,360
We have like the pop up trailer and shit where you tow it behind my dad's Jeep and then like,

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,280
you know, like the sides come up and expand and, you know, you like crank up the thing

221
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,440
and you pull the awning out and it had two beds and like a little shower in it and stuff.

222
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,960
And then my dad had like, you know, a gas stove and we like we he like really did it

223
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,160
up. It was kind of like early glamping.

224
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
But, you know, my parents like would put out like their shit, their like foldable Shays

225
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,120
lounges and read a book.

226
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,720
And I would be like, throw a frisbee with me, walk to the store with me.

227
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,000
And they would be like, go do that by yourself.

228
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,920
And so I would ride my bike around like by myself.

229
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,120
I would go down to the store and they would give me money and I would and they would be

230
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
like, don't buy candy with it.

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
And I would buy candy with it and I would go find a place to hide and eat it.

232
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,800
And it was just like and then every now and then my dad would be like, all right, let's

233
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,480
throw a frisbee back and forth or like we will go down to the pool together as a family

234
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
or whatever. Or if there were other kids at other campsites, he would be like, go make

235
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
friends with that kid, even though I had like crippling anxiety, social anxiety and like

236
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
did not want to go talk to kids that I didn't know.

237
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
That's a vacation nightmare.

238
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
Like never do I want to.

239
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,560
I've never done anything good.

240
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,600
Come from me trying to make friends on a trip.

241
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,520
I don't understand. Like you walk into scenes where like you guys don't know each other

242
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,360
before. How did this happen?

243
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,680
I can't make friends on trips.

244
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,080
The only time that ever worked for me was on a cruise ship and there was like kids,

245
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,840
ours by age group.

246
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,680
And we were kind of forced into it.

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's like we don't want you just wandering a cruise ship all day.

248
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,760
And then looking back, I'm like, well, I was 12.

249
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,960
Why not? Why couldn't I?

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,400
What? You let me wander half the time anyway.

251
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
Why did I have to do little skits and like activities and stuff?

252
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
You did skits with 12.

253
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
I was strangers.

254
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,560
Oh, oh, yeah.

255
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,360
And like crafts, there was crafts and like pool hour and stuff.

256
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,640
And it was like here, staff occupy the children so your parents can drink at the pool before

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,960
dinner time, you know, so your parents can do the on ship casino.

258
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,360
Yeah.

259
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,760
Wow. I'm killing.

260
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,280
That's it. Yeah, it was fun.

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,800
I mean, it was fun, but I never like when we went to Disney or even if we went to like

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
the mountains or stuff like it, never again did I really have that experience.

263
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Mm hmm.

264
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah, no, I didn't make friends with anyone on vacation.

265
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, never happened.

266
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,720
So what what what a like I guess maybe as an adult and you know, we've all got our

267
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,640
little boomer parents, but just like just like go go go up to that kid and make

268
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,120
friends with them, literally just like go walk up to that campsite right now and say,

269
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,440
Hi, my name is Michael Blakelock and can I please play with your daughter or whatever?

270
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,240
And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

271
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
That is a nightmare.

272
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,920
I don't want to talk to that kid.

273
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm too I'm I'm literally scared of that person.

274
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
Like I don't want to talk to people I don't know.

275
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,160
Yeah, and it's kids.

276
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,920
So they might say, get out of here, idiot.

277
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,040
Like it might be like it won't happen if you feel like I want to try to like talk

278
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,720
to this girl or tell you these people at a bar.

279
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,760
It might probably won't happen as an adult, but like get the hell out of my face.

280
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,400
Could happen with a child.

281
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,480
Yeah.

282
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,560
Or like I go up to it's just like, Hi, can I play?

283
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,760
Or and then it's like, oh, so you're just our responsibility now.

284
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,520
I'm just walking.

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,040
Exactly.

286
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,920
Can I play cards with you guys or whatever?

287
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,400
Just like my parents don't want to do it.

288
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,920
So like I'm now I'm your problem.

289
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,920
And all of these parks, the New England kind of parks, it seems.

290
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,200
If you look on their websites, like places to stay,

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
they're sending you to either a campground or they're sending you to

292
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,560
like a motel, essentially.

293
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,360
And because it's very rusty, I usually like if you look up six legs,

294
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,000
places to stay in the area, it'll have a link to like, all right,

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,440
there's a courtyard Marriott, there's a Hilton Garden in less

296
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,280
the case, seemingly in New England.

297
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,000
It's a lot of still little motor lodges.

298
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah, it's it's all especially like in that area of New Hampshire.

299
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,160
It's like it's very like you start getting into like

300
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,160
like the wilderness where it's like there's you're going to have to like,

301
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
if you're at this campground,

302
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,400
you're going to have to drive 25 minutes to get to something

303
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,600
to do, right, right, which is the thing, which, you know,

304
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,400
speaking of what we're speaking of, but like that would be the thing.

305
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,160
So like we would go up there for a week every summer and then one day

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,880
of the week, we would like take a day trip out to like one of these places.

307
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,880
Oh, that's the the trip is to the one place, but this is the right.

308
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,440
I guess we should do something.

309
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
So you go to one of these.

310
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,640
It is just like we cannot be here every single day.

311
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,640
So we would go into like or it would be like a couple of days.

312
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,640
So it would be like, you know, one day we would go into like Littleton,

313
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
New Hampshire, which was like a couple of towns over.

314
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,960
And they had like a little town square with like a bookstore.

315
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,000
And we would go to the bookstore and like they would they would be like,

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,760
we will buy you a book and you can read a book from this place.

317
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,200
Or or we would go to Sanders Village or we would go to Clark String Bears.

318
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,680
Canopy Lake Park was not a vacation thing for me.

319
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
That was just another New Hampshire.

320
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,200
Like that's the big New Hampshire, like like independent,

321
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,200
like little amusement park that I had been to many times.

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,760
But that's separate from these vacations that I took with my.

323
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
But if we took a day trip, we would either go.

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
And it was and it was we went there for years.

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
And we would go to every year it was last year.

326
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,480
We went to Clark's Trading Post.

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,920
And this year we'll go to Santa's Village and next year we will go to Clark's.

328
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,120
And then the next year we will go to Santa's Village.

329
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,760
And then next year we'll go to Clark's.

330
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,160
And then it got to a point where like, you know,

331
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,040
when I was like maybe 12 or 13 or 14 for like a couple of years,

332
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,960
they were like, you can bring a friend so you have someone.

333
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,080
They were like, this kid is going fucking stir crazy.

334
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
You can bring one of your friends.

335
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,120
And then when I was like 15, they were like, you can stay home alone

336
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,920
while we go out. And I was that can rules.

337
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,320
Yeah, that's great.

338
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,080
But yeah, those were those were my those were my experiences

339
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,240
with those smaller places where it was just like we would go to those two places

340
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
every year.

341
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Mm hmm. So then do you like did you like them or was it like, well, it's a place

342
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,520
there's there's distractions, there's signs I can point at and that will fill time.

343
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,360
I mean, I think it was like Stockholm syndrome where it's like, well,

344
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,640
I have to like it because I don't have a choice.

345
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,440
You know what I mean? It's not like I hate going here.

346
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm like, I think that my dad tells me every year that I like this.

347
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,400
And so I believe it because like I'm I'm your hostage.

348
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,920
I'm like your lifelong hostage.

349
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,080
That's yeah, there's a there is a point.

350
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,440
There's points for I think it happens a lot when you're a kid

351
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,360
and either like you finally realize you can have like an opinion

352
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,920
or you can have a choice about something.

353
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Like when I was a kid and I was playing soccer a few years in a row

354
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,200
and I didn't realize I hated soccer until my mom said, you know,

355
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,640
you don't have to play it because like she got my she got the sense

356
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
that I was not maybe that into soccer because I'd run away from the ball

357
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
and only cared about getting a hot dog after the game.

358
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,160
And then she presented that to me.

359
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,320
And I remember going, oh, I don't want to play soccer anymore.

360
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,440
But it up to that point, I felt, oh, I'll be playing soccer for my whole life.

361
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,200
There'll be never a time when I won't be playing soccer.

362
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Yeah, that's just who I am.

363
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,160
It's just yeah, I was told that this is what I'm doing.

364
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,000
And there's no part of me that goes like, well, mother and father

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,040
are certainly not wrong.

366
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,440
They're always right. In fact,

367
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,680
they know they happen to know everything and I actually know nothing.

368
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,200
Yeah, I stuck around in Boy Scouts and baseball

369
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
for probably a year or two, too long, because I was like, oh, well,

370
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,840
I don't want to upset anyone by not doing this.

371
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,560
And then once I started doing school plays, I was like, well, I found this

372
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,960
and I like this more.

373
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
So I think I'm just going to gravitate towards this.

374
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,120
Sure.

375
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,440
We're Mookie, when you were going on the trip, were you like, at least

376
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,680
do you think like, OK, that candy store is good and the arcade is good?

377
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,120
Because that's obviously that would have appealed to me.

378
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,520
And I would be like, oh, yeah, it's the, you know,

379
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,600
old time confectionary with a bunch of taffy or something.

380
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm just imagining what it is.

381
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,560
Yeah, I mean, no, I mean, literally, it was like a little

382
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,120
it was like a tiny, like, like the size of like my bedroom,

383
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,720
like, like just like corner store.

384
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,360
It was it was literally like it was like the front desk to the campground.

385
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,560
So it's like when you when you pull in and you're checking in,

386
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,600
you go in this little shop and then there's the lady

387
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,400
who owns the place behind the desk and you go, hi, we're in site number.

388
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
We're the Blake locks and we're in site number 36 or whatever.

389
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
And then they go, great, welcome.

390
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,360
And then, you know, it happens to just be a little general store

391
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,280
where it's like they got a little freezer with like ice cream sandwiches

392
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
in it and stuff and like, you know, you can get like candy bars

393
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,800
and candy and like fruit pies and shit like that.

394
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,160
But it's like it's like the office slash front desk slash

395
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
little general store where like you can go.

396
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,720
It's like where you would go and like outside, you could buy like fire,

397
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,840
like bundles of firewood or like, you know, they had like

398
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,400
it was almost like a little market where it's like you get marshmallows

399
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,880
and Hershey bars and graham crackers to like go make s'mores at your campsite.

400
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,840
Gotcha. I'll be honest.

401
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,640
I said it before. It sounds cozy.

402
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,200
The whole thing sounds very cozy. It's cozy. It's cozy.

403
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,680
But I can see how you might bristle

404
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,280
just doing these things over and over again, especially because Santa's Village

405
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,000
and like story land fall into the category of this is an amusement park

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,960
catering to 12 and under maybe 13 and under.

407
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,640
So as you're hitting adolescence,

408
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,000
it this stuff hits less and less.

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,160
My family, I feel like my family got so into theme parks

410
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,000
that we tapered off from like storybook lander

411
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,520
Dutch wonderland kind of parks kind of quickly. Right.

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
And I mean, like I understand I understand this more now is like an adult,

413
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,320
like approaching 40, but like,

414
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,160
you know, like I got what was appealing to my parents.

415
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,800
It was just like it's a quiet,

416
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,160
relaxing place that has a babbling brook running through it.

417
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,360
And I get to escape the hustle and the bustle of Ashland, Massachusetts.

418
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
And

419
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,840
and like go and like I get to like read books and be in nature and stuff like that.

420
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,200
And it's like, yeah, I might like that now.

421
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Right. But just like as a kid, you're like.

422
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,040
I mean, it's fun to just be like, we're getting in the car

423
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,160
and we're going someplace different and like it is fun and like we're

424
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,440
we're like sleeping in a tent or whatever.

425
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,320
And it's cool. But it's also just like, I mean, as a kid, for most of it,

426
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,160
it's just like I have like child energy and I'm just like,

427
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,040
oh, I have nobody to fucking play with or do anything.

428
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,000
And it's like, I want to do way more than they want to do.

429
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,520
And it was always just them just being like,

430
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,360
oh, can we please just sit here and read a read the new Janet Ivanovich?

431
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
Look, it's you don't understand.

432
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
Mookie, it's two for the show.

433
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,200
We read one for the money last summer.

434
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,280
Two for the dough. Excuse me.

435
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,440
We get deadly for the score.

436
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,840
Five. Stephanie Plum is back.

437
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,320
And I'm the last person in my office to read about her adventures.

438
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,440
Those books are so funny that they just like there's like 23 of them or whatever.

439
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
And like the like the the names just start being like

440
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,920
like it's 12.

441
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,600
Yeah. What do you do after there's no puns?

442
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,800
13 dream any numbers north of 19?

443
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,720
Yeah. They had three good ones.

444
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,880
They had one for the money, two for the dough, three to get deadly.

445
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,920
One score, one for the money, of course, made into a movie starring Catherine

446
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,880
Heigl. That's right.

447
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,640
It's glued into my mind

448
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,000
as the only movie I've ever seen sold tickets,

449
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,680
tickets sold on Groupon for a movie.

450
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,560
Oh, my God. Yeah.

451
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,720
It was a it was box office.

452
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,080
My my parents were like, that was one of the worst movies

453
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
we've ever seen, and we love those Stephanie Plumb books.

454
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,320
It's like, yeah, it's such a God sucker because they like the book.

455
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
Oh, my God. Group rates like how they did, like what they did with, like,

456
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,800
Passion of the Christ.

457
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,960
Get your group together.

458
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,600
Oh, no, no group pond.

459
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,360
Like, get us. Oh, no, I know.

460
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,040
Ticket. Yeah. Yeah, boy.

461
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,000
That's crazy.

462
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Um, you know what? I went to I have a New Hampshire memory, too,

463
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,120
which is similar to this is the high end of this is the the the like,

464
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,600
this is the like annoying, fancy version of the boring place.

465
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,400
Do you know what the what the Balsams is?

466
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
Does that sound familiar?

467
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,320
Do you know about Dixville Notch, New Hampshire?

468
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,960
The Dixville Notch is the town where only like seven people live there

469
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,320
and they get up early and vote first thing so that they can be the first place

470
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,720
where the election results come in in the New Hampshire.

471
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,760
Well, and they you mean in the primary because the New Hampshire primary

472
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,520
is the big one. You just mean the election that that's like as a collective group.

473
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,000
They're like, we're getting up early so we can have this claim to fame.

474
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,960
Is the New Hampshire primary the first primary?

475
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,280
Yes. Yes. It's before the Iowa caucus.

476
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,360
Then that must be the thing.

477
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,840
Like they cast their president vote first of all, as it's the first state

478
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,920
and the first time they all know each other.

479
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,720
So they wake up and it's the it's the most like odd, mundane little.

480
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,840
But there's like a there's a really nice resort near there

481
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,200
where you get to learn about this tradition and how it's been going for.

482
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,080
And I was watching videos about the place and it flashed me right back to like,

483
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
yes, it's pretty. It's so pretty.

484
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,720
There was nothing I wanted less as a kid than pretty.

485
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,560
Pretty, so pretty was absolutely boring.

486
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,680
And now in retrospect, I feel like my parents probably took me

487
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,520
to some like jaw dropping places where I was like, no, but it's not.

488
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,920
I would like absolutely rather be playing Mario Kart than any

489
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,280
any one of these places.

490
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,160
Yes. Yeah.

491
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,800
Leave me at home with a bunch of sunny delights or something.

492
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,200
You just the beauty of Mumu Farms is better than anything that's in New Hampshire.

493
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,960
That's right.

494
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Yeah, they all have like Egyptian levels, like the deserts, the

495
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,160
all the winds you see there.

496
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,400
That's one of the wonders of the world. Hey, I relate to that.

497
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,080
I think also that was a hotel that I really specifically

498
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,120
this is how fancy and traditional the hotel was, is that they

499
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,000
I remember getting that.

500
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,080
This is very important to me because it was the season premiere of The Simpsons

501
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,040
when we got there.

502
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,840
You can't miss the sea. These will never be able to be seen again.

503
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
No one's tracking the Simpsons.

504
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
If I don't see it now, I'll never see it.

505
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
Mom, dad drop. I don't fancy dinner or whatever your plan.

506
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,560
I do not want to do it.

507
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,400
I want to watch The Simpsons no matter what.

508
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,320
And then and then I am told, no, no, no, this is a traditional resort.

509
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,840
There are not televisions in the room.

510
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,440
I'm sorry. What are you talking?

511
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,080
The whole summer is ruined.

512
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
Wait, but that's OK. There is a television room.

513
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,680
We did at some point recognize that these ghost

514
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,440
children wanted to see TV and they opened a TV.

515
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,720
And I'm like, wait a minute, I as a 13 year old have to convince the room

516
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,960
to put on this show or else I will miss the show.

517
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,920
And thankfully, there was enough group think that we wanted to watch it.

518
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,600
And then it was Mike, the one we were just talking about.

519
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
Was it the wait?

520
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,560
The one we agreed was the yes, Edison.

521
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,240
And then like so after all that, then it's the episode

522
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,360
that lets you know that the show is no longer good.

523
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
Absolutely awful memory.

524
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,160
All of this, all this.

525
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,720
I have to get to the TV room and I think I had to wear a coat.

526
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,880
You have to wear a coat to sit in a room and watch a fancy restaurant.

527
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,960
Yes. Yes. A coat for a child.

528
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,120
I had to wear a little coat for the TV room. Yes.

529
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,000
My parents loved this.

530
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
We came back from this trip.

531
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,200
I remember like my sister and I still talk about it, that my mom,

532
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,760
like a threat in the car as we were leaving the place said from now on,

533
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,080
when we get home, Wednesdays will be fancy Wednesdays.

534
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,240
We will all dress up and we will eat dinner as a family and we will look nice.

535
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,360
And I was like, for Noah, for us only.

536
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,640
I have to wear his coat while we eat like fish sticks.

537
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,160
What are you talking about?

538
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,800
I love when like suburban parents like get outside of their bubble

539
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,920
and see something and then they go, OK, we are doing this now.

540
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,520
This is we are now making a change.

541
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,160
And this is this is the rule of this is the law of the land from now on.

542
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,280
Do you understand?

543
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,080
And then it lasts for like, you know, a couple of weeks or so.

544
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,760
But it's stupid.

545
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,080
There will be like a short like making we're going to make our own pasta now.

546
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
We I'm not buying it out of the bags anymore.

547
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,200
We'll do it together and you will cut the shapes and I will put them

548
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
into the grinder.

549
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,560
And then it's so bad. The first time you try.

550
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,520
We had like a law like chore allowance.

551
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
We're like, we're doing this now.

552
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,560
You're not just going to get money when you beg for something.

553
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Here's what you do.

554
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,360
That's we'll reward you.

555
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,160
Twenty five cents per you make your bed, you clean you.

556
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,440
OK, that's how we're doing it.

557
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
Three weeks later out the window.

558
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,480
It's just the begging system for whatever you want.

559
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,240
It is back in play.

560
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,400
It's gone. It's over.

561
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,440
And white all or nothing, just like

562
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,280
there's no like patience or like examination of like,

563
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,360
you know, there's stuff in our family that maybe isn't working

564
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,680
or I don't like the attitude of my kids or something.

565
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,840
And then you see one other idiot be like, my family does it this way.

566
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,040
And you're like, we're doing it this way.

567
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,760
And you don't have a say in it. And we're doing it.

568
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,960
And if we don't do it, you're in you're in trouble.

569
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,920
And then they're the ones that give up on it.

570
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,920
And then like a month later, when you're back to the way that,

571
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,720
you know, business as usual in your family, you're just like,

572
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,120
do you want me to go?

573
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
My family's was like, I said, I'm they think

574
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,640
they thought I said I was bored too much.

575
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
I was always like, I'm bored.

576
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,560
And so my we we we took a bunch of piece, little slips of paper

577
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,880
and wrote like things to do, like do a puzzle, like read a book, like take a walk.

578
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,680
And if I ever said I'm bored, we would put them in a drawer

579
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,640
and I would open the drawer and pick one out and be like, OK, do a puzzle.

580
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,840
And now like we do, you know, that's like the shit we would do if I was bored.

581
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,040
And it was just like so like walking over to that fucking drawer.

582
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,040
My mom being like, let's go over to the drawer and pick something to do

583
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,760
if you're bored and then pick out something where it's like, you know, it's like

584
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,080
build a castle of blocks and it's like, oh, this fucking sucks.

585
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,800
And then and of course, after a while, it was just like, I'm bored.

586
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,280
And they were like, well, I don't know what to tell you.

587
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,720
Yeah, I'm bored is not like

588
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,520
I think kids just say that as like a response.

589
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,120
You know, it's it's like a little verbal tick.

590
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,880
And it's like, yeah, well, you're probably not really bored.

591
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,920
You probably just need like

592
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,600
the equivalent of jangling keys in front of your face.

593
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
But you're seven.

594
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,920
You're that I can't jangle keys.

595
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,400
And you didn't fucking give me a brother or a sister to play with.

596
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,880
So like me, a child has to fill 24 hours of the fucking day.

597
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,920
Yeah, that's true.

598
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,840
I know I got to figure it out.

599
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,360
That's a lot.

600
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,480
You really advanced my mental arguments for should I have another child?

601
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,000
This is this is typically pushed me a long way.

602
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,600
It's your life, it's your family, it's your whatever.

603
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,640
But just let you know.

604
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Do you really want your kid to turn out like me, Scott?

605
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,360
Well, Scott, I have one brother and do you want him to turn out like me?

606
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,480
So these are your options.

607
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,920
I'm looking down two different river paths.

608
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,520
I don't know which that's right.

609
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,560
I just crashed down the middle.

610
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,600
As we're saying all this, so I'm realizing like, oh, yeah, that,

611
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,280
you know, my family did little bits of this, but it's like,

612
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,880
it's kind of chill looking back in some ways,

613
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,240
because I'm realizing like, well, my mom was the youngest of five

614
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
and my dad's the youngest of four.

615
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,600
So I think maybe at some point they're like, all right, well, let's

616
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
let's keep a quieter house.

617
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,800
Like, that's not let's we don't have to do this insanity

618
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,640
like our parents did.

619
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,800
These are numbers of siblings that are impossible.

620
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,840
Like they are. You could maybe get your head around.

621
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,080
All right. Maybe I could have a kid and not go bankrupt.

622
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,920
But five like, do are we going to know anyone

623
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,120
our age with five children, unless it's an accident?

624
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,560
Well, and also if I when I'm asked what did my grandparents do,

625
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,560
it's always like, well, he did a little of this and a little of that.

626
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,840
Like, it's never like, oh, is that this job for 30 years or that sort of thing

627
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,680
for our parents? I mean, my dad worked for a long time.

628
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,520
But like, yeah, my grand, I feel like my grandparents

629
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,120
were retired by the time I knew them.

630
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,600
But but they jumped around to other jobs a lot.

631
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,320
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

632
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,920
Yeah. We should get to these parks or where we have the least

633
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,800
theme park content.

634
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,640
But it's all applicable. We got we're in the vibe now.

635
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
So we're in the vibe. We're in the new.

636
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah, I was told this is a loose structure.

637
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,880
Oh, yes. No, no, no. That is correct.

638
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,840
I'm just making sure we do it.

639
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,240
That's what I was told. That's what I was told.

640
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,640
There's no there's no itinerary.

641
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
There's no every five minutes.

642
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
This happens.

643
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Let's just start.

644
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,880
Let's start tossing them out. Can't it be like park?

645
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,560
This seems like the biggest of the one.

646
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,520
This is like the most like major. Yeah.

647
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,320
Theme park of all this.

648
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,240
So this was not this was a separate trip.

649
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,760
This was not in the regular rotation.

650
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,640
Yes, this was not in the and I'm not even remembering where it is.

651
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,400
I think it's a little closer like to like Nashua, New Hampshire,

652
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,840
which is like a little closer to the like Massachusetts, New Hampshire border.

653
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,440
But can it be like Park was like the like?

654
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't know how to describe it,

655
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,640
but just like, you know, the independent, like small local like theme park,

656
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,320
but like with legitimate like roller coasters and stuff.

657
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,600
Yeah. Family owned seemingly, which is sort of rare.

658
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, it was the place where you went, like on a school trip

659
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,400
or on a camp trip or like, you know, your friend is like,

660
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,760
we're going to Canopy Lake Park if you want to come with us.

661
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,440
And that was like, you know, it was like an hour and a half away

662
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
or something like that. You know what I mean?

663
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,480
And that that was the like that was like a full like

664
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,960
theme park with like rides and roller coasters and,

665
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,920
you know, like, I do.

666
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,760
Yeah. 30 miles outside of Boston.

667
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,120
So pretty close.

668
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,440
There's that area originated as a trolley park.

669
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,960
And this was like where I was, you know, to or something.

670
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,160
Yes, that's right.

671
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,400
And so where trolleys would terminate, Kenny, what I mentioned in Pittsburgh,

672
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,680
also a trolley park, Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom and Allentown, Pennsylvania.

673
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
Also a trolley park.

674
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,040
When I was looking at the Wikipedia and I saw the phrase trolley park,

675
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm like, there's no way Jason will not say this for that phrase is like Jason Bates.

676
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
It's like a little crate was put up

677
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,000
in front of a sign that said trolley park. That's right.

678
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
And there used to be quite a few trolley parks in America.

679
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,080
But as the automobile

680
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,080
rose in prominence, a lot of the trolley lines closed

681
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,720
and a lot of the barks went away or they evolved into amusement parks.

682
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,520
But there are still 13 left that started as a truck.

683
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,840
God, yes. Thank God.

684
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
How are the trolleys doing? Do those work?

685
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,360
Oh, no, they're long dead.

686
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
They all burn up.

687
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,800
But but later you can still hear the sound that a trolley makes.

688
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,600
The ghost of the rail.

689
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,120
What do they have a horn?

690
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,720
If anyone knows what trolleys do, it's Jason.

691
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,720
If they go clang, clang, clang, as we learned in Meet Me in St.

692
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,000
Louis. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right.

693
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,320
This seems like you're Jason.

694
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,560
We're saying this is like a Kenny Wood field of this little you.

695
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,800
You'd probably dig this place, I'd imagine.

696
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,440
Yeah, I mean, it's it it it's right up my alley.

697
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,320
It reminds me a lot of Kenobles Park in Pennsylvania, another older park.

698
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,800
It's got a few roller coasters.

699
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
It's got a dark ride.

700
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,600
They do a Halloween event.

701
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,600
And it also is the was the inspiration for a Stephen King novel called Joyland,

702
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,960
one of the newer Stephen King novels.

703
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,880
That's unsettling, though.

704
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,520
Yeah, that's scary. Yeah.

705
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,400
Um, what was the like?

706
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,960
Did I I don't know what like what you was the one who went here?

707
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,120
Like like, did you have fun when you when you went here, Mookie?

708
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,240
Yeah, I mean, this is my my my my my fondest memory is that

709
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,600
it was the first time I went on an upside down roller coaster.

710
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,160
So they had the cork.

711
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,480
The corkscrew is like their big fun upside down roller coaster.

712
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560
So it's not like a full loop roller coaster.

713
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,840
It's like a you go up and you do a little twist.

714
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,720
You know what I mean? Kind of thing.

715
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,160
Mm hmm. And I remember going with my dad

716
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,160
and like him being like, you're going to love it.

717
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,280
And me being like a scared little boy and being like, no, it's scary.

718
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,400
And he's like, let's just get in line. Let's do it.

719
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,840
He convinced me to do it.

720
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
And it was like one of those were like, we did it.

721
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,840
And I was like, that was the most fun thing I've ever done.

722
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,640
And we got back in line and we went on it like three more times.

723
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,240
It was like my first upside down roller coaster experience.

724
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,480
It was it was a fond memory.

725
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,320
Oh, there's that there's the corkscrew.

726
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,280
And then they have like the really old I think it's like the oldest

727
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,480
or like one of the oldest.

728
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,960
They have the the Yankee Cannonball, which is like their old wooden

729
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,680
roller coaster, like the like the standard wooden roller coaster.

730
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,080
Which was lame, rickety and fun.

731
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,480
And then like the only other thing I can remember there was like they have one

732
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,920
of those like, what's the fucking it's like the Gravitron,

733
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,800
like it just spins really fast and then they drop the floor out from under you.

734
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,840
Like they have one of those.

735
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,120
Oh, it's I mean, that's why I always call it a Gravitron.

736
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,800
Yeah, like a tilt to whorlers or not a tilt to world, but just like, you know,

737
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,360
you get sucked up against the side of the thing.

738
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,760
But those were like the big rides there.

739
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,800
Oh, and they had a big they had this really cool one where it's like,

740
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,880
you know, one that just spins and it's like you're you're like sitting in a thing

741
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,520
that's hanging from hanging from like wires and you just basically

742
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,080
just get like flung around or whatever.

743
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,600
You know, it's a bunch of little things that you sit on.

744
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,360
They were like shaped like roosters and you sit in them and they're

745
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,960
you're hanging from a wire and it spins and you're just like going around the thing.

746
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,360
Maybe that's more like tilt to whorl or whatever.

747
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,200
Now, it's not.

748
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,080
Well, it's all to whorl is like, yeah, that like half kind of

749
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,600
I don't know how you describe it.

750
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,400
Like it's like sort of circular back and then there's a little seat

751
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,760
and then it spins as the whole thing spins as well.

752
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,800
It's literally just like you're just getting swung around by a wire,

753
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,320
but you're sitting in a thing anyways.

754
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,160
A little chair.

755
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,680
It's like a little chair, like a little swing kind of thing.

756
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,480
Almost was like a little like I'm trying to find.

757
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,040
They were these big roosters and they could fit two people.

758
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,280
So it's like you're almost sitting in like a little like

759
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't fucking know.

760
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,520
A little spinner ride car.

761
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,160
Yeah, like you're just sitting in a thing.

762
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,680
You're like sitting in a little.

763
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,440
Is it like that? Hold on. I'll show you a photo here.

764
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,960
Is it like this one here?

765
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,520
Is it like this thing right here?

766
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,960
Yes. Yeah.

767
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,520
But there were less.

768
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,640
There were less things and the things were bigger.

769
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,920
The things could fit like two people in them and got probably like 10 of them

770
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,560
in the whole thing.

771
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,760
And then you would just it would just get swung around.

772
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,600
Not sure. Sure.

773
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
We were a different kind of theme park podcast.

774
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,480
This would only be all we know the names of the things.

775
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
And we say all of the names and we say the manufacturers.

776
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,880
And there are no jokes.

777
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,400
Oh, that's you want that podcast.

778
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,960
It exists and the audio is way worse than ours.

779
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,880
So you might want to stay with us.

780
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Hey, Yankee.

781
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,240
Yankee Cannibal was made by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company,

782
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,520
who has made quite a few rides in the last 100 years.

783
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,600
Jason's got your cover.

784
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,960
You're saying he's got all of that.

785
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,880
Let me I think the question you asked me was, do what?

786
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
What are my memories of that?

787
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,120
And my memories are.

788
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,560
I I wish I had more of them.

789
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,440
I think my whole childhood was just like fear and anxiety.

790
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,600
And so I don't retain a lot of memories.

791
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,000
But I remember going with a friend of mine,

792
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
my friend Bear Klaus, his name was Robert Klaus, but we called him Bear.

793
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,520
And we would go and we would like it would be like this whole like fantasy.

794
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,440
Like we like for some reason, I always we like me

795
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,560
and my friends always had these fantasies of like,

796
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,680
we're characters on a TV show and like.

797
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,120
So like we're like when we get in the park, we're like these characters.

798
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,040
And so we're like we're like these two guys who like are on some adventure

799
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,840
and we're in a movie and like, you know, the roosters are like we're

800
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,720
we have a big pet rooster and we fly on it or whatever.

801
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,160
And like, I don't know.

802
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,480
That's like that's why you were having like one.

803
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,720
You had a persona.

804
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,280
It wasn't just like we're going to the park.

805
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,600
It's like we are we're turning this experience into like this is a fantasy

806
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,960
of like we are these two cool guys.

807
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,720
And this is an adventure that we're on.

808
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,920
And each of the rides is like part of our adventure or whatever.

809
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,640
So that's like it was like Muppet Babies.

810
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

811
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,760
Like you would have just like kind of a fantastical fantasy journey.

812
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
I guess not. They were in the nursery.

813
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,080
So they weren't even in a cool place like theme park.

814
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,200
But they're in a you're in a cool place imagining it's a cooler place

815
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,480
or that you're cooler people.

816
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,320
I guess that would be it. Yes.

817
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,720
That I that I would I would die if I had to just be myself.

818
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,200
So is that why you take on personas and play characters?

819
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,560
Is that like? Yeah, I know.

820
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,280
You know, I think the coolest thing about acting and performing

821
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,440
is that you get to be whoever you want to be.

822
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,720
You know what I mean?

823
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,040
You know, you could be someone who knows England.

824
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
Or you could say something cut out there.

825
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,280
You became some.

826
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,720
Wait, the Mookie's cutting out.

827
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,480
There's these other people showing up and say, who else got the zoom link?

828
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,960
Well, so far, so the Queen of England and a bum on the street,

829
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,840
a bum on the street, I think both from the same part of the state.

830
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,280
Assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.

831
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,120
OK, anybody.

832
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,280
Wait a minute.

833
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,760
Maybe you shouldn't be anybody blackout.

834
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,720
You can be anyone in your wildest fantasies.

835
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Do you?

836
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't know. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here.

837
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,640
But do you remember the characters at the park?

838
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh, God, this is like going to be too embarrassing.

839
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,240
I think it was like we were whatever it was.

840
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,160
It was like we were supposed to be two guys who are very cool.

841
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,120
And like we're starring in our own TV show and it's about.

842
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,280
The two of us being like.

843
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,360
Like like two adventurers or something where it's like,

844
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,520
like I feel like there was like a fantasy element to it, where it was like

845
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,680
there were people chasing us and we had to like get away from them and fight them.

846
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,160
So it's like, you know, we're on the rooster thing going around

847
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,320
and the people in the rooster thing behind us are chasing us with their own rooster.

848
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,160
Or like, you know, like the like the corkscrew roller coaster is like us,

849
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,600
like on some like train track, like getting away from the people

850
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
that are chasing us or something like that.

851
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,640
Again, that's like to the best of my memory.

852
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,920
That's it was something like that, where it was like because we would play

853
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,360
these characters like not at the theme park, too.

854
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,760
It would be like when we were just hanging out with the wilds, like

855
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,240
the theme park was like the the theme park was like, you know, and it's like

856
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,800
like the special episode of Family Matters where they shoot it at Disney World

857
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,880
or whatever. It's like that, where it's like the the special on location

858
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,920
episode of the fantasy TV show that we are in at Canopy Lake Park, where

859
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,960
normally when we're playing at one of our houses, we're just two guys

860
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,840
that have that have that shoot guns and play with swords or whatever.

861
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,400
But when but when we're at Canopy Lake Park, it's like now we have flying roosters

862
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,720
and like tilt the world tracks that like pull us into other dimensions or whatever.

863
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,120
We had we had we had we had wonderful imaginations.

864
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,120
I admire that you found someone who would commit to this with you,

865
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,640
because I feel like I would have flights of fancy like this.

866
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,400
As a child, and I would never in a million years utter them out.

867
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,560
I would be like this.

868
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,320
I cannot vocalize this where I will be put in a straight jacket.

869
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,360
Like they will wheel me away.

870
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,680
I probably had something where I like for some reason,

871
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,240
because I felt embarrassed about every fucking breath that I took as a child,

872
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,160
where I was just like, I don't know, maybe there was no filter on this one.

873
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,240
Or like this friend in particular was just like, I do that stupid,

874
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,400
dorky shit to idiot. Yeah, that's awesome.

875
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,960
I love that you had like a like a long narrative.

876
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,840
It was like a like a long serialized pro TV show or something.

877
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,360
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,960
That's like only child stuff to me, where it's just like,

879
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm alone with my imagination 24 seven.

880
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,280
So if any if if anybody wants to like do this with me, like, please, you're welcome.

881
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,040
Sure. Yeah. Thanks a lot of psyche, a major service.

882
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,880
I know I'm just like, I've got all these I've got all these.

883
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,120
It's kind of how I feel now.

884
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,160
It's like I have all these incredible creative thoughts in my head

885
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,320
and I just need to get them out.

886
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,360
Yeah, of course.

887
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,760
And if we were a different kind of podcast, right?

888
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,080
We would spend the next half an hour or so exploring those kind of things,

889
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,120
but we don't have time.

890
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,320
No time.

891
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,480
We have to say facts.

892
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,480
We have to say when things opened, we know there's there's characters in the

893
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,560
you don't have to just invent your own characters in the part.

894
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,000
You can meet some characters.

895
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,040
They're not tied to Disney or Warner Brothers or any of those things.

896
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,840
They had to make up their own things.

897
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,720
So so, you know, they have a set of characters.

898
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,080
I feel like Jason, maybe you have more about the about you as a less Jason.

899
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,880
I have pictures, but I didn't really find names.

900
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
There's a video where some of them have

901
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,520
there's like a video where they go through character boot camp.

902
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,080
Did you find that?

903
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,640
I saw that.

904
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,400
Yeah, like like it was just a little promotional video.

905
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
They do YouTube content.

906
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,200
They're content makers, too.

907
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,360
Yeah, they also probably have to.

908
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,560
I bet that place has changed a lot since the last time I was there.

909
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
I mean, the last time I was there

910
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,960
was probably like at least 20 years ago.

911
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,560
Oh, gotcha. Yeah.

912
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,680
So they have a YouTube channel.

913
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,440
That's one thing that happened.

914
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,600
Wouldn't have been possible then.

915
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,280
Like I didn't do any research.

916
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,880
Kind of a poorly labeled YouTube channel too.

917
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,520
I mean, this guy came across this guy a lot with a button nose.

918
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,160
Well, that's he's patches.

919
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,560
We know he has patches.

920
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,560
OK. Mike and I both we always says it on his stomach.

921
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah, yeah.

922
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,320
It was just funny how much we both wanted patches.

923
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,200
And he's a teddy bear.

924
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,080
Nobody said to I got was for a teddy bear.

925
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah, that's that.

926
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,800
That's the Leonardo DiCaprio once upon a time in Hollywood meme

927
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,880
when he's pointing at the way he went to patches.

928
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,640
But you use that feeling when you see patches.

929
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,640
That's the meat. We'll tweet that.

930
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,760
You're giving us content. Thank you.

931
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,000
You got it, guys.

932
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,440
Hey, look at that motherfucker.

933
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,120
This guy's great. Hey, I like him.

934
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,480
Is that I think his name might be Dapper the dog.

935
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah, I think that's right. Dapper the dog.

936
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,040
Sometimes you could find them because if you look on their Instagram,

937
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,720
they hashtag it with the name Dapper dog.

938
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,400
There's Molly Mouse.

939
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,760
Am I wrong about that?

940
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,960
I think I'm right. I think that's right.

941
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,040
Yeah, I recall none of these like mascots.

942
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,400
So I don't know if they like were a more recent addition to it

943
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
or I just wasn't paying attention.

944
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,520
It might be new.

945
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,680
I was trying to get little kids stuff, too.

946
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,520
Or something. Yeah. Yeah, that's kid stuff.

947
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,280
That's stupid.

948
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,480
Maybe they want to hang out with Simon the slug.

949
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,880
Maybe they didn't fit in the narrative.

950
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,200
You would have been constructed.

951
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,800
And then you just sort of ignored them because they weren't there.

952
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,160
You're like, that's not part of the world.

953
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,040
Anthropomorphic animals. Yeah, no, no, no.

954
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, I'm like, look, we're on.

955
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We have a structure here.

956
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,520
We're in Act two and you're not going to fuck this up.

957
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,160
We can't change the reality of the story now.

958
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,880
By bringing more of a two hander.

959
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,600
Yeah, we don't have time to visit Castaway Island.

960
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,880
We can't weave that into the narrative.

961
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,360
I love this guy. It's a cool parrot.

962
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,480
Yeah, they have a very like compact, but pretty,

963
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:34,320
pretty thorough water park that has a I think I saw it called a title title river.

964
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,480
It's like a combination wave pool, lazy river,

965
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,080
which I have never encountered that before.

966
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,880
So it's sending waves along while you're going.

967
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,120
Yeah. A little bit.

968
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,640
That's cool. A title river. Yeah.

969
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,680
We're into that.

970
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,920
Another neat thing is that

971
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,400
there were a bunch of it was all family that wanted to bring their hunting knives

972
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,440
into the park and the park didn't want them to have hunting knives.

973
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,600
So the security said they couldn't.

974
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,560
And then they got in a fight with the security and kicked the security

975
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,440
guard in the head.

976
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,360
And then I think they the whole family went to jail.

977
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,880
I want to hunt. We were hunting patches.

978
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,520
And rip his head open bag.

979
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,160
Terrace fluff out.

980
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,280
I have two quick things here from Instagram I'd like to bring up.

981
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,520
This is from a couple of years ago.

982
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,600
This is a performance by a band called Aero Myth.

983
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,080
The tribute band to Aero Smith, Aero Myth.

984
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,280
And you can see this man kind of looks like Steven Tyler.

985
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,520
If he does, and this kind of looks like guitarist to Brad Bradley Whitford,

986
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,000
not the actor.

987
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, there's you know, that did you know that my dad, you didn't know this.

988
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,520
I don't know what you're about to say.

989
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,960
My dad, when my dad was like 19 years old in in Massachusetts,

990
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
was in a band with Brad Whitford from.

991
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Oh, wow.

992
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,680
My dad was the bass player in a band.

993
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,840
They were called Sounds of the Poets.

994
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,480
Oh, wow. That is huge.

995
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,000
There's a lot of Aerosmith discourse on this podcast, and that's.

996
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,760
We see Aerosmith comes up all the damn time.

997
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,360
I but this is this is a useful piece of Aerosmith info.

998
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,640
I love it. Well, so you can help form the sound in a way.

999
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,520
Yeah, yeah. Sort of in the early.

1000
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,080
My dad says it. I don't know if this is true, but that he left my dad's band

1001
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,920
to join Aerosmith. Wow.

1002
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,840
That's crazy.

1003
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,280
He's like, I'm playing with these other guys who are more talented

1004
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,960
than you, Andy Blakelock.

1005
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
Oh, man. Did he?

1006
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,840
Did he ever stay in contact with him?

1007
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:43,080
He I like coincidentally, this is the only thing that I went to.

1008
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,760
There was a kid who was in my kindergarten class who was his nephew.

1009
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,120
And I remember my dad asked his mom one time, who is his sister,

1010
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,840
like, hey, ask your brother, Brad, if he remembers Andy Blakelock.

1011
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,360
And the conclusion was like, he said he did.

1012
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,480
OK, something that was the only

1013
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,400
that was the only and then years later, my dad worked for a company

1014
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,800
called California Closets that would organize that would like

1015
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,600
design like organization for people's closets.

1016
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,040
And I OK, I got very excited

1017
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,720
because I worked for the container store and we had alpha shelving

1018
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,640
and I planned closets for people.

1019
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,920
And California closets was always the thing we'd say, well, that's too expensive.

1020
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
They come to your house. You don't need to do that.

1021
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,240
You come in store. Yeah.

1022
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,840
Wow. That's interesting.

1023
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah, I'm mad.

1024
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,440
I'm mad at you now.

1025
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,560
Don't talk about my dad like that.

1026
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,080
But he worked for California Closets and he they were expensive closets.

1027
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,520
And he would be going to like all these crazy, expensive houses.

1028
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,440
And he did Joe Perry's closets. Wow. Really?

1029
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,520
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

1030
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,880
That's a lot of bookends.

1031
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,200
Joe Perry and was like he was like, I went there for a consultation

1032
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,480
and I was talking to like his assistant and it was like eight in the morning.

1033
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,920
And like at a certain point, like Joe Perry in like a satin robe,

1034
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,320
like stumbled out with like a cup of coffee and was like, are you doing my closets?

1035
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,440
And then I was like, did you ask him,

1036
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,800
did you tell him that used to be in a band with Brad Whitford?

1037
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,560
And he was like, no, I was at work.

1038
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,240
Very professional.

1039
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,080
Yeah, it's closet time. I'm at work. Yeah.

1040
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,000
Man, that's great.

1041
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,240
And I have yet to have that so crazy.

1042
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,320
California Closets, we would hear that all the time as our like

1043
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,920
they were our enemy when I worked at the container store.

1044
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,920
That that makes total sense because it's like truly it was just my dad would just

1045
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,640
be like, you won't believe the fucking houses I'm going to to design closets.

1046
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,840
It was like all for rich people. Yes.

1047
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,960
So yeah, we were we were it was still very expensive to put in the alpha

1048
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,920
shelving that I was designing for people, I think.

1049
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,960
But it was not nearly as bad as the California closet price.

1050
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,880
This is truly a sign of the way musicians like former working man

1051
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,400
musicians like Joe Perry can lose their way and lose sight of what the

1052
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,400
what the common man wants.

1053
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,720
What's wrong with the closet you have, you fucking.

1054
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,280
You made your first album in a closet.

1055
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,760
You didn't need a reorganization. Good point.

1056
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,880
Well, I lost the last touch.

1057
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,320
Well, but Aero Myth keeps the spirit alive.

1058
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,360
Here I am. Sorry. Sorry for the tangent.

1059
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,600
No, I love the tan. That's crucial info.

1060
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,720
Multiple great pieces there.

1061
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,240
Oh, yeah. Really? Commenter on this is Abby Elliott.

1062
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,680
Is that that Abby Elliott?

1063
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,800
It's the impersonator from Target.

1064
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,680
I don't think it is.

1065
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,600
No, this is the.

1066
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,200
We don't have to. We don't have to. I just was.

1067
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,080
Let's look at all of our photos and describe them.

1068
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,720
The real Abby Elliott was commenting on Aero Myth's Instagram.

1069
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,440
That would have been a very small world. Yeah.

1070
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,520
A little too small.

1071
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,680
You're a myth. Too perfect.

1072
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,400
So real quick, let me just I'm going to show you a picture of a recently

1073
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,080
redesigned color scheme for the Tilt-A-Whirl at this park.

1074
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,080
And you tell me what this looks like.

1075
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,320
OK, real quick. Here we go.

1076
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,200
Oh, boy. Oh, OK.

1077
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,480
So it's a booth.

1078
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,480
It's a little like shell.

1079
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,560
And it's got stars that are reminiscent of the American flag.

1080
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,720
But then also a big blue line.

1081
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,840
OK, right.

1082
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,800
Oh, man. Oh, no.

1083
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,080
I'm not crazy, right?

1084
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,880
No, no. I saw it right away.

1085
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,520
OK, good. Is that what they're intending?

1086
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,320
I don't know. Maybe.

1087
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,120
But it's the line. It's just like the cushion that's cushioning you

1088
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,800
from banging around in the Tilt-A-Whirl.

1089
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,280
That was the color before.

1090
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,360
But it's also a full blue.

1091
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,800
I'm not seeing any red anywhere.

1092
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,120
There's no red. And I don't know if that's an accident.

1093
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,120
I think this is a blue lives matter.

1094
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,600
Tilt-A-Whirl is what I'm saying.

1095
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,880
And I've never seen that before.

1096
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,480
So that's where you could at least at this at September 21st, 2020.

1097
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,360
That's what the Kenobi Park had going.

1098
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,160
Did they redesign it like early last summer?

1099
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,520
Like when did we get the scheme?

1100
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,680
I went through the comments to see if anyone like noticed it.

1101
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
And I don't think they did.

1102
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,760
Yeah, there's so much.

1103
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,160
Somebody went, hey, did you change the colors on this one?

1104
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,440
So somebody just maybe innocently and innocently enough was like, what?

1105
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,720
What happened? This is different.

1106
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,000
There is. I don't like them better.

1107
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,360
I don't know what it is I like about this, but I like the new colors that you did.

1108
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,160
I ride this Tilt-A-Whirl and yell and yell.

1109
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,760
Yeah, this is. Yeah.

1110
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,360
Get pumped up and see what else I can do with that energy.

1111
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,840
Fox and Friends should broadcast from this Tilt-A-Whirl every morning.

1112
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,240
Steve Doocy should ride the Tilt-A-Whirl.

1113
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,960
That group now is always.

1114
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,680
You have to save to melt the camera.

1115
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,280
Why don't you just do what the officer says?

1116
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,080
Aren't they to blame in a way to.

1117
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,600
Just lock the.

1118
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,440
Lock the camera.

1119
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,240
If you do what the officer says, then nothing bad will happen to you.

1120
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,240
I think they just don't know about it.

1121
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,200
That's why there's been no broadcast from here.

1122
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,840
I would like to if this podcast caused them to, like,

1123
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,920
you know, put a purple cushion in there instead.

1124
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Yeah, I think that's yeah.

1125
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,480
I think that's just a stock head cushion on a Tilt-A-Whirl.

1126
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,520
Yeah, I don't know.

1127
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,320
Jason's given them a little too much credit.

1128
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,520
I don't well know because like

1129
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,960
in the car in the original colony states, the red, white and blue is

1130
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
especially in New England.

1131
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,800
I feel like right.

1132
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,440
Mookie, do you think that like they just slap red, white and blue

1133
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,760
colonial shit on everything?

1134
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Where's the red, Jason?

1135
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,400
Where's the red?

1136
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,240
There's some red behind there on some other ride.

1137
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
You mean like, does New England have just like a red, white

1138
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,280
and blue aesthetic like naturally?

1139
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,520
I just in terms of the design, like I feel like parts of.

1140
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,080
Sure. Like, yeah, it's like every it's like every.

1141
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,880
I feel like when you think of New England, maybe this isn't reality,

1142
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,360
but it's like everything looks like it's like a Fourth of July parade

1143
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,400
or something, you know what I mean?

1144
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,120
Where there's like, yeah, little one of those little like half circle

1145
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,600
like red, white and blue, like ruffle flags or whatever

1146
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,160
that are like hanging off of shit.

1147
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,280
I think maybe it's not that, but that's what you're led to believe.

1148
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,720
Yeah, that feels right to me as somebody who's not been to the States

1149
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,640
and just knows it from media, I guess.

1150
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,560
Yeah, you know, like it chapter two. Right.

1151
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,600
Yes. Yeah. So that feels right.

1152
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,960
So, yeah, anyway, if you're a listener, go ahead.

1153
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,120
No, no, no, you go.

1154
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,720
I was just going to say, just if you're do it, do a report

1155
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,760
if you're around there and just see what's going on.

1156
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,520
Maybe the red and blue is maybe the red is on the side and we're not seeing it.

1157
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,840
We're being we're being stupid.

1158
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,440
Somebody's got to check this out for somebody.

1159
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,920
Got one car.

1160
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,720
Maybe all the different cars are different designs.

1161
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,880
That one was that's that card.

1162
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,680
That cart was donated by the Hampshire police to put the department

1163
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,080
and one is like a snake and says, don't tread on me.

1164
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

1165
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,960
So where we go on, we go on.

1166
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,200
One's just a Sean Hannity's face painted on the back of it.

1167
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,080
Everyone's different.

1168
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,480
They're all different cars.

1169
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,640
The tilt. I don't think we said they do have a ride.

1170
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,000
They have a shoot the shoot ride, which is shoot the shoot is all they got.

1171
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,640
The longer log flumes that fit like eight or 10 in a row,

1172
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,760
like the Jurassic Park ride.

1173
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,600
OK, that attraction at Kenobi is called

1174
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,360
a canopy, excuse me.

1175
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,920
It's called the Boston Tea Party.

1176
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,120
Yes, I vaguely remember that ride.

1177
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,480
Yeah. Again, just profiting off any like colony shit like New England.

1178
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,120
Revolutionary war.

1179
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:45,560
I lost track of the number of times I went to battlefields or like old farms

1180
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,640
or like this is how they ran a big crowd when they had to cut the crops, you know.

1181
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,800
Yeah, I like New England is so like

1182
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,160
you know, there's a lot of history or whatever.

1183
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,240
So I think it's like there's a, you know, they were like,

1184
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,920
you're right, it was like they were like among the first like 13 colonies.

1185
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,040
So it's just like this is our shit, man.

1186
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,680
This is like our identity.

1187
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,440
Like we were the the pilgrims and, you know, the pilgrims

1188
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,840
were on Plymouth Rock and the fucking.

1189
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,320
Whatever the Boston Tea Party, like Paul Revere's Boston,

1190
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,560
where it's just like this is our shit, our old tri-corner hat

1191
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,360
shit. This is us.

1192
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,920
We love it. The greatest hit.

1193
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,800
They're like doing the greatest hits and like, yeah, that's if you come there,

1194
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,720
that's what you want.

1195
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,520
And it's like you want founding fathers.

1196
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,920
You want some historical things.

1197
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,760
And then you want the bad boys of Boston Aerosmith.

1198
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,360
You want everything in the area that's famous.

1199
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,760
Oh, check out the cranberry,

1200
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,800
the ocean spray cranberry processing and visitor center.

1201
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,160
Oh, they have an ocean spray sponsorship.

1202
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,640
No, I well, no, I've just been to like the ocean spray factory

1203
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,960
in Plymouth, Massachusetts or the ocean spray.

1204
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,200
Like you can see a tour and see how bugs.

1205
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,160
Yeah. Learn how bugs work.

1206
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,840
Wow. You've been in a bog.

1207
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,680
You'd be waist deep and berries.

1208
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,120
No, we just saw like big pictures and recreations like, you know, I haven't.

1209
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,360
I'd love to go in a bog and just, you know, get in there and mess around.

1210
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,600
But I've seen Plymouth Rock.

1211
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
I see that around in there, man.

1212
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,200
Just fuck around. Find out P in the bog.

1213
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,720
Yeah, I really want to be in a bunch of rune, a batch of cranberries.

1214
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,040
I Mike, with the the Aerosmith thing, they seem to have a lot of tribute bands.

1215
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,280
Yeah, there's I think it's weird that they I'm surprised.

1216
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,880
I don't think I knew there was there were tributes of this or how you would do it.

1217
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,800
But there is a Bruno Mars tribute, which is kind of funny.

1218
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,160
And you can watch that on a YouTube link where the person sat through

1219
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,320
the entire 25 minute show and yet still labeled it tribute to Bruno Moss.

1220
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,080
Spelled not not Moss like I may guess, but like tree moss.

1221
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,880
Right. Right. Oh, man.

1222
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,600
I liked it. Nice, nice fella. Nice performer.

1223
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,840
Bruno Moss.

1224
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,360
And then you think maybe it was a spelling error or something,

1225
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,760
but then they made another video.

1226
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,400
They seem to go again, post another video and say Moss again.

1227
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,560
Is that the name of the like a real myth is the name of the.

1228
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,960
Oh, it could be Bruno Moss. Is that the no?

1229
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,280
I think. Yeah. Yeah.

1230
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,240
Aaron asked that question.

1231
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,000
And I think it the video is called Tribute to Bruno Moss.

1232
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,560
So unless it itself is a tribute to another Bruno Mars impersonator

1233
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,360
named Bruno Moss and then were two steps impersonator removed.

1234
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,000
Could be a labeling issue.

1235
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,720
It could be. Yes, you're correct.

1236
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,480
They're tribute. The likelier answer.

1237
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,200
The most likely answer I'd say is that the person that posted it

1238
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,960
is a common moron.

1239
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,920
You fool.

1240
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,920
You're run of the mill American moronic idiot.

1241
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,240
You posted an error on the Internet and you should be shamed for this.

1242
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,280
What else do we have about Canada?

1243
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,440
Because there's other places to hit and there is a ride coming up

1244
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,840
that I am thrilled to talk about. But are we missing anything on Canobie?

1245
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,040
Let me let me do a real quick one.

1246
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,120
And then the ride's big.

1247
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,040
If I found this to Jason, you'll be excited about this.

1248
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,280
And at least in 2014, there was something you get a coupon.

1249
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,080
It's a dollar hot dog day.

1250
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,280
And you could. Yeah, it was like there's two coupons.

1251
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,400
There's a coupon for like saving money on the actual admission.

1252
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,200
And then on the bottom there, you would present the coupon

1253
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,000
and get your dollar hot dog.

1254
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,040
And you would. I mean, is there a better deal?

1255
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,480
From the from the food supply people at Sodexo.

1256
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,400
The giant food company.

1257
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,400
Wait, is Sodexo bad? Why is Sodexo bad?

1258
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,920
I don't think anyone said it was bad.

1259
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,800
I mean, it's just kind of like a big monopolistic like food supply company.

1260
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,480
Like, I don't think you have a lot of choices if you need a certain quantity

1261
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,560
of food, like if you're running a restaurant or like a college

1262
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,200
dining hall or something.

1263
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,720
So, Jason, you knew what Sodexo was before this,

1264
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,040
because I actually was not familiar with that name.

1265
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,200
So Sodexo Marriott was the people who supplied

1266
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,080
like the dining halls I worked in in college.

1267
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,920
Oh, interesting.

1268
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,640
So you were like you were familiar. You worked with Sodexo.

1269
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,080
I think they paid me.

1270
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,720
I think that's who like.

1271
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,800
Wow, you're a Sodexo former employee.

1272
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,040
Sodexo's blood money. You're rich.

1273
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,440
Are they paying you now?

1274
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,440
Yeah, they paid you now.

1275
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,160
Wow. Sodexo.

1276
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,200
Oh, no wonder we had to spend the fucking time talking about Sodexo.

1277
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,320
Oh, man, he always has to slip it in now.

1278
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,160
What if Mike's in on it?

1279
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,200
He brought up that Instagram.

1280
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,760
So that Sodexo would get said.

1281
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,600
Yeah. You guys want to go out to dinner tonight?

1282
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,360
I was maybe thinking we could go someplace where they're supplied

1283
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,800
by the Sodexo brand of food supply.

1284
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,440
Yeah. So hot dog links specifically.

1285
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,240
They just because it's a little more snap to them.

1286
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,520
Mm hmm.

1287
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,080
Jason and I have both gotten a fat check from Sodexo.

1288
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,360
That is right.

1289
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,360
Well, do you know one episode every four years?

1290
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,040
And that's all we have to do.

1291
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,120
So we're good.

1292
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,080
We're good for a while.

1293
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,520
They won't come shaking us down again.

1294
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,520
Do we want to move along?

1295
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,560
Do we want to talk about Santa's Village a little bit?

1296
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,160
Because boy, oh, boy, I wonder if Mike and Jason,

1297
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,720
do we all find the same thing, the ride?

1298
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,680
Oh, I think so. Yeah.

1299
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,240
But yeah, I know which ride you're talking about.

1300
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,040
It probably wasn't there. I think it's a newer thing.

1301
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,200
What do you recall about the Santa's Village of your childhood?

1302
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,960
I mean, Jefferson, New Hampshire.

1303
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,040
Yeah. So Santa's Village is probably the one that I like,

1304
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,440
have the least memories of, because it was like a boring ass.

1305
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,120
Like you walk around and it looks like Christmas.

1306
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,040
And there's like I truly I truly could not tell you one thing

1307
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,280
that I did there other than like you walk around and there's maybe

1308
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,680
like a little train ride or something.

1309
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,480
But like I do. I barely remember Santa's Village truly.

1310
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,400
And I'm sorry. I think it's OK.

1311
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,040
I know. But you see you brought in a prompt for us is what you did.

1312
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,480
Good. And you caused us to have to look up because there's Santa's

1313
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,400
Villages around and you sort of know what to expect.

1314
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,360
There will be an opportunity. Are they all affiliated?

1315
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,040
That's what I've always wondered, because I remember.

1316
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,640
So else I remember somebody else.

1317
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,680
It's just it's just like a it's just a common concept

1318
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,880
because I remember hearing other people go,

1319
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,840
we have a Santa's Village near us.

1320
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,600
And I was like, you have Santa's Village.

1321
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,040
I have Santa's Village, but I didn't I I've never known if they were there.

1322
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,400
They're all just separate intellectual properties.

1323
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,520
Santa Claus and fairy tale storybook stuff are in the public domain.

1324
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,560
So someone starting an abusive park, it's an easy place to start.

1325
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,640
Right. And you're probably yeah, you're probably getting like even like,

1326
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,240
if you say somebody moves from some other place,

1327
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,800
then they like think it's all sort of the same thing, too.

1328
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,840
So you're getting probably like, oh, I love Santa's Village as a child.

1329
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,240
Let's go to this Santa's Village.

1330
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,760
So smart, smart move.

1331
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,000
And you're like, this shit isn't anything like mine.

1332
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,600
Mm hmm. The different Santa. No brand unity here. Right.

1333
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,240
But I say thank God that this isn't like the other ones, because there's like

1334
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,960
there's some real odd stuff.

1335
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,360
There's odd IP all over the place.

1336
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,040
I just want to share the screen really quick so that I could show you

1337
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,480
that the area called Pugi's splash pad.

1338
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,920
There's a fancy penguin with a top hat and a little

1339
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,280
a little tie in one picture, but the knot in the other two.

1340
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,600
They're inconsistent just with Pugi's style.

1341
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,720
But what a name, though. Love Pugi. Yeah, we like.

1342
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,640
Love Pugi the penguin. Yes.

1343
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,040
It's it's like it's a character making fun of you, Mookie.

1344
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,520
It's like they're like it's a parody of you.

1345
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,560
Pugi. So Pugi splash pad is there.

1346
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:04,520
But the main thing to talk about is a I'm just so like

1347
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,280
because there's limited IP with Christmas.

1348
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,400
Like, what do you do really?

1349
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,800
Besides, like, here's the the bake shop where Mrs.

1350
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Claus makes her cookies or something.

1351
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,600
But this place really figured out something with a ride called

1352
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,800
the Great Humbug Adventure.

1353
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,080
Yeah, all did you guys? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,920
Love this. Love it. Yes.

1355
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,320
I wonder if do I try to explain the ride

1356
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:34,560
or just allow the man himself to do it?

1357
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,120
I think maybe this is the move because I don't know if you guys saw

1358
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,600
the same video that I did.

1359
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,120
There's ride throughs, but then there's one.

1360
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,200
There's this one that's like very artistically cut.

1361
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,840
Let me pull this guy up.

1362
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,840
I mean, this this explains it so succinctly.

1363
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,240
And this is true insanity. Here we go.

1364
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,200
I am Ebenezer Scrooge, and this is my home.

1365
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,720
And these humbugs are making me miserable.

1366
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,000
So it's always stuff right there.

1367
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,440
These are bugs are making me like, I don't know why the emphasis is there.

1368
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,080
Maybe somebody was arguing that the humbugs aren't making it miserable.

1369
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,080
And you have to correct them.

1370
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,800
But so this is a rough Ebenezer Scrooge famously says, Bah, humbug.

1371
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,240
And I guess this is a ride that imagines that humbug.

1372
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,320
That's not just something he's saying.

1373
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:36,040
Ebenezer Scrooge is a grouch because is how this is infested with humbugs.

1374
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,440
Oh, my God. It's a reimagining of it's a reimagining of the story.

1375
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,200
Yes, which I really like. Yeah. Yeah.

1376
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,240
And you know why he doesn't like Christmas.

1377
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,320
This is like this is like if you did the or if you did like the solo

1378
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,400
like origin story of of Ebenezer Scrooge.

1379
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,200
And it's like, why does he say, you know what I mean?

1380
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,040
Where it's like, you know how in solo when it's like

1381
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,800
that fucking stupid thing where it's where he's like Chewbacca, that's too long.

1382
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,040
I'm going to have to call you something shorter like Chewie.

1383
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,240
This is like humbugs everywhere.

1384
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,920
And you're like, oh, that's why he says humbug now.

1385
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,800
And that's that would be everything in your life.

1386
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,160
There was a one moment that caused it for sure.

1387
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,520
When Paul McCartney walked by that guitar shop and looked in the window and nodded.

1388
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,800
And the legend was born.

1389
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,120
I don't really remember where this video goes.

1390
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,720
If there's nothing interesting, I'm just going to let it play kind of

1391
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,840
silently while we talk, because

1392
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,760
look, there's one now.

1393
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,600
Oh, wait a minute here.

1394
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,240
If I go back frame by frame, you can read the sign, which explains further the

1395
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,280
I mean, first it says Santa says no food or drinks on this ride.

1396
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,240
And himself lays down the rules here.

1397
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,520
But then the great humbug adventure.

1398
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:06,320
Tickle the humbugs with your special laser and make them finally giggle.

1399
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,920
Why finally?

1400
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,280
All right. A lot of questions here.

1401
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,520
Finally, I don't know why.

1402
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,120
I guess this has been a decade long.

1403
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,480
And finally, that's very hard to see.

1404
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,200
Mm hmm. I think so.

1405
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,560
And it's parenthetical, like fine.

1406
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,840
Make them finally giggle.

1407
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,760
Really weird.

1408
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,880
And then just the phrase tickle your humbugs, tickle the humbugs with your special

1409
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,120
laser tickle the kind of with your special laser.

1410
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,320
Yeah, just everyone's sitting there for a moment.

1411
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,880
Just think about it.

1412
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,600
Say it out loud.

1413
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,800
So special to go there and with your special narrate in that

1414
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,200
tickle. It's a good ASMR.

1415
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,880
I said this before. Turn off the podcast while you're listening now and turn to

1416
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,440
the nearest person, find them and just run in and say that sentence to them

1417
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,480
and then run out.

1418
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,200
Tickle the humbugs with your special laser.

1419
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,160
Exactly. And see what they say.

1420
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,760
We melodic the more you say it.

1421
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,440
Tickle the humbugs with your special laser with your special laser.

1422
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,640
It seems like a procedure to like that's like a lot of euphemisms for like

1423
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,040
getting rid of genital warts or something.

1424
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,840
You don't want to tell your child that's what the operation dad is going to have.

1425
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,720
Honey, your father is going to have his humbugs removed.

1426
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,800
And the doctor's going to tickle them with his special laser.

1427
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,480
The doctor is also a master tickler.

1428
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:45,680
Um, this is yeah, this this was made by the Sally Dark Rides Company who made

1429
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,840
Mookie there was once a ride based on the moody blues song Nights in White

1430
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:56,320
Satin at a heart, a short lived hard rock park in by Myrtle Beach.

1431
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,080
And this Sally Dark Rides Company has made a number of dark rides

1432
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,400
all over the country, all over the world.

1433
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,280
They did the Justice League rides at Six Flags.

1434
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,640
And then they also made the humbug.

1435
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,640
I think they've made a lot of weirdo rides.

1436
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,200
There's some Looney Tunes ride they did.

1437
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,160
I looked up there is a ride.

1438
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,320
Have you ever heard of this, Jason?

1439
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,080
In Pennsylvania, they did a ride with animatronics that is Mr.

1440
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:26,560
Rogers' neighborhood where you ride the trolley to bring trolleys back there.

1441
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,360
I had no idea there was a Mr. Rogers ride.

1442
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,240
I've heard a little about that.

1443
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,440
Yeah, they changed it into Daniel Tiger.

1444
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,400
Is that right? Am I thinking of the same ride?

1445
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,560
Oh, did I? I don't know. I thought maybe it just disappeared.

1446
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,480
Yeah, there was a Mr.

1447
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,960
Rogers ride and they changed it to the just Daniel Tiger specific. OK.

1448
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,760
Anyway, this place makes some like bonkers rides.

1449
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,360
We might want to do an episode where we just pick off their website,

1450
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,960
whether or not they are still around or not.

1451
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,400
Like if it is a like weird, wonky,

1452
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,240
kind of scary, kooky animatronic filled ride,

1453
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,760
I think we might just want to like throw darts at Sally rides and then do it.

1454
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,880
That's the point.

1455
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,520
But they definitely are because I went to their digital booth

1456
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,240
at the IAPA convention last year, which was all digital.

1457
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,600
Digital. You went to a digital booth.

1458
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,520
That's right. Yeah.

1459
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,840
I looked at their prospectuses and such because they sell a lot of rides

1460
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,840
that are like pre-made, right, right.

1461
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,560
That you could just insert into your park.

1462
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,560
Mm hmm. I think I think I got like a cold sweat being like that.

1463
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,560
We have a guest here and that and that like a virtual prospectus

1464
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,360
for a ride company was talked about.

1465
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,320
Yeah, that's all right. We're cool, dude.

1466
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,000
I swear we're like pretty cool.

1467
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,440
We're not even that nerdy about it.

1468
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,960
Let's go back to normal stuff like the narratives we would tell ourselves

1469
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,560
as children to distract ourselves from our mundane suburban upbringings.

1470
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,680
Anyway, I don't know.

1471
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,640
Here's a really this is a like like a scary wax figure come to life.

1472
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,040
He's pointing a gun.

1473
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,560
This whole video is like I don't know who made this or why,

1474
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,760
but like it's kind of like it's not just like the ride going through it.

1475
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,800
It's full of really intense angles and cinematic close ups.

1476
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,280
It's sort of a fever dream.

1477
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,760
And then the the hump like the humbugs are sort of eerie.

1478
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,240
In other world, they have like flower ears.

1479
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,120
They're like they're soos like.

1480
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,200
Yeah. And they're yeah, they're like kind of cute, but they're little gross.

1481
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,880
Not Scrooge's house also.

1482
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,200
That's just a whole other premise.

1483
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,080
So is arriving at where Ebenezer Scrooge lives.

1484
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,880
So good, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1485
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,040
I'm fun. Pretty obsessed.

1486
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,080
Dying to go here and tickle some.

1487
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,240
Why is it tickle though?

1488
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,240
Oh, wow. Look at the bugs. They're so cute.

1489
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,840
The humbugs. Yeah.

1490
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,280
There's like five humbugs.

1491
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,120
One of the great trips.

1492
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,040
They have a cute humbugs tickled them.

1493
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,760
But they're like aliens. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1494
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,640
Yeah, there's a lot going on.

1495
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,600
I know you wouldn't even like maybe flag these as bugs necessarily.

1496
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,240
Like they're a little more.

1497
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,560
Well, they have like bumblebee torsos, but this is very like Salem Witch Museum.

1498
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,320
OK. Wait, is that a place?

1499
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,160
Is that is that a New Hampshire Salem or is that Salem, Massachusetts?

1500
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,960
So that's where the witch trials took place.

1501
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,240
And they have the they have the witch museum there and you go in.

1502
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,800
But they have these like very old, like very creepy animatronics.

1503
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,680
Oh, where they like tell the story of like

1504
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,840
whatever, like the crucible or whatever.

1505
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,720
Right. It's like very it's like very unnerving.

1506
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,840
That's that is even on a radar.

1507
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,680
We got to do that. Yeah.

1508
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,560
If there's weird red robots, that's a pretty cool one.

1509
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,400
It's like very old.

1510
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,520
And I think they haven't changed it in like years and years.

1511
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,560
But it's like you go and you sit in this like little room and there's like little

1512
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,000
they like light up little animatronic like things and they tell you the story

1513
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,200
of the Salem witch trials and stuff like that.

1514
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,400
Oh, man. Yeah, so great.

1515
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,080
Hasn't been touched in years.

1516
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:01,120
That is the here's not by our favorite song here.

1517
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,040
Also, those humbugs had like little like side mouths like they were like,

1518
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,640
like they were slack jawed or something like that.

1519
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,320
It's it's.

1520
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,320
Yeah, they're all snarky comics.

1521
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,680
Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,880
They're like they're yeah, they're all little Bill Maher's

1523
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,760
YouTube thumbnail face.

1524
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,600
Yeah, they are.

1525
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,240
They see culture is out of country.

1526
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,120
It's run amok.

1527
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,000
And we know I know running amok.

1528
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,680
I'm a humbug.

1529
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,240
So all right, that's what I wanted to say about Santa's village primarily.

1530
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,680
Should we move on to the the oddest thing on your list?

1531
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:45,120
Really? Like I think when I gave it the cursory Google, what are I'm sorry?

1532
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,480
What? Like I had to double check.

1533
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,960
We were talking about the right thing.

1534
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,080
Clark's trading post.

1535
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,920
Clark's trading post. Yes.

1536
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,280
What do you want to describe it as a person who went?

1537
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,160
Yeah, well, so I mean, it's like there's there's two major things about this

1538
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,840
place that I have memories of, two major attractions.

1539
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,480
But it's a it's like a sort of larger like compound trading post

1540
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,320
where it's like it's like, you know, like cool general store vibes.

1541
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,480
But they have like old trucks that you can look at and like old

1542
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:22,200
an old looking like, you know, like an old 50s gas station facade.

1543
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,920
But there's two major attractions there, which is.

1544
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,680
Which is Clark's trained bears.

1545
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,000
So they would put on a show with bears.

1546
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,200
I think they still do, which is sad.

1547
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,520
But that was like for many years.

1548
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,160
And when it was over 49, it's decades and decades of bear shows

1549
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,880
where they do bear live bear shows, where it's like bears are balancing on balls

1550
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,480
and like, you know, shooting a basketball into a hoop

1551
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,360
and jumping through little hoops and stuff.

1552
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,480
So there was that.

1553
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,120
And then there's the tram ride with the.

1554
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,840
Oh, fuck, what's he called?

1555
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,720
Like the old man. There's there's a.

1556
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,800
I know about this.

1557
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,880
I was delighted.

1558
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,920
You would ride through.

1559
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,760
It's almost like kind of like the haunted hayride.

1560
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,000
But you were in this old like,

1561
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,520
you know, like like like hollowed out or like, you know, the sides taken off bus

1562
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,720
and you ride through this thing and an old man, an old like steampunk

1563
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,560
man, like chases you through

1564
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,520
through the woods.

1565
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,680
His name is Wolfman Wolfman.

1566
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,680
Wolfman, you get him to.

1567
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,800
Did you read about this?

1568
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,600
The way that you get him to leave you alone.

1569
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,080
Did you read this, Scott? I did.

1570
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,920
But you I feel like you should say it.

1571
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,080
I love everybody on everybody on the bus.

1572
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,440
Men, women and children included.

1573
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,080
You all yell, Scram, you old goat.

1574
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,480
This rules love.

1575
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,440
You old goat.

1576
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,560
And that's how the Wolfman would leave you alone.

1577
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,640
But it was like a guy who had like big, like a big red beard

1578
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,400
and big crazy hair, like an eye patch and like a club.

1579
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,200
And he had like a steampunk ATV and he would chase after you and be like,

1580
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,160
oh, and they're like, it's the Wolfman.

1581
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,080
And you had to drive away from the Wolfman and we would all go,

1582
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,160
Scram, you old goat.

1583
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,200
And then the Wolfman would be scared because you yelled, Scram, you old goat.

1584
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,080
And that was the tram ride of.

1585
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,720
As a child was genuinely afraid of the Wolfman.

1586
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,040
He looks scary to me.

1587
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,400
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

1588
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,400
That's like advertise that.

1589
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,480
They advertise like the guy and that catchphrase right on the front of the website.

1590
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,120
That's like the first thing you see when you go to the website.

1591
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,520
And he's like written about in the newspaper a lot.

1592
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,080
Like if there's change over with the Wolfman when the oldest Wolfman retired.

1593
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,360
And he's like, I don't know.

1594
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,160
I don't know.

1595
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:32,960
I don't know.

1596
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,920
I don't know.

1597
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,360
I think it's like the same thing with the Wolfman when the oldest Wolfman retired

1598
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,440
and then he's picking his successor.

1599
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,440
This seems like major local flavor.

1600
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,400
I don't know for how far emanating from Lincoln, New Hampshire,

1601
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,640
but at least there's some places in New Hampshire where Wolfman and Scram,

1602
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,240
you old goat loom really large.

1603
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:56,280
Yeah, I mean, in retrospect, it must be like those just it must be like a local

1604
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,560
actor or something being like, I got the Wolfman.

1605
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,800
Well, I found I found the story of it.

1606
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,120
I think essentially, but there was a so, yeah, as you said, this was, you know,

1607
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,320
the main thing was was bear shows and they'd make the bears play bear

1608
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:17,040
skit ball and and also do like this seemed to like involve bears

1609
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,080
in a wedding proposal once, like a bear pulled out a wedding ring,

1610
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,600
all kinds of weird humiliating bear things.

1611
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,440
And that was like the main attraction.

1612
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,360
But then like the only people who knew how to do the bear show

1613
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,640
had to go out of town so they couldn't do the bear show.

1614
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,440
And it's like, well, we do have the train still or the little or whatever.

1615
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,520
You were saying the car with one side missing.

1616
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,560
But is that enough?

1617
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,240
And then there was like a maintenance guy who just who looked like Wolfman,

1618
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,400
who just just was very scraggly.

1619
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,360
And he was just kind of thinking and was like, I'm going to take a risk.

1620
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,520
But if this risk pays off, it might change everything around here.

1621
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,840
And he went and found some weird firsts.

1622
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,280
And when the train started going around, he went up and started screaming at it.

1623
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,720
And made up the whole wolf.

1624
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,680
I'm a man raised by wolves.

1625
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,000
He just did it without checking with the owners or anything.

1626
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,640
And then it became like, well, if we don't have the bears,

1627
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,440
we always have Wolfman like it was a crucial second attraction.

1628
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,840
It really like it just like, I think, amplified the place and fleshed it out.

1629
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,760
And it was all this one guy.

1630
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,360
Wow. And Allegia was born.

1631
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,680
And a guy who, I mean, big risk like I'm shocked that nobody was like,

1632
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,160
what the fuck are you doing?

1633
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,040
Yeah, I want a little tram ride and you're running up going like,

1634
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,960
I'm the wolf man. Get out of my woods.

1635
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,200
I do like I feel like most people, they'd be like, you can't do that, dude.

1636
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,400
Yeah, it's like Disneyland.

1637
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,080
You can't just say I'm like, I'm trying this.

1638
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm going to start screaming, scared, spitting on the tram tour.

1639
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,760
Like you can't do that at the container store.

1640
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,800
I like put like I glued some of the shelving to my legs.

1641
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,600
I was like, I'm shelf boy.

1642
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,280
Yeah. Get out of here.

1643
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,280
I'm trying to scare you.

1644
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,960
Scram, you old shelf.

1645
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,200
Scram, you old shelf.

1646
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:10,320
One enterprising manager was like, I think we got something with shelf boy.

1647
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,720
Shelf boy. That took balls, Carlson.

1648
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,320
I took a risk.

1649
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,000
Container store could be more than a store.

1650
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,880
It could be a brand.

1651
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,600
I have a little video of the wolf man because it gives you a flavor of the.

1652
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,360
Yeah.

1653
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,800
This this is this is truly

1654
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,120
you guys post pictures of this afterwards on Twitter so people can see them.

1655
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,200
Yeah. Yeah. Well, assuming we remember.

1656
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,920
Yes. That's right.

1657
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,360
I'll send you. I'll get it.

1658
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,640
I'll get a few and send them to.

1659
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,760
Oh, if you got old pig.

1660
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,360
Yes, please. Oh, no.

1661
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,440
You know, I wonder if I do.

1662
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,440
I should ask my parents if they have because my mom just went through

1663
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,320
a bunch of old photos.

1664
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,160
I was like, if you have any, please send me some.

1665
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,400
I'm going to ask her.

1666
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,320
I'm going to text her as soon as we're done.

1667
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,400
Oh, right now.

1668
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,720
And then she might listen to it and be like, you didn't like the vacations.

1669
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,200
I thought you had fun at the arcade.

1670
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,400
Oh, my God.

1671
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,000
Wow. You've got some of that negative wolf man spirit.

1672
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,160
Here's here's the wolf man.

1673
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,800
You know, I don't like, oh, dad, you're flat,

1674
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,760
my land and my bopping yellow belly, long nose geysers.

1675
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,120
What are you doing on my turf?

1676
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,320
No, I do. Do you?

1677
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,040
I'll take it and I'll take your hands and I'll stick it right down those jaws.

1678
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,880
And then so he's a guy in like furs and an eye patch.

1679
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,480
We hadn't said that he's missing a lot of teeth.

1680
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,560
He's super scraggly.

1681
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,760
And then he says, I'm going to throw your down our jaws right there.

1682
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,280
And fucking great.

1683
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,600
Like this is my car.

1684
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,760
Like great Boston accent, just like this, my car over here.

1685
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,240
My car has jaws.

1686
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,000
Is there a car?

1687
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,840
My car's got a car.

1688
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,680
This is my car.

1689
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,840
You're kidding. You're going in the jaws.

1690
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,680
That's it. You're going in the jaws on my car.

1691
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,840
So he kind of like he seems to hit a button and then like some big

1692
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,800
like bear trap looking thing is going on and off in front of his car.

1693
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,560
And it is like little picket fence pieces that are jaw like is

1694
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:22,280
his weird little bad Maxi car has a mouth in it

1695
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,840
and he's going to feed your kid into the jaws.

1696
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,160
Man, that would have scared the shit out of me.

1697
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,760
This guy will.

1698
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,160
It's scary, man.

1699
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,760
And he like fucking and he's got and his car is like, it's like one of those

1700
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,560
like old like it's like a it's like a lawnmower engine or something.

1701
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,840
So it's like the whole time.

1702
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,440
Like when he's chasing you, it's like loud and he's like screaming at you

1703
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,280
and waving his club.

1704
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,800
The lo fi.

1705
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,560
Yeah, it makes it worse.

1706
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,960
The lo fi nature of it.

1707
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,400
Well, and it's also not like, you know, you you can kind of smell

1708
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,040
in a universal setting that like, well, there's an actor air to the Norman Bates.

1709
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,280
And it doesn't it's not a real knife.

1710
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:04,920
But when this like rusted out car pulls up with it like this,

1711
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,280
what if this is just a guy who lives in the hills?

1712
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,200
It's in the hills.

1713
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,400
Like conceivably, he just lives there and he is mad.

1714
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,880
Yeah, he's just like he's very believable.

1715
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, you would not be able to tell.

1716
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,600
I mean, if I was a kid, I would just be like, what is this accent?

1717
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,960
This must be a hill person accent.

1718
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,040
He he keeps going and says this is my favorite thing in the clip here.

1719
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,960
And if you ever come when they double cross me,

1720
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,200
you become vomit stew, especially kids,

1721
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,240
boiled kids with cabbage and rottel.

1722
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,440
That's my favorite.

1723
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,240
The.

1724
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,760
I mean, that that little thing is like what Charles Manson would say,

1725
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,000
like when he went on Charlie Rose and then like a gibbity gibbity gibbity.

1726
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,080
Like that, that is true serial killer stuff.

1727
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,800
Yeah, this guy, I, I, I admire the commitment

1728
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,960
and I admire the history of the character.

1729
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,840
But yeah, I, oh, scary.

1730
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,040
Varmint stew.

1731
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,000
He's going to with kids, boiled kids with.

1732
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,720
Yeah, it's become varmint stew.

1733
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,000
It's like it's varmint stew, but it's the special extra ingredient is kids.

1734
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,520
His child's flesh. Yeah.

1735
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,960
Yeah, no kids. He poils them.

1736
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,720
I want to have like a like a listing for playing him on the website.

1737
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,640
Like, could I apply to be the wolf man or would I just like they would look at me

1738
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,000
and they go, you don't look like the wolf man.

1739
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,440
What are you doing?

1740
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,040
There's a lot of people vying for that spot, man.

1741
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,160
Yeah, that's yeah, that's you're right.

1742
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,560
There's probably like they hold like open call nationwide auditions.

1743
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:41,840
That's like that's like that's like like landing, like like hosting the tonight show.

1744
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,840
It's it only happens to very few people in the world.

1745
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,080
Lauren Michaels has a lot of drama every time there's a change.

1746
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,480
Yeah, there's so much the guy says he's going to give it up and then doesn't.

1747
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,720
Yeah. And Lauren has a lot to do with it, too.

1748
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,920
Guys, mom says I'll look sweet.

1749
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,160
All right. A lead. Nice.

1750
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,440
Within the episode, we didn't even have to wait for it.

1751
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,320
That was a question I had is if like, is there some would a couple

1752
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,760
if a couple of different things happened in your life, Mookie,

1753
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,640
is there a chance that you're that you are the wolf man?

1754
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,160
You know, you know, look,

1755
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,760
it's tough. Los Angeles is tough.

1756
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,960
You know, am I going to be here forever pursuing this dream of mine?

1757
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,840
I don't know. Maybe I retire as an older gentleman in another,

1758
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,600
I don't know, 10, 15, 20 years back to New England.

1759
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,920
And go, well, I have this skill, this we talked about it earlier,

1760
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,720
this skill where I could become anybody.

1761
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,920
You know, we do know we know that you have this.

1762
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,560
We know that you can inhabit different personas.

1763
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,600
And you know, it is entirely new people showed up.

1764
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,640
Yes. The answer is I wouldn't rule it out.

1765
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,280
Yeah. It's straight.

1766
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,560
You do the work now.

1767
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,840
You're not gray now, but maybe someday.

1768
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,480
And you start growing the hair. Is he not gray?

1769
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,440
Oh, you know, wait a minute. What am I talking about?

1770
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,360
Yeah, you don't have to be. Wolfman's not old. He's a ginger.

1771
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,400
You're right. You're right. But you so if you do.

1772
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,240
But if you start putting in the hair work now, if you don't cut it,

1773
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,480
start growing. Yeah.

1774
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,800
Yeah. If I don't shave for the next 15 years, then.

1775
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,040
And then all of your credits and work up to this point

1776
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,680
just become like, hmm, I guess. All right.

1777
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,360
Well, I guess he seems like he knows that he's acted before.

1778
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,920
But does that is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1779
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,000
Is he going to intellectualize Wolfman? He was the last Wolfman.

1780
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,920
Yeah. And if you're if you're like in the next like 15 years, somebody goes,

1781
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,320
oh, you're growing it out for a role.

1782
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,040
And you go, yes, a long term role.

1783
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,760
The role of a lifetime, the role of a lifetime that I'll get in 15 years.

1784
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,400
That's really my future.

1785
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,200
I would be curious if any of the Wolfman ever were like,

1786
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,400
I was in a local commercial or something or like not local,

1787
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,600
even like a regional commercial that was like it was just like I went.

1788
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,400
I go to commercial auditions to like.

1789
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,640
Yeah, I probably my days off like the guy who played Bozo.

1790
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,640
When I was a kid, I played Bozo like I found his website and I found his reel.

1791
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,880
And I'm like, he's trying to get like a commercial job now. Whoa.

1792
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,800
Bozo is trying to do the same jobs I am.

1793
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,000
We're going out for the same roles.

1794
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,600
He doesn't. He does.

1795
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,320
But just like so they'll pop up and things, but just not with a lot of range.

1796
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,080
So it's just like, if you don't buy recliner from us,

1797
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,640
for then I'll turn your kids into vomit stew.

1798
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,640
You kids at home, you tell mom and dad.

1799
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,280
Yeah, you don't buy recliner.

1800
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,600
You're going to end up in a stew pot.

1801
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:44,080
He's like threatening flow, threatening flow in the progressive people

1802
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,800
with stew, child stew.

1803
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,880
Yeah, I'm like, like his wolf man, like his wolf man.

1804
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:55,080
I mean, it like, you know, like has wolf man ever been

1805
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:00,160
like, you know, seen or portrayed in any kind of like pop culture?

1806
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,720
Anything?

1807
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:03,880
Had us a reference.

1808
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,920
Yeah. Has anyone like done any depiction of their childhood

1809
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,960
where there would have to be a wolf man equivalent?

1810
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,920
Or even just a mention of it or just like, you know, like, you know, whatever.

1811
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,680
In a Stephen King thing where it's like

1812
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,800
we went down to Clark's Trading Post where the wolf man was hanging out.

1813
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,280
I mean, that's Stephen King would write it a lot better than I just did. But

1814
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:28,880
this is like the one that I would have guessed Stephen King would have been

1815
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,240
influenced by. Right.

1816
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,920
No, it's the charming little carnival atmosphere of canopy.

1817
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,240
Well, if if there was like a

1818
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:45,080
like imagine a horror situation at this place with not only wolf man

1819
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,360
and the jaw car, but also a bunch of bears who are probably mad

1820
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,760
that they've had to bounce around on balls and play bear skip ball for so long.

1821
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,400
I mean, this this place at night is I don't know if you're stuck there

1822
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,440
or like in an apocalypse or something.

1823
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,080
This is an awful place to be.

1824
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,800
Oof. Yeah. There's a lot of darkness here for sure.

1825
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:10,080
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's you know, it's like local level, you know,

1826
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,600
attraction where it's just like, yep, this is the best we can do in this area

1827
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,480
that just is mostly like dirt and trees.

1828
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,880
Do we have trees?

1829
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,760
We could build a train that takes you through the trees, and that's not nothing.

1830
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:30,640
I have a more like wholesome local attraction story, too.

1831
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,680
Yes. Yes. If you want something a little lighter,

1832
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,680
if you want something a little more scarifying.

1833
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,040
Let's go out on some lightness. Yes. Sure.

1834
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,800
So this is at Storyland, which is another park we mentioned earlier.

1835
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,000
I say it's run by the company that runs Kennywood Park.

1836
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,400
And I found a video online.

1837
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:55,120
And from 1983 to 1998, they had a dark ride called Voyage to the Moon.

1838
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,520
And it really seems like a

1839
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,320
sort of homemade sort of dark ride

1840
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,720
that has a certain type of magic to it.

1841
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,120
And you can find this video on YouTube.

1842
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,200
Someone made like a a video essay about it.

1843
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,560
Voyage to the Moon, complete ultimate tribute.

1844
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,040
This is in the style of Mookie.

1845
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,000
There's a guy named Martin's Vids who makes

1846
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,520
video essays about how certain rides were made.

1847
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,120
And someone made it for this little Voyage to the Moon ride.

1848
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,680
And every I'm encouraging everyone to go and watch this video

1849
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,560
because it takes some twists and turns.

1850
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,000
The guy gets some stuff from the park as like gifts.

1851
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,280
And but a brief description of some of the ride.

1852
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:46,120
So it's sort of like that old, old silent movie,

1853
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,000
the Voyage to the Moon, where you're like

1854
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,560
or a trip to the moon, where where a bullet is shot at the moon.

1855
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:59,040
In this case, your car overshoots the moon and enters into a black hole.

1856
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,600
And it's it says, after emerging on the other side of the black hole,

1857
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,720
guests would then encounter a wizard who would appear out of the darkness.

1858
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,520
The wizard in the black hole.

1859
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,960
In the black hole, there's there's a lot more.

1860
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,800
The wizard would then explain to guests that he was able to make dreams come true

1861
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,320
and suggested that they come along with him to see what was possible.

1862
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,600
Oh, boy. Are you still with me?

1863
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,440
OK, then the golden bullet would enter another scene

1864
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,800
occupied by strange creatures called Worrywartles.

1865
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,840
When you're in the golden bullet, you're not like you're in the wizard

1866
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,360
and fire a gun.

1867
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,840
No, no. Worrywart, but you do meet Worrywartles.

1868
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,640
Guests would then encounter another strange creature named Chugga Chugga Puff Puff.

1869
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,840
So I don't know.

1870
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,240
I think that sounds awesome.

1871
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,920
Delighted by all this.

1872
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,640
I was delighted by all this, and especially once you see there is footage

1873
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:01,480
in this essay, this video essay of the ride.

1874
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,880
And then unfortunately, it does end with the note that the ride closed

1875
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,520
the walls underneath the dome were removed and Professor

1876
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,680
Bigelstepp's loopy lab opened for the 1999 season.

1877
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,320
Professor Bigelstepp's loopy lab, of course, evicting

1878
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,520
the voyage to the moon ride.

1879
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,720
Was the character Chugga Chugga Puff Puff?

1880
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,520
Is that what you said? Chugga Chugga Puff Puff.

1881
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,960
Puff Puff. OK, so it's a weed like character.

1882
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,960
It's a weed based.

1883
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,200
Yeah, man. Kind of.

1884
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,200
They are drinking and chugging like.

1885
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,520
Yeah, it's a real partier.

1886
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,920
So, yeah, I like the sound of all these characters for sure,

1887
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,840
including that professor that replaced the whole thing.

1888
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,880
Yeah. But what I really want to see is the Wolfman just going wild

1889
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,680
with that jaw car and laying waste to the whole thing.

1890
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,440
And all the.

1891
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,400
Well, that's what he tries to do every time.

1892
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,760
And then, you know,

1893
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,680
he's brave kids stop it every time.

1894
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,240
Yeah, he's afraid.

1895
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,360
He's really. Trust me, he is trying.

1896
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,760
He is trying to destroy that place.

1897
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,920
Yes, then get out of there and destroy every he wants to destroy story land.

1898
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,200
I know. Or canopy.

1899
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,160
This guy would lay waste to all of New Hampshire if he got out.

1900
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:21,040
If he ever got out, please, people, this if this message can reach far and wide.

1901
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,280
You need to scream, scram, you old goat.

1902
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,760
There's only one thing that stops him.

1903
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,440
And if this podcast, if something happens in this podcast is the only clue.

1904
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,800
If there's a Jurassic Park level disaster at Clark's Trading Post,

1905
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,560
where the Wolfman gets out somehow.

1906
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,280
But what if the Wolfman is a misunderstood protector?

1907
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,280
What if if the Wolfman goes away?

1908
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:47,160
What if New Hampshire is just overrun by worry wardles and humbugs?

1909
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,160
You know, maybe.

1910
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,920
And absolutely. Keeping it in stasis.

1911
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,800
Yeah, it's the only thing keeping it in stasis.

1912
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,680
You know. Yeah, well, we won't know.

1913
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,240
We won't know until it happens.

1914
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,520
I hope to God that that does not happen.

1915
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,360
Yeah, let's all pray real quick.

1916
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,840
Yeah, let's all pray.

1917
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,000
The people of New Hampshire. Yeah.

1918
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,560
Yeah. For the sake of New Hampshire, there's a there's a worry wardles

1919
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,520
and humbugs are not escaped.

1920
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,080
And we don't have to turn to Wolfman and form an unholy alliance. Amen.

1921
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,160
Yeah. Amen. Well, Wolfman.

1922
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,000
Santa.

1923
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,960
Oh, that was the other the Santa's village.

1924
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,160
The other thing I had

1925
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,960
just right at the end, Mick Foley,

1926
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:35,040
a wrestling icon, AKA, Cat, Jack, AKA, Dude Love, AKA Mankind,

1927
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,800
said of Santa's Village, every good thing in my life somehow leads me back

1928
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,840
to Jefferson, New Hampshire and the trip to Santa's Village.

1929
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,680
My parents took me on when I was only three years old.

1930
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,280
Wow. He's a Mick Foley is a big he is such a Santa.

1931
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,880
He's like a Santa head.

1932
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:55,960
He has a Christmas room and he like dresses as Santa.

1933
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,840
He's very he looks he looks like Santa.

1934
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,480
He's like jolly. He's very seemingly nice guy.

1935
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,120
What a sweetheart.

1936
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,040
And yeah, he loves Santa's Village.

1937
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,760
And I think I've said this on the show.

1938
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,040
He's a big theme park guy because when he jumped off the top rope

1939
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,320
to the outside to try to land on the rock on an announce table and missed

1940
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,400
and cracked his rib right on the side of a table in Anaheim, he thought,

1941
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,360
oh, man, am I going to be able to make it to Disney tomorrow?

1942
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,520
It's the first thought he had during the match.

1943
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,480
Geez. Yeah.

1944
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,480
Well, so well, that's beautiful.

1945
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,760
Everything good in his life came from and I think a lot of good came

1946
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,040
from talking about all these places, a lot of great IP,

1947
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,320
a lot of great breakthroughs about your life and family stuff.

1948
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,400
Yeah, I hope it was helpful to you, Mookie.

1949
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,240
You survived podcast, the ride.

1950
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,320
We all went through some stuff and we survived podcast, the ride.

1951
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,520
Mookie, thank you so much for being here.

1952
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
Thanks for having me, guys.

1953
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,560
Of course, for sure.

1954
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,120
That is so much there is like that is an odd amount of bizarre IP

1955
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,680
in one neck of the wood.

1956
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,360
I did not think that's where we're heading.

1957
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,560
I love the wolf man. I love all the humbugs.

1958
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,000
Thanks for bringing it to us.

1959
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,200
But now before all us old goats scram,

1960
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,160
let's exit through the gift shop.

1961
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,200
Mookie, is there anything you'd like to plug?

1962
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,440
Sure. You can check out my podcast.

1963
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,040
You are worthy with Lamouki B.

1964
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,080
And.

1965
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,560
Follow me on social media, on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram at Lamouki B.

1966
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,040
L.A. L.A. OK, I.E.B.

1967
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,880
And other than that, no irons and no fires, man.

1968
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,560
But you have an iron in the fire of of inspiring people

1969
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,200
and of making people of of getting people in touch

1970
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,880
with their best selves and getting people away from chasing clout.

1971
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,720
And if you I don't know if anyone's ever

1972
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,440
plugged a TikTok account really on the show.

1973
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,840
And if you do one thing, I think follow the TikTok.

1974
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:58,160
And if you want to be inspired on a regular basis, then follow them.

1975
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:02,680
Yes. With the disclaimer of it's it is parody.

1976
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,320
What? Oh, man.

1977
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,680
Yeah, I thought it was real.

1978
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,280
I had a lot of breakthroughs.

1979
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,080
I don't want anybody.

1980
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,200
I don't want any any cool people coming there thinking that I'm.

1981
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,200
Some kind of fucking.

1982
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:19,920
Have you not there?

1983
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,160
Didn't I heard taking those people down?

1984
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,840
You know what I mean? Take it down a peg.

1985
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:30,120
Did you not have one that like blew up significantly within TikTok?

1986
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,880
Like there was some statement about dating.

1987
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah, I got a and it was.

1988
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:40,800
It got about like like something like 13000

1989
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,240
likes and a bunch of comments and of a bunch of people who thought

1990
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,360
that I was being a like, sincere like.

1991
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:50,640
I mean, basically for for anybody who doesn't know this,

1992
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,720
it's basically like a parody of like the type of guy who goes on TikTok

1993
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:01,920
and is performatively, you know, like feminist to in order to get laid.

1994
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,480
Sure, sure.

1995
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,120
And so it was a video sort of like that,

1996
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,760
but it was a bunch of people thinking that I was being sincere.

1997
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,640
And I gained 12000 new followers in a week

1998
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:16,280
of all people who think that that is the kind of person that I actually am.

1999
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,200
And so, you know, I mean, I guess that's a success.

2000
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,800
Yeah, audience, you've always been trying to cultivate.

2001
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,120
Yeah, sure.

2002
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,760
And then and then they look at and then they look at some of the other ones

2003
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,320
and they're like, is this what I was?

2004
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,520
Is this what I followed?

2005
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,840
And like, yeah, it is.

2006
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,280
I'm just being made for the numbers, man.

2007
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,080
I just want to get my numbers up.

2008
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,160
You're all just little stats to me.

2009
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:52,240
You played right into my trap, fell right into my car jaws.

2010
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,120
All you fucking verified.

2011
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,920
I don't even look at the names.

2012
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,920
Just put them on the pile.

2013
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,440

2029
