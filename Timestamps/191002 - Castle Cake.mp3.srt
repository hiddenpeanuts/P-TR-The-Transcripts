1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,840
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,280
where we're celebrating a historic anniversary,

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
a historic event that celebrated a historic anniversary.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,880
The anniversary of an anniversary.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,200
Of an anniversary.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
October 1st, 1971, the opening of Walt Disney World

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,960
and then October 1st, 1996, the unveiling of the Castle Cake.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,360
Yes, perhaps more important than the original opening.

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,240
Perhaps.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,160
Of the park itself.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
Perhaps more important.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,240
Or if you will, I've been thinking about this,

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,720
do some people call it the Cake Castle?

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,280
I wasn't sure what to call the episode even.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,880
I assume you'll be listening to it

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,800
and there will be a title,

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
but maybe we should talk about it now.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,520
Yeah, is it Cinderella Castle Cake?

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,040
Is it the Cake Castle?

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Is it the what's the, the Castle Cake?

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I think we all very quickly started using the term Castle Cake.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,800
All right, so we'll stick with that.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
So we'll stick with that

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,800
and I'm gonna go ahead. And Cinderella

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
just clunks it up too, so.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Yeah. Okay.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
If I Google, by the way, my name's Mike Carlson,

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,680
Jason shared an intro, that's Scott Gartner over there.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,520
Oh yeah.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,120
If I Google Castle Cake,

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,080
it doesn't come up in the first batch of Google search images.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,480
You do Disney Castle Cake?

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,160
Well, I'm sure if I did that.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm just wondering what like the internet wants to call it.

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,800
If I look up Disney Castle Cake, oh, it doesn't,

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
well, hold on, let me go image search.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,440
Well, the trouble is, you end up with a lot of like

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,560
wedding cakes. Yes, that is the problem.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,800
That are shaped like the castle.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,520
And that's not what it is what we're talking about.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Someone did, I forget, it's a Twitter account

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
of someone who works in theme park design,

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
I think had their like turn 25 and their birthday cake

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,720
was a replica Cake Castle.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,440
Nice. And it looked great.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
You even look up Cinderella Castle Cake

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,920
and it's like the 12th image result.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah, this is right on the edge where I feel like

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
when I would read stuff about it online,

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
people would say, well, here was what the chatter

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,080
was going on about the Castle Cake in Usenet groups.

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,760
Like this is right before like,

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,120
I feel like AOL was just starting to break big.

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,560
I remember around then getting an AOL floppy disk,

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,560
like pre CD, like we got a mailing with an AOL floppy disk.

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
And I gotta say, I think I forgot to introduce our names

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,120
because I'm jacked up for this episode

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,880
because I love the Castle Cake.

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,560
Haters back off.

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,160
Scott Hader or I forget.

62
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,000
I have to admit Scott Hader.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,680
And if I could, you know, look,

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,160
you guys have already melted my icy heart a little bit.

65
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
You've already melted my internal frosting

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
about the Castle Cake.

67
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
I am a little more fond of it now,

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,440
but just to back it up, I just on the way here

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,240
called my mom and she asked what I was doing today.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,560
And I said, I'm about to do a podcast

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
about when Cinderella Castle was a cake for a little while.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,920
And my mom was like, oh yeah, ugh.

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,440
So this opinion is out there.

74
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,280
A lot of people have this opinion.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
That's the majority.

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,840
I think it's a common opinion,

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,200
which is I truly no troll, hashtag no troll.

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,240
I don't understand it.

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I don't like, yeah, yeah, I love it too.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
I love it.

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,600
We went that year.

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
We went that year.

83
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
I was like, this is awesome.

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Yeah, I was like, I did the same thing.

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,160
I texted my dad like, hey, we're gonna do a Castle Cake

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,760
episode, the family, we all liked the Castle Cake, right?

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,600
And he's like, yeah, absolutely.

88
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
This is weird.

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,120
It divides, it goes along family lines with us.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,560
I think it's like, let me text my mom and my sister

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,880
and see if they have an opinion and they can respond back.

92
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,720
Yes, please do.

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,000
I thought it was awesome.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Wow.

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,880
And maybe I had just been to Disney World enough.

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,240
I was like, something else new.

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
I mean, this is around,

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,000
this is like the gold and the go-go 90s,

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
new stuff coming left and right.

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,200
I mean, this is kind of the tail end of it.

101
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
But when you only go every few years,

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
the new thing from a year and a half ago,

103
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,560
you're like, oh, cool, something new.

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
It's really bold.

105
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
You gotta give it that.

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,560
And just so, just to be totally clear,

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,400
what we're talking about is that for the 25th anniversary

108
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,160
of Walt Disney World, for a period of 18 months,

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,680
Cinderella Castle was transformed into a big cake,

110
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,800
a big pink cake.

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
A big pink cake.

112
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Yeah, painted multiple shades.

113
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,240
I think I read three different shades of pink.

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,440
And then there's a lot of like 16,

115
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,240
five foot high candy bears, 12, five foot high gumdrops,

116
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,320
four, six foot high life savers.

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
We're reading off the same thing.

118
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,560
And I like that whatever we're reading,

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,720
we're both reading has, it calls them candy bears,

120
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,280
not gummy bears.

121
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
Candy bears.

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,640
No, inflatable icing.

123
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
That was the thing I learned.

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
It didn't dawn on me at the time that like,

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,080
oh, that icing is inflatable,

126
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,440
which makes practical sense.

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
Very impressive.

128
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,720
Okay, so those are, that was my question

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
because I didn't, so those are life savers on the cake.

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Yeah.

131
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
That's the idea.

132
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
That's one of my qualms.

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
Life savers?

134
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
What are you talking about?

135
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,520
We should talk about this as a practical cake.

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, if you were to eat the cake.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
Yeah, we should address this from a standpoint of like,

138
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
the different things on the cake.

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,840
And if it makes sense or if that's good or not.

140
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,480
Well, are we addressing, but then we have to break down.

141
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,560
Is that a practical cake that you would take to a party

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,800
or is like a more elaborate wedding cake or like ace of cakes?

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,320
I mean, ace of cakes and-

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,280
This has to be transported by a baker of some kind.

145
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
The cake boss.

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,240
Like there's no way that like, I'm bringing this over.

147
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,000
We live in a post ace of cakes, cake boss,

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,320
duff world where cakes are insane and largely fondant,

149
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,680
which is purely deck, which tastes like shit.

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,520
Don't wanna eat it.

151
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I have the first family weigh in from my sister.

152
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
I sent a picture and I said,

153
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,480
did you like this Cinderella castle

154
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
when they turned it into a cake?

155
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,640
And my sister just wrote, of course.

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,000
Wow.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,120
The families line up.

158
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,240
Kicked, I thought it kicked ass.

159
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
I agree.

160
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm sorry, everyone got mad.

161
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,160
You didn't get to see the castle that's 80% gray.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,640
I'm sorry, there's beautiful technicolor magic

163
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,600
at the end of Main Street.

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
I wouldn't mind if every couple of years

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,760
they switched it back to this.

166
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I want it back.

167
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,240
I want it back for 50th.

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,880
I want it back bad.

169
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,680
Because, or back for-

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't think it's gonna happen that way, but-

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,640
This isn't the first, this wasn't the last time.

172
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
Like when the Stitch's Great Escape opened,

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
the castle was covered in toilet paper

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
and like spray painted Stitch was here.

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,880
It said Stitch is king.

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,080
Stitch is king, that sucks.

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,040
That was, I don't think anyone likes that.

178
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
And it was only for a day.

179
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
It was just to announce the arrival

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
of what is now considered Disney World's worst attraction,

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Stitch's Great Escape.

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,280
But for the 50th anniversary of Disneyland,

183
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
not even Disney World, in 2005,

184
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,320
they added all this gold trim

185
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,400
and like a video screen that would show all the castles

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
around the world. The magic mirror

187
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,520
that cycles through all the different castles

188
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
around the world.

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,760
I gotta say, fuck out of here with this.

190
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
This looks like shit.

191
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,520
This looks like Trump Tower, gaudy ass gold.

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
Like, I hate this.

193
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,400
This looks worse to me than Castle Cake.

194
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,320
Sure. Castle Cake has a-

195
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,840
Castle Cake's like the best castle.

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
I might be with you.

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
I might be- Oh man.

198
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,320
I might be with you on that.

199
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, I'm getting shot down.

200
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
I wish we had even sides.

201
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,520
It's two against one.

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,680
Yeah, we should have had a guest.

203
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,520
You could have found someone who doesn't like the Castle Cake.

204
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,920
This is full of fucking world that we know

205
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,840
who would have opinions about this.

206
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
This is East Coast, West Coast right here.

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,440
Or this is, I mean- It might be.

208
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,800
In terms of the Mississippi River, I guess.

209
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Or is it Chicago, West of the Mississippi, or East?

210
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Yeah, it's, I should know.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
I think it's West.

212
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,480
Fuck.

213
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,040
The dividing, like Disney World, Disneyland,

214
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
in terms of East and West, I mean.

215
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
I also, you know what I have to confess?

216
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
I didn't see it in person.

217
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
So that might color it.

218
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,160
It's East, I'm an idiot, it's East.

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
That would be Mississippi River.

220
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
Yeah, so as a dividing-

221
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,320
Or Chicago is East of the Mississippi River.

222
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,720
I think it's safe to say you were a Disneyland family

223
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,520
and we were Disney World families.

224
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,560
And Disneyland might have been on Mars,

225
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,880
like as we've established.

226
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
So you're more, you're just like,

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,560
you're going there more often, so any change is exciting.

228
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
And this is a pretty sizable change.

229
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,280
And we're not going that often.

230
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,480
We're going every three or four years.

231
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,640
So we had just timed the trip to be at the anniversary.

232
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,080
So it was just like, holy shit, cake.

233
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
Like we were- Look at this.

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
As kids, we were very obsessed with sweets

235
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,280
and the looks of like crazy cakes and desserts and colors.

236
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,680
Just remove as kids.

237
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Well, that's fair.

238
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,440
Currently, I'm obsessed with sweets.

239
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,760
That's fair.

240
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Colors, as we know.

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
So, yeah, yeah, it wasn't even like-

242
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,520
Mr. Colors.

243
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,240
Did I, we'll reveal more of these details down the line.

244
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,520
Did I eat it too much last night and get a stomach ache?

245
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes, I did.

246
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,080
Was part of that sweets.

247
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
I wasn't feeling great either.

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes, it was.

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,960
The little Downtown Disney ordeal preview.

250
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
Little Downtown Disney ordeal.

251
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,400
Was it all delicious?

252
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Yes, it was.

253
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,120
Absolutely.

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,520
No regrets really, at the end of the day.

255
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,240
You know where I think I'm landing is that I'm not

256
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,280
vehemently against the castle cake.

257
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I have found angles to like it and I enjoy your enthusiasm.

258
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
But I think how I feel is a little similar

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,320
to another ongoing back and forth discussion,

260
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,720
pop cultural discussion that we were into last night

261
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,640
a little bit, which is the Star Wars prequels.

262
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,040
It has started to become kind of cooler to say,

263
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,560
I like the prequels.

264
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,280
It's kind of like an anti-opinion.

265
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,480
Like it was so, it felt like the people who didn't like it,

266
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,240
it was so much more deafening at the time.

267
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
And I know all these people who are like,

268
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
you know what, actually the prequels are good.

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
And it's been making me go back and check them out

270
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
and see like, you know, I kind of would like to be

271
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,040
one of those guys who is into the pre,

272
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
and then I just watched Attack of the Clones and like,

273
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,520
I don't like sand.

274
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,920
I hate them.

275
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
And I'm like, I can't do it.

276
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
I can't fucking do it.

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,200
I can't lie about how I feel inside.

278
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,160
I don't like this movie and I don't like this castle cake.

279
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Right, well I would say there's a difference.

280
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,720
I would think there's no time.

281
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,400
Like the prequels is a different,

282
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,480
my sister just texted, how could you not like that?

283
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,160
Oh man, God.

284
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
I love these live updates.

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,160
You don't even have, as you said,

286
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,160
you don't have, you're not vehemently like, fuck off.

287
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm not, I think it's just like a taste of,

288
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,720
and now I should answer your sister's question.

289
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
I should attempt to justify it.

290
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
And I probably don't have the strongest justification.

291
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,840
I think I just like, I think I just thought it looked dumb.

292
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,960
I think I thought it looked like,

293
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,960
despite clearly not being cheap, I think it looked cheap.

294
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,720
It looks like a huge miniature golf obstacle to me.

295
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,840
I think it looks like fiberglass silly.

296
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.

297
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,800
And I think there's like a stateliness

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
to the castles especially.

299
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,240
You know what, if you, if like separately

300
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,920
in another Disney park, there was a big castle cake,

301
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
I'd probably go, yeah.

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,440
But something about it replacing what is a classier,

303
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,160
more ornate affair, I think just bothered me.

304
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,400
And I was also trying to analyze like,

305
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,440
well, hey, but what is it?

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
There's gotta be some greater reason.

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
And I think it's this, and I'm curious your thoughts.

308
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
I think it's the pink.

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
I don't like the pink.

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,760
And I saw a lot of haters of it describing it as Pepto pink

311
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,320
because I think a lot of cast members started to not like it

312
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,720
and they encountered a lot of guests who were disappointed

313
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,920
they weren't seeing the regular castle.

314
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,480
And I think in that Pepto pink comment,

315
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I think that conveys a lot to me

316
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,840
because Pepto is a gross kind of pink.

317
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
I think if it had been a more subtle pink

318
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,760
or perhaps even a white,

319
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,880
because who's eating a big pink cake?

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
I would love to eat a big pink cake.

321
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,000
That's the problem here is that I see,

322
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,160
is there an anti-pink in general bias?

323
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,440
Is there some sort of sexism going on here?

324
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
Because that pink is a very,

325
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,880
no, no.

326
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,920
I'm not saying you're being sexist.

327
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm saying though people with the anti-pink,

328
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,640
I feel like pink actually might be the most divisive color

329
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,040
because it's so tied to maybe identity.

330
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,920
Feminine, there is a trivialization in popular culture

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,280
of like feminine interests, movies aimed at women.

332
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
That's where we are now.

333
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Look, I didn't expect to be here either, but here we are.

334
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,720
But, and then I think you get into a semiotic argument

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,720
of the idea of cake.

336
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,360
How do you simply communicate the idea of cake?

337
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,920
There's a couple ways to do it.

338
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,960
White frosting, brown frosting for chocolate,

339
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,360
pure white would look like you get dirty immediately.

340
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
Brown would be hated by everyone.

341
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,840
But pink, like Looney Tunes, Mickey Mouse,

342
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,640
pink denotes cakes in those cartoons.

343
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,400
You know, there's a poet once wrote,

344
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,840
pink, it's my new obsession.

345
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Pink, it's not even a question.

346
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,480
Yes, of course.

347
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Pink, it's the color of passion.

348
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,880
Cause today it just goes with the fashion.

349
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,720
Yes, of course.

350
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
I think we have to consider that

351
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,320
with any semiotic argument.

352
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,920
It's a song that's still played in Disney World.

353
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,760
True.

354
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,320
It's outside of a ride in Disney World.

355
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
Do you know what we're talking about?

356
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,000
What song is, I can't.

357
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Aerosmiths.

358
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,040
It's Aerosmiths Pink.

359
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
You see.

360
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,400
A song I wasn't listening to just a couple days ago.

361
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,160
As a noted fan of pink.

362
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,640
It's about a dirtier topic, Jason.

363
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,080
Obviously you know that.

364
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
But that's.

365
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
I know what it's about.

366
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
Yeah, really the cake should make me horny

367
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
cause pink is the color of passion.

368
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,400
Right.

369
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,840
I can't say I was horny for it.

370
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Okay, you know, I think that cleanliness argument is good.

371
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
And the white just might kind of look like nothing.

372
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Yeah.

373
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't know.

374
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
I think it could be a shade issue.

375
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,160
I am no opponent of pink in any way.

376
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,600
I wear a lot of pink clothing.

377
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,720
This is not the problem.

378
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,880
I think the shade.

379
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
When I said.

380
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I have a problem with the shade.

381
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,520
I think it is a gaudy pink.

382
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,960
I wasn't accusing you of being an anti-pink person.

383
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,800
Sure.

384
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
I was just saying, I wonder in general.

385
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Let me defend anybody who might have felt

386
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,840
victimized by that.

387
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,520
I would get made fun of.

388
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,160
I would get made fun of for in elementary school

389
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,080
saying my favorite color was purple.

390
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Because people would say, oh purple is a girl's color.

391
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,600
So pink for sure was a girl's color.

392
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
So I do wonder.

393
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm wondering if pink has a connotation.

394
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
I wonder now.

395
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,320
Because I feel like because of Brett the Hitman Heart

396
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
and other famous pink wearers.

397
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
If that's sort of now.

398
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,120
The history is that pink was gender defined

399
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,040
and then Brett the Hitman Heart changed it permanently.

400
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
That was his color.

401
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,880
I mean that was his.

402
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,720
That was black.

403
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Pink and black.

404
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,380
Pink and black.

405
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,220
Very cool look.

406
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,040
He looks cool.

407
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
Gender warrior, Brett the Hitman Heart.

408
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,440
I think you don't even point to a lot of things

409
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,600
that he helped to fix.

410
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
To tie it.

411
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,640
Steven Tyler.

412
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
To tie it back to the prequel talk.

413
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,160
I think one of the things you can say

414
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,920
about both of them.

415
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Is that there is a clear vision.

416
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,480
There is a singular vision of the prequels.

417
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Whether you like them or not.

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,600
There is a singular vision of the castle cake.

419
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,620
And it is presented boldly and confidently.

420
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,560
Bold and silly and visual.

421
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,120
And silly and visual.

422
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,960
I mean it does look like a cake that if there was a cartoon

423
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,740
where Mickey is a baker.

424
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,960
Like this might be a cake in the background.

425
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,720
Or one he makes and then big Pete.

426
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,120
Plops down on it or something.

427
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,840
You might say that the castle that you just showed

428
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,620
with the magic mirror and just the gold trim.

429
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,660
That that's more the equivalent of the new trilogy.

430
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,940
Where it's like slightly dressing up

431
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,280
what was there already.

432
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
That's fair.

433
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,280
But the prequels equaling the castle cake.

434
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,160
It's like well it's crazier and it might lose some of you.

435
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,420
It's got some new stuff.

436
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,160
You might not like it but it's certainly different.

437
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
I gotta say.

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,820
And the boldness of it.

439
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,940
I like that it being super bold

440
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,500
is something I can respect about it more now.

441
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,900
I can studiously appreciate today the castle cake.

442
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,220
And I'm glad we're talking about it.

443
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,080
But at my core and apparently my mom's core.

444
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,180
We just don't like it.

445
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,220
I can also respectively say I understand

446
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,700
why people don't like it.

447
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,140
And I understand why people were upset.

448
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,700
And I can see that.

449
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,700
But from my, my thing was I wasn't super heart broke.

450
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,980
Cause I knew the castle would be back.

451
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,500
And I also like we, I loved Main Street.

452
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,700
I loved all the vehicles.

453
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,400
I loved the vibe.

454
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,380
But we weren't a Cinderella's Royal Table family.

455
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,340
We didn't, I've never been up there.

456
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,180
I've never even.

457
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,700
Are you trying to talk about how you were working class?

458
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,540
Is that what you're?

459
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,380
No, no.

460
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,200
Just that like.

461
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
We never went.

462
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,340
We didn't get invited to the Royal Table.

463
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
No I just didn't care.

464
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,700
We weren't a Crystal Pallets.

465
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,540
The reputation of my family was that I love,

466
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,320
I liked the, the vibe of Main Street.

467
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,340
But Main Street had the worst restaurants.

468
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,500
Kind of true to this day I feel.

469
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,340
You liked it.

470
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,760
No longer the monarchy reigned for those 18 months.

471
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Cake reigned.

472
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,860
Well everyone loves cake.

473
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,340
I mean that's true.

474
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,900
The social confines.

475
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,020
Yeah the cake was a democratization of Disney World.

476
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,100
Of the Magic Kingdom.

477
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,180
You know no longer did you see this oppressive castle

478
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,380
where you were ruled by these hopefully benevolent people

479
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,700
but probably oppressive leaders.

480
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,660
Definitely thought I had it at 11.

481
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,500
Yeah.

482
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,300
How does this tie into a leader famously flippantly saying

483
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,500
let them eat cake?

484
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,820
Hmm good question.

485
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,140
Maybe that's not, that's viewed now as like a fuck off.

486
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,580
Or that's what it was intended as.

487
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,780
But imagine, you know.

488
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,700
Cinderella saying oh let them eat cake.

489
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,020
Yeah actually sounds nice.

490
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,820
And one of the only good qualities you could ascribe

491
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,260
to our current leader Donald Trump

492
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,140
is his affinity for desserts.

493
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,240
Mm hmm good point.

494
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,540
So it is, there's a populism to cake.

495
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,060
Well he also, he will eat the cake that Marie Antoinette,

496
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,820
historically I believe people were like,

497
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,740
she was referring to cake the soot buildup in a fireplace.

498
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,580
That's what cake meant?

499
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,660
That's what like people have interpreted.

500
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah I like, so there's an interpretation of like

501
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,080
let them eat cake, fuck off.

502
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,600
I have got a, my mother has weighed in.

503
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
This is great, these live updates.

504
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
Yeah.

505
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
I didn't ask my dad, he's probably, he'll be upset

506
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,640
he wasn't asked but like he probably doesn't have an opinion.

507
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,120
My mother said so pretty exclamation point

508
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,480
but maybe not forever.

509
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,560
Yeah. Okay.

510
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,400
Fair.

511
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,640
This is a good centrist point.

512
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,760
But still she's, that's a pretty big endorsement

513
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
of the look of it.

514
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,920
This is pretty limited time magic.

515
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,280
Before that was shoved down all our throats.

516
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
That's a good question, I don't think they did.

517
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,920
Oh that is a marketing term that they overuse now.

519
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,440
And like, oh everyone, limited time magic,

520
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,240
the Main Street Electrical Parade is back.

521
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,360
It's like, oh is it six months from when it last left?

522
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
Like they just keep doing this stuff.

523
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,840
Right, right.

524
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
Can I throw this opinion out there?

525
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,920
And I'm not even saying it's my opinion exactly

526
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,720
but if I could get in the heads of the,

527
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
I was not a person who was upset.

528
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,240
I didn't, well I didn't go.

529
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,080
I don't think I would have cared.

530
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
I didn't get to see the castle.

531
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,720
But people did feel that way.

532
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,720
I read the, there were brides who were livid

533
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,000
because they found out they wouldn't have photos

534
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
with the fairy tale castle.

535
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,160
I get that.

536
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,040
Sure you imagine the specific photo op.

537
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,720
That seems to be the verdict that they lost a ton of money

538
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,280
because the wedding pavilion looks,

539
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,760
has a direct view of the castle.

540
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,800
Oh sure, sure, sure.

541
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Well and also, okay so I have recently

542
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,120
encountered this opinion that is not my opinion

543
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,320
and it's a surprising opinion to me

544
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,280
that people do not like the Nightmare Before Christmas

545
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,520
haunted mansion overlay because you're going on Halloween

546
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,280
and you wanna see the real scary haunted mansion.

547
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,200
Is it possible that this was an opinion

548
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
for the 25th anniversary?

549
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,720
You wanna see the real castle and not this,

550
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,520
not this alterna version?

551
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,120
Now that, there's one step of it.

552
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
If I could just do one more, people another complaint,

553
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
a sub opinion of Nightmare Before Christmas is I like it

554
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
but it goes too long.

555
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,040
Right, yes.

556
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,400
I think 18 months was a long time to have a castle cake.

557
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
I think if that had been up for like just the year

558
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,040
or just for seven months, I think the amount of time

559
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,520
like Nightmare Before Christmas is some of the complaint.

560
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Perhaps.

561
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah I wonder, I think, I would think

562
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,880
that could be part of it.

563
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,480
I think the majority is probably just didn't like,

564
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
my mom, okay my mom, sorry to distract,

565
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,840
my mom has added another interesting thing

566
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,760
that I think is maybe part of why I like it.

567
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,960
She said, you know, maybe not forever

568
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
but she said unless they did a second one elsewhere

569
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,680
in the park which means she would like this somewhere else

570
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,320
but then she just wrote Candyland exclamation point.

571
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
And that is a very good point.

572
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,080
And it's a very good point because I loved Candyland.

573
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,920
I loved Candyland too.

574
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
I was obsessed with it and really looks like something

575
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
straight out of Candyland.

576
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,440
If there were some physical Candyland place

577
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,560
that you could hang out and like go,

578
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,240
who are the scary guys like the molasses guys or whatever?

579
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,080
I almost wanna hang out there the most.

580
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Well this is funny because we were talking,

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
I feel like we have an inside joke

582
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,280
about one of the Candyland characters with you.

583
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,120
What?

584
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,600
With the fudge monster I think.

585
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,080
That I am him?

586
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,480
I think that maybe you're just friends with him.

587
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,840
When there's an inevitable Candyland film,

588
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,920
I think the goal needs to be to popularize Jason

589
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,120
via this podcast to like get you like a scene stealing part

590
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,920
on a show because of this podcast

591
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,040
and then that gives you the one up to be in the,

592
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,120
be a voice or a mocap guy in the Candyland film.

593
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,960
I would love that.

594
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,200
Plumpy, I think it was plumpy.

595
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
He's like a plump.

596
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,120
Plumpy plum?

597
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,280
He's not plumb though.

598
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,240
He's like, he's hold on, let me find out where plumpy.

599
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
So I remember now it's because it's between you, me

600
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,400
and Marissa Strickland, past guest

601
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,680
and we would call Marissa Strickland grandma nut.

602
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,840
Grandma nut, yeah.

603
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,760
And then I think we called it,

604
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,600
we were talking about you and plumpy.

605
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Yeah, it's all 100% possible.

606
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,520
Oh yeah, I see it.

607
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
He's a little like green.

608
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,720
The purple man?

609
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,600
He's a gingerbread plump, he's cute.

610
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,320
He's not the fudge monster.

611
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,160
No.

612
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,880
He's a green guy with like,

613
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,080
he looks kind of like a friendly grouch.

614
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,920
Yeah.

615
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
And he's got a big medallion around his neck

616
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,000
that looks like a plum and he's eating a plum.

617
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,840
I've seen a lot of different pictures.

618
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,640
I love, this is a similar thing to

619
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,960
when I was watching Alice in Wonderland

620
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,720
and I was like, oh, I love Alice in Wonderland.

621
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm looking at Candyland and I'm like, I love Candyland.

622
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,160
I love Candyland.

623
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,000
I think I'm with you.

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
I would love to star in the Candyland movie

625
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
and then fix the script like Ed Norton would

626
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,800
every night on the Incredible Hulk movie

627
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
and I would go home and like, I'm fixing a piece of trash.

628
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Marissa would be an excellent grandma nut.

629
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm scanning through photos.

630
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,040
You'd be a great plumpy,

631
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,040
but I'd also like to not deny you the opportunity to be,

632
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,680
wait, I lost him, King Candy.

633
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,800
I think you'd be a great King Candy as well.

634
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
And Gloppy is the monster.

635
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,520
Gloppy?

636
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,840
Is the fudge monster.

637
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,040
I think you'd be a great Jolly.

638
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,240
You could be, you like, this could be your,

639
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
the Jim Carrey Christmas Carol.

640
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
Oh, this is good.

641
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,280
You play three of the parts.

642
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,120
Mike, I think as a taller fellow

643
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,080
who could play a more gangly character,

644
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,200
I think you could be a great Lord Licorice

645
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,720
or who's Mr. Mint.

646
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,280
Mr. Mint is super pink and peppermint,

647
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,480
so you might prefer to play Mr. Mint.

648
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,160
And he gets to, he's, what I'm looking at,

649
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,840
he's carrying a big peppermint ax,

650
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
which is pretty rad.

651
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
That's cool, yeah.

652
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
I mean, I'd take that too,

653
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,360
if you wanted to give in to your evil side

654
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,800
and be Lord Licorice.

655
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,440
I don't know if that leaves me to be Gloppy.

656
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,080
I don't feel a strong personal connection

657
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,560
to any of the characters.

658
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,800
My mom and sister want me to ask my,

659
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,080
my sister wants me to ask my dad now.

660
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,680
I hadn't asked him, but I'm now asking my father.

661
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
Throw it out.

662
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,360
Yes.

663
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,640
Dear dad, I know we haven't talked in seven years, but.

664
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
You're his father.

665
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,480
While we're waiting on a response, so.

666
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,840
My sister, my sister thing has a theory,

667
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,920
and this is a relation to the hosts of the show.

668
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,320
My sister thinks that Scott doesn't like treats

669
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
like the Carlson's and Sheridan's do.

670
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,880
This is absolutely correct.

671
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,760
This is absolutely correct.

672
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,320
And it goes with my alcohol taste.

673
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't understand what you drink.

674
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,840
I don't understand these multicolor,

675
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,360
the five colors in the beverage.

676
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,640
Right.

677
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,320
I think that that aligns with it.

678
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,760
I think it's just not, I liked dessert and I ate dessert,

679
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,480
but I don't think I was like,

680
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,280
I don't think I hung on to the affinity.

681
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
And I don't eat a lot of dessert now.

682
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,720
And I ended up getting desserts for Christmas and Easter.

683
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,840
And then they just like pile up and Erin,

684
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,120
my wife has to come like nerve sheepishly say like,

685
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,360
can I have your candy, please?

686
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,400
Like I don't go through my candy at home enough.

687
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,360
I try not to keep desserts candy in the house,

688
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
but if I'm out, I get a little something.

689
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,640
And I do like something that feels fantastical.

690
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
That does feel like it would have been given to me

691
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,320
by Plumpy or Loppy or Mr. Mint, you know?

692
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,400
Maybe not Mr. Mint, I don't like mint as much.

693
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,760
I think I also eat much like saltier bullshit.

694
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,800
Like where I indulge is alcohol

695
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,960
and it's like fries and tortilla chips.

696
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,840
And I know my like bad health is gonna go to that.

697
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,480
So I cut off dessert a little more

698
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,600
just to make room for the other.

699
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,840
Prince, I wish that I would have married Princess Lolly

700
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,680
as a child.

701
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,760
I'd be a different guy.

702
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,200
I'd be Freddy fries.

703
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Well, you would be in what's the candy.

704
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,760
Yeah, I guess it's more McDonald land.

705
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,720
Oh yeah, it'd be a fry gun.

706
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,200
Yeah.

707
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,640
I go crazy if I don't have sweets in the house.

708
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm sorry to say, I don't have much of a taste for salt.

709
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,680
And I feel like my grandfather at some point

710
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,320
had to cut salt out of his diet,

711
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,040
which then my mother before she lived on her own

712
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,400
was still living at home.

713
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
She was the youngest.

714
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,120
And so she kind of like,

715
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,880
I don't know if they ever were a big salt family either.

716
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,240
And my father was never big on salt.

717
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,360
So we were not a salt household.

718
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,760
So I hit something recently with sea salt.

719
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,400
Oh, that's what it was.

720
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,320
I'm not a big, I like sweet salt a little,

721
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
but I had like these caramel cookies

722
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
that had sea salt on top.

723
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,320
And I'm like, I fucking hate this.

724
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,040
Like, can I take these back?

725
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,640
This is fucking, this is a disaster.

726
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
You wouldn't do that.

727
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,920
Sea salt on dessert doesn't square with you.

728
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,960
No, I'm okay with sea salt caramel when it's real.

729
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
Like when it's real caramel,

730
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,920
but when it's like, you can tell the fakeness of it.

731
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,240
It's like, ah, this sucks.

732
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,080
I hate this.

733
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,240
But like, I at least need,

734
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
I try not to have cookies, chocolate,

735
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
and ice cream in the house,

736
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,800
but I feel good when I do with three.

737
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,720
And I don't really, I don't drink a lot anymore.

738
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,320
I really don't drink a lot anymore.

739
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,360
So I don't, I mean, that's my vice.

740
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,760
And I try to drink a lot of water to balance out anything.

741
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,640
I have like white claws in the fridge,

742
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,000
but I don't think I have any, there's no ice cream here.

743
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There's no sugar of any kind.

744
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,920
Any bagged candy in the house currently.

745
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,600
No bagged candy in the house.

746
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,320
I need something either like small cookies

747
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,080
to just graze on like in between meals

748
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
or like chocolate almonds.

749
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,480
How many days have you,

750
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,920
do you think you've gone without that in the house?

751
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,360
A couple.

752
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,200
Two?

753
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,040
Well, but then the problem is,

754
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,520
is that I don't keep it in the house.

755
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,800
Then I spend money at like, you know,

756
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Carl's Jr. milkshakes are really good,

757
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,880
but that's like $4 or like,

758
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,880
I spend it, I waste money on shorter term options.

759
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
I feel like-

760
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
Does that make sense?

761
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm not, I'm goofing around a little bit,

762
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,080
but I do, there's a, there is food and compulsion

763
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
is absolutely obviously a real thing.

764
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,720
I feel like my thing with when I'm feeling compulsive

765
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,760
is I want like a big iced tea.

766
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,960
And then I started drinking a lot more diet soda recently,

767
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,920
which I need to stop-

768
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah, you gotta stop.

769
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,520
Because I think it's creating my stomach up.

770
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,640
But I feel a compulsion,

771
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,920
when I feel like that compulsion,

772
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,000
oftentimes I will drive to McDonald's

773
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,280
and get a dollar large unsweetened iced tea.

774
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,480
Because I just need to be doing something.

775
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,320
No, I know it's totally fine.

776
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm just saying, I'm wrecking that-

777
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
Good price on that too.

778
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,120
I switched over from Starbucks.

779
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,040
I was wasting a lot of Starbucks money.

780
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,880
Yeah, you got it.

781
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
Yeah, that's really easy.

782
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,560
The McDonald's thing also-

783
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,160
I mean, you should cold brew at home.

784
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
You should cold brew pitchers at home.

785
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,080
Yeah, I could do that.

786
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,560
There's a Del Taco also dollar large iced tea as well.

787
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah, that's good.

788
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,640
Or you can get like a 30 ounce, not 30 ounce,

789
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
it's slightly smaller.

790
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
It's a strawberry lemonade, but it's not that caloric.

791
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,320
It's a little smaller though.

792
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,800
But if you need a little some sweet in there.

793
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,640
Sure, sure, sure.

794
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,320
Sometimes I've gotten both

795
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,760
and I put a little inside of the iced tea.

796
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,840
Oh, that's smart.

797
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I don't get sugar from drinks.

798
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,360
I rarely drink like full fat soda.

799
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,640
Really drink, I don't drink sweet stuff a lot

800
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,440
because I had to, I cut soda one summer in high school

801
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,480
and I immediately dropped weight.

802
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah, I like that.

803
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,600
I switched to bottle water,

804
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,480
which I try not to go too hard on nowadays.

805
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,280
I try to use a refillable bottle.

806
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,960
But yeah, once I-

807
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,360
That's the kind of shit that drives me crazy

808
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,720
with alcohol, like margarita mix, get out of here.

809
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,400
I want like a squeeze a line,

810
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,240
like as little shit in there.

811
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,560
Fresh lime, I love.

812
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,520
Yeah, I try not to.

813
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,400
No slush, I want no slush.

814
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,600
No, I, yeah, even like,

815
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm sure some people will think this is heresy,

816
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,840
but like I like bottled beer

817
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,840
because I've had so many bad draft pulls.

818
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,680
Really?

819
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,200
Well, I just, if it's like a dive bar or a questionable place,

820
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
it's like, I know the bottle beer will be reliable.

821
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,280
Oh yeah, yeah, not tampered with.

822
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,120
Yeah.

823
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,800
I'd like to propose that you would also be a great

824
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,320
mocap cookie crisp dog.

825
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,160
Oh my God, of course.

826
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
I would love the dog or the burglar.

827
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
You don't see the burglar much anymore.

828
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,640
I would love it.

829
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,280
My friends, I love those commercials, my friends.

830
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
My friends.

831
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,840
Cookie crisp dog, yeah, with the-

832
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,440
We get cookie crisps in the house sometimes.

833
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,720
To stay a little bit on topic, one thing I will say,

834
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
and I'll just throw this out there

835
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,560
and I bet I'll get agreement, but who knows?

836
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,400
I think there's no question that of temporary

837
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,440
anniversary celebration amending of Disney World landmarks,

838
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,440
this is vastly superior to the giant hat

839
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,560
in front of the Chinese theater at Disney Studios

840
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,440
and the big wand next to the Epcot ball.

841
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,480
I think you got no proponents of either of those things.

842
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,800
Of course, no, there's-

843
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,640
Uh oh, uh oh.

844
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
I mean, the hat I like, okay.

845
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,920
So my dad was like, I liked all the anniversary stuff,

846
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
but I think we were in agreement

847
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,960
that those stuck around way too long.

848
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,520
Yeah, the hat was way too long.

849
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,360
Was way too long.

850
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,200
Maybe for a second, but I think,

851
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240
but also, and again, put the hat in there,

852
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,360
but why is it blocking the thing that you wanna say?

853
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,680
Well, that's because they lost rights to display.

854
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,240
It is like the icon of the park.

855
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,960
It was there like six years ago.

856
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,800
It was like-

857
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,240
You saw the merchandise go from the Grailmans

858
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,280
to the Earful Tower.

859
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,600
The Earful to the Water Tower is still there.

860
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,800
The place had to switch what the landmark was.

861
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
Epcot wand, get out of here.

862
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Did that ruin the policy-

863
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,400
Ruins the funliness of the orb.

864
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,080
Where was that different?

865
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,920
The wand-

866
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
It's in 2000 for a little bit.

867
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
Did it say 2001?

868
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,440
Did they keep changing it?

869
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,280
They did keep changing it,

870
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,880
and then it just became Epcot in the ugliest font,

871
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,680
in which an ugly font in Epcot,

872
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,120
that is my worst nightmare.

873
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,960
Yeah, get out of here.

874
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,800
Oh yeah.

875
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
Fonts are the main appeal of Epcot to this day.

876
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Why did-

877
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,880
It's a harsh script.

878
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,960
Plush it down the toilet.

879
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,760
Why didn't they turn them all into sort of sweets?

880
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
Absolutely.

881
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,400
They should have all been.

882
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,360
We've talked about this to some extent,

883
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,720
but why don't we,

884
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,600
let's go with just Spaceship Earth and Shaney's Theater.

885
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,720
How do you sweetify them?

886
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,560
Yeah, that's a good question.

887
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,120
I mean, a circular,

888
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,000
I mean, now I would say,

889
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
could you make it a circular ball of ice,

890
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,880
like in the Carthay Manhattan?

891
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,720
But that would be a little hard to smooth it out.

892
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,560
It looks like nothing.

893
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,400
Yeah.

894
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,360
Chocolate orb, like molten chocolate orb,

895
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,880
but I don't think those were really in fashion at the time.

896
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,560
And if you just painted it,

897
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,280
of just an even color,

898
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,200
but then doesn't that just look like-

899
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,040
Big pink, yeah.

900
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,880
It just looks,

901
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,960
that looks like the mission space,

902
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,520
like a planet or something.

903
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,360
Yes.

904
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,200
I guess you could,

905
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
I mean, I'm sure there's a way to fill in and smooth it out.

906
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
I mean, it would take a while,

907
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
but you know,

908
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,280
they changed some of the textures on the castle.

909
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,800
If you keep the textures of Spaceship Earth,

910
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,040
it tastes like a burnt peanut.

911
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,480
You know, those red, sugary,

912
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,360
very acquired taste.

913
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,040
And I think it would be lost on a lot of people,

914
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
like why does Spaceship Earth look mad?

915
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,080
It's like a burnt peanut?

916
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,480
It's like a burnt peanut.

917
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
That might not be the most fun.

918
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't know what you're talking about either.

919
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,480
It's those red, like spiky,

920
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,400
like bulk candy.

921
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,560
They're peanuts that are covered in like,

922
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,040
just like a sugary shell.

923
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,680
You could just do like a Tuft of whipped cream on top

924
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,520
and a cherry,

925
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,840
and it's just is the Epcot ball,

926
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,760
but somebody put whipped cream.

927
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,440
Oh, like a scoop of ice cream.

928
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,960
Oh, that's what it is.

929
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,800
You add a second scoop

930
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,040
and then like add a little plastic-y,

931
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,120
like the little runoff.

932
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,360
Or it's an upside down,

933
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,240
it's like a cookie puss.

934
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,680
It's an upside, you put a cone on top.

935
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,520
It's a clown cone.

936
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,680
Oh, it's a great, great.

937
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,120
Is that wrong about what cookie puss is?

938
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,640
Yeah, that's the Carvel cake with,

939
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,720
it's a different,

940
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,600
Blaskin-Robbins has the clown cone,

941
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,440
which again is another thing I was obsessed with

942
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,520
as a child and still mildly might be to this day.

943
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,520
You've brought those two events

944
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
and everyone's like, oh.

945
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,160
Yeah, everyone loves them.

946
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,360
It's a crowd pleaser.

947
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,440
Yes.

948
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,760
Chinese theater, what do you do?

949
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,920
Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably similar

950
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,680
to what they did with Cake Castle.

951
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,520
Yeah, I think so.

952
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
It's a building, so it's like,

953
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,080
we're turning it into like a gingerbread house.

954
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,960
That's kinda nice. Kind of a thing.

955
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
Yes, sure.

956
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,640
Do you keep it Chinese

957
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,480
and it's a bunch of,

958
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,360
it's made out of fortune cookies?

959
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,440
Seems to.

960
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,640
I don't think it would look like anything.

961
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,960
Yeah, I think it has to.

962
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,200
Now, a fortune cookie giveaway

963
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,240
in front of the Chinese theater

964
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,080
would have been a good idea.

965
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,920
Well, that is a good question.

966
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,760
My mom is throwing many ideas out now

967
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,920
that we've opened this up.

968
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,120
She said if they made a candy land with this castle,

969
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,680
they could sell smaller edible replicas,

970
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,560
which I think is good.

971
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,080
Did they have anything,

972
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,520
because now it would make a lot of sense

973
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
that they would be selling cake

974
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,000
that looked like the castle.

975
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,480
That is so easy Instagram bait.

976
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,560
Right, but I don't think they were doing it back then.

977
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
I don't think so.

978
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
I mean, they had merchandise.

979
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,840
Yeah.

980
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,200
Structurally very difficult cake.

981
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
We were talking about it being a practical dessert

982
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
and you saying a team would need to move it.

983
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,400
I mean, not the full,

984
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,880
but they would be selling little pieces.

985
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,720
It's an easy cookie.

986
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
A cook or a cupcake too, honestly,

987
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,680
because you could do it

988
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,520
one of the different spire type things.

989
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
But if you flatten it to two dimensions,

990
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,440
that's an easy shape of cookie and draw on it.

991
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,560
But even you could present it like,

992
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,520
oh, we cut pieces out

993
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,920
and it's like this is just a little piece of the castle.

994
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,640
It doesn't have to necessarily replicate the look of it.

995
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Let me bring up a weakness to it as well.

996
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,360
I didn't realize how this is from a TPM vids on YouTube.

997
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,360
I had a rare shot of the back of the castle.

998
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,880
This is shit.

999
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
They didn't paint all of it.

1000
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
It was like a facade.

1001
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,720
So some of it stayed gray.

1002
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,880
This is a big old weakness I gotta say.

1003
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,200
I can't really hold that against it

1004
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
because it's mainly about that front view,

1005
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,480
but truly they should be ashamed

1006
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,400
of how bad it looked from the back.

1007
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,840
I think it was also very bizarre

1008
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,800
to watch this thing get built

1009
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,040
because as Jason was saying, this is pre-internet

1010
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,080
and the castle was just being painted pink

1011
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,480
and nobody knew why.

1012
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,720
Now you'd know two years in advance they were gonna do this.

1013
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,160
But truly they didn't want to say what it was gonna be

1014
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,760
and they'd even tell guests maybe Barbie is moving it.

1015
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,600
They'd make up some dumb story.

1016
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,760
So I think it was very awkward for a while

1017
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,720
when the castle was partially pink,

1018
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,320
but like halfway.

1019
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,800
Again, that's what they had to do to prep the thing.

1020
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,480
Some of people's bad memories might be watching it rise

1021
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,120
and going, what is this?

1022
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,560
This looks weird.

1023
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
But if you just saw the completed vision,

1024
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,200
much more appealing.

1025
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,560
Yeah, that makes sense.

1026
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,920
I wonder how long, I'm seeing a picture of it

1027
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,320
just sort of pink here.

1028
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,400
And I think that might be, unless it's Photoshopped.

1029
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,320
It looks, I mean, it looks strange.

1030
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,440
Let me also throw out, I didn't realize

1031
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,600
that there was a precedent for the Castle Cake

1032
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,800
that for the one year anniversary of then Euro Disney,

1033
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,800
they did sort of a sweetified version of the castle.

1034
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,560
Which is a little bit, I do,

1035
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,160
I don't think this is better than the Castle Cake.

1036
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,680
We'll post a picture of this.

1037
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,040
But I think it's a little more stately in the colors.

1038
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,280
I think this is getting away from the Pepto pink.

1039
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,720
Hey, you know what?

1040
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,680
The Europe Castle always pink.

1041
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,360
And I think a good shade of pink.

1042
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,160
I think I don't like that shade of pink.

1043
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,560
I also like that it's a bunch of big giant strawberries

1044
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,760
at the base.

1045
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
This looks like a good cake.

1046
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,040
That, yeah, that looks, I like that.

1047
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,640
It looks like the frosting is still inflatable.

1048
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,080
Mm-hmm.

1049
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,960
It's a little more minimal.

1050
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
Yeah, it's more minimal.

1051
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,600
It's a subtler Castle Cake. I do like that.

1052
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,080
Did you guys see at the,

1053
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,240
when you walked into the Magic Kingdom,

1054
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,360
there were 25 candles.

1055
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,480
In front of the train station?

1056
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
At the train station.

1057
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,520
They just looked like big candles.

1058
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
Yeah, those weren't really anything.

1059
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,320
That didn't really.

1060
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Yeah, why do that?

1061
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,520
Yeah. That doesn't, yeah.

1062
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,400
Not a fan of that.

1063
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,240
So I think maybe this, I truly think if you,

1064
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,280
I think I have an aesthetic problem.

1065
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
I think you toned down that pink

1066
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,800
and I'm more on board with it.

1067
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,040
And I do like in the Europe one, the smaller whipped cream.

1068
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,720
It was a little less silly of Tufts,

1069
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,280
but maybe that wouldn't be.

1070
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,400
Maybe you want it to be big and bold and silly.

1071
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Yeah.

1072
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,120
It is, I mean, it's certainly gaudy,

1073
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,200
but it's a gaudy in the way that I like.

1074
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,720
That's the thing.

1075
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,280
So I guess it is just a design.

1076
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,400
I mean, I get that it's so different.

1077
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
Like the castle itself is not,

1078
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
the Cinderella's Castle is very grand and pristine.

1079
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,080
I don't know what the other word I'm looking for

1080
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,720
is prestigious or awe.

1081
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,800
It's got the size, it's got the awe.

1082
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,560
I think it's so changed the character.

1083
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Of what that castle was like,

1084
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,440
which makes it, it really sticks out like a sore thumb

1085
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,600
at the end of Main Street, which with the vibe as it.

1086
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,800
I think what's good about the Europe one,

1087
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
which I don't think is bad, I'm not saying,

1088
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,880
this feels like a snooty opinion to say that,

1089
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,560
oh, the European one was better,

1090
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
but it's like more in the character

1091
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,960
of how the castle always is.

1092
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,800
Yeah.

1093
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
Yeah, I guess it does.

1094
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,480
If you look at the, I'm looking at the picture.

1095
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,080
Yeah, it does look like, it's like,

1096
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,320
I guess it contains, it gets the character

1097
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,040
a little bit more of the castle

1098
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,280
as opposed to the Cinderella one

1099
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,160
that does really completely look like almost a new structure.

1100
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,360
And you can see, obviously it's the same,

1101
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,600
but it looks, they've changed so much of it.

1102
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,360
It looks like a totally different thing.

1103
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,760
I should just try to, I should just pull this into Photoshop

1104
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,560
and de-saturate the color and see how I feel.

1105
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,240
Maybe I can post my idea, like here's what I did.

1106
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,040
I just like, side of things are at 10%

1107
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,520
and this is how I, this is important revisionist work.

1108
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,360
Very important.

1109
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,400
What was the Euro castle, the beta test for Magic Kingdom?

1110
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,480
Like did they know they wanted to do something like this?

1111
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,120
Did they know they wanted to do it?

1112
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,960
Potentially.

1113
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
Yeah, I mean, for Euro Disney,

1114
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,720
didn't matter if people hated it.

1115
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,680
It's one year old, everyone hated it anyway.

1116
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,520
They hated everything.

1117
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,360
Yeah.

1118
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,480
Think about it, yes, absolutely.

1119
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,880
I guess it's, we're on a little long time,

1120
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,240
but the, we should, we need to talk about the fact

1121
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,240
that on this day, like we're one day behind.

1122
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,800
October 1st, 1996, this was the 25th anniversary

1123
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,720
and there was a huge event that part of which

1124
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,080
was the unveiling of the castle cake.

1125
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,480
And as part of this, a big celebration,

1126
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,680
big children's choir saying Michael Eisner spoke, of course.

1127
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,520
Of course.

1128
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,720
But mainly an address, the castle cake,

1129
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,400
there was a speech given in front of the castle cake

1130
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,480
by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

1131
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,320
Wow.

1132
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,000
She addressed the nation before the castle cake.

1133
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I did some cross checking to see what was Bill doing then.

1134
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,240
And I was really hoping that literally one of the

1135
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Clinton Lewinsky affair dates happened

1136
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,640
on the day of the speech, but not sure.

1137
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,560
It was actually in the biggest,

1138
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,960
that was the biggest window of them not really

1139
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,360
seeing each other.

1140
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Literally, Hillary is speaking in front of the castle cake

1141
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,120
and Bill is at the White House with Netanyahu and Arafat.

1142
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,360
Holy shack.

1143
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,040
Yeah, yeah, pretty crazy.

1144
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,600
Do you think like if Bill had seen this,

1145
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,080
he would have asked them to do the same thing

1146
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
to the White House?

1147
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,760
Ha!

1148
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,120
Turn the White House into a cake.

1149
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,320
I can't eat it anymore, but I'd love to look at it.

1150
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,520
Michelle Obama wouldn't have put up with that shit.

1151
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,600
No, that's true, but then Trump would have put it back in.

1152
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,880
Bigger, gaudier cake.

1153
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,960
Again, my Trump hatred goes down by a significant degree

1154
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,960
if every year he, for some thing, there was a...

1155
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,640
He turns the White House into a cake.

1156
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,680
Yeah, I was almost gonna call it a castle cake.

1157
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,520
But a Mar-a-Lago.

1158
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,360
If he turned the White House into a castle cake.

1159
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,760
Mar-a-Lago cake as well?

1160
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,400
I think it's not defined and I don't know,

1161
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,160
I don't have a vision of what Mar-a-Lago looks like.

1162
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,560
I know they have very good cake.

1163
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,400
We're certainly aware of that.

1164
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,800
I imagine they do, yeah.

1165
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh, but a dessert White House.

1166
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,600
Yeah, hell yeah.

1167
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,040
Dessert White House, please.

1168
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
Some very talented person that's listening to this

1169
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,720
is going to draw that, I assume.

1170
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,280
Oh yes, absolutely.

1171
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,120
Dessert White House.

1172
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,680
I also, just to put things in the timeline,

1173
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,320
October 1st, she's in front of the castle cake.

1174
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,400
Clinton's meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat.

1175
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,720
The end of that week, that very same week, October 7th,

1176
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,120
Clinton beats Dole in the first presidential debate

1177
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,640
of that season and that day, I couldn't believe this,

1178
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,440
that same day, the launch of the Fox News channel.

1179
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,280
Wow.

1180
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
This really puts things in bed

1181
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,720
and it cut to what they're doing about Hillary.

1182
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,960
Who knew that they would entirely be about Hillary 24-7

1183
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,040
still in 2019.

1184
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,640
Little, did you know you were setting me up

1185
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,280
for all of my shit about this day?

1186
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,120
Yes.

1187
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,440
So did you get this picture?

1188
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,640
Did you see this picture?

1189
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,000
Not specifically.

1190
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,080
So this is a picture, it's for sale.

1191
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Like it's a news archive print.

1192
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,280
It's got stuff on the back, like Kodak logos.

1193
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,040
It's got the like, excuse me, the poll.

1194
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,320
Ears to you, it says.

1195
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,560
So in this picture from the event,

1196
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,920
Mickey Mouse, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. Disney,

1197
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,160
Michael Eisner, Hillary Clinton,

1198
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,600
and then Florida governor Lawton Chiles,

1199
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,800
walking Lawton Chiles.

1200
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,640
They called him.

1201
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,000
So this was my, I texted, I asked you guys the other day,

1202
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,120
did you, did anyone come across Lawton Chiles?

1203
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,160
Cause I'm like, oh, who is this ghoul?

1204
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,320
He's gotta be a ghoul.

1205
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,640
He was actually pretty, pretty kind of like,

1206
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,000
he was, he was democratic governor of Florida.

1207
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,000
Doesn't mean anything.

1208
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,600
Which doesn't mean anything.

1209
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,400
Seemed to mostly start, it's a lot of headstart,

1210
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,560
like children's health programs and stuff.

1211
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,800
Was a reformer when it came to healthcare and education.

1212
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
I am not smart enough to look at this stuff

1213
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,280
and see if that means actual reform

1214
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,080
or like privatization, ghoul reform.

1215
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Got the name walking Lawton Chiles

1216
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,600
when he ran for United States Senate

1217
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,600
and walked 1,003 miles from Pensacola to Key West.

1218
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,160
He earned that nickname.

1219
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,200
And it sort of earned like that gave him the image

1220
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,880
of like a folksy Southern man.

1221
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,200
Forrest Gump.

1222
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,480
Very, very Gump.

1223
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,400
So, unfortunately, walking Lawton Chiles,

1224
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,520
the reverberations, he died.

1225
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,360
Not long after this, right?

1226
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,480
Not long after this.

1227
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,240
Walking Lawton Chiles is, I think we can safely say,

1228
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,840
a man who helped the start of breaking the world

1229
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,720
because he appointed multiple judges

1230
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,200
who ruled in the Bush v. Gore decision.

1231
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,200
He appointed multiple Florida Supreme Court judges.

1232
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,400
Ruling in the majority instead,

1233
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Perriente, Lewis, and Judge Quince,

1234
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,200
who was jointly appointed with George Bush.

1235
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,240
There was an agreement.

1236
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,080
They had to do a press conference

1237
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,120
because there was an opening

1238
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,920
and it would have looked bad as Lawton was leaving office

1239
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,440
if he appointed this judge last minute.

1240
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,160
Now, who gives a shit?

1241
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,000
We don't have that sort of matters now.

1242
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,040
So, Heeman Bush jointly agreed to appoint this judge.

1243
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,080
Do you mean Jeb Bush?

1244
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,080
Because Jeb was-

1245
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,520
Jeb Bush, yes.

1246
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,640
Did Jeb take over from this guy?

1247
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,120
Lawton beat him once for governor.

1248
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,720
But then as Lawton was leaving, Jeb was coming in.

1249
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,560
Descending, Judges Wells and Harding

1250
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,320
were appointed by Lawton.

1251
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,760
And then Judge Shaw was appointed by Bob Graham.

1252
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,400
I'm trying to picture all of these justices

1253
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,400
as cake candles either lit or not.

1254
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,280
That's a chart I need to see in my head

1255
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,560
to tell who's on what side.

1256
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,400
So, even though he was a Democrat,

1257
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,040
he's four judges or three judges he appointed,

1258
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,680
one judge he co-appointed ruled in favor of Bush.

1259
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,840
And so that kind of started the downhill trend of that.

1260
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,800
They judges also ruled on the Terry, was it Skyvo?

1261
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,200
Shyvo.

1262
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,120
Oh, right.

1263
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,960
Case-

1264
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,600
So much was happening in Florida.

1265
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,320
They did strike down.

1266
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,360
There was a bunch of nuts who were trying to get

1267
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,120
pro-life license plate.

1268
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,640
That's a common, this happened in multiple states.

1269
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,720
People get enough signatures to like,

1270
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,960
well, you'll be able to get a pro-life license plate

1271
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,760
usually struck down as an inappropriate place

1272
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,040
for politicking.

1273
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,880
Okay, okay.

1274
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,760
So-

1275
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,480
So of the people standing in front of the castle cake.

1276
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,040
Standing in front of the castle cake.

1277
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,920
One of them installed a bunch of the people

1278
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,480
who made Bush win through weird, incorrect,

1279
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,480
the first popular electoral votes, NAFU.

1280
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,880
The second person, obviously, obviously,

1281
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,960
the primary person, the biggest victim

1282
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,440
of the electoral popular vote.

1283
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,640
Michael Eisner getting screwed out of office

1284
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,160
by Al Lutz and his string pullers.

1285
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,360
I mean, I'm more torn up about that one

1286
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,920
than Hillary, for sure.

1287
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,520
Roy E. Disney too, I was trying to figure out like,

1288
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,960
wait, so what is the Disney family tree looks like?

1289
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,840
Roy Disney is the father of Abigail Disney,

1290
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,160
the rabble rouser.

1291
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,520
Who's, oh yeah, who's like against their labor practices now

1292
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,240
and who like says her father was a piece of shit.

1293
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,080
Like a abuser.

1294
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,320
He has inferred that her father

1295
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,760
was not the nicest man always.

1296
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,960
I believe that.

1297
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,720
This made me think, for all you succession heads out there,

1298
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,360
is Abigail the Shiv?

1299
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,200
Pfft.

1300
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,040
Pfft.

1301
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,880
Pfft.

1302
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,800
Comment on this video and let us know

1303
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,200
if you think Abigail's the Shiv.

1304
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,040
Jason got real sassy.

1305
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,880
Or is she the Kendall?

1306
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,720
You got real sassy all of a sudden.

1307
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
But I don't think she's in the running

1308
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,000
to take over or anything.

1309
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,840
No, she's not.

1310
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,360
But well, within the Roy side of the family,

1311
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,800
I mean, there's so much money in the family.

1312
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,600
Down in the low, is Abigail the Shiv?

1313
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,960
He's the guy who made the caveman movie?

1314
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,080
Is he the Romula?

1315
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Is he the Roman?

1316
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,840
I mean, where does Minnie Mouse fall into all this?

1317
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,400
Yeah, where does Minnie Mouse fall in?

1318
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,280
Is she Rhea?

1319
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,000
Is she the devious Rhea?

1320
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,040
So these are, this photo in front

1321
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,320
of the unveiling of the castle cake,

1322
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,280
these are truly the horsemen of the epagulate.

1323
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,880
Literally two gigantic figures

1324
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,160
in the two biggest electoral disasters in American history.

1325
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,440
This is an ominous, an unknowingly ominous photo

1326
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,920
that you can own a real high quality print of for $8.

1327
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,760
And I'll try to find that link.

1328
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,720
Where can you get that?

1329
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,960
This is for sale.

1330
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,160
This photo print is for sale.

1331
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,920
I feel like there's only one of them.

1332
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,080
We should get it, right?

1333
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,920
Yeah, boy.

1334
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,120
How big can we get it?

1335
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,800
No, it's a physical item.

1336
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,640
Oh, it's not a print, it's an ice ice ice.

1337
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,960
It's like it was a news archive photo.

1338
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,480
So we'll have to take that and then take it

1339
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,160
somewhere else to blow it up.

1340
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,760
Yeah, we probably get it scanned and blown up.

1341
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,160
I'd like a 72 inch TV size of it.

1342
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,760
Do you think that Hillary said,

1343
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,400
all right, so I'm heading down to Florida.

1344
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,240
Do you think Bill was like,

1345
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,440
oh, you should take my friend Jeffrey's plane.

1346
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,840
He's heading down there.

1347
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,760
He's making a quick start doing a couple of pickups.

1348
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,600
I think.

1349
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,440
Hey, and.

1350
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,280
Drop you off.

1351
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,600
He probably.

1352
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,200
In 20 years, make sure to campaign down there a bunch.

1353
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,320
Down there and like up north,

1354
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,920
a little don't forget, don't forget.

1355
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,280
I'm telling you this now.

1356
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,600
I was gonna say both of those things happened.

1357
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah.

1358
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,280
Yeah, yeah.

1359
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,120
She'll also be noted that she failed

1360
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,440
in her Disney World visit to reach out to the,

1361
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,560
to the Rust Belt of Mickey's Toontown Fair.

1362
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,360
Mickey's birthday.

1363
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,480
Mickey's birthday land, Scott.

1364
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,320
No, not then, no, no, no.

1365
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,160
Was it Toontown Fair then?

1366
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,520
Was it Toontown by 1996?

1367
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,600
It was at least by then,

1368
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,680
it had been Starland for a little while.

1369
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,720
So what you're saying is grandma's petting zoo

1370
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,920
had already been gentrified.

1371
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,680
Had already been bulldozed and gentrified.

1372
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,760
I'm curious about that.

1373
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
When it was Toontown Fair,

1374
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
that's not worth waiting on.

1375
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,800
No.

1376
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,640
I don't know, maybe it is.

1377
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,960
So the castle cake.

1378
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,600
We haven't reviewed the cake itself yet.

1379
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,440
We haven't?

1380
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,880
No, we haven't talked about actually the ingredients

1381
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,080
and if that would be good on an actual cake.

1382
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,160
That's what I wanna do.

1383
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,680
Well, I think it's like these crazy milkshakes.

1384
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,240
Like you get a black tab.

1385
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,560
It became Mickey's Toontown Fair on that very same day.

1386
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,400
Really?

1387
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,600
Wow, geez.

1388
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,440
Big day.

1389
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,840
That was convenient though.

1390
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,760
No, I barely squeaked in there.

1391
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,840
But no way was it birthday land.

1392
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,160
Get out of here.

1393
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,640
Get out of your mind.

1394
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,600
I will say, I wanted to say like so,

1395
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,120
lifesavers shouldn't be on the cake.

1396
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,280
Oh, you're saying if we're gonna eat the cake.

1397
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,120
I'm saying yes.

1398
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,320
That's what I think the final thing should be

1399
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,080
unless you have more stuff is we should assess the cake.

1400
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,920
It's like crazy shakes.

1401
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,960
My father has not texted back to if he likes.

1402
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,800
Deconstruct it before you start digging into it.

1403
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,200
I feel like a lot of this.

1404
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,600
Right, I'm just saying it should have been something else.

1405
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,440
It should have been like,

1406
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,400
those should have been Froot Loops or something.

1407
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,240
Cause that really would go well with the cake.

1408
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,080
That would be good.

1409
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,320
Cause lifesavers honestly, I don't love them.

1410
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,440
I never bought by them.

1411
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,240
I would have one if someone offered, but I don't.

1412
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,080
It's just not the same.

1413
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,320
You couldn't take a bite and then like chomp.

1414
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,480
You'd have to remove those.

1415
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,120
Yes, Froot Loops, perfect in my mind.

1416
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,960
Very good.

1417
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,680
If you take those and make those Froot Loops

1418
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,560
or make them, you know, generic.

1419
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,560
Is the pink icing strawberry flavored

1420
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,480
or is it just colored?

1421
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,120
Is it buttercream that's colored?

1422
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,960
I think honestly, a strawberry icing

1423
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,240
might be a little overwhelming.

1424
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,040
So I think it's just food coloring in my mind.

1425
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,160
You think it's just food coloring.

1426
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,440
Is the inflatable white icing,

1427
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,480
that's gotta be like a buttercream, right?

1428
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
Yeah, I think that's right.

1429
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,960
But I like a buttercream.

1430
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,800
Yeah, I love that.

1431
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,560
And then the blue is probably the same flavor,

1432
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,200
but it would be cool if it's a little bit, you know,

1433
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,840
tinged with a blueberry or something,

1434
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,800
but probably the same buttercream.

1435
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,280
That would be the thing.

1436
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,000
The red and white, are those like peppermint sticks?

1437
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,840
Or are they, is that?

1438
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,960
That's what it looks like.

1439
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,400
Yeah, but also weird.

1440
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,680
I agree with that.

1441
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,440
I think that even though you're right,

1442
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,280
Crazy Shakes do put stuff in there.

1443
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,760
I still think that's like,

1444
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
if you got a piece with the peppermint sticks,

1445
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,000
it's like, now I gotta eat a peppermint stick with this.

1446
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,280
But that's the most manageable.

1447
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,160
You had one of the Crazy Shakes.

1448
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,000
I know, and it had like a-

1449
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,640
Let's save it, but it had a wrapper.

1450
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,880
It had candy still in it.

1451
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,240
Yeah, which I did not like.

1452
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,320
I did not like there was a wrapped piece of candy in there.

1453
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,440
I thought that there, that was a little too much.

1454
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
Just like when you get a straw

1455
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,560
and just a little bit of the papers on top.

1456
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm okay with that, but you gotta rip a lot.

1457
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,880
I don't like a hard anything involved in the cake,

1458
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,320
cause cake is all soft.

1459
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,560
I don't wanna actually have to be dealing with something

1460
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,960
that I'm gonna have to suck.

1461
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,960
I mean, I, there's no other way to say it.

1462
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,240
I know you guys couldn't, you could have kept talking.

1463
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,400
So it didn't sound like I'm a pervert or something.

1464
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,440
It blew me back.

1465
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,640
I had nothing to say after that.

1466
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,480
Like that's what you go,

1467
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,040
you have to suck on a thing like that during a cake.

1468
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,200
It's not, it's different.

1469
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,160
It's two different types of eating.

1470
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,160
There's something in the air recently with this podcast.

1471
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,440
It's been a little profane.

1472
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,080
It's been a little bawdy.

1473
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,120
I could have said, oh, I don't wanna lick something.

1474
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,960
That would have been just as bad.

1475
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,680
The lusty month of October is almost a-

1476
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,520
Suck is weird.

1477
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,040
Suck is definitely weird.

1478
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,960
I guess, but that's what you're gonna have to do

1479
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,080
with a candy cane.

1480
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,760
You suck on a candy cane.

1481
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,000
But aren't, there's a lot of acts

1482
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,040
that are like multiple,

1483
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,360
it is about balancing several types of-

1484
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,960
Is there a thing I could have said

1485
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,560
about what you do to a candy cane

1486
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,080
that wouldn't have sounded sexual?

1487
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,920
Naw.

1488
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,760
Naw on a candy cane.

1489
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,640
You're a thousand percent right.

1490
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,360
That is in no way a sexual word.

1491
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,640
You have to be demented to use naw in a sexual setting.

1492
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,040
Can't wait to gnaw on your ear, darling.

1493
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,800
When are you gonna-

1494
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,640
Rawr, rawr, rawr.

1495
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,280
Like, I feel like, I feel like naw,

1496
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,960
you have to, naw is guaranteed to involve the sound.

1497
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,800
Rawr, rawr, rawr.

1498
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,040
When are you gonna gnaw me out?

1499
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,880
When this business-

1500
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,200
Oh, oh, second gate.

1501
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,960
When this business trip is over,

1502
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,600
I assure you, I'm not gonna-

1503
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,440
I'm not gonna-

1504
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,280
This business trip-

1505
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,120
You're right, something's been in the air.

1506
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,800
When I get my co-

1507
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,960
When this business trip is over,

1508
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,000
I love this synapse.

1509
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,240
You're describing tension between partners

1510
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,560
on a business trip.

1511
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,400
No, I think he's talking to his wife.

1512
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,240
And then it ends with the biggest naw out.

1513
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,720
I think just he's talking to his wife.

1514
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,560
That's when I come home.

1515
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,040
Yeah, yeah, when I get home, the gnawing.

1516
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,240
I thought it was sexual tension between two people

1517
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,120
doing presentations across the country,

1518
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,160
and then by the end of the trip,

1519
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,800
the sexual tension just builds to an apex,

1520
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,240
and then they get, and then just major gnawing.

1521
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,200
Big time gnawing.

1522
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,440
It's complicated with coworkers,

1523
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,440
but if everyone's single and ready to mingle, you know.

1524
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,360
It's those hotel travel, hotel life can get lonely.

1525
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,000
But sexual harassment synonyms, I have to say,

1526
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,600
but just because, talking to an employee at work,

1527
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,960
a fellow employee at work does not mean that you,

1528
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,000
that they are interested in being gnawed.

1529
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,840
Not me.

1530
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:03,840
I mean, I need one more num num num.

1531
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,680
That was the craziest-

1532
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,520
Arrgh!

1533
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,360
Arrgh!

1534
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,040
Like a dog.

1535
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,360
That delights me.

1536
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,000
Like I got, I got started,

1537
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,880
I was walking through my neighborhood the other day,

1538
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,400
and like a Scottish terrier had gotten out,

1539
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
like Ed was just like by my feet,

1540
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,640
going like, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr,

1541
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,000
like trying, I'm like, okay, man,

1542
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,040
like I can tell that it's like a dog whose bark is worth,

1543
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,000
it's not its bite.

1544
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,320
And then they were rad, I was like,

1545
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,560
sorry, sorry, it's being a real turd today.

1546
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,720
And just can't say, like,

1547
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,000
it's being a pain in the ass to get back inside.

1548
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,920
It's like, why are you being such a turd?

1549
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,920
But the sound he was making was,

1550
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,640
rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr,

1551
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,080
He wasn't gnawing at anything though.

1552
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,000
No, but I was wearing flip flops,

1553
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,360
and I'm like, I see a little, but please don't,

1554
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,120
come on, man, like I was just,

1555
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,160
I wasn't scared, I was just annoyed, like-

1556
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,880
Edwin gnaw on Jason's feet.

1557
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,880
If Edwin made that perfect exact sound.

1558
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,200
Rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr, rarrr,

1559
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,200
I'd be so impressed.

1560
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,360
He yawns, the noises he makes are barks and yawns.

1561
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,160
I mean, security did politely have to ask 11-year-old me.

1562
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,720
It's like, sir, please, the cake,

1563
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,000
it's still the castle, please stop going for the,

1564
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,480
going for, you're gonna crack a tooth trying to do that

1565
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,080
on a lifesaver, on a five-foot-tall life-saver.

1566
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,200
11-year-old. Fiberglass life-saver.

1567
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,800
Jumping up on the, you climbed it, you scaled the tower.

1568
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,640
Yeah.

1569
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,160
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

1570
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,880
It is surprising to me that Disney does not sell,

1571
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,200
like, the traditional princess cake more,

1572
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,240
that that's not pushed as like,

1573
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,920
a dessert at the- I love a princess cake.

1574
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,720
Cafeteria, yeah.

1575
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,800
Raspberry filling, green, ice,

1576
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,200
I don't think you'd have the inner pinks on purple.

1577
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,040
They make it on great British pink.

1578
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,840
I don't think you'd have the confidence to say that

1579
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,560
if it were not for Brett the Hitman heart.

1580
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,720
Well, that's true.

1581
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,560
He led the way.

1582
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,520
He led the way.

1583
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,360
He led the way.

1584
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,480
He's a pioneer.

1585
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,920
I think, well, I think we're finding there is some oddity

1586
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,880
with the cake itself.

1587
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,920
Also, a bunch of lollipops on top, also weird.

1588
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,760
Yeah, I don't like that as much.

1589
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,000
It's a neat decoration, but you certainly couldn't.

1590
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,200
The candles on top, I think, would be,

1591
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,800
if it was a real cake, they're edible candles.

1592
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,120
There's real candles at the base of it.

1593
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,400
Yeah, there should be candles on the spires.

1594
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,480
There should be candles.

1595
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
I am, I'm okay though, if those are fun,

1596
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,840
like, frosting candles.

1597
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,800
That's fun to me.

1598
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,400
The candles on the bottom should be

1599
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,160
carelessly strewn about,

1600
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,640
like someone had just picked them out,

1601
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,240
because it was ready to slice.

1602
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,120
So you think they'd just be lying on the ground,

1603
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,960
burned out? That's my fuss up, yeah.

1604
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,880
Looked like shit.

1605
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,400
Yeah, they're burned out.

1606
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,600
They're kind of laying on the side.

1607
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,520
They still have a little icing on it on the bottom.

1608
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,520
My plus up is, we were talking about how it was,

1609
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,280
maybe just didn't kind of fit,

1610
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,920
and people wanted, like, people thought that,

1611
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,040
oh, it's such a contrast from the Main Street

1612
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,880
and everything.

1613
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,120
My plus up is make Main Street all Castle cake as well.

1614
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,960
Wonderful.

1615
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,800
That would help. Mini cake.

1616
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,520
So all the whole thing, the whole stretch of it,

1617
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,600
it looks just like this, with the same color.

1618
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,960
If you, for the anniversary, invited the gang

1619
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,240
from Candylands. Almost.

1620
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,800
Nom nom nom. Nom nom nom.

1621
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,920
What's the one?

1622
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,760
It's a delivery, probably.

1623
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,360
2020 is 60?

1624
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,680
Yeah.

1625
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,680
Usually we can ignore Edwin, but this one's a pretty.

1626
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,480
As he's going nuts, I think it's because there's,

1627
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,440
Edwin!

1628
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,240
Yeah, someone's delivering something.

1629
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
I want some Castle cake merch, at least.

1630
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,080
Yeah. Yes.

1631
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,200
I want some Castle cake merch for the anniversary.

1632
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
At least, and a dessert,

1633
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,480
a dessert that at least resembles a piece of it.

1634
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,480
Should we try to make it?

1635
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,520
Oh, that's interesting.

1636
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,360
Yeah.

1637
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Seems like a disaster.

1638
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,200
It might be a disaster.

1639
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,760
I think I could do a cupcake of one of the Spires

1640
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,720
pretty easily.

1641
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,440
I may want to like store buy the cupcake

1642
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,920
and then add to it, but.

1643
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,760
Yeah.

1644
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,920
We were by a pin trading thing,

1645
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,600
and I feel like there was multiple power line pins.

1646
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,440
Yeah.

1647
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,920
Give me some Castle cake pins.

1648
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,760
Yeah.

1649
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,580
I think so.

1650
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,420
Yeah.

1651
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,260
Are you getting emotional?

1652
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,880
No, I'm getting gassy.

1653
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
I'm getting gassy.

1654
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,760
Which means, yes, that's my emotion.

1655
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,600
Give me some Castle.

1656
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,640
That's how you vent your feelings.

1657
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,480
I'm upset.

1658
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,440
Pretty perfect episode for us.

1659
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,840
We hate left and right politics talk.

1660
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,400
Some, it got a little weird and sexual,

1661
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,720
and mainly it was a ton of dessert.

1662
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,560
A lot of dessert.

1663
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,440
It was an excellent recipe for a Castle cake

1664
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,800
and when my dad finally responds,

1665
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,460
we'll post it on the Twitter.

1666
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,960
The beginning of the end of the 20th century

1667
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,320
and maybe the beginning of the end of the modern world.

1668
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,160
This kickoff, this cake.

1669
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,000
I was also thinking that's Hillary speaking

1670
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,020
mere steps away from where she was nearly installed

1671
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,200
as a robot forever.

1672
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,040
That's a good point.

1673
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:50,880
Instead.

1674
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,400
What could have been?

1675
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,560
What could have been?

1676
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,920
Well, what a time.

1677
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,840
All of history flushed down the toilet

1678
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,280
along with the Castle cake.

1679
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,600
If you have a piece of it, send it to me.

1680
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,840
Oh, you're right.

1681
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,760
Where did it all go?

1682
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,200
Yeah, somebody's gotta have the lifesaver.

1683
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,040
Like a piece of the life of something.

1684
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,360
The theme park connection must have gotten this.

1685
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,760
Must have gotten chunks of this.

1686
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,160
Oh man, that'd be incredible.

1687
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,000
Do the PS members probably work?

1688
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,280
Does Richard Kraft have any of this

1689
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,320
somewhere in his house?

1690
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,680
That's me you'd have to throw down.

1691
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,160
I've had an auction for.

1692
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,000
Yeah.

1693
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,280
I got one cake topper lollipop.

1694
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,320
And you hug it, you sleep with it.

1695
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,160
What would you.

1696
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,560
Cradle it into bed every night.

1697
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,400
What would you want?

1698
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,760
If you could pick a piece off of it.

1699
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,600
That's a good point.

1700
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,200
What would you want?

1701
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,020
Jason?

1702
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,120
I don't know.

1703
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,320
I mean, probably a big pink chunk.

1704
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,160
Where if like I could somehow.

1705
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,880
A lot of the pink is just the castle itself.

1706
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,720
So I don't think that's able to be.

1707
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,680
The inflatable icing, if I could somehow repurpose that

1708
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,560
into what do you do with that?

1709
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,200
A tarp or patio furniture?

1710
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,960
It needs to be like the frosting candle.

1711
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,440
I think it would have to be something like that.

1712
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,640
One of the sprinkles from the 25.

1713
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,040
Like if I would just have that propped up in a corner.

1714
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,880
Yeah, that's good.

1715
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,600
Yes, and that's doable.

1716
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,160
You could keep that in a home and it's not.

1717
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,960
Or there's an icing flower underneath it.

1718
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,800
Yeah, I see that.

1719
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
I'm thinking about that.

1720
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,800
I'm remembering now, my sister had all these food toys.

1721
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,440
You have like a fridge and the fake food.

1722
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,520
She had a cake toy that was plastic.

1723
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,800
It was just a piece of like circular plastic.

1724
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,480
And then you would put the different types of frosting

1725
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,680
and decorate it.

1726
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,480
And we were obsessed with it.

1727
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,400
Like there was different pieces of plastic frosting

1728
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,680
that you would put together

1729
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,840
and you would make different cakes.

1730
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,280
And it was probably a Fisher Price thing.

1731
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,560
Yeah, we had the Fisher Price kitchen.

1732
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,960
The little kitchen in the corner of the playroom.

1733
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,760
And like that all plays into it.

1734
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,400
All of this cake fantasy.

1735
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,720
And at one point in time, it was real.

1736
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,560
Yeah.

1737
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,600
Before the downfall, things were good

1738
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,440
on October 1st, 1996.

1739
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,720
Maybe that's the last time they were good.

1740
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,320
You know, Joe Biden is just trying to get us back

1741
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
to the time of the cake capsule.

1742
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,160
No.

1743
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,400
That's what he's doing.

1744
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,080
We're gonna have to register with the FCC

1745
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,920
if you keep that up.

1746
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,760
Common sense.

1747
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,880
Me and Corn Pop sliding down the candles.

1748
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,920
Corn Pop and the castle cake.

1749
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,240
Mm-hmm.

1750
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,080
I was there.

1751
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,400
I was handing out slices, you remember.

1752
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
You shouldn't have been goofing around with candles,

1753
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,000
but I shouldn't have called you the cake boss, okay?

1754
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,080
I apologize.

1755
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,240
I apologize to you, Corn Pop.

1756
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,600
Soon as you elect me

1757
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,640
and then you turn on your phonograph player

1758
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,520
and you'll hear me saying

1759
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,680
that we're bringing the castle cakes back everywhere.

1760
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,720
You're walking up to the castle.

1761
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,040
Thank you so much for admiring me.

1762
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,880
I was at the castle cake

1763
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,680
the day Martin Luther King was shot.

1764
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,720
So elect me, God bless America.

1765
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,920
And then his teeth fall to the ground and shatter.

1766
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,240
Remember the magic.

1767
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Remember the magic.

1768
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,560
Time to remember the magic.

1769
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,520
Time to remember the magic.

1770
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,800
I have material about that,

1771
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,880
but we don't have time separately to remember the magic.

1772
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,080
So I'll press pause on that.

1773
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:10,920
Yeah, pause that.

1774
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,640
You survived podcast the ride, the second gate.

1775
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,520
Hey, keep following this Patreon

1776
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,320
for three bonus episodes every month.

1777
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,200
We got merch available at T-Public

1778
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,440
and I feel like we gotta think about

1779
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,040
something castle cake related.

1780
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,200
Sure, hey, get some of those designs on pink shirts.

1781
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,560
I bet they look nice.

1782
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,560
That is a good, yeah, maybe we'd narrow it

1783
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,520
for the only make pink available.

1784
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,800
Oh yeah.

1785
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,720
Yeah, the Pepto-iest pink you can find.

1786
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,560
Sure.

1787
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,440
And for more podcasts, right,

1788
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,800

1790
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,680
to see us in Chicago and Orlando at the end of the month.

1791
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,080
Come say hello and we will,

1792
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,360
as we visit the town where the castle cake once stood

1793
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,120
and we'll all mourn and Jason will cry.

1794
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,720
And he'll still tear his butt.

1795
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,880
I was gonna say another joke,

1796
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,480
but I guess we'll end on that.

1797
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,080
Does anyone have a handkerchief?
