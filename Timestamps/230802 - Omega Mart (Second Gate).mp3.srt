1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,120
Alright, it's Podcast The Ride, Sin City Nights, the Fremont Gate.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,700
And you know, this series is our tribute to a betting town.

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,020
That's what we're doing here.

4
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,580
And in that spirit, if one of the hosts bet that a recent text exchange would not come

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,660
up on the show, he bet wrong.

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm Scott, there's Mike on one side of this.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,980
The other is Jason.

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:55,460
This is me at my most old man, which is, I still don't know how my Apple watch works.

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,940
This is, well, okay, okay.

10
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,060
That's a preview.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,340
That's why it happened.

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,540
But let's step the listener through what Mike and I got to experience one day.

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,540
It was great.

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Go ahead, John.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,740
Which is, we were discussing logistics of the very episode that you're listening to

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,980
now, Meow Wolf's Omega March.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,420
We will get to that, I believe.

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,820
But so we were just like discussing the finer points of this.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,740
And then, you know, a couple of text exchanges back and forth.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,900
And then what shows up in our text?

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,540
All right, Jason Sheridan.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,380
I think I could steer this one.

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,740
I think I know how to present in order to our wife.

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,300
Yeah, if you did experience it.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,860
Hi, I was bit by a snake.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,780
Anti-venom didn't work.

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Passed away.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,140
Okay, yeah, this is actually Snake.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Okay.

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Period.

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Gave.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
And then that's the end.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Yeah.

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,900
That was all one paragraph.

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,100
That was one entire text exchange.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,700
There's levels of this that you don't even know.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Yes.

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Me on my bullshit.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,980
We're really quick.

42
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,220
The response to this, Mike and I both, because we're just like fully in a back and forth.

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,300
So we're like ready to keep talking.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,460
So then this lands and then some stunned silence.

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
And I say, what?

46
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,060
And Mike says, question mark, question mark.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,460
And then I said, Jason broke and then go Fifi.

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,060
And then you proceeded to explain what happened.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,060
I explained what happened.

50
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,900
So now I see the floor to you.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
Okay.

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:45,940
So what happened was I was dictating through Siri into my Apple watch and I thought it

53
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,260
sent, but it hadn't sent yet.

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
So it was picking up.

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,820
I started playing a podcast again.

56
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,100
I was listening to Brian Quinn, B's guys podcast where he finds like subcultures on the internet.

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,020
And so like the Doughboys were just on for hot sauce guys.

58
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,760
The Talking Simpsons guys were on talking about like South Park guy.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,060
People still stumping for South Park, like really hardcore 2023.

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,380
So they were looking at reptile collector guys.

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,500
That's why there was a big thing.

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,140
They were reading reviews of people talking about collecting snakes and some real psychos

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,100
who collect poisonous snakes.

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:38,620
Now what happened was I was dictating and I was at a Walmart doing a pickup for mostly

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,260
I learned about Baja Blast Zero is in cans for the summer.

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,900
They can't talk about, I just drank one.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,780
I was mostly picking up.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,580
The Baja Blast is coming back up in your esophagus.

69
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,100
I try not to drink carbonated things when we record.

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,620
And you're having a lot of caffeine for a, we're having a later night record here.

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,660
Yeah, a little can of soda before dinner.

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,340
But Baja Blast is a real jolt.

73
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,740
I don't think, I think unsweetened iced tea is more of a kick.

74
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Really?

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Okay.

76
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Well, I don't want to derail you.

77
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,780
I don't want to derail you guys from an old married person discussion that you just had.

79
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,340
Happy 40 years, by the way.

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,060
So I was picking up like some Baja Blast Zero.

81
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:31,100
I was picking up a new hostess cake called the Casbars that Mike and I have been texting

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,060
about for a few months now.

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,420
They're okay.

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
They're not amazing.

85
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Mike has Casbars?

86
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,780
No, I have not.

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,100
You can ask them before you leave.

88
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,180
Or you take some for the road.

89
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
You both can.

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,420
Thank you.

91
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,060
And then I got some groceries like a normal purse.

92
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,460
You may as well just tell us what the groceries were too.

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,060
I think I got bananas, a loaf of bread.

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,660
No, bananas.

95
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Just don't eat those first thing in the morning.

96
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Hey, amen, brother.

97
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,300
Oh yeah, for him, yeah.

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,060
So this was a, yeah, this was very funny.

99
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,740
And I was, you know, I was still really enjoying Omega Mart, excited by Omega Mart.

100
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,060
I was like pretty enthusiastic.

101
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,100
I was like, oh, I think I would talk about it.

102
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,420
I think the people want to hear us talk about it.

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,120
And I was just very, that was right after we recorded.

104
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,860
So I was probably still a little like up, still a little talky.

105
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,340
Like Baja Blast up.

106
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,360
But minus the like the surging bubbles in your chest, up in a good way.

107
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,560
I was just jacked from learning about the legends in the concert.

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Well, it hasn't come out yet.

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
It hasn't come out yet.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Wait a minute.

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Wait, hold on a second.

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
I'm confused.

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Maybe I missed something.

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,520
You were in a Walmart when this happened, but you were listening to a podcast?

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
I was in the pickup.

117
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I was in my car.

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Oh, so you were in the car, I see.

119
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
That area of the pickup.

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
Oh, you put an order in.

121
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
We're waiting in a car.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
Yes, I was waiting in the car.

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
That makes more sense.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,800
So you did, you were not attempting to dictate this text and then also keep listening to

125
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
the podcast.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,160
It was that one process ended and then you went, all right, and now back to podcast.

127
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,640
No, I dictated the podcast.

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,440
I was dictating and then like the, because it goes through the, the watch is hooked up

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
to the phone.

130
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,480
So then it like pauses the podcast.

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh, it is coming from the same side.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,560
I didn't know if there's a separate iPhone in play or something.

133
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah.

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,200
So, yeah, I forget which I think I was dictating into the watch.

135
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Maybe I hit pause manually, just to be sure.

136
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Sure.

137
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,800
So, but when you dictate a text in the watch, there's a button that is nowhere on like on

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
the phone.

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,320
You dictate and then there's a don't send button, not a send button.

140
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
What?

141
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
So yeah, it's weird.

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a weird like Apple choice.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm not getting sold on the text to speech feature of the or whatever the dictating feature

144
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
of the Apple watch.

145
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh, I use it a lot on my phone, but I end up having.

146
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,600
On the phone you do it, but you're maybe not working at the king.

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Yeah.

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,640
I mean, I think the Apple text to speech, I feel like I've seen people talk about this

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
online.

150
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,080
It's gotten worse over the years.

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
You know?

152
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,200
Can, can we say for a second, I, I didn't know exactly what had happened, but I was

153
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,200
trying to figure out like what different scenarios, like you start going through like, okay, what

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
is he saying?

155
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,680
Is he having a conversation with somebody?

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,320
Obviously, like he didn't just pass away.

157
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,960
He's not at a doctor's office.

158
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,600
Was something copy pasted from something else?

159
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah.

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,920
Was what was weird because he said, I think I could do this one.

161
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,120
I think I know how to present in order to our wife.

162
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,640
And I was like, what is our wife?

163
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I don't know what that means.

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't know what that part.

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,160
I started thinking sexually like, like, yeah, I know how to present.

166
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
So the awkward are a white or like, like a very aggressive thought that maybe you were

167
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
like saying out loud, like kind of in a sinister way.

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,680
Yet, like, so the first sentence would be, I think I know what to do this one.

169
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Yeah.

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
I think I know how to present it.

171
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,200
So ours are one.

172
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,560
Like you said it to yourself.

173
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Like you were like very cocky about it.

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Like, oh, I say, very, very cocky and really like a toxic male, but also censoring the

175
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,320
word are or worse.

176
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm not immediately coming up with another sexual verb with our rail rail.

177
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
There you go.

178
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
There's two.

179
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,800
Ram or who is the other person?

180
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,040
Is this like a Mr. Brooks style?

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,840
Like two people in my brain?

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Yeah, I'm not sure.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,880
I wasn't like, is there a different?

184
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,640
Is there a wife you're thinking of?

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
Yeah, don't know something untoward you were thinking.

186
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,440
So that was my first thing where it seemed it almost seemed sexual with the just in order

187
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
to our wife.

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,240
Our wife was a kind of violence to the sentence.

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,040
I think I the reason I got hung up on it and I knew this must have been some mistake and

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,880
these mistakes happen, but just the specific of what was picked up.

191
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,920
Oh yeah.

192
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
About the snakes.

193
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Yes.

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Yeah.

195
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
But the way that it and I'm going to repeat this sentence because I think this is a beautiful

196
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
little story.

197
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Hi, I was bit by a snake.

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Anti venom didn't work.

199
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Passed away.

200
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,040
OK, yeah, this is actually snake.

201
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,400
This is a complex story.

202
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,320
Yeah, too many words because it takes a person from being bit by a snake trying anti venom

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
it failing.

204
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,440
They die and now cop to that.

205
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,080
They they must admit that they are now actually a snake.

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,120
This is this is a like short haiku length tale of somebody becoming a were snake.

207
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Oh yeah.

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Yeah, you're right.

209
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,080
Handles the in a really tiny amount.

210
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,600
It's almost like it was given like AI or something was given a task of fit into haiku length

211
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,880
or like what a tweet length used to be right and tell this little story.

212
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
And that's an economy of words.

213
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,160
There's not one word wasted in there.

214
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah.

215
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,080
You also know that the guys kind of resigned to it or maybe also like I think maybe it's

216
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,680
a were snake that went to bit somebody made up this whole story and then like, OK, yeah,

217
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,440
this is actually snake and then goes right in for a bite.

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Who am I kidding?

219
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Who am I?

220
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I know my bullet.

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,320
I just get to the I'm going to turn you into snake too.

222
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,640
Yeah, yeah, it's I I feel like I interpreted like 10 different versions of it by the time

223
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,720
you even responded, which was pretty quickly.

224
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
So I was food for thought.

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,240
So this does not reflect what was because it is selectively picking up things from the

226
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
podcast.

227
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
This does not know it's little bits and pieces.

228
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,560
There was this there was not actually a story about a were snake on what you were listening

229
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
to.

230
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
No.

231
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,160
I mean, that's very podcast worthy.

232
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Right.

233
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
That's certainly a guy.

234
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah.

235
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Oh, yeah, that would be a guy for sure.

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,360
This guy's edging into our guy territory.

237
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Yeah, really.

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I realized that.

239
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
I mean, it seems like mildly different definition.

240
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,880
But did the word life ever come into the podcast?

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
That's my question.

242
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm not sure.

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,600
I have to restart the episode because I totally lost the thread at this point.

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,560
I was only a few minutes in, I think.

245
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Right.

246
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,440
It really happened in Lindsay and I.

247
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,720
She was changing or feeding the baby or whatever.

248
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
And then one of her talk to text was still on.

249
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
And I came to the room and I was just talking.

250
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,600
And I think I said something like, like I made like some cutesy comment about the baby

251
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,160
taking a big shit or like was like, oh, like and it was all talked to text and it was a

252
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
big paragraph of it.

253
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,160
So it was like this happened just the other day.

254
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Oh, OK.

255
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Like Jason.

256
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Sure.

257
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, so I'm just getting the fucking business for no reason as usual.

258
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Very well.

259
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,760
For a half reason, I'm again, I just wanted to tell the story of the man turning from

260
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
man to snake.

261
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Maybe I even have it.

262
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,160
I think it's a particularly like just the snake stuff is particularly good.

263
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Yeah.

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Yeah.

265
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
It was just about you are someone's wife.

266
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Well, actually, that would be even better.

267
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,160
That would be more worthy, although maybe we would have kept that off the air.

268
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
You keep saying R-ing.

269
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Is it the letter R?

270
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Yeah, you wrote the letter R.

271
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,880
Imagine it would be more acceptable with effing.

272
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,680
To talk to text, I already have to super enunciate because just the Philly twang, like

273
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,360
the mushing of words together.

274
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,320
So often, Jane is like, what did you just say?

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,480
Like I'm like, oh, no, it hasn't been.

276
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
It's been four years that I still like now and just mush.

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm so comfortable in our relationship.

278
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,160
Just mush mouthing every time just falling back into the wooder.

279
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,360
It's like the dictating is making fun of the accent, too.

280
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
This is getting it from all ends.

281
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
I have the message.

282
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
Let me read it here.

283
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
And this just makes less sense.

284
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Certain same sensor, but they really didn't like it.

285
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Just air gas system.

286
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Check the leg.

287
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,660
Check maybe it just happened in love.

288
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,200
Someone who makes things worse of a whole.

289
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
This part of the message.

290
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Stop.

291
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,280
I will do the town phones, picking up all of them.

292
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm saying is dirty diaper.

293
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,120
So that's what it got out of our conversation.

294
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
That can't have been.

295
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,080
I know that's not what I was saying.

296
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
Or Lindsay was saying, no.

297
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah.

298
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Yeah.

299
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
That's good.

300
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,120
Because that's how you guys talk to each other.

301
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Then I don't understand.

302
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,960
You got a very dense language.

303
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,080
You're buying clothes, adding like periods in there.

304
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,800
We all talk like hep cats or something like certain same sensor, but they really did.

305
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,280
But they really didn't like it.

306
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,880
You're all doing beat poetry.

307
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Yeah, basically.

308
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,800
So that was, that's not as good and concise as your, as the snake story.

309
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,080
Look, nor that's, you know, we are, these episodes go on and on.

310
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,840
We use so many words and don't tell anything as concisely as the snakes.

311
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
That's a very good point.

312
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,400
So good job to the accidental collaboration between Jason hitting the wrong Apple watch

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,200
button, this podcast and, and the watch itself for getting a nice little, nice little tail.

314
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah.

315
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Now you got to hear it too.

316
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Watch.

317
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,760
With that said, that was all in the service of planning our episode about a mega mart.

318
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Yes.

319
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,240
We are now back from our Las Vegas journeys and we had kind of the, the mission to do

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,920
some new stuff, to experience some new Vegas things together and some themed entertainment

321
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
together.

322
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,160
The three of us haven't been there all at the same time before.

323
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,720
So, you know, seemed like a good thing to do and maybe nothing looms larger there in

324
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:44,320
2023 than a mega mart in terms of a big spectacle, mysterious themed experience and the entire,

325
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,880
you know, campus facility, whatever you want to call it, that it's part of area 15.

326
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Yeah.

327
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
So we did it.

328
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
We got to do it.

329
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
We finally did it.

330
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,720
That's, I feel like that's one of the most requests I've seen that more maybe than just

331
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,680
like do space mountain, which people I think want us to do space mountain.

332
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
But I think omega mart definitely.

333
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,960
They know, they know it's a long, they know for a little way.

334
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Space maintenance.

335
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,400
Sisyphus pushing a rock up there.

336
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
It's a lot.

337
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,240
It's like an opening day queue for space.

338
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,960
It's a lift hill that never ends.

339
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
So yeah.

340
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,720
And, and well, by the way, when we do space mountain, it's like a year of space mountain

341
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
at this point.

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Yeah.

343
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Every, every week is space mountain in 2028.

344
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,920
Well, there's a lot of mountains, you know?

345
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
We still have a lot of tomorrow.

346
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,960
We still have promise more tomorrow in this year.

347
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I know that early.

348
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,680
We found out a lot of other stuff we wanted to do.

349
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
We're going to do that.

350
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
We'll pick that up again.

351
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,400
Um, so, so yeah, I feel like this is like not just Vegas related stuff that people wanted

352
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,800
us to talk about, but it's themed of all themed experiences they wanted.

353
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah.

354
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, really well.

355
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,920
And understandably, because it is, um, it's, it's brand new.

356
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,000
It is not done by one of the big corporations that we know puts these themed experiences

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
together.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,120
So it's very, I don't know, it's, it's this odd indie enterprise and, and something that's

360
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:13,680
much stranger and less expected than, you know, the super Mario world, you know, and

361
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,000
they manage things, right?

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,120
Like they're a friend, like obviously there's multiple Meow Wolf things.

363
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,400
This is a potentially could last for a long time as far as like just things popping up

364
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,040
that are like this immersives or whatever you want to call it.

365
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,960
Well, it's very, you know, how often do we talk about these ambitious dreams, right?

366
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,780
That kind of crumbled.

367
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,000
And I was reading articles about Meow Wolf today and reading about how they want, we

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,280
want to be open in a dozen cities.

369
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,440
And we were expand, we're very ambitious with our expansion plans.

370
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,920
It's almost like in weird, like post pandemic and media is collapsing.

371
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,000
You don't almost expect to be reading this stuff in the 2020s, something that is built

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,480
based in physical places that wants to just keep expanding and keep expanding.

373
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
It's like we're reading.

374
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,640
It's like I was reading an article from the past, basically.

375
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Yeah.

376
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,200
So it's kind of crazy to be on the like, hopefully the upward trajectory of hope of this Meow

377
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,280
Wolf enterprise and hoping that it does work out for them.

378
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah.

379
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,680
And there's the angle, too, of yes, it's outside of the big like Disney Universal Six Flags,

380
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,800
but also like it is very theme parky.

381
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,640
It's very themed entertainment, but there's like installation art or experiential, like

382
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,940
immersive art that angle, too.

383
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,400
Like there's hundreds of artists that have worked on like different parts of this.

384
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
You know?

385
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,720
Which, you know, the fact that it's not like here are lots of separate pieces by separate

386
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,320
artists and they are separated by space in a room and labeled and you look at this one

387
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,680
and now you look at this one.

388
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
It's not a museum.

389
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,360
It's pretty cool that you were just constantly weaving from installation to installation

390
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,840
from piece to piece and you don't know what like it all it all cross pollinates.

391
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,000
You don't know when you're the soundtrack for one ends and the other begins.

392
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,760
I don't know if you're in a functional stairwell or if that is a part of the installation as

394
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
well.

395
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Right.

396
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,880
It's like it's all art and it's a thousand things, but it's one thing.

397
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Yeah.

398
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,480
And it's also a big discovery zone for adults.

399
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Yeah.

400
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,000
Which at the end of the day, we'll talk about details of like story and nonlinear storytelling.

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

402
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,120
Really is a lot of like colorful lights and weird looking stuff and things to climb and

403
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,640
little passageways and it's discovery zone for adults in that way, which I appreciate

404
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,440
as a man who wants to climb through little holes and through and like up low ladders

405
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,080
and secret places and like I want it to be like Caesar land or little Caesar's play area

406
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
though I've talked about many times where like I would crawl in right by the crazy bread

407
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,200
and come out by like a thing that was only in Schomburg that only you had.

408
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Yeah.

409
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
So I think there was maybe one in Wisconsin.

410
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,640
I think we figured out maybe there were two, but yes.

411
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,240
So I was really happy that that element was there because like ultimately if you're look,

412
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm a Midwestern dad.

413
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,520
I don't live there, but I'm from the Midwest.

414
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,920
And so like if I didn't want to involve myself in any of the storytelling, well, I got to

415
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,360
climb up a couple sets of stairs and there's some lights and I got to hit a button and

416
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I go, okay.

417
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,640
And then like I went to another set of stairs and there was like a little tiny like a hallway,

418
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,920
the trunk like Willy Wonka and I go, oh, that's cool.

419
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,640
And I like crouched down and I went, oh yeah.

420
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,720
And then I came out of it.

421
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,880
Like at the end of the day, fun lights crouching down and secret staircases.

422
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,600
That is enough for a dad who still misses the days of his discovery zone glory.

423
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah.

424
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Wow.

425
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,360
There was a lot of people like, you know, there was a lot of adults there doing it,

426
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,520
but like as we were leaving, you know, it got more crowded as the morning went on.

427
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,940
And a lot of families like in kids got this immediately.

428
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,720
There was a woman with a nine month old under her arm walking up these like really like

429
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,360
narrow, steepish stairs.

430
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,400
I was like, that does not seem like an easy situation.

431
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Probably not.

432
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,440
But a good, but yeah, the fact that you're right, there is what you were saying.

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,160
There is the intellectual way to experience this and there is the completely non intellectual

434
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,760
way to experience this.

435
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
So I was definitely flashing to my three year old.

436
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,560
Yeah, would like absolutely go for just the tactile would want to climb, would want to

437
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,480
touch, would want to stare.

438
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,240
I actually I think probably more than probably more than most things at Disneyland or something

439
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,680
could a nine month old get a lot out of this because it's like, ooh, lights, sound stuff.

440
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Yes.

441
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,840
Did you go in the little hallway, the trunk like Willy Wonka?

442
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Do you know what I'm talking about?

443
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
I don't.

444
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
I definitely remember.

445
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,400
I was in it.

446
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
It's probably not this.

447
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,440
I went through a tent and that goes into a much smaller hole.

448
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,000
So that's the only thing I'm thinking of that is like what you're describing.

449
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's a different hole.

450
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

451
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I I watched a couple of videos today and there was so many things.

452
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
I was like, well, I didn't see that.

453
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,360
Like I didn't see.

454
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,560
I really tried to see everything, but I still felt like I missed things.

455
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sure within the first hour I was like, OK, I'm not going to be able to see everything

456
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to that.

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Like I'm just accepting that.

458
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,760
Let's let's describe what this is in case people don't know what we're talking about.

459
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Yeah.

460
00:21:50,760 --> 00:22:00,080
West of Strip, like a mile away roughly from the Lava Main Strip Casinos, part of Area

461
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,160
15, which is this on the rise entertainment district.

462
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,040
I don't know what to even call it.

463
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,840
It is so its own bizarre thing.

464
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,480
I honestly, having not been to Vicks for a little bit, I missed the rise of it and wasn't

465
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,040
aware until Learning Universal was going to invest in that area and do this horror year

466
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,800
round experience there.

467
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,040
But it's like a crazy adult indoor carnival.

468
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes.

469
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:39,320
With little rides and experiences and yes, bars and restaurants, but mainly just elevated

470
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
somewhat themed.

471
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,880
Bizarre carnival of the mind stuff and colored lighting and a lot of colored lighting, a

472
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,600
lot of weird, you know, kooky restaurants and bars.

473
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,080
There's a bar outside.

474
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,400
I think it only runs later in the day during like the hot time of year that rotates you

475
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,920
a few stories in the air and then rotates you back down.

476
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, yeah, I saw some pictures that OK, OK.

477
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,480
Well, it was like a hot like a hot air balloon sort of deal.

478
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,600
But yeah, yeah.

479
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,040
When you park in there, there's like a weird like air raid siren that's going off with

480
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,680
like a scary message like you immediately are like a MERS immersed in like weirdness.

481
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,480
Yeah, this is kind of apocalyptic.

482
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,560
Yeah, there's like a big robot like that's like lying dead.

483
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:33,320
Yes. Yeah, there's a Jane and I got dropped off at the lift like ride share drop off and

484
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,040
people were going through the shipping container and we're like, what's in here?

485
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,600
We're going through they were walking.

486
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,200
They were walking through it at doors on it.

487
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
And we walked in.

488
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,520
It was like a hall of mirrors with like crazy lights and music and stuff playing.

489
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,000
And so that's even before we like got to bag check.

490
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,120
Geez. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

491
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,480
So just in the parking lot, you're you're seeing stuff.

492
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,960
Yeah. So so yeah, then you get in like the area or the excuse me, the building with

493
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,200
with Omega Mart is like a big kind of complex.

494
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,560
It's got a bunch of stuff in it.

495
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,840
That's not just the immersive thing we're talking about today.

496
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,360
Yeah. Yeah. Bunch of warehouses.

497
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes. All around there are a bunch of warehouses and there's something what's like the

498
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,960
Imaginarium or something is next to it.

499
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,240
I don't even know what that is.

500
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,320
Yeah, not sure. No, we didn't get to explore everything a little bit, but mostly.

501
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Yeah, that's a different building.

502
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,280
But but the anchor of it is definitely this.

503
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,680
And we can we could talk about Meow Wolf a little bit, at least the best of our understanding of it.

504
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,320
But basically, broad stuff is it is a

505
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:47,200
bizarro simulated supermarket where all of the products are fake and it's hyper

506
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:57,160
details at every with every type of product and, you know, like deli counter and all the zones that the market would have.

507
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,280
But what's the tagline?

508
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,400
There's you have no idea what's in store.

509
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Right. That it's all alluding to that there is more going on here and there is a broader story and lots of secret passageways that lead you into this.

510
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:23,480
Like you think this facade is the entire thing, but through the many, many ways that you could wander into really what the big show is,

511
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,520
this entire thing unfolds, which is part installation and part of story that you can follow.

512
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,960
But mainly all of it together, just a big, bizarre, trippy experience that

513
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,760
clearly cost a lot of money and took a lot of work, but still feels very handcrafted and made by specific people.

514
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah, yeah. It's and it's like a psychedelic thing.

515
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm on some level I'm surprised that it's still like it's so popular with normal people with normies.

516
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,320
Yeah, I know. Because it's really weird.

517
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,920
The whole thing is really weird and it's not like I said this before, it's like not linear.

518
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,280
So you're not quite sure what's going on or how to do it or how.

519
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,680
Yeah, they don't tell you how to do it.

520
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,880
You can you can buy a card for three dollars, which I did.

521
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,360
I did, too. That's like kind of tells you.

522
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,560
I mean, it does tell you more of the story, but like that's not going to help the average person figure out what to do.

523
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:28,320
No, and the story is second, like you could do the whole thing and not really get more than like glancing blows from the store.

524
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,200
You know? Yeah. So so yeah, you could wander in there for sure.

525
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,600
And like still kind of only just go in the supermarket, probably go.

526
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,560
That's that was clever, weird supermarket and leave.

527
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,240
Yes. Yes. I wonder if it's I'm sure it's happened.

528
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,480
There's people who've missed that employees try to tell you like, oh, you should go up.

529
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,920
I had a couple like whisper like, hey, you should go do this.

530
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Oh, OK, OK. So that's how they try to facilitate.

531
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:02,480
Yeah, because you might be starting to think this was a rip off if you know, depending on the day, it's yeah, it could be anywhere from 45 to 65, which we were there at peak time.

532
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,440
So we were. Yeah. And I think and then if you're there during peak times, which we'll talk about this, like you do see people going into secret places.

533
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
So it's not so hard to tell.

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,360
But I bet if it's a little more sparse, you might really miss.

535
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,000
You might. Yeah, yeah.

536
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
I mean, a nudge.

537
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:31,000
I think the psychedelic stuff was later on, I learned is like, oh, when you first get back here, you're in a town and then you're in like a factory and corporate headquarters.

538
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,720
Again, that's all kind. I had no idea it was technically a town because it's just so weird back there.

539
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,520
Yeah, that's an exactly I guess if I've been paying closer attention, but there's there's for sure a way where you were just in an absolute haze.

540
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes. And and Gabris was like, oh, go to the butcher, which he was right.

541
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,880
That is a way back there. But there's like three or four ways.

542
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
Maybe more, maybe more. Yeah, I think I missed a few.

543
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:06,680
I think there was a there was a zone that said employees only that I like in a stairwell that I took on faith.

544
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,120
I actually was like, OK, I guess it stops here.

545
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,760
And until watching a video today, I didn't realize.

546
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,400
Wait, you fool. That is a way that you could have gone.

547
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Yeah, because upstairs, that's an entire path that you're it's all it's multiple ways to get into this, you know, bizarre simulate or not.

548
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Surreal warehouse.

549
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,360
And one way is that to like, all right, in a normal market, you wouldn't go up the employee stairs, but you do.

550
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,760
And then you go to the break room.

551
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,720
But the break room is weird. And these videos are really bizarre.

552
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,360
And then what's this door? You open up the lockers and then the lockers are a secret door.

553
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,040
Yes. So that's one way to do it.

554
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,200
That's not how I made it up.

555
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,160
So right from the get go, you finding like the real deal, it's completely up to you.

556
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,640
How you do it. Yes.

557
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah, I just learned today watching a video.

558
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:09,120
So I bought a T-shirt, which the T-shirts are various levels of melting like like the logo on them.

559
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,560
There's some that are like very clear and then some that are starting to warp.

560
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,520
I think I bought that halfway through warp and it says Cal Tucky, which I don't even know what that means.

561
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,320
Like I just thought it was a weird, fun graphic shirt.

562
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Apparently that circular T-shirt rack, that is a door to a spiral staircase.

563
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,000
Like a spiral staircase. That's how I went up.

564
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
Is that the T-shirts? Yeah.

565
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,920
And you told me about it when we were in there and then I went, oh, I got to go back down and do it.

566
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,440
So I did it. Yeah. I saw people.

567
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
But I feel like I barely caught it. It was hidden.

568
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,400
It was. I went by it a couple of times.

569
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,840
Maybe you even said maybe that was an employee prompt.

570
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Somebody might have said, you want to check this out?

571
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,920
That's one of the coolest parts, I think.

572
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,080
Yeah. Of just again, sort of like kid brain.

573
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm like, there's a secret entrance here and you go spiral staircase and now you're in a different place.

574
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Like that part really would have blown my mind as a kid, especially if I hadn't seen it like once around.

575
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,680
Yeah. So yeah, that was that was, you know, the Batman side of it.

576
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,920
The like I always wanted a like what the Magic Castle has that you like secret passageways.

577
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah, there's secret.

578
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,840
You pull a book and then something turns around that here.

579
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,880
I'll say this now, but I know why they have to have so many people in there.

580
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,600
But if we could have done it with just the five of us, it would have been way better.

581
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. Because there's too many people going in.

582
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,680
And I understand the legit like why they have to do it.

583
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,400
But I think that if you were only in there with a smaller group, you would there are big stuff

584
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,520
that would be even like blow your mind more if you noticed it.

585
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,680
And also you would be scared more. Yeah, true.

586
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,640
Because there's scary shit in here.

587
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,400
But there's so many people going through it.

588
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,680
It doesn't it doesn't unnerve me like other scary stuff does.

589
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
You know, it's kind of cool.

590
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,720
It's it's sort of like an escape room where there is no wrong answer.

591
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
And you can escape whenever you feel like it.

592
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,160
Leave whenever you want.

593
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,440
There is a lot of benches and there's a good amount of bathrooms.

594
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I thought for like, oh, this is this is smart design because you keep people in the Omega Mart

595
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,600
like campus, they don't have to go outside area 15 to like use the bathroom or like

596
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,240
take a lot of or whatever.

597
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,200
I was going to say this maybe at the end, but I will say this right now.

598
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,040
I wanted it to fuck me up more.

599
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,280
When I was in there, I felt the desire for it to fuck me up.

600
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,120
And I don't know if it's because I'm a horror nights maze junkie now.

601
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,800
That might be what it is.

602
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,440
But I was definitely like, come on, scare me, you fucking thing.

603
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,760
Like, do it. Come on.

604
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Like I was daring. One room did.

605
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,800
I will say one room got me.

606
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,080
I don't know if you're in it.

607
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,120
There's one room where it was like strobe light and this just pulsating crazy noise.

608
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,120
I don't know if that's the way to describe the noise.

609
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,800
It was like, oh, like, yeah.

610
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,400
And then there was also on the wall.

611
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,640
It was just you looking at you in black and white and a giant blown up image.

612
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,720
So I didn't looking at you.

613
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
It's down the corridor.

614
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,120
I should I think I have it written down what the name of it was.

615
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,120
And I was in there alone and I'm standing there and it's going

616
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,720
and it's like going crazier and faster and faster.

617
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
And I remember just going, I think I could lose my mind.

618
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,120
It's this is fucking me up.

619
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,400
But that was the first time I like felt like that extra level.

620
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,760
It's like when you're eating food and if you like hot sauce,

621
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,080
if you like a little kick, I the way I think of hot sauce

622
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,280
is like adding like a fourth dimension to eating, essentially.

623
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Like there's an extra.

624
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,120
This was making every meal so much more exciting than any of us having.

625
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,520
Well, it's not thinking that crazy thought if you're eating hot chicken,

626
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,960
because like really, what is hot sauce?

627
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,200
But making your mouth react in a way that's not doing something

628
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,600
that's like a normal satisfying taste thing like you're normal.

629
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Like really hot shit isn't good.

630
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
It doesn't taste good.

631
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,280
But you get end up liking that sensation that's happening in your mouth.

632
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
You know what I'm saying? Does that make some sense?

633
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,680
It seems like the psychedelia of Omega Mart has fucked with Mike's brain.

634
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,440
And where he's like spitting here, this is my philosophy, man.

635
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,760
He's like the dude.

636
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,400
And now he is burrowing down on everything, including like cap capsaicin.

637
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,840
So I'm saying there was a dimension missing because it was a spooky, weird thing.

638
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,720
But I'm used to that extra dimension of like an immersive like this,

639
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,320
where I get my body physically reacts because it's freaked out.

640
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,600
So I was you should have done it on hot sauce.

641
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,800
Well, that's what's missing.

642
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,440
I would. That's what I'll do next time.

643
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,840
When you also next horror nights, horror night season, just take

644
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
keep some packets in your pocket.

645
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,040
Well, I'm in your pocket.

646
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,880
That that is, I think, how in the theme park, like new stuff, area 15 came around

647
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,360
because, you know, you said earlier area 15 in Vegas is getting the year round

648
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,840
universal horror nights on and then Orlando is getting an area 15 in 2024.

649
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,640
So kind of an exchange.

650
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm assuming that's going to happen.

651
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,120
Oh, I'm not 100 percent.

652
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,160
I don't know that.

653
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,640
But I don't know.

654
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,840
Meow Wolf has duplicated any of their stuff.

655
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,960
I know they're just opening a Texas thing right now.

656
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,120
There's that there.

657
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,960
I think there has been that discussion of are there things that they can replicate

658
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,000
and they're like that there's because they're all original and original premises.

659
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,960
Yes. Currently you get three.

660
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
You got Santa Fe.

661
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,000
You got this one in Vegas and then you got convergence station in Denver,

662
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,920
which is five stories and nearly twice as big.

663
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,880
Oh, man, I didn't realize that.

664
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,160
Yeah, that's the ultimate one.

665
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,560
Wow. Yeah.

666
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,640
And that has a collaboration with Everything is Terrible.

667
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,640
Oh, yeah. Called Pizza Pals Playzone.

668
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,920
That is an invented from the ground up, but more surreal Chuck E.

669
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
Cheese. Yeah.

670
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,760
With a fully fleshed out cast of characters.

671
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
Great. Yeah.

672
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,040
I mean, you know, does it hurt to not see Helen and Jasper and the characters we love?

673
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,680
Sure. But, you know, I understand they they they don't even want those characters anymore.

674
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:34,640
That company. They also they have the ride called Collide Escape at Elitch.

675
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,760
How do you say this?

676
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
Elitch Garden, Elitch Gardens.

677
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
Yeah, I didn't know about this till today.

678
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
They took over a dark ride.

679
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,640
They like the park was like redo this ride, you know?

680
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,400
Yeah, that's pretty insane because they're they're Denver

681
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,120
exhibit, whatever you want to call it, is next to that theme park.

682
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,640
OK, and they have a big corporate presence in Denver.

683
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,440
So I think it all just came together like, hey, this thing is going so well.

684
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
Or maybe it wasn't open yet.

685
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,240
Maybe they just like, I don't know.

686
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,080
I actually I think the ride opened before the Megamart even.

687
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,600
So I'm not sure how it happened, but how like for what is otherwise

688
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,280
seemingly a sort of generic park, from what I can tell about Elitch Gardens.

689
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,160
Apologies if I'm offending any listeners who.

690
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,760
But, you know, it seems in the realm of like the the Kings's or

691
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,640
not a Six Flags, maybe.

692
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,840
But like but this they yeah, it was the ride Ghost Blasters,

693
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,400
which is a Sally Dark ride that's kind of rubber stamped across a lot of places.

694
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Carol Wins and other parks.

695
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,000
So they have that, which I'm sure is fine.

696
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm sure I'd like Ghost Blaster.

697
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
Yeah, just fine.

698
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,520
But then to give this art collective like it like you guys do a ride.

699
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
That's pretty nuts.

700
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Yeah, that's a pretty next level thing.

701
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,240
That's right.

702
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,240
With like an aesthetic that's kind of not not abrasive, not scary or anything,

703
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,320
but it's not like theme parky theme park.

704
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,200
Right. Stuff can be so kind of tame, really.

705
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,160
Yes. I mean, this is akin to letting Raleigh Crump do whatever he wants or something.

706
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,760
You know, like it's it's pretty you don't see this art influence in theme parks very often.

707
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,760
Yeah, it's very much more aggressive.

708
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,240
It's like the theme park.

709
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,960
The general theme park tone is always not aggressive.

710
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,080
Yeah, yes.

711
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,960
Especially a dark ride.

712
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,720
It's like, yeah, you know, you expect to be taken care of a little bit.

713
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,120
This is a little more or see just see a lot of characters who, if you aren't paying close attention,

714
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,640
you're like, was that Mickey or bugs?

715
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,800
Yeah, probably. It was. Yeah, I think so.

716
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,400
Yeah, I'm really cute.

717
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
If not the one you immediately recognize, you know.

718
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,040
Well, they're probably from something.

719
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,800
Yeah. So in the actual like Omega Mart part, I didn't I know Gabris told us this,

720
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,880
and I actually didn't realize you could buy the fake products.

721
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Uh huh. Oh, yeah.

722
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,000
Which is very good. You did.

723
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,720
I bought and the box was pretty beat up by the way.

724
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,960
Corn PM.

725
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
You picked a beat up box.

726
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,880
They were all kind of beat up in the display.

727
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,720
People handle them all day.

728
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
People handle them. Yeah.

729
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
So, yeah, you can buy.

730
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,640
There are price tags underneath all the fake items.

731
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,400
How much did the corn PM cost just out of five ninety nine?

732
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
OK, and there's no bottle in there or there is.

733
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,240
There's nothing in there. OK, just a box.

734
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,360
So like I think what was the one next to it?

735
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,120
Emergency clams. Oh, yeah.

736
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah. Those I think it's just an empty can. Right.

737
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
So I don't know.

738
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,920
I just thought it was a cool like piece.

739
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,680
Some of them get pretty expensive.

740
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,680
Yeah, I didn't I didn't track what was the most expensive.

741
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,600
Now, here's where in an episode where I think the tone will mostly be.

742
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,680
This is cool.

743
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,920
I thought it was really cool and it's cool.

744
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,960
They're doing this. Yeah.

745
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,760
Let me say this early on before you have,

746
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,440
you know, breached the other world and seen like the stuff that this is really about.

747
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
I am going through a mega mart and I am looking at these products

748
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,480
and I am thinking, am I am I supposed to be laughing at these

749
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,040
as a like my wrong here?

750
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,880
Am I to like maybe have not been satisfied by like, hey, oh, this one.

751
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,080
Hey, and this one.

752
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,320
And I, I, I kind of let me down.

753
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,960
There was a moment where I'm like, OK, it is a satirical store

754
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,880
with satirical products.

755
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,920
I don't know if I like the general tone of these.

756
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,040
If you're Jason, what you just said was like, I thought it was cool.

757
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm just I was like, if I'm supposed to be laughing out loud

758
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
at these bizarre products, I am not laughing out loud.

759
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,880
I think I think it was odd.

760
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,360
I think it was like, oh, that's weird. That's odd.

761
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,760
I think I bought that one because I think the phrase corn PM is funny.

762
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
Yeah, but I do think that's funny.

763
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,280
They're not all home runs.

764
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:00,520
It is. But I think it's similar to the way of like, well, there's theme park funny.

765
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,600
There's also art world fun.

766
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,560
Like these are very specific kinds of funny.

767
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,560
These maybe aren't laugh out loud funny. Yeah.

768
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,640
Yeah. But I almost feel like more likely to laugh at theme park funny than this.

769
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,720
Am I nuts? Am I like, is this like cynical, Scott?

770
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,800
I was anybody dying over the.

771
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,680
I don't think you caught me laughing like Rhonda Santus at any of the products.

772
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,320
Ha ha ha. Like I wasn't walking through here.

773
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,280
I think it was like, oh, yes, it's like I know what that original product is.

774
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,520
And I know what they're parroting here.

775
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,920
And I was a I was nodding.

776
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,840
Yes. Well, if that's the intended effect, then I certainly I was nodding.

777
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,000
I see it. I like this.

778
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,080
I like how they made it look like the real thing.

779
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,480
But I don't think I wasn't guffawing.

780
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,480
I was maybe I was more like they have like a the deli section

781
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,560
or where they have like chicken and like meat and there's like tattoos on the meat.

782
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,200
And I was like, oh, that's gross.

783
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
That gave me more of a feeling again.

784
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,440
You know, I'm looking I'm you know what I'm looking for.

785
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm looking for really get like

786
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,080
messed with a little bit, like where I feel like something's gross

787
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,760
or I feel more of a visceral reaction.

788
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,720
And that was giving me more of what I think

789
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,720
that it was giving me something.

790
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,080
I think bizarre, bizarre color need and what is this?

791
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,760
Yeah. Yeah.

792
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
Versus like, lol.

793
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,640
Stuff. Yeah. Stuff is more quietly unnerving.

794
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,080
Yeah. And you're a haunt boy.

795
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,000
You know, you love your haunts, you know.

796
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
Well, daddy needs his haunts.

797
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,320
Daddy needs his haunts.

798
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,600
So he wants to be shocked.

799
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,480
But it all can't be super shocking because they're trying to hit a lot of age ranges.

800
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,200
There's a lot. Yes.

801
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,880
It's doing a lot at once, which when you do it,

802
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,120
it's probably doing a lot at once in almost the best way you can.

803
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,720
But you do sacrifice things when you're doing everything,

804
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
everything everywhere all at once.

805
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,280
Which is what they're doing in this thing by having it be so nonlinear

806
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,400
for all ages, essentially. Sure.

807
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,640
Yeah. However, I mean, it is crazy that they've

808
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,560
they've managed to do an experience that like comes in tears and that is not

809
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,400
that I think would completely satisfy people who want to do complicated,

810
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,320
immersive experiences. Yeah.

811
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,680
It also can work for a five year old to wander through.

812
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,320
That's that's pretty nuts that they've managed to do something with like

813
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,760
tears and levels.

814
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,960
Well, they got everything in like a B plus or A minus

815
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,280
versus like if I like in my here's where I used to make your point.

816
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,400
Maybe my point is, oh, I was going to say and and dozens of like

817
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,280
fully designed dozens, if not hundreds of fake products,

818
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,760
which not only can you buy, but like, oh, there's a bunch on the shelf.

819
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,880
Like they're all in stock. Oh, yeah.

820
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,560
At least. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

821
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,240
But it's like I don't know why I'm being so negative.

822
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm sorry. I'm not being trying not to be negative.

823
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,720
I think I was just I was thinking about like,

824
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,560
hey, look, I bought the new Zelda, which is a great game.

825
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,560
From what I've seen, I'm not playing a lot of games with the baby,

826
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,760
not with the baby, but because of the baby.

827
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,520
It's nonlinear, meaning you just can wander.

828
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,480
You just take Link around, put different clothes on him.

829
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,920
He he he just like welds stuff together with his magic wrist gauntlet.

830
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,080
And then you can throw shit and like climb up shit.

831
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,400
It's really fun.

832
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,640
But as an older man, sometimes I'm just like, just tell me where to go.

833
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,120
Uh huh. Tell me where I should go right now.

834
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,920
But did you feel that here?

835
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,160
Because I liked I really liked that aspect of it.

836
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,800
I was even like we were there with Eva, who's done it before.

837
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,360
And I was almost looking to her like, how do we do it?

838
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
And she's like, just go.

839
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,640
And I was like, should we do it all as a group?

840
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,520
But she's no, it's just yeah.

841
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,320
And it is also it's clear that like that'd be weird

842
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,720
if like the what the six of us all like stuck together.

843
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,320
I think yes, I agree that that she told that was the right move

844
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,240
for us all to just sort of break away and go do our own thing.

845
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,520
But I was thinking I was like, OK, what is this better?

846
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,280
Or would I rather in my lazy old man brain sort of just like be shoved in a room,

847
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,400
have one of the actors like have all the music cues and like lightning

848
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,400
or the TV's flicker or whatever, and somebody like just shout something at me

849
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,440
and then throws me in a scary room.

850
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,360
Would I like that more?

851
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,600
And I think I would like it more.

852
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,280
OK. But but you were you're just describing a different thing.

853
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,720
We know you're right. You're right.

854
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,280
You're right. You're describing haunts.

855
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,120
You're chomping at the bit for haunts.

856
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,760
It'll be haunt season soon. This isn't maybe that's what that maybe

857
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,600
that's what dad dad is just wanting.

858
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,520
I think it's weird, actually, that you are.

859
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,480
I understand the feeling that you like if you you get the sense

860
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,440
that this is a like that it's it's surreal and trippy

861
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,480
and that maybe you want a little bit of like you want to get

862
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,640
the get a little shocked, you want to like what you got out of the one room.

863
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah, I understand.

864
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,480
Like that, like it's it's and it's presented as this pleasant

865
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,960
veneer of a store and then but then shit in it is going to fuck you up.

866
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Yeah. But I don't know.

867
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,000
I also just don't think that's what it's.

868
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,560
No, you're right.

869
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,520
Well, I think so close to other things.

870
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,240
That's the only reason my brain was starting like moving it

871
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,080
into like different boxes while I was doing it. Sure.

872
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,880
Also, you can I think you can do what you're describing.

873
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,160
It just takes a little while to figure it out.

874
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,840
Like if you buy that Adam card, you can try to find all the boop stations.

875
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,040
And that's a lot of work.

876
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,560
Track and and listen to the sentence you just said.

877
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,520
That sentence sounded boring to me.

878
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,360
You get the Adam card and get all the boop points.

879
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,200
You can do all all that stuff, but you can also just find all the screens

880
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,000
and the psychedelic part that have the weird movie playing.

881
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,080
And that establishes story.

882
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,280
You can follow story if you want.

883
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,040
Sure, sure. And I did some of I

884
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,320
booped a little bit, I booped here and there.

885
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,800
Sometimes you have to wait in line for teens to finish booping

886
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,400
before you get to boop when it was crowded.

887
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,840
When we were leaving it, it got a lot more crowded.

888
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,680
And I think that was you were seeing the limits of the boop state.

889
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,240
Like the lines were getting very long for the boop station.

890
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,480
And the boop here's what I OK.

891
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,480
Also, when we're talking about booping, so you go.

892
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,720
I actually don't know what booping is.

893
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,520
I didn't do this.

894
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,760
So not just should we say being like when Jason said R

895
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,160
instead of rail being? Yeah, sure.

896
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,640
I think I know boop boop is that was sometimes more confusing.

897
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,640
But it is right now. I also boop.

898
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,520
Yeah. But all right. So what's boops?

899
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,200
So booping is when you take your little card,

900
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,680
which is a regular like credit card size thing or like rewards card,

901
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,320
if that helps like a law, a law, or Landry's reward card.

902
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,920
Larry's. Lowry's. What do they call?

903
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Yeah, well, I have a Larry's. Yeah.

904
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,200
Yeah. So one of those we all have Larry's.

905
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,840
You scan it on a little console and then it gives you like a hint.

906
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,520
And this is this is the add something.

907
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,160
This is that you don't have to have three bucks. Yeah.

908
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,200
And generally it'll give you like a little hint or a clue like,

909
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,000
oh, do this and find this.

910
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,840
And then you get like an achievement.

911
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,000
And this some people like doing this type of thing.

912
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,840
And I was sort of like by the third one, like, OK,

913
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,160
this isn't so fun for me.

914
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,320
And I again, this is a good go back to video games as an older man.

915
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,000
It's like I'm not collecting like a perfect hundred star game for Mario

916
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,400
anymore. That's just not who I am as a player.

917
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,680
I'm more of a guy. I want the experience.

918
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,880
I want to kind of go through it. I want to see all the levels.

919
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,440
I want to feel I want to fight the monster.

920
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
I want to fight Bowser.

921
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,320
I want to rescue whoever princess, whoever, or if it's Cappy or if it's Toad.

922
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,640
I don't care. I just want to rescue them.

923
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,960
And I want to be done onto the next game.

924
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,160
I'm an older man who has a limited amount of time.

925
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,920
So brought things, but so Booping felt like, OK, well, OK, yes, I did find.

926
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,120
Oh, go locate the door that's over by the red light.

927
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,200
OK, I did do that.

928
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,160
But that doesn't feel like I'm unlocking this crazy mystery

929
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,240
that involves like aliens and robots and capitalism.

930
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah. Evil family.

931
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,960
That doesn't it doesn't satisfy me in that way, which I actually have never done.

932
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,400
An escape room we know about the Minotaur or whatever.

933
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
I wonder if an escape room would drive me nuts now.

934
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,360
That's that's sort of what I was thinking where I'm like,

935
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
I've never assumed I will do it.

936
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,320
We'll do it. Maybe if we can do that back at that back of the field.

937
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,880
Oh, let's do it. Yeah.

938
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,200
But I was like, oh, I wonder because some people really like get

939
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,200
get off on escape rooms and stuff and solving things.

940
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,840
It makes them feel like they're areing. Yeah.

941
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,320
It makes them feel like they're areing.

942
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,920
It's that same high or booping.

943
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,520
But yeah, I wonder.

944
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,120
I wonder if like an escape room, I'll sort of go like this

945
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,720
isn't giving me the satisfying feeling it's giving someone else.

946
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,080
Sure. As if you're doing like a high school, like end of the year test

947
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,760
in a limited amount of time, you're doing an SAT.

948
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,880
I don't know. I'm interested to see.

949
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,200
I'm sure all escape rooms are different, but maybe it's just something

950
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,960
I don't like as much as like when we did the Blue Blade.

951
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,240
And it's just like quick, go into this tiny room and hit a button.

952
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
And you go, yeah, it feels like I'm doing something.

953
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,720
And it fools my dumb brain into thinking like I'm part of a narrative.

954
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,520
You don't want it.

955
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,680
Well, it also it sounds a little similar to Galaxy's Edge data pad,

956
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,840
which I've never been a fan of.

957
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,960
But that that at least you can hit a button and then like the ship beeps.

958
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,000
Yes. But that's kind of it.

959
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,440
That's the one thing I feel.

960
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
No, you're right. It is the one.

961
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,760
Yeah. I don't go to the back to the data pads a lot.

962
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

963
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,360
I don't. Well, it also I mean, also, it's like the way you're describing

964
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,640
doing it doesn't if you were like getting frustrated in the weeds.

965
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,760
That's a bummer because Erin and I just went like,

966
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,840
wow, a big room with a bunch of pink and purple triangles.

967
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,280
This is crazy. I want to hug them.

968
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,040
So I so I'm almost like maybe the optimal way to do this is that first time

969
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,080
is just like no nothing. Yeah.

970
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,240
Feel it. Just feel it. Just be there.

971
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,040
And then I was thinking if if I was in Vegas again and I'd like to be

972
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,520
if I were to get invited to go again

973
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,920
and a group went, then maybe then you like, OK, well, since I've been before

974
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,400
and I don't and I'm not going to have that visceral first time thing again,

975
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,280
maybe trying to understand story.

976
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,000
You're saying I was trying to make it something it's not.

977
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,800
And that is true. But also, I think it's because of booping,

978
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,720
because booping in the screens and like waiting for waiting

979
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,800
for some teens who are trying to boop as well.

980
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,840
That's when I started being like, OK, the story is here.

981
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,440
And you're trying to lead me to places to experience things.

982
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
So that's when my brain started being like.

983
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,760
But if you just sort of narratively led me and I experienced it,

984
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,360
I would find it, I think, more satisfying.

985
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,920
And that's just a different preference.

986
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,600
I don't know. How do you feel about escape rooms and like

987
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,880
like doing little busy work, essentially busy work?

988
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,160
Oh, yeah.

989
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,680
I think stars was collecting stars in Mario, collecting all the artifacts

990
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,960
in a video game. I know.

991
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,680
I don't like the like

992
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,320
collect all the stars in a video game.

993
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,800
I was, you know, I was thinking about getting a switch when I move.

994
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,880
And most of the games I bookmarked were like,

995
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,120
it's all the Disney games from Sega.

996
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,480
Like it's all by the Aladdin game from the Aladdin.

997
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,080
It's the Lion King.

998
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,240
Eric's like, well, getting all the scarabs is very sad.

999
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,320
Sure. Yeah.

1000
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,240
Do that one.

1001
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:27,560
The both Star Wars, Dark Forces on one card like in those again,

1002
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,720
that's like something you need to buy 20 year old.

1003
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, exactly.

1004
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,960
They sell the Super Nintendo.

1005
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,400
So I mean, to the point where I was like, oh, I guess you got to.

1006
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,600
I was like, oh, yeah, I guess.

1007
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,680
Yeah, I get Zelda and get a Animal Crossing.

1008
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,920
I was like, oh, I guess you got to hook the new systems up to the Internet.

1009
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,840
Huh? Like I think you brought it before once it went to.

1010
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,160
You were like, oh, yeah, because you play the stuff

1011
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,600
where you got to get on the Internet.

1012
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,760
And Mike's like, this is a very basic thing that console.

1013
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,320
I haven't had a console since PS2.

1014
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,840
Jason's trying to play everything on his Apple watch.

1015
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,000
I go haywire, records podcast.

1016
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,800
So yeah, no, I don't know that I mean, is the first one on Wi-Fi, I guess.

1017
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,160
Yeah. Nintendo systems.

1018
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,600
I am. I was even like

1019
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,520
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, like there was RPG kind of like

1020
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,840
you had to level up and you would get to rinse skills and stuff.

1021
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,720
And I'm bad at that shit.

1022
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,000
You know, if you had gotten like a PS5 and you were in our crew

1023
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,160
during the pandemic, the Grand Theft Auto crew.

1024
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
Oh, doing the heists and stuff.

1025
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,360
Yeah, you were on the heist team with us.

1026
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,160
That would have been Jason. Hey, Jason, where are you?

1027
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,640
Jason fell asleep in the middle of the night, which by the way, happened to Evan Susser,

1028
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,400
which I think I said on the show before the fell asleep.

1029
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,400
I was playing just with Susser and I'm talking to him and all of a sudden.

1030
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,280
Hello. His character stops moving.

1031
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,720
And I'm like, uh, like shooting at his character trying to work.

1032
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,640
And I'm like, I think he just fell asleep.

1033
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,880
But like, what if he's having like a medical emergency?

1034
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,440
I'm like, look, I'm like staring at my phone going, I have his wife's phone number.

1035
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,080
It's one thirty in the morning.

1036
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,240
Should I wake his wife up?

1037
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,280
And then like 10 minutes later, he called you.

1038
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,120
Deck, you went to you drove to his house and threw rocks through the window.

1039
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,200
Well, yeah, I just was the right thing to do as a friend.

1040
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,080
Very great. They have to auto just start to drive over and destroy something.

1041
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,680
You know, like did a mission.

1042
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,720
Look, Jason, I think you need to get a virtual boy to really start to catch up.

1043
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,240
I think just an emulator.

1044
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,520
I guess you can't get the new systems yet.

1045
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,600
It would be too much of a shock.

1046
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,760
I think you need to actually go in sequential order to sort of level yourself up slowly.

1047
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,120
Oh, OK. Well, just do a simulator of entering your Wi-Fi

1048
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,400
info into the console on a Wi-Fi password entrance emulator.

1049
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,920
Yeah. Yeah. So so yeah, we're not we're not collect them all guys, I don't think.

1050
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,080
As far as video games, I mean, I had the first Pokemon game and it drove me insane.

1051
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,960
I was like, do I have to get all of that?

1052
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,440
Which one for the for the Gameboy?

1053
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,880
Oh, OK. Gameboy Color.

1054
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,400
I think I was playing it on Gameboy Pocket.

1055
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,720
I think it was one of the games where it's like, well, you can play it in color,

1056
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,440
but you can just play it in black.

1057
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,240
Got to catch them all and got to catch them all.

1058
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,000
The most stressful sentence.

1059
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,720
Oh, terribly stressful.

1060
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,400
I liked my I liked my little core guys, but I was like, I can't keep catching.

1061
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,360
Who was your guy? Who was your Pokemon?

1062
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,800
Um, I think I leveled up Bulbasaur all the way to

1063
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,920
past Venus Venus or I got to look at the Pokemon characters.

1064
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,080
And I like it. But I was just wondering if you had a Bulbasaur.

1065
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,520
I played Pokemon Pinball for a little while, but I don't know.

1066
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,120
I just know the color. I like that one.

1067
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,000
I know the basics.

1068
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,480
I was more of a Spectrobes guy.

1069
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,160
Anybody know about Spectrobes?

1070
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,120
If any. All right.

1071
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,000
There's maybe three listeners who I said that and they're like, yeah, I did.

1072
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,920
And I only know I know about Spectrobes because there is a like

1073
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,000
one of my jobs at this.

1074
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,360
I was like made videos for all these Disney properties at this company

1075
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,920
that I worked at and somehow the job I wrangled the job

1076
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,200
of singing an original song that named every Spectrobe.

1077
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,400
It was all nonsense to me.

1078
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,440
I never heard of one of these things.

1079
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,920
Was it Disney's rip off a Pokemon? Yeah, yes.

1080
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,520
Whoa. I think that's what this was.

1081
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah. And there is a song.

1082
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,320
I got to find it called Spectrobes Roll Call, maybe.

1083
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,000
And it's me singing hair metal style.

1084
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,880
All of these like Zekasar, Tazanur.

1085
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,080
I'll find the link if I.

1086
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Wow. Spectrobes.

1087
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,440
It is my it's called Spectrobes Roll Call and it's 450,000 views.

1088
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,040
Wow. Really great.

1089
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,160
It's my distinct hope that some listener was like,

1090
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:54,080
of course, I know the Spectrobes Roll Calls on the channel Disney Games here.

1091
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,840
All right. Wow.

1092
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,680
I don't think I can sing that well.

1093
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,040
I didn't know that.

1094
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,400
Singing again.

1095
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
I don't think I got those octaves.

1096
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,920
Well, I certainly didn't know about your song, but I didn't know about Spectrobes at all.

1097
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,160
I knew about Digimon.

1098
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,600
I knew Digimon a little.

1099
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,680
That's what the other Pokemon called Spectrobes.

1100
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,280
Yeah. And then maybe that's a general thing to, you know, where we got through Kingdom Hearts.

1101
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,200
But boy, yeah. Hey, shout out to any Spectrobes heads out there.

1102
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,400
You know, I'm a Spectrobes supporter.

1103
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,000
You should cover the due to my involvement in the franchise.

1104
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,320
You should cover like the Bucky O'Hare theme or something.

1105
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,800
That seems like, yeah, I don't know the song right in the way.

1106
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,520
Just to confirm for anyone listening, Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur.

1107
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,880
Ivysaur evolves into Venusaur.

1108
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,200
OK, you got to Venusaur. I got to Venusaur.

1109
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,080
Yeah. OK. And that's your guy.

1110
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,680
And that's your guy. He has a big blossom.

1111
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,320
Yeah, he's kind of a big guy.

1112
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,880
He's got a big flower on his back. Yeah.

1113
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,280
Yeah. So, yeah, that's why I say that is, but is the booping felt like, OK,

1114
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,960
I see they're trying to like

1115
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,120
give the people that want a little more story or a little more of like

1116
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,960
a discovery aspect of it, but it felt.

1117
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,400
Yeah, it felt like unsatisfying to me.

1118
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,320
And I mean, maybe that's just me as a consumer of this stuff.

1119
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,960
You need more than like you got directed where to find a piece of paper.

1120
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,880
And yeah, yeah, sure.

1121
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,960
Did you log into the computers and the corporate headquarters?

1122
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,760
I did. Yeah. Yeah.

1123
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,800
So there's a lot there.

1124
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,760
It seems like it was in high enthusiasm.

1125
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,360
That's different than what I'm kind of talking about,

1126
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,600
because if you go into the big corporate office,

1127
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,520
you can go to one of the computers and you can boop

1128
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,840
and then you get access to the desktop and there's all these different videos

1129
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,800
and you get the like secret video, like of what happened to the

1130
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,800
patriarch of the family.

1131
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,920
And you get videos from the daughter who is like kind of the main,

1132
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,440
I would say, villain of the whole thing.

1133
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,920
And there's a lot of that supplemental material.

1134
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,720
I'm not talking about as much as like the kind of tasks,

1135
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,000
the random kind of tasks to like earn an achievement on your card.

1136
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,400
So this is a whole thing also that, again, you if you're like taking it

1137
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,480
at face value, initially, I am in this little cutesy supermarket,

1138
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,080
but there'll be occasional little glitches.

1139
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,960
All the lights flicker and weird messages are broadcast.

1140
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,360
And it implies like something devious going on behind the store.

1141
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,800
And then you get behind the store.

1142
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,640
And among the things you find are weird, surreal break rooms.

1143
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:37,760
But then like the the test laboratory of the umbrella corporation of the play.

1144
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,280
And that's the that's kind of the excuse for a lot of the odd rooms

1145
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,040
that you can walk into is that it's like bizarre psychic tests,

1146
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,680
which is a really good framing device for then just something trippy

1147
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,160
is happening in a room. Yeah.

1148
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,440
But that's some of what unfolds back there is the like intrigue

1149
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,080
of this corporate umbrella company and how they destroyed this town.

1150
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,080
And they what?

1151
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,800
And I first let me say I missed all of this well.

1152
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,840
Yeah, I completely am just like lights, colors, but that you're

1153
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,320
it's it's all about mining this.

1154
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,880
This is resource, the source, which then comes from humans.

1155
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,320
That's what I mean.

1156
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,520
I had to watch videos to I don't think any of it.

1157
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,400
But again, I had a good time and I didn't decipher almost any of secondary

1158
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,560
secondary to like the just being there and doing shit,

1159
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,160
like just trying stuff out.

1160
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,440
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1161
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,360
The source. Yeah.

1162
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,600
That almost reminded me when I was in the town, it reminded me of

1163
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,920
and I haven't been on it, but I saw the video of Phantom Manor

1164
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,080
where you're like all of a sudden in the town at the end,

1165
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,880
like it's a broader like it's kind of weird, weird little

1166
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,920
podunk Western town that's seen better days in the populations

1167
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,560
ticking down and see the you can tell some shit went down here.

1168
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1169
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,520
Oh, very, you know, a gulch. It's a gulch.

1170
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
It's a gulch, which gulch.

1171
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,760
You have to be a fan of a gulch if you're a theme park fan.

1172
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,000
I think you got to love gulches.

1173
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,120
Yeah, I love you.

1174
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,000
Is there enough gulches for a final four?

1175
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,640
A gulch final four.

1176
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,080
You have to look up what's actually going for sure.

1177
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,240
For sure. Gower gulch might take it all.

1178
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,880
The very vaguely Western themed Denny's and CVS.

1179
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,520
Yeah, yeah.

1180
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,080
Just a strip mall in Hollywood that is like sort of Western themed ish.

1181
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,480
Yeah. For their Starbucks and their togos.

1182
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:20,960
Right.

1183
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,680
Oh, have I maybe gone to the bathroom at that Denny's, but not eaten there.

1184
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,600
Mm hmm.

1185
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,280
Yeah, it's all one of the shadiest places on earth.

1186
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
But yeah, yeah.

1187
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,400
But yeah, but if we're talking theming only, then we could figure out gulch.

1188
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,680
We have to expand the term maybe or expand the definition a little bit.

1189
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,880
But I think of gulch isn't in the name.

1190
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,760
And I guess, you know, they got to call itself a gulcher.

1191
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,440
I mean, something in Big Thunder versus a gulch, I would imagine.

1192
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,760
It's got to be right. It's tumbleweed gulch.

1193
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,120
I don't know if there's a different gulch for each of these.

1194
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,960
There might be a different gulch for each Big Thunder too.

1195
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,360
It might all be different gulch.

1196
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,400
All right. Well, we'll take a look.

1197
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,680
OK. Well, yeah, we'll do some gulch assessment across the world.

1198
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,880
Can't be a real gulch.

1199
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,080
Here's something. No, no, no. No real gulchers. Fake gulchers.

1200
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,600
Here's maybe something bigger to talk about.

1201
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,880
And this this factors into the little preview we got of this place from Gabris.

1202
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,280
Let's talk drugs. And I don't mean hot sauce.

1203
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,200
It's certainly this place would lend itself to being high as fuck.

1204
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,040
Do we think that is the optimal way to do it?

1205
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,720
Is it somehow is it somehow better that way?

1206
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,840
Do you think maybe, Mike, you're getting your like

1207
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,120
sensations are going off a little more.

1208
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,240
Maybe you're more likely to get like scared, creeped out, paranoid.

1209
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,280
If I was a little high, I would absolutely have felt that. Yes.

1210
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,160
Yeah. Certain rooms would be almost like impossible to handle.

1211
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,520
Ones that seem fairly tame, just regular.

1212
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,160
You could really flash to.

1213
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,120
Yes. If I were the tiniest bit high, this would fuck me up.

1214
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,840
Yeah, I think so. I mean, it depends.

1215
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:02,200
Yeah. What what type of a drug user you are, I suppose, if you're

1216
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,280
if you know how you are high and you like that, I think that's good to do it.

1217
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,440
You probably I don't know.

1218
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,640
There's some climbing involved.

1219
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,720
So if you get like a really high, I could see myself like falling on my face

1220
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,400
on a metal stair, which feels like it should happen once a day there.

1221
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,320
Yeah, those are some scary.

1222
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,800
Yeah, you're not seeing those in a theme park.

1223
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,320
Yeah, those are non Disney like approved.

1224
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,520
But there's also just a regular flight upstairs by the bathroom.

1225
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,320
And also there's stuff you can climb with, like,

1226
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,680
you know, step stones and a rope.

1227
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,040
I never saw that step stones like like you're kind of climbing like an incline.

1228
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,040
No, I'm not.

1229
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,240
So this online. Yeah, I haven't seen.

1230
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,400
I don't know where it was.

1231
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,920
Take those step stones away because when you fell, I don't know.

1232
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,720
There's slides, too. There's multiple slides.

1233
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,000
I didn't know that were slides.

1234
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,160
I mean, I knew what I was looking at, but I thought, oh, that's clever.

1235
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
They used pipe.

1236
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,040
They use slides to simulate big like sludge pipes.

1237
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,600
Didn't know they were practical slides.

1238
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,520
Could you open them and slide down because they look like they were closed?

1239
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,920
The ones I saw maybe they were closed.

1240
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,880
They might have been closed.

1241
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,480
Videos you can watch show like an attendant.

1242
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,200
I waterpark style.

1243
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,280
Maybe they were not.

1244
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,600
And I went, those are slides for sure.

1245
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,640
But there's they're blocked off because now we're in full adult discovery zone.

1246
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,560
I would love some slides.

1247
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,040
Do you think you think you review it like one grade higher?

1248
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,400
Yes. You go on one slide.

1249
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,280
And if I climb whatever these things Jason's talking about, if you get this

1250
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,200
climb, the step stones. Yes. Yes.

1251
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,920
I do think that Jason, I turn to you.

1252
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,920
What what condition were you in that day?

1253
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,360
Oh, stone colds.

1254
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,360
I mean, tired from the desert, just sapping any energy.

1255
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,640
OK, didn't know if you could give us any any big blunt.

1256
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,960
He's not Mr.

1257
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,200
Drugman anymore.

1258
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,160
That's not his persona.

1259
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,320
I know. I'm back.

1260
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,160
I am just right when we found the big blunt in.

1261
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,920
Now we can't. I know.

1262
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,640
Mr. Blazing Big Blunts isn't blazing big blunts.

1263
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,320
I know. Stone Cold Sober.

1264
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,400
I I we went to a dispensary after this.

1265
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,640
Oh, you did. Yeah.

1266
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,440
Just to grab a couple joints for Jane.

1267
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,480
More for Jane, less for me.

1268
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,320
I don't really like being high around people.

1269
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,720
And I certainly don't like being high, navigating stairways

1270
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,720
and crowds and secret passage.

1271
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,480
Like, I don't think I would be having a good time because you also have to like

1272
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,520
I did. There was like a get an entrance pass,

1273
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,320
which I got because I didn't have the tickets.

1274
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,400
And but they were just letting everyone in.

1275
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,920
They hadn't activated that.

1276
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,440
But there were so many signs about entrance pass to the bag check.

1277
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,120
This is just this is just to get into area 15.

1278
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,320
OK, like when we first walked up, there were signs about scan this.

1279
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,240
Get your entry pass.

1280
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,760
I think when it gets really crowded, they limit the number of people

1281
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,280
going into the whole wall.

1282
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,320
Yeah, because we didn't need that.

1283
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,640
Yeah, we need you can't let you're not be able to handle the scanning of passes.

1284
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,920
If you're if you're super blazed, let alone I don't.

1285
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,720
I mean, I can, but that's all I can do.

1286
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,800
Like I was just monofocus.

1287
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,840
So, yeah, I don't think it would be ideal.

1288
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,240
I was already spending time in area 15 trying to find.

1289
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,720
I found the answer on Yelp, trying to find the E.

1290
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:38,120
Mack and Bollio ice cream parlor, which I found out closed at some point.

1291
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,360
It is not open anymore in area.

1292
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,360
If you if you had blazed and then found out that an ice cream place had closed.

1293
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,880
Oh, that's a psychic depression.

1294
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,720
I would have just been I was already like, I guess I'll settle for a boba tea.

1295
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:57,640
Like, you know, I but yeah, drugs and then now you're Brian Wilson.

1296
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,160
Now you're in bed for three years.

1297
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,440
Yeah, I would do it.

1298
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,840
I don't I don't really.

1299
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,080
Yeah, we doesn't agree with me, but I guess I would do it before doing this again.

1300
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,440
I mean, I'm interested to know what would it unlock?

1301
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,280
What dimension with fifth dimension, the sixth dimension?

1302
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,080
I think I think the thing to do is get into area 15, eat an edible

1303
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:24,640
and then slowly make your way through a low level, really low level edible.

1304
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,680
I'm going to have to do some testing before that.

1305
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,520
There's some crack.

1306
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,920
There's a good brand of crack that are pretty good.

1307
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,920
Oh, crap. Yeah.

1308
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,200
That is what it said.

1309
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,200
There's a good brand of crack.

1310
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,360
Jason reveals on this episode that he's not doing marijuana anymore, but he is

1311
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,760
smoking crack.

1312
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,680
Oh, yeah.

1313
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,760
I'm going to crack like these barbecue crackers we like.

1314
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,520
And it's THC and CBD.

1315
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,720
Yeah. Interesting.

1316
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,800
It's really nice.

1317
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,120
It's not like a crazy concoction of Omega Mart.

1318
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,560
That's not a bizarre product you'd find on their show.

1319
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,160
So that something like that, I think, would be chill enough, you know.

1320
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,880
But you do have to.

1321
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,400
It gets very crowded.

1322
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,080
It can get very crowded in here.

1323
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,960
The nice thing is you just go to another room.

1324
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,360
I want to do it alone.

1325
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,600
I want to do it very high and alone.

1326
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
Jesus. Why? What are you?

1327
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,680
You just said that you doesn't agree with you.

1328
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,640
So you're going to be solo.

1329
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,440
Like, take a lift over there.

1330
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,440
Well, yeah, I guess you're right.

1331
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,040
And then you have to.

1332
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,760
Yeah, but I guess this is a recipe for disaster.

1333
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,960
I mean, this is like now you live there.

1334
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,200
Now you spent like you just like hide in the locker room.

1335
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,440
I spend the night.

1336
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,000
If somebody from Omega Mart is listening and they want me to come there,

1337
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,400
I will do two hours alone.

1338
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,320
I will. I will do all the puzzles.

1339
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,200
I will collect all the things or I'll boop and my heart to my heart.

1340
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,680
Your your offer is to be given free admission, which you will not share.

1341
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,400
OK, you will. You will pay.

1342
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,600
But you must have not buying it out, though.

1343
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,120
You're generous. No, no, no.

1344
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:00,440
Yes, your generous offer is to do it by yourself for an unaccompanied two hours.

1345
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,640
Do you like now? Wolf, are you listening?

1346
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,920
Yes. Are you listening?

1347
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,480
Well, we're going to unpay while this so they can hear it.

1348
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,280
This feels like trying to play a game on expert.

1349
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,760
Do you like to be high in public? No.

1350
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,080
Oh, yeah, I don't. I don't either.

1351
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,440
I unless it's a movie, if it's like going into a movie, like I agree.

1352
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,000
I had a great time taking a weed blueberry and then going to see Book Club.

1353
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,720
That was a great alone.

1354
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,080
I'll say now that you're now that we're thinking about this.

1355
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,720
And the reason I answer so quickly is because I've literally like

1356
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,560
experienced this like eight times in my life, maybe maybe a little more or a little less.

1357
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,280
Here's actually what I'm thinking.

1358
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,760
I actually think I can function a little bit better high

1359
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,960
in public or doing things than I can alone, because I actually think I get weirder

1360
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,880
if I'm not doing anything, because I've said this before, like if I'm alone

1361
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,280
in that and like I'm a little high, I will find myself sort of just in a stress

1362
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,120
position in the corner of the room, like charging my phone.

1363
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,640
Like I remember the one of the last times I did it.

1364
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,560
I remember just going, you're like crouched in an area of the house.

1365
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,880
Just like relax and go over to the couch.

1366
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,680
And like I keep consciously saying, relax, relax.

1367
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,200
Like this is this is fine.

1368
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:17,000
And I think I think almost being in public makes me

1369
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,120
forces me not to be like that.

1370
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,200
So I think maybe it would be better if I was alone in Omega Mart.

1371
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,440
Wait a minute. But you just said alone is bad.

1372
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:30,560
How is alone in the scariest place ever when you're high?

1373
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,280
OK, my apartment, although maybe you would find me crouched by a big art

1374
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,480
installation with my phone plugged in somehow.

1375
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,520
You're in it. You're you're just in a place where scary announcements are made

1376
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,680
and unsettling ambient music is playing nonstop.

1377
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,480
And and there's creepy stairwells.

1378
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,320
Yeah, this seems like a recipe for success.

1379
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,680
I do the X. I may throw up the X and they'd have to come pull me out or something.

1380
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,400
It sounds like you need a buddy.

1381
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,480
Like it sounds like you need someone sitting at the bar in area 15,

1382
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,000
like fiddling with their phone, waiting for your who is giving me tips.

1383
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,600
Like if you are like a Luther for Mission Impossible, who's kind of good.

1384
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,800
Yeah. Yeah. Like a man in a chair.

1385
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,960
Like I think sometimes when people do psychedelics, there's someone

1386
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,240
there sober just to watch them, just to guide them.

1387
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,760
And it sounds like that's what you need for your Omega Mart experience.

1388
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,200
Well, there will be employees, though, in there will be employees.

1389
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,040
They're still there.

1390
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,360
So like I can interact with them because I did see a few people

1391
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,440
interacting with the employees and the employees are not doing like a big

1392
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,160
performance, but they will in character give information.

1393
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,560
Yeah. So when you like crawl up to one on your knees and say,

1394
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,440
is there a corner where I could plug my phone in?

1395
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,360
I need to charge. It's not charged.

1396
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,960
I think they are a character.

1397
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,440
They'll answer in character, like help people out.

1398
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,440
But you can be a little weird about it.

1399
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,560
You know, you can be a little weird who I can be employees.

1400
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,720
I'm saying I think the employees are encouraged, like be helpful, help people out.

1401
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,800
But you know, weird.

1402
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,040
Here's a question.

1403
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,960
And we'll go back to that.

1404
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,880
My scenario that will come true eventually, I hope about being alone and high.

1405
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,720
Your exclusive guided tour.

1406
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,040
Mike's Mike's ideal high sounds like taking two puffs off a joint

1407
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:21,240
and immediately walking into the chill out tent, like being fully prepared to like

1408
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,920
to calm down, you know, maybe I just once every, you know, couple of years,

1409
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,320
somebody goes, oh, you're doing the wrong thing, man.

1410
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,960
You're not doing it right here.

1411
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,400
Let me give you these mints.

1412
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,840
And I go, OK.

1413
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,360
And then I try the mint and five minutes later, 10 minutes later,

1414
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,400
I'm in the corner charging my phone.

1415
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,600
I think my friend, my

1416
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,920
my tails in this neck of the woods are identical to yours.

1417
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah. And I just I turned a corner a number of years ago where I was like,

1418
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,360
I have to put up the white flag.

1419
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,120
This is not for me. Yeah.

1420
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,600
I want it to be for me very much.

1421
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,520
But what is this doing for me that white wine isn't going to do?

1422
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,400
That is my weed. Yeah.

1423
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,560
I think I think there's no shame in it.

1424
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,880
I think if I don't if it's if it's a number of false starts

1425
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,960
and it's dependent on I don't and may again,

1426
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:21,120
maybe the elusive barbecue cracker might be the maybe the crackers of the key.

1427
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,600
But if not that I think you try crackers and if not that you quit the whole deal

1428
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,120
and you do it with pride, it doesn't matter.

1429
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,320
It is not puts you to sleep.

1430
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,560
You know, worse case that's the out.

1431
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,560
Well, I like that. I would like to go to sleep.

1432
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,200
But here, let me ask you this, Jason.

1433
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,000
Yeah, we've talked about this before when we did the delirium, the blue blade.

1434
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,160
Yeah. Tried to interact with the performers in a way they were not comfortable with

1435
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,840
by like doing your own dialogue.

1436
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,000
Make me sound like a sleazebag.

1437
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,440
No, no, you weren't being appropriate.

1438
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,040
You were just saying I was trying to answer it.

1439
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,960
It sounds like the like the guy is like, oh, hello, Cinderella.

1440
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,600
Well, well, can I be a prince charming?

1441
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,720
This was not. Yeah.

1442
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,920
Hey, Nazi lady. Good to see you.

1443
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,120
I don't agree with everything, but I agree with those eyes.

1444
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,400
I think I can fix you.

1445
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,280
I think I can denazify you. Yeah.

1446
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,000
What? What is your question?

1447
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,360
My question is.

1448
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,800
And then your original question we'll get back to.

1449
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't remember my.

1450
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,120
Yeah, well, I was just going to say, because these performers,

1451
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,440
they're the people that were working there, weren't doing like big monologues,

1452
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,520
but they were in character.

1453
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,880
Did you do any banter with any employees trying to be in character?

1454
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,960
I asked one of them, do they know where the ice cream parlor is?

1455
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,600
They said, I don't really know what's out there.

1456
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,400
I like. And I. In Omega Mart.

1457
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,000
In Omega Mart.

1458
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,040
But they were in the character of the world.

1459
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,640
Well, I didn't know how in character.

1460
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,040
I only been in there for like 20 minutes to that point.

1461
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,920
You didn't realize. On your way.

1462
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,440
You were still starting the experience.

1463
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,280
No, we were upstairs in a little like hang out nook.

1464
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,880
There was a couple of screens.

1465
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,160
But you would you had done some of the trippy things

1466
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,160
and you were in a trippy alternate dimension.

1467
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,600
I wasn't. You wait a minute.

1468
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,400
Let me finish. OK.

1469
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,800
You ask, where is the actual ice cream place outside of this?

1470
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,440
You are deep and you're supposed to be immersed.

1471
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,680
And then like it's bizarre fake food.

1472
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,760
And they're like, but what about real ice cream for my tummy?

1473
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,040
This person was mostly opening a door that led from a stairway.

1474
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,200
And they were just making sure people didn't get like.

1475
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,640
But they had their lab coat on.

1476
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,120
They still had like a lab coat, like an Omega Mart lab coat.

1477
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,040
I don't they had the Omega Mart like apron on like everyone else.

1478
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,400
OK, like some people like a lab coat, some people more of an apron on.

1479
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,960
Yeah. So it's like if I were to go into Disneyland and I met like Bell

1480
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,920
and I said, Bill, hey, where's the wind?

1481
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,960
No, I didn't even harbor.

1482
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,360
I hadn't interacted with any employees.

1483
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,640
I didn't know they were doing a bit yet.

1484
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,600
I thought she was so focused on like letting people in and out of this door.

1485
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,000
I didn't. I just adore Jockey.

1486
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,120
She can tell me where the ice cream is.

1487
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,880
If I went to Universal and I asked Lucille Ball, I asked her where the nearest Landry's.

1488
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,040
Also, I didn't know if that answer was like, I don't know what's going on

1489
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,560
in the outside world or like, I really don't know this place that well outside.

1490
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,880
And so they said, I don't know.

1491
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,800
But they could have been in character saying they don't know.

1492
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,000
It is entirely possible. Yeah. Interesting.

1493
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,840
Well, that's something we need to do in the second time, too, is see

1494
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,560
how much they know about the outside world.

1495
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:33,160
So ask if they know where the Wendy's is in the nearest when he's a White Castle

1496
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,920
in Vegas next time to see what the reality is outside of the Mart.

1497
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,040
Do you know how far along the water burger they're going to build next to the Waldorf

1498
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,560
Astoria? Who knows that?

1499
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,720
I don't know. I just it's just breaking.

1500
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,280
I just learned about it recently.

1501
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
They're getting a water burger on the strip.

1502
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,440
Well, I'm very excited about that.

1503
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,520
I'm just saying that's where the Wendy's is.

1504
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
More people might know.

1505
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,760
What is Tillman for Tito's project?

1506
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,280
And how is the for Tito project coming along?

1507
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,160
I think I think any run of the mill person obviously can answer that question.

1508
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,200
Yeah, it does.

1509
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,200
I feel like we've encountered that the public is absolutely is aware of Tillman

1510
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,120
for doing the three.

1511
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
Yeah.

1512
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,240
Well, look, it's all we're saying.

1513
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,920
You customize your experience.

1514
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,280
You do it. However, you go into whatever room you want.

1515
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,080
And if you want to 20 minutes in, ask where the ice cream's at.

1516
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,440
You can do that.

1517
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,800
That you did a mega mart your way.

1518
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,160
I love it.

1519
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,680
And I did you do it in like a 50s voice or anything?

1520
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,600
No, no, I was just more curious because I hadn't seen it.

1521
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,080
We had kind of done a lap ran into Evo's bathroom.

1522
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,160
And then I was like, oh, I didn't see the ice.

1523
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,600
All the rocket phase. I didn't see the ice cream.

1524
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,760
Let's quickly talk about the rocket phase.

1525
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,200
You went to the rocket phase.

1526
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,920
There was a rocket phase in the whole facility.

1527
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,400
It's not part of Omega Mart.

1528
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,800
And in case in case some crazy person doesn't know what a rocket

1529
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,840
fizz is, of course, I was going to explain.

1530
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,440
Rocket fizz used to be in Burbank, and it was a place where you could get

1531
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,520
a bunch of fun sodas and bottles or fun candies.

1532
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,720
And they had a bigger selection of candies, some from other countries,

1533
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,720
just some retro candy.

1534
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah, some things you don't necessarily see in a CVS or you couldn't

1535
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,440
get for free with a three or four dollar coupon, which I, by the way,

1536
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,480
have been getting three dollar coupons lately from.

1537
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,680
I've been getting three dollar coupons, too, and they're very inconsistent.

1538
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,880
It's a draw.

1539
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,600
Yeah. So no one's winning tonight.

1540
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,200
No one wins tonight.

1541
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,680
Although I haven't checked actually what I got a couple of days ago.

1542
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,840
That rocket fizz.

1543
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,880
So I saw a rocket. Oh, shit.

1544
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,120
Rocket fizz. I haven't been in a rocket fizz in a while.

1545
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,680
I went over there.

1546
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,760
Too tiny. Not a great selection.

1547
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,040
It's really small. Yeah.

1548
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,720
And I was really let down.

1549
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,320
So this was definitely the low point of the whole experience was that

1550
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,160
this was a small like satellite location rocket phase,

1551
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:53,480
almost like an airport kiosk rocket to rocket.

1552
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,560
Right. Exactly. Like Chili's too. Yes.

1553
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,680
So that's that's a true negative.

1554
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,520
Everything else I'm saying is sort of nitpicky or like just things

1555
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,640
I was kind of wishing for.

1556
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,920
But this one, I was like area 50, the area 15 organizers should be ashamed

1557
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,960
of the subpar rocket fizz. Yeah, because rocket fizz to me is

1558
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,040
is about possibilities, is about endless possibilities.

1559
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,640
And this rocket fizz is about a very finite amount of choices.

1560
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,240
And why even try?

1561
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,920
Why even I got the name soda?

1562
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,240
I got a bottle of grape soda.

1563
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,760
And it's and now I still gave I still give money to your business.

1564
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,280
But I spit on the general idea of you not alone.

1565
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,960
Yeah, I didn't spit on your floor.

1566
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,080
Hardworking people have to clean that if I didn't want to add to the mess.

1567
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,920
But it's theoretically, hypothetically, metaphorically,

1568
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,920
I spit on the idea of your store.

1569
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,120
So I was I don't know.

1570
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,840
Jason went and obviously he felt the same way,

1571
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,480
but he wasn't quite as upset as I was, I guess,

1572
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,080
because he was thinking about ice cream and he wasn't worried about the candy.

1573
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah, no. I hadn't had any food that day either. So.

1574
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,880
Oh, wait, you had food at all that day.

1575
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,800
The full stump of the room.

1576
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm just trying to go.

1577
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,840
You hadn't had food at all that day.

1578
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,080
So you started off with a grape soda.

1579
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,480
Sure, Vegas, baby. OK.

1580
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,280
Yeah, who I don't even recognize Vegas, Mike.

1581
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,920
100 percent different than regular Mike.

1582
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,920
Yeah. My first meal a day is a grape soda from a bottle.

1583
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,320
Delicious grape soda, by the way,

1584
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,880
which they don't have at the Vegas White Castle I went to.

1585
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,200
That's a like a White Castle tradition is getting grape soda,

1586
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,280
which is very rarely carried at fast food places.

1587
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,640
Now it is with free Coke freestyle machines.

1588
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,280
But in general, you're not getting grape soda at McDonald's.

1589
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,040
You're not getting grape soda Burger King.

1590
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,240
But White Castle always would have it and at least has it in the Midwest.

1591
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,360
And that was a shock to me because I had I asked,

1592
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,560
even though I didn't see it on the menu, I asked.

1593
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,240
And they said they don't have it.

1594
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,880
And that was really like that started the trip off on a bomber,

1595
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,480
even though I then drove to the sphere and I felt better

1596
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,280
because I saw the sphere.

1597
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:01,880
When you when you were saying all that, I like a cartoon like turning you into it.

1598
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,760
I was hungry and turning you into a big chicken leg.

1599
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,160
I just I just turned you into Andy Rooney.

1600
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,840
You just fully. Yeah.

1601
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,440
The voice went up.

1602
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,640
You you you lost a foot or so.

1603
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1604
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
I honestly even lost me for a second.

1605
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,080
I was like, what is it talking about?

1606
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,640
The White Castle experience, grape soda, White Castle experience.

1607
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,040
This is an experience.

1608
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,440
This is a a themed experience for one.

1609
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,400
And it's the one person who's talking about it knows what I'm talking about.

1610
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,200
So again, again, White Castle head like I am.

1611
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,840
This came up a little bit in the live show, which a lot of listeners have not heard yet.

1612
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,320
But so your first night in Vegas, you were in Las Vegas.

1613
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,280
You are single.

1614
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,640
You are hot to trot.

1615
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,160
I'm not. You are not not.

1616
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,440
No, no. Yeah. You're you're flying solo.

1617
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,520
Yeah. I haven't haven't been in a long time.

1618
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,400
But I know, kid, none of the, you know,

1619
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,040
none of the responsibilities that come with that.

1620
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,200
All right. What do we do?

1621
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,040
But what's my hangover weekend?

1622
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,880
Ultimate Vegas fantasy going to be?

1623
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,240
Drive to a White Castle.

1624
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,800
Get upset about soda selection.

1625
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:11,640
Then stare at a concert venue that is not open yet.

1626
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,400
You got to go to bed.

1627
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,120
You got to think, though, also, what I'm what's happening, too,

1628
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,200
is I'm driving straight from San Diego Comic Con.

1629
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,880
Sitting shotgun are my Ninja Turtles three figures

1630
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,680
and my Keno from Secret of the U is our Arieas Junior figure as well.

1631
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,200
So I got them right there.

1632
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,360
I'm excited about them.

1633
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:32,080
I don't think this applies to the drive, but did that help you in a carpool lane?

1634
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,760
They're not.

1635
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,560
They're only like one 12th scale.

1636
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,000
So it wasn't going to pass for if you got pulled over,

1637
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,640
the highway patrolman would take out a tape measure and measure their size.

1638
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,160
That happens. Yeah. Maybe full size.

1639
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:47,960
They were a quarter.

1640
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,920
Maybe my size, Barbie, but not it was quarter scale.

1641
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,000
It was hot toy size, one sixth scale.

1642
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,200
At least the detail on those are human features.

1643
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,480
So I understand why you thought you could get away with this.

1644
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,840
But these are one 12th.

1645
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,440
These you can't really spot there.

1646
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,760
They're the features from a police cam.

1647
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,760
So unfortunately, I'm happy to give you a ticket.

1648
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,600
If I pull you over again and you aren't and riding shotgun is not the real Ernie

1649
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,280
Reyes Jr., then I'm afraid that's jail for you.

1650
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,160
Yeah, he comes with his scooter, too, which is also a quarter.

1651
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,320
Excuse me, a 12th scale or 10th scale.

1652
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,040
I forget. So, yeah, so that's I went to White Castle.

1653
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,120
It took forever.

1654
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,560
At one point, an ambulance with its lights on blocked us all

1655
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:34,040
in in the drive through, which was a little intense, I will say.

1656
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,120
But the White Castle was taking completely forever.

1657
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,640
So it was that was it was it was it somebody

1658
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,440
going to rescue somebody who had had one bite of White Castle?

1659
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,720
If it was their first time, yes, because they haven't been vaccinated

1660
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,240
like I have at a young age.

1661
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,520
They haven't had theirs.

1662
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,160
Their intestines lined yet. Yeah.

1663
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,280
I was with onion goo. Right.

1664
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,800
When I was one years old, I had my round of three shots.

1665
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,200
And I was my inoculations for White Castle.

1666
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,840
So now my body understands it and accepts it with no problem.

1667
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,640
No weird bowel movement at all.

1668
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,200
You know, no problem.

1669
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,040
I have a feeling that would I think I mean, any fast food

1670
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,800
folks me up at this point, but I think why then White Castle would be a

1671
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,800
I think it'd be a blowout.

1672
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,760
I think you I think you got organs on the outside of my head.

1673
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,000
It one time when I didn't my body did not know what to make.

1674
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:29,840
I didn't grow up with it.

1675
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,680
So I had it in Tennessee and it really I just it like

1676
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,840
I don't it was like eating a newspaper to me.

1677
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,160
It didn't make any sense.

1678
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,440
And you have a view of I given you the freezer ones.

1679
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,680
I think I don't know if you've given them to me.

1680
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,200
I think I've had the freezer ones before.

1681
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,000
I've never had the restaurant.

1682
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,240
Yeah, the freezer ones are almost entirely accurate.

1683
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,880
They're almost the exact same.

1684
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,880
So you had the holes in the in the patties.

1685
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,080
I think so. OK.

1686
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,920
They steam the steam the patties.

1687
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,840
That's the difference. That's kind of their thing.

1688
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,400
You both really love turning to me and saying that you like the look

1689
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,360
Scott in the eye.

1690
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,680
It's a it's a go to Mark Summers unwrapped.

1691
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,240
I feel like so like a go to Food Network show.

1692
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,560
Steamed. Yeah, that's why they kind of are weird and soggy.

1693
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,600
Is that they're steamed and they go on top.

1694
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1695
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,000
The actual steamed is that is it onions and then the patty

1696
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,600
and then the buns are on top and then they open the bun and put everything in.

1697
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,400
Is that right?

1698
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,960
I actually don't know the order of there's a pickle, there's onions.

1699
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,120
And then if you want the cheese.

1700
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,000
Oh, I mean, prep when they need to.

1701
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,760
There needs to we need to find like a hot drink style.

1702
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:40,760
Rap. Yeah.

1703
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,120
We have many employees out there.

1704
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,600
What the proper order is.

1705
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,360
Yeah. So, yeah, no, I did that Friday night,

1706
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,680
but I was tired from the long drive and I was already it was hot, you know,

1707
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,960
and I was I was conserving my energy to to entertain the people the next night.

1708
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,120
I wanted to bring the energy to suppress your grape soda rage or else it would.

1709
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,080
Yes, but I would get it a rocket fizz, but in a disappointing way.

1710
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,840
That's not a good weekend for grape soda.

1711
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,520
Yeah. What's like big stuff about this that we need to mention

1712
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,440
before we move on from this?

1713
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:19,600
There is there are 750 minutes of original music in the whole thing done

1714
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,000
by so many different composers.

1715
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,720
And I had no idea until after we did it.

1716
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,560
Brian Eno, there's Brian music in this thing.

1717
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,880
In the room, I thought was incredible.

1718
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,360
The I saw it just called the projection room or the it's like projected.

1719
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,960
Like it's it's projections on Ra.

1720
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,720
It's like a canyon.

1721
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1722
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,560
So with the with the Gulch,

1723
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,360
essentially like one of the particularly coolest areas.

1724
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,360
Yes. Apparently what a cool person to reach out to.

1725
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,280
Very cool. Beach House did music for one of my other favorite.

1726
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,640
I really like the it's like pink and purple triangles.

1727
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,000
Yes. Very Epcotty.

1728
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,480
It's very spaceship earthy.

1729
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,240
And I thought the music was cool and the music was was Beach House.

1730
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,120
And one thing that I was kind of alluding to this at the beginning,

1731
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,520
but I really I really like how,

1732
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,680
you know, you talk about transitions in theme park

1733
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,360
world and going from land to land or room to room.

1734
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,000
And it's all like cacophonous.

1735
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,640
But it but the fact that it's it is also ambient and

1736
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,800
like you just never feel like a hard boy.

1737
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,880
I walked through that tunnel or out that door and it just that seemed like harsh

1738
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,080
and those things didn't match it like all.

1739
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,560
Yeah, yeah.

1740
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,600
Like if you do it over the course of an hour or more, it's it does.

1741
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:43,720
Like one big walkthrough just feels like one full long piece

1742
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,000
that makes sense, even though there's tons of different aesthetics

1743
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,280
all happening at the same time.

1744
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,840
There's a lot of like invisible stuff or not so invisible stuff

1745
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:57,120
going on to like ease you into different areas that you probably just take for

1746
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:01,400
like they're there to make you take it for granted that you're being transitioned

1747
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,920
into like a pretty different.

1748
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,280
Yeah, I'd be very interested to see like the

1749
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,880
operations side of like running all this.

1750
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,480
Like what's the manual for turning all this stuff on at the beginning of the day?

1751
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,280
You know, really, it's so many different components.

1752
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,960
And I yeah, I the making of it, it's almost impossible to

1753
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,440
wrap your head around.

1754
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,120
And the fact that everything is kind of done, like there are just lots of tours

1755
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,480
within all of these pieces.

1756
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,600
So how do you begin?

1757
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,280
How do you figure out this layout to make sure everybody's got their space

1758
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,920
and it all makes sense together and there's a flow to it?

1759
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,040
And just a big empty canvas.

1760
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,040
How do you begin to tackle that and figure it out?

1761
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,840
And some stuff I think is still being worked on.

1762
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,680
Like some stuff like the story stuff, I don't know that there's.

1763
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,920
I feel like Eva was alluding to like there might not be an ending yet.

1764
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,800
Oh, sure. Right. Yeah.

1765
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,920
That's what I was on. Like I was looking at reddits.

1766
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,960
There's a closed Reddit to like spoilers for this basically.

1767
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,960
But like I had to sign up to get in there.

1768
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,200
Oh, I didn't do it.

1769
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,520
So but then also people would be like, yeah, they're like still like

1770
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,560
they don't know what the ending is.

1771
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,960
And we've sort of said that we haven't really talked about the story

1772
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,720
not that it's even that important to like your experience.

1773
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,760
Yeah. But it's like, yeah, like a evil.

1774
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:29,080
Walton's essentially like Walmart family, the Dram family, the family.

1775
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:33,160
And like the father goes missing and the daughter takes over

1776
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:38,320
and she seems pretty possessed and she's like experimenting on people.

1777
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,960
And there's aliens and robots.

1778
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,080
And it's a big capitalism thing.

1779
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,440
It's a whole I mean, I don't want to say it

1780
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:50,120
in a too dismissive of a way because like it's really well done.

1781
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,360
But you are like, oh, I get it.

1782
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:56,720
It's this is like a evil life force that's sitting behind a corporate chain.

1783
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,680
A friendly for public face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1784
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,120
And that that like I was worried that it was going to feel surface like.

1785
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,120
Yes, I was too. Yeah.

1786
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,920
Initially, like in the store part,

1787
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,080
because I was so many of what comes like, you know, transcends that.

1788
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,920
Yeah, yeah, because everything is so well done that it's like, yeah,

1789
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,000
I get it, but good, fine. Mm hmm.

1790
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,800
Which happens sometimes.

1791
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,040
Like I've said this, is it the third season of The Boys or second season

1792
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,800
of the show, The Boys and like Homelander is like the crazy, evil superhero.

1793
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,840
And man, is it like one to one Trump?

1794
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,600
OK, like it's just Trump.

1795
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,280
And you're like, I've seen this before.

1796
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,760
But then you're like shows really good, though.

1797
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,480
Like that happens sometimes where I'm like, yes, this is very obvious

1798
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,680
what this is, but you are doing a really great job.

1799
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,160
So it's fine.

1800
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,080
We all know when we've seen something, you go, oh, it's this.

1801
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,080
Yeah, it's one to one or it's.

1802
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,200
And you would say the same or you'd say the same thing about any other

1803
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:59,000
villain who is alluding to Trump over the many great villains we've.

1804
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,080
Oh, I see the fictional characters, you mean that are basically just doing Trump.

1805
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,560
What a great time for art.

1806
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,640
Everything they said and punk rock at all.

1807
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,080
Yeah, all came true.

1808
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,680
Punk rock is Green Day release a new album.

1809
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:18,280
Speaking of dying, dying to know a little bit of Trump stuff.

1810
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,240
What do you think about Trump?

1811
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,880
I'm sure that'll be maybe next.

1812
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,120
They don't like him, do they?

1813
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,200
I think they don't like him.

1814
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,840
I think they did release one a couple of years ago,

1815
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,000
but I don't think it's as politically charged.

1816
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,840
I can't remember. Well, then when they're new, when their new piece,

1817
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,480
American greed, my stir drops.

1818
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,720
Maybe that'll maybe that'll finally fuck up his 2024 chances.

1819
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,880
I think it will. They should do a DeSantis song.

1820
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,320
So, yeah, so so it's this story and like, I don't.

1821
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,840
Yeah, I don't know if you guys there's anything else you need to talk about with it,

1822
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,720
but it's like it's you get at least the broad strokes of it

1823
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,200
versus actually knowing like detail plot by plot, which you can find if you boop enough

1824
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,680
and you go to all the stations and then if you look at redhead

1825
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,560
and then go back and boot to the stations, then I think you can get an actual

1826
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,640
like kind of linear story of what happens with the family

1827
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,760
and what the actual mystery and the alien stuff.

1828
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,680
But I don't know that there's anything we were talking about before this,

1829
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,800
where you were saying like, you want to spoil and I was like,

1830
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,960
I don't know that there's anything like so like crazy.

1831
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,560
I don't know. There's like not like a Luke.

1832
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,560
I'm your father moment in this area other than just like, oh, it was

1833
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:34,920
the aliens from Saturn or something like, you know, just go in one of the doors.

1834
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,320
Yeah, I shudder to think if somehow you didn't know if you missed that

1835
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,920
and we're just like, oh, why did I pay sixty five dollars for a store? Yeah.

1836
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,200
Yeah. It's a silly store, but still there.

1837
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,520
I think at this point, there's been so there's so many fake commercial.

1838
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,960
There's a Willie Nelson fake commercial. Yes.

1839
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,000
But I feel like in terms of spoilers,

1840
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,920
I think just the visual like marketing and like the pictures that have been released,

1841
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,040
like, oh, yeah, there's a bunch of other rooms like that.

1842
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,680
Yeah, you gotta find them.

1843
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,160
But it's it's really not I I like that it wasn't super difficult

1844
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,880
to like, sure. Yeah.

1845
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,520
What do we have to figure this out?

1846
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,800
And then like Jane and I went through the freezer,

1847
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,680
the drink freezer, and I thought that was just a little ice cream.

1848
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,920
Or was that just because you know, no, just by going,

1849
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,840
I just saw people coming in and out of it.

1850
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,160
And I thought, oh, maybe this is a little room because I and then that opened up

1851
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,920
into everything. I was like, oh, this is the psychedelic stuff.

1852
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,720
I went into like the server room first, which is over towards the right of that.

1853
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,680
Oh, OK. I thought that was a good way to start because it kind of just

1854
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,240
it gives you like nefariousness.

1855
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,160
Yeah. There was the nice, friendly store.

1856
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,120
But now this is very creepy and, you know, sort of like a 70s,

1857
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:56,600
like, you know, it feels like it's like a 70s CIA office.

1858
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,720
But then like to it, I feel like I got to do it in backwards or like it

1860
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:07,960
the way just the path I took, it got bigger, trippier, more surreal as I went.

1861
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,400
Right. I feel like I might have been disappointed if I ended in creepy computer room.

1862
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,800
Yeah, there's a tip.

1863
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,440
Go look for that that is a T-shirt way to go up is maybe a good way to do it.

1864
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:22,480
You know, it's actually more important than even I think than the boxes being so funny

1865
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:27,840
or anything is just the sheer amount of detail of work and detail.

1866
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,160
Doesn't even matter if everything's that funny or interesting or good.

1867
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:37,240
Like if you read it, it just matters that you look at things and go work went into it.

1868
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,440
Yeah, that's actually so much more graphic design.

1869
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,120
Or really realistic.

1870
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,080
Like if you squint, it seems like real products that like Tokyo Disney.

1871
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:51,760
See, that's like everywhere you look, you go, there's some somebody wrote a little blurb here.

1872
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,600
You don't even need to read it.

1873
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,680
You just know that that's a written thing.

1874
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,960
You feel it when you're walking around, which I think is sort of the.

1875
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,520
The big thing with Omega Mart is just that you can feel it.

1876
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,520
You can feel the sheer amount of work.

1877
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,240
Yeah, that's in there.

1878
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,640
And people like, yeah, passion projects left and right.

1879
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,680
So many of them.

1880
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:17,080
Yes. So it's like that ultimately is like the star of it is just the effort.

1881
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,040
Yeah. Yeah. All of it.

1882
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,960
Worse is like, oh, is the story like so amazing?

1883
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,640
Sure. Or is it something that's like because like some

1884
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,720
some of the stuff without all that like context, a couple of the things

1885
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,080
where you climb up, like there's a third.

1886
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,880
Did you climb to the third level?

1887
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,160
I missed it until the very end.

1888
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,560
Oh, I don't even know if I did to climb up kind of a catwalk.

1889
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1890
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,640
Small area. Yeah.

1891
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,840
But you go up there and really all it was was like you hit a button

1892
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,280
and like a beat starts and you hit another button and like, oh, you're playing

1893
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,360
like a little synth.

1894
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,560
And I'm like, this is like a children's museum.

1895
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:53,360
This is like a fun little thing to do it like a kids museum or whatever.

1896
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,480
Did you play the musical like laser beams?

1897
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,080
Yeah, a little bit like the red lasers.

1898
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,320
Yeah.

1899
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,920
And the one thing like a kid science museum or something.

1900
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,640
Yes. But you're like the effort around everything else, obviously, lifts

1901
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,880
all of that. But that kind of has like a weird ambient noise in the room

1902
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,920
where I was like, am I going to do something if I touch and it's like,

1903
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,520
oh, it's playing music.

1904
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,680
Yes. And maybe there is.

1905
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,480
I'm sure there's something I missed or you.

1906
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,520
But it wasn't. I don't think if you like played the right thing and unlocked

1907
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,280
like a clown alien that came out of the ground.

1908
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:29,560
Yeah. But yeah, look, I liked it.

1909
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,840
I like it. It's cool.

1910
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,960
And I think a lot. Yeah.

1911
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,960
Like I think it fits this.

1912
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,760
It fills a void.

1913
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,480
Love Vegas and was really excited to be back.

1914
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,160
I think there's certain windows you have where like,

1915
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,680
all right, I don't I am like wiped from last night.

1916
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:52,560
I don't I want to do something that isn't a lavish, crazy meal.

1917
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,280
Yeah. Or getting drunk or what or gambling.

1918
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,680
I want to just do something weird.

1919
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:03,600
This definitely like fills that void and all the very 15, I think, fills that void.

1920
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,760
Yeah. Very nicely.

1921
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,600
Just a thing to do that you can't do back in L.A.

1922
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,520
or wherever you're from.

1923
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:12,240
There's a lot down in the arts district, too, that I've never even said,

1924
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:16,840
like microbreweries, pizza places like there is there's like a motel

1925
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:21,560
that was restored and like like cleaned up.

1926
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,760
But it's not a motel.

1927
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,840
It's like every room is a different little boutique.

1928
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,640
That's cool. Like there's there's all this cool,

1929
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,000
weird stuff in different parts of Vegas off the strip.

1930
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,920
I think we did this at the wrong time of day also,

1931
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,600
because we did it like it was still 11.

1932
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,960
It wasn't like we woke up so early for it.

1933
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,320
But we did the show the night before.

1934
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:46,280
And I was definitely like a little tired. Yeah.

1935
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:50,560
I kind of feel like maybe if you have a couple of cocktails

1936
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,400
and you do it at like three or four, like right before dinner.

1937
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,320
Yeah, that might be the optimum time to do it.

1938
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,160
You got a little more energy.

1939
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,600
I think you're maybe feeling crowded.

1940
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,080
I believe that's probably that's the idea.

1941
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,000
And then you go all that and then you have like a meal after that.

1942
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,600
I feel like that's especially because also the bar and the bars a little hidden.

1943
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,360
And now they even knew about that.

1944
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,320
Datamosh is the name of it.

1945
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:15,720
And it's all all the drinks are made of like

1946
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,440
like cleaning materials.

1947
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,440
That's the idea. That's the theme of it.

1948
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,760
So she she gets a drink made in front of her where it looks like it's being sprayed

1949
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,400
by just like, you know, some like soap bottle.

1950
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:33,680
But and then a huge bubble is laid on top of it that grew so tall.

1951
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,160
It was the craziest science experiment.

1952
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,880
And then it burst and then smoke came out of it.

1953
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,440
I'm a sucker for little Donald mixology shows like that.

1954
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,320
So bar seemed super cool.

1955
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,480
I just wasn't I wasn't ready to drink yet.

1956
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,280
So you're right. There might be like a

1957
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,480
yeah, I think you may be.

1958
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,400
Yeah, you knock a few back.

1959
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,360
You get a couple of barbecue crackers if you feel so.

1960
01:37:59,240 --> 01:37:59,960
But I think you got.

1961
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,360
Yeah, I think you go into the night like kind of juiced up a little more than

1962
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,520
because like you just did analyzing the experience and sure.

1963
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,800
I have a big meal and then you go and you go to a douchey night pool party or

1964
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,680
something. Practically, I'll say this.

1965
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:18,600
We Scott, you're right to buy the tickets online in advance

1966
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,320
because there's one line to buy tickets and you have to wait to get it.

1967
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:26,920
So you want to skip a line to wait in by your ticket advance.

1968
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,400
Sure. And then you just go right up.

1969
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,520
And they're not they're not too strict on the start times.

1970
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:38,080
Yeah, I do think we missed something in area 15, though.

1971
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,280
And maybe this is for the next time we go.

1972
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,720
This this was, you know, when we threw it out like, hey, we haven't locked

1973
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,960
all of our Vegas topics.

1974
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,200
What would you like to hear about?

1975
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:54,120
Friend of the show Bugmane Buzz Buzz posted the phrase Smokers

1976
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,640
Pokus. Oh, no.

1977
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:00,160
And I wanted to I was like, what's up with Smokers Pokus?

1978
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,840
Something made up. Is that a joke?

1979
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,040
No, Smokers Pokus is a thing in in that area.

1980
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,760
Here is a cool high rabbit coming out of a hat.

1981
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,560
Oh, no. Is it a big blunt?

1982
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,640
Oh, is that a lounge? Is it smoking?

1983
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,360
No, no, no, no, my friend.

1984
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:17,840
Oh, OK.

1985
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,120
Hope. Think about the phrase that it's alluding to.

1986
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,000
This is a high magic show is what this is.

1987
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,520
I wanted to see that now that you say it, I want to see that.

1988
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,600
The oh no is because you didn't get to do it.

1989
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,560
I thought your own was because it exists.

1990
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,600
No, I like that.

1991
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,200
I showed you the bunny and you said, oh, no.

1992
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,000
Oh, bad that we didn't see it.

1993
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,720
Well, yeah, it could have been a night of dank debauchery,

1994
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,840
a spectacle packed with tokes, jokes and tricks.

1995
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,440
This couple of those rhymes.

1996
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,520
Another last one.

1997
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,320
Jars of Bud will appear.

1998
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:53,080
Lighters will come to life and bongs will bend reality.

1999
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,600
I mean, oh, man.

2000
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,840
Yeah. Yeah. Well, hey, fuck this up.

2001
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,080
Bug tried to tell us.

2002
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,400
I don't know.

2003
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,280
But he in the show.

2004
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,520
Yeah, he's been doing a residency.

2005
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,640
Oh, he's got a resident in house in house rapper for Smokers Pokus.

2006
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,280
Well, yeah. Hey, next time around.

2007
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,000
If we if we're staying on this thing or hey, you're going back, maybe a pregame.

2008
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,600
Oh, yeah, maybe you two with a little smoke is focused.

2009
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,760
Yeah. Then see how that sphere hits you.

2010
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,320
So see. Yeah.

2011
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,200
Jason, what do you think?

2012
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,280
Will you get back into weed to become a magician?

2013
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,240
I didn't say it was totally off.

2014
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,760
I was just I was scaling back.

2015
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,280
OK, scaling back.

2016
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,600
That's scaling back from my.

2017
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,840
Yeah. Quarter a joint a week to one.

2018
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,440
The one. Yeah.

2019
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,560
When you're dealing with this paranoid corner mongers,

2020
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,160
I'm the. Yeah, yeah.

2021
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,360
Bocchorus one.

2022
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:47,840
I was I will say, and I don't I know it takes more work than I'm willing to put into it.

2023
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:52,240
I was like, oh, what could we what could a podcast, the right omega Mart look like?

2024
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,920
Or what could a me a wolf podcast?

2025
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:57,840
The right. I mean, it's it's we've said this.

2026
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,880
I've said this before six years in.

2027
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,000
I'm it makes me sick to my stomach that no one's reached out to have us

2028
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,440
design a theme park ride or something.

2029
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,120
It's ridiculous. Sure.

2030
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,720
It should have happened by now. Sure.

2031
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:13,160
No, you add. And just to put on the scope more or less upset than the grape soda

2032
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,840
at and the general state of rocket.

2033
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,880
Well, grape soda is like an institution for White Castle in my mind.

2034
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,720
So that actually these are actually I can make it matter.

2035
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,200
Issues. These are two different things.

2036
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:26,440
Yeah, yeah. But that rank them then poor general poor quality of rocket fizz.

2037
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,800
Lack of grape soda at White Castle are nonpresence in theme park building.

2038
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,680
Right. So much has come true with the theme park that I thought might happen.

2039
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,520
And that is not.

2040
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,240
And but now that I'm asking me, they probably have their own people.

2041
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,640
They're going to, you know, make their own stuff.

2042
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:44,160
But I was you seem to have hundreds of people.

2043
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:47,120
Yes. I don't know if they need the help, but they probably don't.

2044
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,520
But I was like, well, we could do our own.

2045
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,640
We could make our own immersive at the very least.

2046
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,400
Doesn't have to be as intensive as this one.

2047
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,080
But well, all we need is 50000 square feet.

2048
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,600
Yes. If we could get that much, I guess we'd have to maybe do it far away from L.A.

2049
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,240
It seems like it would probably be harder to rent a bunch of space here.

2050
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,320
But maybe you don't know somewhere along the way.

2051
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:10,440
You're more. Well, yeah, they got in your mo.

2052
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:13,400
Yeah. So we'll put your mo on the map.

2053
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,680
Yeah, we could. Yeah, sure.

2054
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,080
There's a lot of land.

2055
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,400
So I don't want to call a shot that we're going to do this, but

2056
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,800
maybe in twenty twenty eight, when we do Space Mountain year,

2057
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:32,480
we can also do some sort of immersive like this with a deep narrative.

2058
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,840
And it's mostly about capitalism.

2059
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,320
You can do there's stuff you can do on every screen.

2060
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,360
You can experience what it's like to be playing GTA with a sleep.

2061
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,640
Evan Susser.

2062
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,320
It really were.

2063
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:46,600
He really he really doesn't respond. Right.

2064
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,760
Mike Soda Fountain room.

2065
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,840
And it's just a soda fountain of just fully functioning grape sodas.

2066
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2067
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,200
It's like a weird, surreal like dummy of Mike just smiling.

2068
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,760
So why his smile is like three feet long?

2069
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,720
None of them are broken. They all work.

2070
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,040
We have to keep that up, though.

2071
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,080
Who needs maintenance?

2072
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,040
You know, yeah.

2073
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,920
Well, that's an issue for the DWP of your mo.

2074
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,800
OK, that's true.

2075
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:19,280
You get the best people putting those pipes in, making sure there's ever flowing

2076
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,400
grape soda. Yeah. Yeah.

2077
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,440
And it's a place for you to live.

2078
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:27,720
Jason's weed room where you can watch him take a tiny puff once a day.

2079
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:32,200
Take a tiny puff and do not fucking look at it like take a tiny puff

2080
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,800
and look real quick and then get out.

2081
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,880
And he's watching book club on the couch.

2082
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,080
And watching.

2083
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,960
Got a boot up club, too.

2084
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,200
You know, you get in there and then he goes, get the fuck out of here.

2085
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,080
And you just turn around and you leave.

2086
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,600
But if you put your ear up to the door, you can hear him saying,

2087
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,120
Joan, Mary, what were you saying?

2088
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,600
Andy Garcia, really?

2089
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,840
He's he's still charms.

2090
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,160
He's still a charmer.

2091
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,000
I still got it.

2092
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,640
Oh, and he's Andy Garcia.

2093
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,600
Sure. Andy Garcia.

2094
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,360
I'd go I'd go on a personal flight with him anywhere.

2095
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:11,680
Where does Diane Keaton get all these wonderful outfits?

2096
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,800
Oh, the outfits.

2097
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,640
Coastal grandmother.

2098
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,000
Oh, she's the ultimate coastal grandmother.

2099
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,120
That was a trend for a while.

2100
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,400
That was a term someone invented.

2101
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,040
All right. I'm calling it.

2102
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,440
You survived. You survived.

2103
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,080
I think I think I am.

2104
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,120
I think this is I think this is my exit back to the.

2105
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,280
Weird. You survived podcast, the Red Sin City Nights.

2106
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,400
Thanks for subscribing to the Fremont gate.

2107
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,600
We're going to delve this week.

2108
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,360
Later this week, we're going to get a little 90s again back on the main strip.

2109
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,200
But here on Patreon, if you want to dig even deeper, join us on our high roller

2110
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,200
tier club three, where you get one more bonus episode every month

2111

and our regular episodes ad free as just voted on late breaking.

2112
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:03,480
A landslide victory for this is something that's lived entirely in Club Three.

2113
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,400
If you didn't hear the Sin City Nights episode there with my wife,

2114
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:11,400
Aaron, the designer of the logo, we got to hear all of Jason's tales

2115
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,680
about working in college food service college dining hall.

2116
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,200
And now what what this has led to is that the next Club Three episode

2117
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:24,160
will be tales of this and this big story that Mike has alluded to.

2118
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,280
Only the club three.

2119
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,520
This is like an entire this.

2120
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:29,200
This is like the the the boop of.

2121
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,360
Yeah, people.

2122
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,520
People have not done the add on.

2123
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,760
It's the same amount, right?

2124
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,240
Three dollars. Three dollars.

2125
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,760
Well, this is the same thing.

2126
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,600
OK, so by the if you really want to get the full Sin City Nights

2127
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,240
experience, the full pockets, the right experience, get that boop.

2128
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,800
Make sure you boop your way.

2129
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,800
So you hear Mike's big story, which seems like it involves him

2130
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,440
failing to are.

2131
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,240
For sure, I did not are

2132
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,440
there was no areing, no areing happening at all.

2133
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,320
Yes, that's coming soon.
