1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm Torque, joined by Outlaw.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm pointing at you, Outlaw.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Me, I'm Outlaw.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
That's right.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Embrace it.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Own it.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Outlaw.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,120
I was going to call myself, like, Young Man or something.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Well, that's fine.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
These are suggested.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
But that's better.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
That's more of an actual American Gladiators name.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
I'll call myself Outlaw.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Outlaw.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
And over there, it's Throb.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
Oh, Throb.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,120
I was going to say Scuttle, and then I realized that's a little...

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Scuttle's a little mermaid.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Yeah, that's why I was like, wait, there's a Disney thing named Scuttle, and then I remembered.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Yeah, scuttling isn't a tough word to scuttle around.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
What about Engorge?

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Sure.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Or Jason?

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Well, Throb Engorge.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Scuttle kind of made sense to me because you've got to scuttle between the barrier.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
You've got to dodge the balls and stuff.

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
You've got to be crafty and high.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
I guess you could describe that as scuttling.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Scurrying?

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Scurrying is what you're thinking, I think, more.

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
You're thinking about scurrying, I think.

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,040
And over there is scurry.

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Technically, an action verb.

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, to each his own.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I just wanted to come in with a couple of suggestions.

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,040
And by the way, mine is Torque spelled with a Q, not like Peter Torque.

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Thanks for making that distinction.

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
For our audience.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Yeah, yes.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Well, for at least one person in the room.

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was making a monkey's reference.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're talking about the Torque as in the, is it a motorcycle movie from the early 2000s

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
with a young Adam Scott?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, right.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's in Torque.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's in Torque.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He came to Funny or Die once and made a video about his experiences on the set of Torque.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is that true?

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It was something about an assistant director who was making him do something dangerous.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And it made him feel unsafe while making the movie Torque.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, oh dear.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I forget the name of that.

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,960
And Ken Marino is in it playing a backstage role, much like in the rock and roller coaster

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
attraction.

61
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
It's the part he was born to play.

62
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Yeah.

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,960
But we are here to talk about something I've been wanting to do the deep dive on for a

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
long time.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
This has been on a, this has been on a literal to-do list for a while, and I'm glad that

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
we've, we've landed here.

67
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,760
Today, we are talking about American Gladiators Orlando Live.

68
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,520
However, I would like to overshoot that proper title and refer to it as what it is in my

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
heart, which is the American Gladiators Dinner Theater.

70
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
This is something that was in Orlando.

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
And you know what?

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,320
The building did say American Gladiators Dinner Theater as well.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,020
There's a bit of branding confusion throughout this thing.

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,240
So I'm going to, I'm going to use the most descriptive one because that's what this is.

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,360
If you don't know this, American Gladiators, the smash hit pop culture phenomenon syndicated

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,800
televised pseudo sports show of the late 80s and early to midnight, 89 to 96, this thing

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
ran.

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:35,200
We can talk about the show a little broader, but you know, very popular, like insane, garish,

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,280
show with, you know, crazy bodybuilder types performing stunts and sports that were made

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:51,320
up for the show specifically, memorable theme, you know, just like a vibrant, great 90s memory.

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,720
When the show petered out and stopped airing on television, they wanted to do more with

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,760
the brand and the Gladiators wanted to work and people involved in the show wanted to

83
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,320
keep going in some way and someone had the idea to take all of those desires and to

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,200
thrust them together, to throb them together with the rather big at that time and maybe

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,080
still a little bit, the world of Orlando dinner theaters.

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,400
And I say dinner theater, not so much as like who done it to mystery type dinner theater,

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,440
but you know, medieval times, pirates, dinner adventure, these dinner arenas really would

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,920
be the proper way.

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,560
Yeah, dinner in a show, I guess is what medieval times would say.

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,080
Big, long piece of entertainment where you're not in the dark, you're eating, you're lit

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,040
up to, you're eating a big piece of chicken.

93
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,200
You're eating the worst chicken you've ever had.

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,640
You're cheering on your guy against your opponents.

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,720
And it does, these things do sort of align.

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,480
You can certainly see why on paper American Gladiators becoming a new current version

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
of medieval times.

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Makes sense.

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,560
Yeah, I mean, it is, I'm trying to think of even a better way, like dinner in a battle

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,760
is really the way these specific dinner theaters should be described because it is pirates

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
dinner adventure.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
It's medieval times.

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
It's this.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,800
It's probably Dolly's Dixie Stampede or whatever it's called now, but you're watching fighting.

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,720
It's like, it's like you're in the Coliseum, which was also, by the way, a great idea for

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,080
an Orlando dinner theater is when you're in like a Coliseum and there's gladiators.

107
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,220
Has that been done?

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,400
That feels like that's no, I don't think that's a ripe, that's, you know what, as I discovered

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,760
doing this, I think I'm virtually every other type of theme and era was done.

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,000
And I'm kind of surprised that somewhere in, well, I guess by the two thousands, they figured

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,500
out that this area is not as fruitful as and guaranteed financially successful as anybody

112
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
thought that it was.

113
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,780
So I was going to say, like, you'd think maybe the movie Gladiator would prompt more

114
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,620
of that stuff, but I guess not.

115
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,260
And will the new one, will Gladiator, will the success of Gladiator 2 lead to the dinner

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,020
seum or the food seum?

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,020
What's the, what's the, for the cuisine of seum, what's the cleanest way to combine those

118
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
words?

119
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,780
The coleslaw seum, because that's one of the dishes you get.

120
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Right, right.

121
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,220
This is only, this is related, but I'm realizing now that when we were in Orlando and I drive,

122
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,300
I noticed that the body show that's at the Pirate Dinner Adventure in Buena Park, Tietro

123
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Martini, which closed in Buena Park is still in Orlando.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,140
I saw a sign for it.

125
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Wow.

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
So I don't know if they move.

127
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,700
Is it's own venue and does it not share with the Pirates?

128
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,940
That's what I'm wondering, because there is a Pirates Dinner Adventure in Orlando as well.

129
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Yes.

130
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,220
The sister cities of Buena Park and Orlando.

131
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,300
That's why I think of them.

132
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
That's why, yeah.

133
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,020
And that's why Buena Park is so high in your heart.

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Right.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
It's one of the greatest cities in the world.

136
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,300
It feels like there should be a portal to Orlando, not you don't have to take a plane.

137
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,300
It's just like there's a magic hole in Buena Park that you step through and you step out

138
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
into Orlando.

139
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
That's how it feels.

140
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,220
It does feel like it's like you're not that far, like one minute you're in downtown LA

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,340
and then maybe, you know, 25 minutes later, if you're lucky, you're in the silliest place

142
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
you've ever seen.

143
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Right.

144
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Yeah.

145
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
It doesn't feel like the rest of the city, not even Anaheim.

146
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
It feels like singular.

147
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Yeah.

148
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
From Anaheim.

149
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Yeah.

150
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,340
You show up next to the Big Wizard gift shop or the empty lot where the Florida Project

151
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Motel used to be.

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
Yes.

153
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Yeah.

154
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,500
Well, the location of this gets us close to one of these like roadside looks like something

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,900
kind of places, which is a gift shop that looks like a big orange, near the big orange.

156
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,980
This is, I was showing Jane to the building to see if she recognized it from living in

157
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Florida.

158
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,060
And she's like, I can kind of picture the area.

159
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,540
And she looked up in this, the building this used to be in is about 10 minutes from Pop

160
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Century.

161
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
Yeah.

162
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,460
It's not that, it's not that far.

163
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:10,260
Hey, look, this, this should have been a point in its favor that it is fairly close to Disney

164
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,740
World.

165
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,380
I think that I, you bring up iDrive, you bring up International Drive, like the big crazy

166
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,700
stretch, you know, near Disney and Universal where every single corner and block, it is

167
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,620
like just one, it is just a murderer's row of every crazy two story chain restaurant

168
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,780
and weird pseudo themed thing.

169
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,100
And at one point in time, a lot more of these dinner theaters, which I'll bring up a few

170
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,700
of these kind of in history.

171
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,780
But I, that was some of what spurred me to push for this episode finally is that, you

172
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,140
know, you and I made it down there, Mike, and I was like, iDrive, we got to explore

173
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,820
some of this crazy iDrive stuff, like the American Gladiators dinner theater, but looked

174
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,980
into it, not iDrive, not iDrive, different area.

175
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,420
As you said, as Jamie pointed out, pretty close, like 10 minutes east, but it's actually,

176
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,660
it was on a stretch in Kissimmee, it's very close to Fun Spot Kissimmee, if anybody's

177
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
been there.

178
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,780
Kissimmee St. Cloud, the center of all the action.

179
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,380
Throw a dart, throw all the darts.

180
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,300
It might be, because we did the, I'm too excited to sleep, the Kissimmee St. Cloud

181
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,460
archery ad might be worth examining.

182
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,540
Well then maybe you get into some other what the hell was going on in Kissimmee, because

183
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,980
I think it's the episode Kissimmee St. Cloud, obviously with a strong focus on darts, or

184
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
arrows?

185
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Arrows.

186
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,060
Yeah, arrows, I think, it was a big archery target.

187
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,260
There's Sea World.

188
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,540
There's Universal Studios.

189
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,020
I believe Pirates, Dinner Adventure, and Teatro Martini are in the same, at least.

190
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
In Florida too?

191
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Yes.

192
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
It is a shared.

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,820
I believe it's shared, but it might be two different buildings next to each other, I

194
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
can't tell from here.

195
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Okay.

196
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,540
And do you have any sense of if the Florida one does the seasonal show Vampirates?

197
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
Very good question.

198
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,700
I can look into it, and I will right now.

199
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Great, great.

200
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,180
And can you befriend someone in that show as well?

201
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,820
What is one of the odds of a Vampirate talking to you in Florida?

202
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
In Florida?

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,340
Honestly, probably pretty high.

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
We might know a Vampirate.

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
Yeah, I know.

206
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,020
Because I knew a Vampirate in Blana Park.

207
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,140
If the show had kept going, we might have known a Gladiator too.

208
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
We might have.

209
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
That's true.

210
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,140
Oh yeah, absolutely.

211
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,420
We might know the Hot Soup Pitcher Company if it kept going.

212
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,060
One of the greatest inventions of mankind, the Hot Vegetable Soup Pitchers.

213
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,860
As if you're getting a pitcher of Coke, but it's a bunch of soup in the pitcher.

214
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,700
You'd think that they would use the same ones, but first of all, you don't want the

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
cross-contamination.

216
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,300
You don't want the vegetable soup in the Coke, although I've combined those things, and

217
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
they're excellent.

218
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
But you need the hotter pitcher.

219
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,860
It's got to be thicker in order to have the soup in it as opposed to the cold cola.

220
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,700
Scott, when I tell you I had this same conversation in my mind a few hours ago, about whether

221
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,740
the pitchers could be the same.

222
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,900
Do the pitchers get, are they one pitcher used for everything?

223
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm like, oh no, that Hot Soup Pitcher has to be temperature safe.

224
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,020
It couldn't be the Coke Pitcher.

225
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,060
I chose the character of somebody who thought that there should be specific, because you

226
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,540
mentioned the Hot Soup Pitcher Company as opposed to the cold one.

227
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,220
I guarantee it's the same pitchers.

228
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,660
This is some of the worst food on the planet Earth.

229
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,580
I thought mine was, this is one of my revelations, I thought the food was fine.

230
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
God.

231
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
I just never.

232
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,100
The Doughboy's despised by a steer of hatred for one of the worst places they've ever been.

233
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Maybe the worst meal Aaron has ever had in her life.

234
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
You guys.

235
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
It is the worst.

236
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,660
We come from different worlds.

237
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
There's no doubt about it.

238
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
I don't bake chicken a lot.

239
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,100
Mike Carlson is saying this.

240
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,660
It's some of the worst food on planet Earth.

241
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,140
You've got to listen when Mike Carlson's saying it.

242
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,540
It's some of the worst food on planet Earth.

243
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,060
I don't know how you can say that it was pretty good.

244
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,580
The salad is like wet newspaper.

245
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,220
The chicken is just like an odd texture that I've never seen before or felt and then it's

246
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,220
dark in there and it's like, it adds, it's like when you're like, you were a kid and

247
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,820
they put like spaghetti in a box and you put your hand in there and you're like, it gives

248
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
me that feeling.

249
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
I don't know.

250
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Touching the chicken.

251
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,380
They had that lobby, they're like touch a zombie pirate and then that's someone's chicken

252
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
on tray an hour later.

253
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
They just serve it right up.

254
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,220
Yeah.

255
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Yeah.

256
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Yes.

257
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220
With hand contamination.

258
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Who cares?

259
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
We've got to move these babies.

260
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,940
You will not find worse food than a pirate's dinner adventure.

261
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Geez, Mike.

262
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,180
Some sanity has been reached food wise on the show after many, many long months of avoiding

263
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,300
it altogether.

264
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,500
Something that we'll learn in this episode also is that this, I mean, it shouldn't be

265
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,420
a surprise, but the food being extremely cheap is absolutely a part of the model.

266
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Oh yeah.

267
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,780
It was extremely on purpose and I can point to the specific person who pushed this model

268
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:15,340
and you may be surprised, you may not be surprised who this source ends up being.

269
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:23,300
There's a very good Orlando Sentinel article from 1995 and it was giving good details and

270
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,860
then right at the end, it hit like two things where I was like, oh, of course Scott's all

271
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
over there.

272
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Yes.

273
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,700
Credit to Orlando Sentinel really like unlocked it because there's not a ton of info about

274
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
this thing.

275
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,220
So some excellent articles that sent me down some rabbit holes.

276
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I had so much fun.

277
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
I don't want to build it up too much.

278
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,060
I just, I know I loved learning about what I learned about and dare I say, we're hovering

279
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,460
around something, a word that we haven't said in a while, strangely, this word that was

280
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,500
really looming over the podcast and I don't know why, maybe we've just picked more benign

281
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,740
topics lately, but today, guys, guys are on the menu.

282
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
Oh yeah.

283
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,540
There are definitely some guys in the picture here and welcome back guys.

284
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,980
I had a feeling, I had a feeling just reading, just seeing some of the names.

285
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,740
I was like, oh, these wonderful names.

286
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,140
I don't know what it is that's speaking to me about them, but I will say the article

287
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,900
that I read, which was kind of a rundown of how this started and came together, no mention

288
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
of food.

289
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,780
Yeah, no, there's almost no information.

290
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,260
I can't vouch for how much better or worse it is than the pirate's food.

291
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,380
I would guess same or worse.

292
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
That's what I'd throw out.

293
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:45,100
But anyway, as far as location, not I drive, but on a stretch called Erlo Bronson Memorial

294
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Highway.

295
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,420
I feel like I've come across the street in Orlando Travels.

296
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,900
I think maybe part of Erlo Bronson Memorial Highway maybe connects all the way to Disney

297
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
World itself.

298
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,220
I think that is possible.

299
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,220
And I just in seeing it on a map, I got curious who Erlo Bronson is or was, and I'll say was

300
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,380
because he has passed, but he was an old guy in the Florida House of Representatives.

301
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,420
He was a massive Florida landowner who sold some of the land that is today Disney World.

302
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,980
He made Walt's dreams come true, sold for like a hundred dollars an acre.

303
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,380
I don't know how much he had, but you know, Erlo was one of the guys that Walt swindled

304
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,820
when he came into town, but he got a street named after him, so it all worked out.

305
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,100
And you know, it's maybe fine because would you believe that a Florida representative

306
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:47,300
in the 1960s and 70s engaged in a lot of segregationist and McCarthyist tactics, some not good stuff

307
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:55,100
along with a bunch of his fellow representatives to where Erlo and his whole gang, they all

308
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,140
got a kind of a group name together.

309
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,540
They were referred to in the Florida House as the Pork Chop Gang.

310
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Okay.

311
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah.

312
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,220
Which is, you know, I guess refers to that whole, that government pork and that spending

313
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
stuff.

314
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,540
But I hear Pork Chop Gang and I think like the old gang Jason was in when he was a little

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:24,140
kid with a bunch of other friends of his, an off-brand reboot of the Rascals that some

316
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,780
straight to video enterprising filmmakers tried to get off the ground with a, I was

317
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,740
going to say an eight-year-old Jason, but it could have been like it was all eight-year-olds

318
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,340
and then a 30-year-old Jason.

319
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Yeah.

320
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,940
Mike and I had already done an improv team at UCB and then I fell in.

321
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,820
Well, you know, if you go down the store with bulk candy, inevitably everyone scoops it

322
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,500
out into bags, but you know, one or two pieces fall off and those are no man's land.

323
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,060
So you got to grab those single pieces.

324
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,500
Was that your audition monologue for the Pork Chop Gang?

325
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah.

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,980
Well, that's, that was a tip I gave them and they're like, that's a great idea.

327
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
That's a great idea.

328
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,540
Tall boy, you're in because I was taller than all the only time in my life I was ever taller

329
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
than the room.

330
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,980
Why the hell they listen to you?

331
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,140
So the, the, the place itself, well, how else to go about this?

332
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,900
I mean, like, is there anything else we need to say about American Gladiators?

333
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,540
I think, I feel like people probably know what it is.

334
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,940
It's, you know, it's crazy red, white and blue costumes.

335
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,000
It's the most fit people you've ever seen, kick-ass theme with the ultimate like films

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,080
at Universal Studios Hollywood with the fountain in the beginning of the show.

337
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,720
Although it wasn't always filmed there and moved to CBS Radford at some point, but the,

338
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
you know, just a watch to this day that goes down smooth.

339
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,620
It's not like I'm watching a lot of American Gladiators, but it was the like cable era.

340
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,480
If you land on that and I think there's a Pluto and all that, it's like, you love it.

341
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
You love these and all these, you know, they're all named something crazy.

342
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,920
It's ice and saber and blast.

343
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
It's, it's, it's just a lot of fun.

344
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,960
It's definitely in the wake of rock and wrestling, WWF at the time, Hulk Hogan.

345
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,400
It's definitely in that zone where like, and kind of capitalizing on like bodybuilder mania

346
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
post Schwarzenegger.

347
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah.

348
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Yeah.

349
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah.

350
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,240
But if you've never seen it, it's like adult guts, adult Nickelodeon guts.

351
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Yeah.

352
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,760
That it's like, well, we're probably on the episode about guts that we did with Mo herself

353
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,360
or an episode about Nickelodeon Steels, we were like, if you've never seen guts, imagine

354
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,840
like a kid, American Gladiators.

355
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Right.

356
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Well, it works the other way.

357
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
All of this came first.

358
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
This was years before.

359
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Yes.

360
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Imagine adult guts.

361
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,000
American Gladiators has a lot more high powered nerf cannons.

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,160
Things that would be dangerous for kiddos to use, things that the pork shop gang would blast

364
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
each other's heads off with.

365
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,320
Did you watch the video on YouTube?

366
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,600
The video about this?

367
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Yeah.

368
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
The infomercial?

369
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
The 30 minute infomercial.

370
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, I sure did.

371
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh, I didn't catch that.

372
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,560
It's really a tremendous 30 minutes.

373
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,880
It's kind of the best piece of material that exists about this thing.

374
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Yeah.

375
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a, we should have passed it around.

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You learn a lot.

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You learn a lot.

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You learn a lot.

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
And I was just going to say, yes, you could, if you're listening to this and you really

380
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,720
want to know before you get into the analysis of Podcasts that Ride, it tells you about

381
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,160
the different events that you will see at the dinner theater, which also were on the

382
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
show.

383
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,360
Which that's, you know, that's a good way to go about it maybe in terms of what this

384
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,800
was a little bit.

385
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:42,240
And yeah, because they did all of these like invented kind of hyper, what's the like, they're

386
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
all like a roller ball, like scary future sports.

387
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Something in American Gladiators would be in a dystopian Verhoeven movie of here's what

388
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,240
sports are in the future, but they make it very friendly and fun.

389
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Yeah.

390
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,400
And they try to, I mean, they definitely hype it up as being, I think it was at power, like

391
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,680
one of them is called Powerball, which is really funny now in hindsight cause they said

392
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,120
less the lottery if you didn't know, but I think they refer to Powerball as like the

393
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,280
deadliest sport on this infomercial.

394
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,880
They hype it up as like, this will kill you.

395
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,640
Yes, they are hyping it up to that degree and then the ultimate musical hype up that

396
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,800
you could do, which is in the background during Mortal Kombat.

397
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes.

398
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,720
Which lasts for a while and they keep looping, I feel like, Mortal Kombat as well.

399
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,560
But then isn't Powerball, that is mainly like, it's sort of like a fast pace disposing of

400
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
your lunch items.

401
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Yeah.

402
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,520
It's a bunch of cans.

403
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,440
It's like four basketball hoops on the ground and you got to run and throw your basketball

404
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
in them fast.

405
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,480
And you got a big scary guy or woman coming at you.

406
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Sure.

407
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,920
And I'm sure that is very imposing and difficult.

408
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,000
And by the way, everyone, also the premise of the show is that there are the weak, there's

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the staff, right?

410
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,720
You're, it's, you know, think of it as a beat the geeks.

411
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,520
Think of it as a more obscure thing than this.

412
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:14,080
But here's the ones who are always there and then it's outside opponents come in and try

413
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,840
to take on the gladiators and those outs to even be there, you got to be a fighter fighter

414
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,480
or former military or something, you know, like the immense shape you have to be in to

415
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,560
even try to do this.

416
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,400
There was apparently the premise in the show that the winner of the season would be asked

417
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,200
to join permanently as a permanent gladiator and then they lost that premise between one

418
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,720
and two when they realized they didn't want to keep anybody or something.

419
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Right.

420
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Yeah.

421
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,400
You get sort of the greatest hits in this dinner theater show of the real things that

422
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,520
they would do, such as Powerball.

423
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,680
Do you have other favorites?

424
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
The assaults.

425
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
The assault.

426
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,000
That's the first one they talk about the assault and you're like, it's not, it doesn't sound

427
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
so fun.

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,840
It's not a word that today you want people saying assaults.

429
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,000
So like, it wasn't then either, by the way.

430
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It goes from assault to Powerball, which is really funny.

432
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
In 2025, I feel like something's really awful sounding and then something sounds fun, like

433
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,320
you can win some money.

434
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
What's the, I'm blanking now, the joust.

435
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
What's the joust called?

436
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Is it the joust?

437
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Yes.

438
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Joust is the thing where they're up on the platform.

439
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Yes.

440
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,720
That's the iconic, I think, the most iconic of all the American gladiators events.

441
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,960
Well, there's that, but there's also where they're rolling around in the balls.

442
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Yeah.

443
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,360
It feels iconic to me due to the Simpsons joke when Luanne Van Houden, is that her name,

444
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
is dating a gladiator?

445
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Pyro?

446
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Pyro.

447
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Yeah.

448
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,480
And they leave in his ride, which is one of the big balls.

449
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,040
But kind of a big hamster ball or something, hamster wheel, but that actually moves around.

450
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,880
That may be too big and expensive of equipment to do at this gladiator dinner theater, which

451
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,000
if you haven't started guessing already, this is a little lower rent than the television

452
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
show.

453
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

454
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,320
It's just basically a staff with like cushion pads on each side.

455
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
It's like a big Q-tip.

456
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
It's like a big Q-tip.

457
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Patriotic Q-tip.

458
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,760
And you're trying to knock each other off your platform.

459
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,440
I think it was maybe the main event or on the cover, there was a Nintendo game of American

460
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
gladiators.

461
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Oh, yeah.

462
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Oh, right.

463
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Yes.

464
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I would love to do the joust, I think.

465
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,520
As long as it's like softish on the bottom, I think I could still do the joust.

466
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
How long you think you're holding up in the joust?

467
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,840
Who am I against, though?

468
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,160
The weakest gladiator who ever did it.

469
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
But they are a gladiator.

470
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Yeah.

471
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,160
What event are we planning?

472
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,520
It's me, Mike versus Scott?

473
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Possibly.

474
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Okay.

475
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:04,000
Well, if it's the weakest gladiator, let's call him Spudder.

476
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,760
I think I could last 30 seconds.

477
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Maybe that's generous.

478
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
I don't know.

479
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
That's very generous.

480
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Yeah.

481
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I think you're getting hit three times.

482
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Spudder now?

483
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
No.

484
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,680
Because Spudder is 65 years old now, probably.

485
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,080
You're fishing for people exactly like you or that it's old gladiators.

486
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I think probably an old gladiator, unless they're very injured, I think is probably

487
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,280
still got a good shot.

488
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,480
I would like to take on an old gladiator.

489
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,080
I think a lot of them are in great, you know, because there's this documentary which gets

490
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,400
into this thing a little bit, and I think a lot of them are in fantastic shape to this

491
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
day.

492
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,920
There are competing documentaries, which I forgot about.

493
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,120
Is it Netflix is one, and then there's a 30 for 30 on American?

494
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,080
Oh, I forgot this, yes.

495
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,120
I forgot my friend John Katz, who I don't know if he still works for Absolutely, but

496
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,880
he did for a while.

497
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,000
And he's involved in Santa Monica Democrats, Santa Monica political issues.

498
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,560
He was my boss on the American Gladiators remake, my college classmate, and hired all

499
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,160
of us on the incredibly disorganized 2008 one.

500
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,040
And just listeners, you may have heard this before, but if you don't remember, Jason was

501
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,920
one of the 2008 American Gladiators.

502
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah, I was Spudder.

503
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
He was Spudder.

504
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,000
I was very callous of you.

505
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,640
I would prefer not to take on my current state, but okay, if it's for the glory of the gladiators.

506
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,680
Yeah, do you think we have, we don't have any gladiators listening in the audience,

507
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
do you think?

508
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,960
Any of the group who, how many gladiators, honestly, how many people can officially call

509
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,540
themselves gladiators?

510
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,320
The answer to that depends on if you count the people in this show or not.

511
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I do.

512
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,920
It's a fan website that certainly does count them, but I think by that point, my guess

513
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
is like 30.

514
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Wow, that is low.

515
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,080
I was thinking 50, but yeah, I guess it would be.

516
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Well, I don't know.

517
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,080
Well, then the new people, 2008 people, your pals Wolf and, do you remember the other?

518
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Wolf and Phoenix.

519
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Phoenix, okay.

520
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Right.

521
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Gina Carano.

522
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Was Gina Carano one of them?

523
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Yeah, I believe she was.

524
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,520
What was her name?

525
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
I don't remember.

526
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
I don't recall.

527
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
In the original?

528
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,800
No, no, in the 2008 agreement, the writer's strike filler version.

529
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Oh, okay.

530
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Yeah.

531
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,240
I think there's maybe more than 30, but maybe I'm wrong.

532
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,800
No, I guess maybe it's closer to 30.

533
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,960
She was crushed.

534
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
She was crushed.

535
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Wow.

536
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Gina Carano was crushed.

537
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Wow.

538
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,840
And today she's crushing weak, woke minds with her defiance.

539
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,760
If you search American Gladiators live, you will find also there was a live touring version

540
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,960
of Gladiators in addition to this show having live in it.

541
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Okay.

542
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,740
Oh, which I think planted the seeds of, well, this has worked on the road, so why could

543
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,760
there not be a permanent version?

544
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,740
And would that not be a good deal for some of the real Gladiators?

545
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,960
You don't even have to go on the road.

546
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
You got a family.

547
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
You bring the family.

548
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,200
Bring the family to Disney World.

549
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
You're 10 minutes away.

550
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,120
This certainly will not become a seedy, sad development that ends the franchise for at

551
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
least a decade after.

552
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,160
I might've, maybe I under did it.

553
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm looking at a pretty big list.

554
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,280
You know, I got ones popping up.

555
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,520
I've never seen Raider and Rhino and Rio and Rocket.

556
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I see Zap.

557
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
I see Khan.

558
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Ooh, Khan.

559
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Like Spalltow.

560
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
How?

561
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Like Wrath of Khan-Khan.

562
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Oh, wow.

563
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Uh-huh.

564
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Not C-O-N.

565
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Not C-O-N, no.

566
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
You're starting to get to maybe a few dozen Gladiators?

567
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,840
Yeah, and also apparently there's a BBC version.

568
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
We can't.

569
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
American Gladiators.

570
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,920
Well, they talk about the British one in that video.

571
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Oh, okay.

572
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,400
Because one of the guys, Thor, the guy Thor is from England and he kind of shits on the

573
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,640
English Gladiators.

574
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,300
He's like, you know, America's where it's at.

575
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,300
That's really what he, no offense to my British counterparts, but you know, America's wherever

576
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
the real action is.

577
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Geez, wow.

578
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,220
So it wasn't bad, even though you're closer to the roots of jousting.

579
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
You would think.

580
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,700
That doesn't make for more quality jousting.

581
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,900
Yeah, but was it called England Gladiators?

582
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,660
English Gladiators.

583
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,020
That's such a different vibe.

584
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Yeah.

585
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,820
That is such a more like, there's like, you get hit in the face with a glove to start

586
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
the match.

587
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,100
Maybe just, I believe, okay, it looks like just Gladiators.

588
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
I see that now.

589
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Yeah.

590
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I see.

591
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Okay.

592
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
There's a whole list of those Gladiators, too.

593
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,220
It also inspired another show called Ice Warriors.

594
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,700
Oh, there was Gladiators in 2024.

595
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Wow.

596
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,460
That's a British one?

597
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
It looks like it.

598
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Yeah.

599
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Wow.

600
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Wow.

601
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,740
So there probably is a whole new crop of Gladiators.

602
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm also getting, not to get distracted here, I'm starting to get interested in Ice Warriors.

603
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,540
Gladiators type, it was on, it was like Gladiators, but on an ice rink and they all have even

604
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:25,260
cooler names because the names are longer because they do like Viking type, Krell the

605
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Tormentor.

606
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
Wow.

607
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
That's great.

608
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,620
Morka the Fireblade, Thorgon the Beast, Zalan the Serene.

609
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Wow.

610
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Oh, nice.

611
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,220
Well, there's room for serenity in here, too.

612
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,500
I didn't know the ice ones.

613
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,820
I really like the martial arts.

614
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,820
WMAC Masters.

615
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,740
WMAC, yeah, what does that stand for?

616
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Is this another syndicated?

617
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,060
It was on Fox.

618
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
After Fox Kids.

619
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,580
And it was like ninjas in a battle dome of some kind.

620
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Geez.

621
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,500
But it was also kind of WWF storylines behind the scenes.

622
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
This was maybe a Saban related.

623
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Yes.

624
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Oh, yeah.

625
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,540
Yeah, there was some Power Rangers elements to it.

626
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Geez.

627
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,020
Filmed at Universal Studios Florida.

628
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,620
This is what I'm going to, I think what this episode will become is kind of like its own

629
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,720
little gladiator match within topics to like see what rises to the top as something we

630
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,420
want to keep talking about because there's more.

631
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,740
There's so many things that I'm hearing about for the first time via like especially other

632
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,740
dinner theaters.

633
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
Right.

634
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,220
There's a lot to unpack here.

635
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,300
Maybe we should start diving into the real, into the thing.

636
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,580
So anyway, so here's the idea.

637
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,300
We'll do like a greatest hits of the best and also cheapest to recreate gladiator.

638
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
They did the wall.

639
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
They didn't do the wall at the same size.

640
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:57,100
So they say as the wall on TV, you know, things look bigger on TV.

641
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,540
Probably should have done it bigger because it's in person.

642
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
Right.

643
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
Yeah.

644
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,580
But they also they had something that the show didn't have, which is a really tall American

645
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
flag.

646
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,540
The tallest, most patriotic flag you've ever seen.

647
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Isn't that nice?

648
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,460
That's I think it's very nice.

649
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,780
So you know, what else?

650
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,280
Yeah, they had the wall.

651
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,020
So you know, it culminates in this in the same way.

652
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,620
But so, you know, definitely makes sense on paper.

653
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,700
Orlando sent an old article, you know, they bring up the gladiators to tour several years

654
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,540
ago and the live concept went over very well, said Steve Scarano, who brought together the

655
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,260
investor group that financed the dinner show.

656
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,380
You can watch it all with a meal for $39.95.

657
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,380
That's still the price.

658
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Yeah, you're right.

659
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,900
That is still how much Pirates Dinner Adventure cost, I'm pretty sure.

660
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,620
So that's expensive for the time.

661
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
Yeah, seemingly.

662
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,580
But also the second show at the night was just the show, No Dinner.

663
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,580
That was $27.95.

664
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,300
This is what I would do at every one of these.

665
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,540
If you give me a non-dinner option, please, do any of them do this?

666
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Do they all do it?

667
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,700
And I don't know.

668
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
The food is precisely what I want.

669
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,420
But I don't think there's food with Teatro Martini.

670
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,620
I don't know about that.

671
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,740
I bet there's a version of it.

672
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,540
I think there's options, but isn't it kind of in the outer lobby stage area?

673
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,180
Well, at least in point of part, we just said it's closed.

674
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,500
So I don't know what the Orlando setup is.

675
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,340
I'm seeing now this, I swear I paid $40 for my seat at the Vampirates, but I'm seeing

676
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,820
This is one of those things where there's 10 different types of discounts to get, depending

677
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,340
on what it's just like, whatever.

678
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,740
If you're like a, if you have low patience for finding deals, you'll pay $60.

679
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:51,460
But if you do two Google searches, you will easily find it for 25 to 30 to $40.

680
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,900
Anything in the Groupon range, they have to, they rely on things like this.

681
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,780
Groupon or what was the other one?

682
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
I don't know.

683
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,820
There was a Groupon competitor.

684
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
I don't know if it's still around.

685
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,820
There were a few, I think, but I don't recall.

686
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,860
Anyway, the, okay, so Scorano wouldn't say how much money he and other investors put

687
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,900
into the venture, but another producer, Blaustein, said it was up in the millions.

688
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,180
The show employs 213 people.

689
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:27,700
In classic chain restaurant endeavor kind of thing that we talk about, they're instantly

690
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,380
out of the gate talking about, we're going to do a ton of these.

691
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,740
We're going to do one in Vegas.

692
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,180
We're going to do one in London.

693
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,420
It's always the best.

694
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,500
That's the guy, the multi-city hubris.

695
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,460
That's the trademark of a guy too.

696
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,260
It really is.

697
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,100
And I'm not sure which one, I don't know that they're, the people talking right here

698
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,900
don't seem like guys, but there are guys, guys do come up and the guys might help

699
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,700
influence that thinking.

700
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,140
Yes, it's just guy.

701
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,180
It's typical guy thinking, whether it's said by a true guy or not.

702
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,140
Yeah, us on the cover of a book, typical guy thinking.

703
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,580
Typical guy thinking.

704
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,740
And it's, and there's like, like crooked martini glasses.

705
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,540
It's the book cover that every Chelsea Lately guest got.

706
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,820
That's going to be a best seller typical guy thinking.

707
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,300
Anyway, another person said, we liked it from day one.

708
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,620
We felt that the TV show is very popular and that Orlando needed something as an

709
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,260
alternative to other dinner theaters here.

710
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,860
And this is sort of the point that I was making.

711
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,100
And this is the rabbit hole that I started going down due to these Orlando Sentinel

712
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:40,260
articles is other related dinner theaters, including the one that occupied this theater

713
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,140
before American Gladiators came there.

714
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:48,700
So this space was not built for American Gladiators.

715
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,420
It was, I don't know if it was built for this, but this is what was there.

716
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,620
Something called Fortune Feast Dinner and Game Show.

717
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,060
This lasted less than a month.

718
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,580
We've come across some bombs in our time and this show you would consider American

719
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,860
Gladiators because it only lasted a couple of years, but I mean, that's that's

720
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,340
seeming like a global phenomenon compared to less than a month.

721
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,380
Yeah. Yeah.

722
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I always I'm always mystified when I learn about Broadway musicals and stuff.

723
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,740
That like last less than three months.

724
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,980
And it's like that took years to mount.

725
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,260
That took so much money and so much manpower.

726
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,140
I didn't even make the six months.

727
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,460
It's got to be so broken to not even just like to sputter, sputter.

728
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:46,820
Yes. The headline from the Orlando Sentinel article, it says, and now, of course,

729
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,060
I just got an ad which took a Fortune Feast closes for some fine tuning.

730
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,180
Such as Entire Concept, Entire Business Plan, this thing.

731
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,780
So this was a little cheaper for only thirty five ninety five.

732
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,780
Here's what the OK.

733
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,940
Let me explain.

734
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,980
For Fortune, Fortune Feast Dinner, maybe Game Show.

735
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,300
Huh? OK. Here's what it was.

736
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,620
Was you're in Sherwood Forest.

737
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,140
It's Robin Hood and it's Merry Men and it's stealing from the rich

738
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,380
and giving to the poor, but stealing the rich and giving to the poor.

739
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,980
Couldn't we make that an interactive concept like a game show?

740
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,180
Like, let's make a deal.

741
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,060
So this was a Sherwood Forest Robin Hood game show.

742
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,580
Man, I am so in the weeds like I forgot all these details.

743
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,220
I was like, oh, OK, it'll be like a Jeopardy stage and you eat chicken or beef.

744
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,020
Mm hmm. And I'm like, no, it's Sherwood Forest.

745
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,860
It's gamified Sherwood Forest.

746
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,300
Yeah, gamified, gamified Sherwood Forest.

747
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,980
You mean like that they fight the king? No, no.

748
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,060
They you play games of skill and memory and chance.

749
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,500
You do fun games and it's what's behind door number two.

750
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
That is what happens in this Robin Hood thing. Yeah.

751
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,300
I we're talking a combination of let's make a deal

752
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,380
and all hell breaks loose in Sherwood Forest.

753
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,740
It's roast chicken and Robin Hood.

754
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,540
And then it was described by the guy who started it.

755
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,100
Bahram Korsandi, as I was trying to find a theme

756
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,220
that nobody had the rights to and take from the rich and give to the poor.

757
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,900
Went with my idea for a game show.

758
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,580
The audience can come in to eat and leave with a new car.

759
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,740
So in the search for something that no one if he is right,

760
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,900
no one had ever thought of it. Yeah.

761
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,940
And it is funny because I guess you could have done like,

762
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,220
let's make a deal live.

763
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,820
Yes, but that might require the rights to let's make a deal.

764
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,220
Unless you just have to change enough words.

765
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,100
Let us let you and I consider forging some kind of arrangement

766
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,140
that you could do.

767
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,260
Do we know like was Friar Tuck involved?

768
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,260
Don't know that. No, I don't know that.

769
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,420
It depends also on Robin Hood has been public domain for for a while,

770
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,860
I would think. OK, yeah.

771
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,460
And then I think the answer lies there.

772
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,020
I think if if Friar Tuck is public domain, then yes, he was in it.

773
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,260
OK, if not, like we could do like Sherlock Holmes was on the table,

774
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,460
probably I'm guessing he was probably he was he came to your table.

775
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,660
He was at this to he was also Sherlock Holmes is there.

776
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,780
Help Sherlock solve a mystery and win a Ford probe.

777
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,500
I don't even remember that car.

778
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I don't even know.

779
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,140
I know I've never heard that in my life.

780
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,340
You may have made that up.

781
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,700
I don't know.

782
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,620
Ford probe. 50-50.

783
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,740
A glamorous Ford probe.

784
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,500
It's just fine.

785
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,780
Latchback. What year was that?

786
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,260
I don't know. They stopped making them 97.

787
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,700
When did people stop? That lasted less than a month.

788
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,980
That's way into but that's way into like alien stuff

789
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,740
where people just thought of probes is going up someone's rectum.

790
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,380
Yeah. That's too.

791
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,740
That's too recent for calling something the Ford probe.

792
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,900
That's bizarre.

793
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,260
If you want to go exploring uncharted territory,

794
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,300
find yourself deep in dark uncharted

795
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,540
territory and get yourself a probe.

796
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Buy American for your probes.

797
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,260
Listeners, I don't know if you'd believe this, but

798
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,740
a lot of this stuff is not well documented or preserved.

799
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,820
No, not terribly.

800
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,300
But I did find a post on the Orange County Regional History Center.

801
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,020
And it is the cast and crew windbreaker.

802
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,820
Great. That was donated as a piece of history.

803
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,020
Yes, donated as a piece of history by.

804
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,420
Oh, I don't want to spoil your fun and say this name.

805
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,740
I'm sure you're going to get around.

806
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,580
Peter Blaustein.

807
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,700
Yeah, it was Peter Blaustein.

808
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,260
Well, the fun wasn't saying the name Peter Blaustein.

809
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm a stupid. Yeah, but there's some details about Peter Blaustein.

810
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,420
A ton of details about Blaustein.

811
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,540
Let me first close out Bahram Korsandi

812
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,700
and say that I was curious, is there anything else about

813
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,540
Orlando game show entrepreneur Bahram Korsandi?

814
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,940
What happened to him after Fortune Feast and Dinner and Game Show went bust?

815
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,740
Well, apparently he was also involved in American Gladiators Orlando Live.

816
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,100
And I found this out through a deep Google where I discovered that

817
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,620
somewhere in him doing business with American Gladiators Orlando Live, he

818
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,300
he was arrested at Miami International Airport

819
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,740
in connection with one hundred and sixty grand not paid in state sales taxes.

820
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,900
My God. He pleaded no contest to a single count of theft of state funds.

821
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,700
Wow. So this is an you know,

822
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,060
the guy number one.

823
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,300
And it's a it's a mini guy because there is literally no more information.

824
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,380
But like one of the first names you encounter is a guy like here's

825
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,940
there's what we know about this guy. Robin Hood Game Show. Great.

826
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,780
Next thing we know about him sent to prison.

827
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,220
I mean, I'm sorry, not set to be arrested at the airport.

828
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,260
Forced to pay one hundred sixty grand.

829
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,020
What? Because he stole from he was robbing from the rich.

830
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,660
He was robbing the rich to give to the poor.

831
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,980
Himself is a poor, who I suspect is not maybe that poor.

832
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,500
But, you know, the same idea applies.

833
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,220
Could we win back the money we spent on these tickets for dinner in the show?

834
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,980
Oh, no, absolutely not. You'll never see that again.

835
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,300
Well, I was thinking about this like I do.

836
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,740
I envy these people who just can make something stupid happen.

837
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,780
Yeah, because it would be fun to have a bad dinner and see a show.

838
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,740
And you would be responsible for that, creating the whole thing.

839
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,340
Make it what seems fun.

840
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,020
But the inevitable amount of like the amount of money it takes to put this up

841
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,340
means you're going to have to get the money from weird places.

842
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,220
And then that means that you're probably a little bit looser with laws.

843
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,420
So probably a lot of like being mired in funding and people who fund things.

844
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,460
Right. You're going to get really tempted to start stealing.

845
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,260
Right. So much money.

846
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,780
And then you just that that money becomes meaningless to you at a certain point.

847
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,700
And then one hundred and sixty thousand is just like, whatever.

848
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,140
But here's the thing is that if you can successfully make the switch

849
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,380
to being one of these people, you get to do it into infinity until you die.

850
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,540
Well, you get to be the president.

851
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,140
If you get to be. Yes, obviously, the president is the biggest example.

852
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,660
The most famous example of this.

853
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,340
Another crowd. All right.

854
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,580
One more chance, but we'll see.

855
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,940
Yeah, we're also seeing it with it.

856
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,460
Like somehow people are giving money to the fire festival guy.

857
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,220
Yeah, right. Every right everywhere that it's supposed to.

858
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,420
Every every city he's saying he's doing it in saying he is not doing it here.

859
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,340
There is no thing.

860
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,020
I just watched a thing about this last night and like, you know,

861
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,980
you could go on a TV expedition with your favorite rapper.

862
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,820
People make phone calls. No rappers are attached.

863
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,300
There is one football player who has been somebody.

864
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,060
Forget who was on a Super Bowl winning team.

865
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,300
This is the music festival.

866
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,060
FireFest has booked one act and it's a football player.

867
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,380
Oh, it's an XFL play. He hurt me.

868
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,580
But he's loved. I'd go party with him.

869
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,780
And I'll be honest or whatever.

870
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,700
He's going to make a bunch of money again. Yeah.

871
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,980
Like, yes, it just that's how this works.

872
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,100
I don't understand it exactly. Yeah.

873
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,980
But he's one who went to jail.

874
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,700
Even if you're what?

875
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,900
Maybe especially if you're one of the ones who go to jail,

876
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,100
you get to do it again as many times.

877
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,260
And it's just a matter of like because I don't think you or I could get away with it.

878
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,580
I think I don't think so.

879
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,940
You have to you have to like just make this sweet.

880
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,380
You have to become this person fully.

881
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,180
Yeah. If you do so, you get 12 cracks at that bat.

882
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,860
Yeah. Before you go to jail and at dinner theaters,

883
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,420
we go to jail for two weeks and then get out and do another 12

884
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,940
and we'll go make all your contacts for the next time you do it.

885
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,300
Yeah. No, I know.

886
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,780
It's really we should try to put together like a comprehensive list of guys,

887
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,220
of like people who seem to have this ability to just either

888
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:40,140
scam people or at least just thrust their terrible ideas.

889
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,900
And I actually I'm very glad he is alive is a good idea.

890
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,900
I don't want to trash.

891
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,340
No, this one actually makes sense.

892
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,780
It's this is more an execution that it falls. Yeah. Right.

893
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,380
So there there was a guy going around the Internet the other day,

894
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,780
and he's like, when you drop out at Stanford after your first day

895
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,060
and then a month later, your most cracked out friends

896
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,300
join you to start building your startup.

897
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:10,220
And it's just the nastiest room full of like guys on MacBook Pros.

898
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,860
One of them has their shoes off and their feet up.

899
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,020
And then at some point, some of the most damning detail I've ever heard.

900
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,660
The guys are you just saying?

901
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,740
No, I've seen.

902
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,380
No, I this this was a thing that was going around.

903
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,180
And then at some point, it's like, yeah, we had an engineer.

904
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,140
He was passed out one day from working.

905
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,260
And so we had to put in air safety reminders

906
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,940
because it's just like everyone's like, I don't know what the ventilation

907
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,540
like is in that room to have a dozen people like working out of like

908
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,460
a one bedroom apartment, a studio.

909
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,900
We got drive. We got we got the juice.

910
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
We don't need air.

911
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,780
We got Riz.

912
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,740
Who needs heroin? You got Riz.

913
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,220
We're smelling this guy's feet.

914
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,660
He's got his feet out.

915
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,220
And it's like the fire festival guy where it's like, oh, they made one

916
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,540
app for credit card processing.

917
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,220
Or it's like this is a new kind of credit card.

918
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,060
And it just holds a lot on that a lot of events.

919
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,700
But you're like, I haven't seen him talk about the credit card in a while.

920
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,140
Jason, we should after we're done with this, you get your shoes off.

921
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,220
And we got work to do.

922
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,700
We need to start getting on our shoes off.

923
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,020
Mike, shut off the air.

924
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,660
All of us scramming in the closet over there instead of the lightly

925
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,660
bigger room that we're in.

926
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,340
Someone turn someone turn one of these monitors vertically for some reason.

927
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,540
That's good because we're thinking different.

928
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,940
We're flipping everything on its side script.

929
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,180
Yeah, I agree.

930
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,780
No, it's we got to figure out our scam.

931
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,060
After years of pitching perfectly good theme park

932
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,740
ideas that no one is taking, it's time to start doing it our way,

933
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,540
which is by stealing.

934
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,460
Yeah, I know.

935
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,340
If I had no like if I didn't have if I was like a single guy

936
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,940
and I had like nothing to lose, it does seem fun to try to be a weird scammy guy,

937
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,780
doesn't it?

938
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,180
It does.

939
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,700
You definitely see many people really seem like the type from the way

940
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,860
that you were raised to suddenly become a major scamster.

941
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,100
But then wouldn't that be fun?

942
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,780
Like that would be fun to go completely against your programming.

943
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,300
There's no one would suspect it.

944
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,460
No one would suspect it.

945
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,700
That's true. You have good cover.

946
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,340
Yeah. Yeah.

947
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,980
So I'm not doing it.

948
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,380
I think this guy's scamming us.

949
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,260
I listen to this podcast where he said all the stuff that his mom made him do.

950
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,540
Right. That would be that would hold up in court.

951
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,860
Thought a poster was going to land on his head and suffocate him.

952
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,620
Yeah. When I was like 10 people, I told I took five million dollars

953
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,740
from 10 different people and they were all suing me together.

954
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
And we would play clips of that.

955
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,580
And they would say, well, this man is innocent, Your Honor.

956
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,700
You know, like 10 years ago, the like

957
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,460
early streaming of 10 years ago in different websites and you know,

958
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,020
there was so much money flying around that some people just pocketed and disappeared.

959
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,500
Oh, yeah, of course.

960
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,380
It's all it's all.

961
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,860
That's what anyone was trying to do.

962
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,380
That's all it was, was being in the cash hurricane.

963
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,380
I grabbed I got a 20.

964
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,100
Yes, money, money, the Internet was just money laundering.

965
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,260
Comedy websites were money laundering.

966
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,180
But not happening, not like the fruitful,

967
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:20,980
trustworthy world of Orlando dinner in the 1970s and 1980s.

968
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,860
Now all of these now we start getting into people who I who I kind of like.

969
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,980
Peter Blaustein, as you said,

970
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,500
he was the producer of the show as far as the entertainment.

971
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,540
It seems like maybe do we all go down the rabbit hole of this person?

972
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,460
Because the rabbit hole of this person leads us to some people we really like.

973
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,860
Peter Blaustein was a longtime Disney guy.

974
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,260
He put together the opening ceremonies of Walt Disney World in 1971.

975
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,300
A lot of stuff for Disney program shows and stuff for them.

976
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,580
But at some point, he left Disney and went to work

977
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:02,220
producing dinner attractions for the company Orlando Entertains LLC.

978
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,260
He produced a show called King Henry's Feast.

979
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,260
He produced a show called Mardi Gras.

980
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:15,580
These were all on iDrive and Orlando Entertains LLC.

981
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,020
That name might not mean anything to you, but the guy who ran it

982
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,700
might mean something to you.

983
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,260
The name is Robert Earl.

984
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, the famed restaurateur.

985
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,580
He's always here.

986
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,820
The famous man who makes great sandwiches

987
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,340
for construction workers to fill up their hungry bellies.

988
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,060
It all started with King Henry's Feast.

989
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,340
You can feast like a king here in Orlando, Florida.

990
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,660
Yes, you can.

991
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,900
I'm going to make so much money for loud

992
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,740
Hawaiian shirts from King Henry's Feast.

993
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,940
Robert Earl is here.

994
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,900
So this guy is a this is a Robert Earl acolyte.

995
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,100
So the Robert Earl was not involved in American Gladiators, right?

996
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,420
Dinner. He would have made it work, I think.

997
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,820
Yeah, for three years longer than it actually is.

998
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,780
They're building the third or fourth location of the Earl of Sandwich

999
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,180
at Downtown Disney at this point.

1000
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,820
And it's like a like finally like a dream campus.

1001
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,460
Yeah, we're like a bar on the top of it or something.

1002
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,940
This might be one of the best spots.

1003
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,820
This is going to be fucking awesome.

1004
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,700
I'm so excited about that in the portos.

1005
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,420
Downtown Disney is where it's going to be where it's at.

1006
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,900
Yeah. Thank you, Robert Earl.

1007
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,460
We're all have sandwich briefly in the old La Brea Bakery space.

1008
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,260
I think at some point was in like a temporary trailer.

1009
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,460
Yeah, well, still is.

1010
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,540
You can get you can get a sandwich on the way out by the ESPN zone.

1011
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,980
But you also can get it at La Brea Bakery.

1012
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,940
Well, much like Walt Disney Animation, which was shoved into a couple of bungalows.

1013
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,500
Yeah, maybe everybody thought it was on the way out,

1014
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,900
that it had lost the good graces of the Disney Corporation. Right.

1015
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,300
But instead, it went there, it grounded out and it did its best work.

1016
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,940
And just as then Disney Animation rose from the

1017
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:04,020
rose from the ashes like a phoenix and made Beauty and the Beast in Aladdin

1018
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,860
and entered its golden age, so will Earl of Sandwich

1019
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,100
with its glistening new two story location.

1020
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,900
It's going to be great.

1021
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,740
Robert Earl wins again.

1022
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,020
It's going to be great.

1023
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,580
Would you describe the sandwiches as great? No.

1024
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,180
Yeah, I was going to say that was really that did confuse me.

1025
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,060
It's going to be great. The food, you mean?

1026
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,780
No. Fine's a good

1027
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,660
once in a while, you get a good one.

1028
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,220
And usually it's fine.

1029
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,020
Eight bucks or something. Nine dollars.

1030
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,060
I still, by the way, I'm like, you know, there's a lot of like

1031
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,340
and they got portos now and they got Dintai Fung.

1032
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,700
I'm putting money on these ending up the worst portos

1033
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,260
and the worst Dintai Fung in the entire organization.

1034
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:46,980
That's a good point.

1035
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,260
I don't that Dintai Fung looks cool, though.

1036
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,300
I haven't had it there.

1037
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,980
Oh, and I'm sure it's good now.

1038
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,740
Well, sure.

1039
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,180
Like if any location was going to start to lose the shine.

1040
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,020
Yeah, it would be the downtown Disney.

1041
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,860
But I could counter is Disney Springs.

1042
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,420
Our rest, like the boathouse is still apparently where it's at

1043
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,460
as far as like the quality hasn't dipped.

1044
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,340
Now it's not a chain. Yeah, yeah, sure.

1045
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,980
So what could could the magic be sustained?

1046
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,620
I don't think Disney Springs is as bad as downtown Disney or City Walk.

1047
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,580
Either. That's probably right. Yeah.

1048
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,260
I think there's something that there's something

1049
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,700
a more inherent quality going on.

1050
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,340
Portos, Dintai Fung.

1051
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,020
There's another place coming soon as well

1052
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,420
that has different kinds of food and drinks.

1053
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,780
I wouldn't I wouldn't get in.

1054
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,020
It's like there's a lot of things.

1055
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,060
Everything's under construction.

1056
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,980
Stuff takes so long.

1057
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,980
I just think there's so much vibrancy coming there and life will be injected

1058
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,620
that I think I'm very optimistic about the future of downtown Disney.

1059
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,220
Sorry, I looked at photos of it again.

1060
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,220
And one of the photos that they've released is a chef

1061
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,220
drizzling vinegar onto a bunch of tomatoes.

1062
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,860
The place that you say is the most toxic.

1063
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,300
No, I didn't.

1064
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,940
Masculine. I didn't.

1065
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,980
I said the market and like these signs.

1066
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,460
But they've only released three pieces of marketing.

1067
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,020
And one of the pieces of marketing is a man pouring vinegar onto tomatoes.

1068
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,420
Yeah, it's just get image, probably.

1069
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,180
Right. No, it's no, I don't.

1070
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,420
You're accusing them of just buying.

1071
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,740
I'm just saying that's very generic.

1072
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,140
No, what you said is that it's faux masculine.

1073
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,700
Is the faux masculinity in the vinegar or the tomatoes?

1074
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,940
Which which part of the equation is the faux?

1075
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,020
I thought just the black and gold.

1076
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,220
I like I don't know.

1077
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,540
It just it just drives me the wrong way.

1078
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,300
I don't know. Leave me alone.

1079
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,380
Look, it is my unfortunate to tell you that I will never stop

1080
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,740
thinking about this opinion that you've asserted.

1081
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,380
And I have one thousand questions.

1082
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,460
I listened back to people sent me similar things.

1083
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,420
It's it's something about when you just plop it down on butcher paper

1084
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,380
or like a silver like just that.

1085
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,420
But do we know that's what the restaurants like?

1086
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,620
No, I just said that we only know the name and a picture.

1087
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,540
And one of the pictures is a man putting vinegar on tomatoes.

1088
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,340
And I like that.

1089
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,940
Although I mean, we do like one of the three things

1090
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,100
and we do like steak, but we don't like.

1091
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,860
I think, well, I will write.

1092
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,700
OK, I will write a list of things.

1093
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,300
I have to collect my thoughts on this discussion.

1094
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,140
And then we'll do it.

1095
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,900
We'll do it on the Arthur and Sons episode.

1096
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,020
I did not mean to open a can of worms.

1097
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,140
Of course you didn't mean to.

1098
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,060
But when you say things like that, cans of worms are open.

1099
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,540
Here's what it was just funny, because you said it was very masculine.

1100
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,860
And all we knew that it was called Arthur and Sons.

1101
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,580
And there was a picture of some meat and a picture of a drink.

1102
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,380
And I thought it was funny that out of context of like the aggressive,

1103
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,900
like barbecue lifestyle with like menswear and this without any of that context.

1104
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,220
I thought it was funny to refer to that as like faux masculine.

1105
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,020
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, sure.

1106
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,180
Versus like the aggressive, like, hey, we have barbeque.

1107
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,900
We have our smoker out here and the guys got the apron and they're doing the whole thing.

1108
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,420
It felt very it did feel more generic, which is, I think, what you said.

1109
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,100
The second. Yeah, I think that's what I was aiming for.

1110
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,500
Yeah, I do tend to like barbecue.

1111
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,980
I think there's more craft involved.

1112
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,700
I think there's usually more flavor involved than just a regular thing.

1113
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,660
What you just said is we got the smoker and then you said you like barbecue.

1114
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,580
When is now? Why is barbecue the problem?

1115
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,420
Look, it's not the problem for me, unless you're a vegetarian.

1116
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,660
And I'm just saying if you have a smoker, that's basically a military weapon.

1117
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,660
Look, Dean Norris has a smoker.

1118
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,900
I'm excited about it.

1119
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,740
Everyone's in full support of Dean Norris.

1120
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,740
Of course we are.

1121
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,500
I'm just saying that's more of the aesthetic

1122
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,180
that I see a lot of where it feels like kind of aggressive in the way it's marketed.

1123
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,140
Arthur and Sons feels very, very nothing.

1124
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,540
It feels like nothing to me.

1125
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,820
But a steak and bourbon to me is a good nice treat once in a while.

1126
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,260
You know what I'm saying?

1127
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,460
I would agree. It's all just opinions.

1128
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,420
I just like a sloppy pile of pulled pork.

1129
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,180
I don't know. What do you want to know?

1130
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,260
Well, you're not. You can like that.

1131
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,500
You can like. Yeah.

1132
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,540
Do you think it's insane that people like steak and bourbon together?

1133
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,060
No, I was just saying.

1134
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,340
You can't deny that this is a combo that people have.

1135
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,940
I don't really like those things that much.

1136
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,700
That's fair.

1137
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,340
It was stated as if like it in and of itself was a problematic combo.

1138
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,740
It's just seemed a little generic to me.

1139
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,060
It just kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

1140
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,780
I've not really explored. Not like a nice dry rub.

1141
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,220
That's rubbing you the right way.

1142
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,740
I like a mustard base or a vinegar base.

1143
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,020
I think usually from the Carolinas.

1144
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,940
Here's what I think.

1145
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,260
I think Arthur and I think we're all going to get a meal we really enjoyed.

1146
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,220
Arthur and sons, bourbon and steak.

1147
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,900
I think when you find when you realize that that's not the only things that they have.

1148
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,860
Well, here's the thing.

1149
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,180
It's going to be a nice meal because we're at downtown Disney

1150
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,300
and it's going to taste at least a letter grade higher,

1151
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,780
especially if there's like a porch or something.

1152
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,020
And if there is any problem with it, it will be due to the fact

1153
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,660
that it is a restaurant at downtown Disney. Yeah. Yeah.

1154
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,300
Yeah. This is the greater enemy.

1155
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,460
And maybe we even like had a nice little time at the patio

1156
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,340
part of Earl of Sandwich before we go to Arthur and Sons.

1157
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,500
The future city walk.

1158
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,500
I have more of a mystery about what it's going to be either.

1159
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,940
But I think downtown is going to be good.

1160
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,260
I am excited about the future of downtown Disney.

1161
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,940
No, no one wants to get in on this with me.

1162
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,940
I'm a little more skeptical. OK.

1163
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,380
Well, the I feel like one of the best meals we have there,

1164
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,420
Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen within just a few years.

1165
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,900
It was stripped of like.

1166
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,740
Well, the personality of that person definitely sucks.

1167
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,500
Yeah. Personality of the place certainly was stripped.

1168
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,860
I agree. But we don't know if the food is bad.

1169
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,860
We don't know if the food got worse, do we?

1170
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,380
One thing I know is that the big rolling hills,

1171
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,300
like the big grassy area that they put in is one of the biggest hits

1172
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,980
in recent Disney history. Yeah, it is.

1173
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,620
There are so many children.

1174
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,500
Yes. Running, having the time of their life.

1175
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,820
Now, does this go against some things that I said about,

1176
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,420
I don't know, certain types of things you put on the ground?

1177
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,620
Gras, you might say.

1178
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,260
Oh, that was referring to different grass.

1179
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,020
You know what? That grass, that was a photo of grass

1180
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,660
that was very tiny and it's mainly used for stroller parking.

1181
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,900
Yeah, this grass is rolling and giant.

1182
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,340
Yeah. And there's like there's dimensionality to it.

1183
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,100
And I got no beef with this grass.

1184
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,300
My son had a lot of fun on the grass. Yeah, no, I the grass is all

1185
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,780
we've we've had a lot of fun on the grass the last year or two of Disneyland.

1186
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,420
Yeah. So my daughter.

1187
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,060
The grass is good. The grass is green.

1188
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,620
It sounds like one that they did deliver based on the concept

1189
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,700
or there was a lot of grass.

1190
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,980
Yeah, no, it's absolutely true.

1191
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,380
And so the future is so bright.

1192
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,140
This is the most optimistic I am about the country.

1193
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,100
It's just specifically at downtown Disney.

1194
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,100
At least one that's the only zone of several blocks in this country.

1195
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,780
Yeah, it's going to be better than it's ever been.

1196
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,220
Yep. OK, back back to all this.

1197
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,060
So now we're dealing with a guy who used to be in the Robert Earl

1198
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,180
enterprise.

1199
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,340
Now I know about King Henry's Feast.

1200
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,380
Now I know about Mardi Gras.

1201
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,580
And where all this ties together is that Peter Blaustein went

1202
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,540
to go work on a new show for Robert Earl.

1203
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,140
And all of this information is on the website of a guy named Ron Schneider.

1204
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,900
Ron Schneider was the original actor who played Dreamfinder in Epcot,

1205
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,100
the face character, the walk around guy.

1206
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,900
He also played a character who's come up on the show before.

1207
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,180
Old C.L.

1208
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,780
Whomp Hopper. God bless him.

1209
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,140
This guy is back.

1210
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,300
A man who is Dreamfinder and who is C.L.

1211
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,340
Whomp Hopper has entered the world, has entered the domain.

1212
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,940
There was always a crossover that we didn't know about between C.L.

1213
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,820
Whomp Hopper and Robert Earl.

1214
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,460
And here it is. It happened.

1215
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,500
So this guy's friend leaves Disney to go work for Earl.

1216
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,380
He's starting a new concept.

1217
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,700
And he asks Ron, are you ready to maybe

1218
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,820
hang up the big purple hat and join?

1219
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,780
And and he went and worked with Peter

1220
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,620
and Robert and made a third I drive dinner show called the Fort Liberty

1221
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,260
Wild West Dinner Show.

1222
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,740
All of these on the same stretch.

1223
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,140
You can go to every one of them.

1224
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,060
Can you eat each meal?

1225
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,060
I wish you could eat like breakfast, lunch and dinner at different

1226
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,460
theater shows on I drive.

1227
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,980
Spend your entire day, the whole day, all three meals.

1228
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,980
Yeah. Three great shows.

1229
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,820
It all only costs you one hundred and twenty dollars.

1230
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,620
Yes. Assuming that they don't get you with extra add ons.

1231
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,180
What a time.

1232
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,660
I mean, I don't think I really like how much Robert Earl made I drive.

1233
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,300
And it's all still in his shadow.

1234
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,060
You know, right.

1235
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,380
Is there there's there's a book of De Beppo there. It's all there.

1236
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,500
So here.

1237
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,220
So this guy, none of this is central to American Gladiators.

1238
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,860
I just I'm so excited that there's more restaurants we know about.

1239
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,380
So here's quote Ron Schneider.

1240
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,980
I'd seen King Henry's Feast and was wary of working for Robert Earl.

1241
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,380
The food was OK, but I'd found the show to be rather dull.

1242
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,620
I thought King Henry's Feast was beautifully produced,

1243
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,620
but too authentic and stuffy.

1244
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,700
If I'm going to create a show from scratch, I want it to be exciting

1245
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,620
and truly funny with a good plot and audience participation integral to the story.

1246
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,820
So with the first time that former Dream Finder

1247
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:13,260
and Seal Mom popper meets Robert Earl, Robert says,

1248
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,860
Ronald, I need you to understand one thing about me.

1249
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,620
I charge people twenty eight dollars for a meal that costs me one fifty.

1250
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,500
I put on a show so they won't complain about the food.

1251
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,940
Quote Ron Schneider.

1252
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,820
Do you mind if the show is good?

1253
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,380
Not at all.

1254
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,860
Then we'll get along fine.

1255
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,180
Cool. That's a scene I want to film.

1256
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,580
I want if there was any desire for.

1257
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,980
All right. Guess what?

1258
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,380
Guess what, Hollywood Studios, we're making Robert Earl the movie.

1259
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,860
Oh, we are finally telling the story.

1260
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,660
And who's that now?

1261
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,580
He runs restaurants just up the streets, up at the top of the studio.

1262
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,220
What is that now? Oh, God.

1263
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,980
Is that place still open?

1264
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,220
Yes, it is.

1265
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,460
I've why me and the host of a show I do and the listeners of the show

1266
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,820
talk about it all the time.

1267
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,820
So if that's a random sampling of the American populace,

1268
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,460
everyone's thinking about Robert Earl and his restaurants at all times.

1269
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,060
You sure it didn't just become a grocery outlet, bargain market,

1270
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,500
because I swear I know most things did.

1271
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,780
I know most things did.

1272
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,260
It's it's so funny, too, that he's just like,

1273
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,660
oh, I feed these little piggies slop.

1274
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:32,460
They don't mind because they're distracted like doesn't matter.

1275
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,820
He's really like that is such a like a shitty evil thing to say.

1276
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,180
Yeah, yeah. The food is awful and they don't care.

1277
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:46,180
I put a little dose of OK sauce on top of dog food

1278
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,260
to where you can't tell that it is dog food on first bite.

1279
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,660
You will buy the sixth bite.

1280
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:56,260
But by then, you're engrossed in this show and you want to know

1281
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,460
all that King Henry's feast.

1282
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,780
I need you to remember the acronym SFS slop for slobs.

1283
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:10,260
Is that a real one?

1284
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,380
No, because I would have believed that.

1285
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,020
Yeah, you can imagine it, right?

1286
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,780
That was a secret.

1287
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,540
Someone's listening who is in the organization

1288
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,940
and they're picturing the poster and they're like, my God.

1289
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,700
Yeah. How did Jason know?

1290
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,460
I'm going to get a cease and desist because they trademarked the term.

1291
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,380
Or Robert is going to like hire you.

1292
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,020
Because he's impressed.

1293
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,100
You get it. Someone gets it.

1294
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,540
Brilliant. Brilliant young man.

1295
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,100
Yeah. But then what happened to him?

1296
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,300
We're like, we put on a show so you can't tell that the food is terrible.

1297
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,140
Years later, Bucatepepo, there's no show.

1298
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,460
I think everyone's left to figure it out.

1299
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:52,420
Yeah. It's looking at the head of the pope in a glass cube counts as a show.

1300
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,940
Yeah. Any number of podcasters, they just come and spend money

1301
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,660
and they want to sit in the pope room by the deformed statue

1302
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,660
of Pope John Paul's sack.

1303
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:08,100
Also, by the way, in an episode, I don't know, like a month or so ago,

1304
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,660
I asked if anybody pre-gamed Conclave

1305
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,820
at the Universal Cinema by going to the Bucatepepo

1306
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,500
and asking for the pope room and that I never heard anything else about that.

1307
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,580
And I forgot that I said it.

1308
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,460
And then all of a sudden, last night, friend of the show,

1309
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,220
past guest Joe Quazzalla texted, I did it.

1310
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:30,580
I did conclave pre-game in pope room or I tried, but we didn't have enough people.

1311
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,940
So they turned us down.

1312
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,420
I pulled over to the side of the road to tell you this.

1313
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,420
I could not wait to tell you this.

1314
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,500
Wow. So one hero out there.

1315
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,820
That's great. At least tried.

1316
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,220
Were you getting maybe I'm getting ahead of you.

1317
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,500
Did you see what happened to King Henry's?

1318
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,820
Are you going to get there? No.

1319
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,060
What happened to King Henry's?

1320
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,620
It turned out it's an olive garden.

1321
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,140
Great. Great.

1322
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,260
Yeah, I think all of I think Mardi Gras is a Walgreens.

1323
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,300
None of these exist.

1324
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,260
None of these, even if Orlando locals are listening,

1325
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,220
maybe you remember them faintly from long ago.

1326
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,860
But none of them exist today.

1327
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,780
On Stage Entertainment, Inc. of Las Vegas, the company best known for the legends

1328
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,220
and concert impersonator shows, more guys,

1329
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:20,300
acquired King Henry's feast, blazing pianos and wild bills, dinner theater,

1330
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,500
including for liberty from then owner Orlando entertains.

1331
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,900
But on stage ran into financial difficulty, sustaining major losses

1332
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,980
from the now closed Daytona Beach

1333
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,460
and Toronto shows of legends and concert on December 9th, 1999.

1334
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,660
Whatever the mortgage holder on King Henry's Theater

1335
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,140
obtained a foreclosure judgment against the company after late and missed payments.

1336
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,780
And poor old Henry, old King Henry's was subsequently dethroned.

1337
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,660
And then on June 22nd, 2000, the feast ended and the castle closed.

1338
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,700
The valuable I drive real estate kingdom on which it sat

1339
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,500
was redeveloped into a less kingly olive garden.

1340
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:02,460
So the olive garden, I guess, is the olive garden still there on I drive?

1341
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,380
I bet it is.

1342
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,980
Probably. It seems like it would be.

1343
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,100
Olive gardens don't seem to be having a lot of trouble.

1344
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,300
No, they do. Yeah, they they thrive.

1345
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,980
Good margins. Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:16,580
Let me tell you, the olive garden food costs 125, but we charge 29 for it.

1347
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,980
Doesn't that take some?

1348
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,900
Don't you want to think that on some level, Robert

1349
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,060
Earl was like, I want to give good food to the people.

1350
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:27,260
Like, I want to believe that on some level he believes that the food is good.

1351
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,180
It's that he's now he's like a Kraven supervillain.

1352
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,060
I don't know. I guess I'm not surprised.

1353
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,620
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised either.

1354
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,140
I just want to know.

1355
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:40,180
He is like synonymous with restaurants that are uniformly bad.

1356
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,260
Yeah, we ever is.

1357
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,820
Are any of the Earl restaurants any good?

1358
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,900
Yeah, good question. Probably not. Chicken guy.

1359
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,300
Chicken guy's not bad.

1360
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,660
I mean, yeah, we liked I don't know how it's doing now, but it's a more even

1361
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,020
handed that guy influence. Right.

1362
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,220
Cut me a deal. Got to make the food good.

1363
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,340
Olive Garden, yes, is still there.

1364
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,940
OK, well, we should all honor its memory as we pass by that all good.

1365
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,100
You met this time.

1366
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,900
It's just this time where like there is a fort.

1367
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,580
There's an old West Fort and there's a castle.

1368
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,060
And yeah, sure, half of that stuff is still there.

1369
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,860
But I want all of it to be there.

1370
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,220
And it's yes, the world's largest McDonald's is there,

1371
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,140
but it doesn't look nearly as stupid as it used to know.

1372
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,340
This was the stupidest street in America.

1373
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,260
There is so much what happened.

1374
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,820
Decay and it's so decaying now.

1375
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,220
When you draw like parts of I drive.

1376
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,940
Yeah, because I walked a big stretch because my plane kept getting delayed

1377
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,340
on that Monday and I ended up walking all the way down to the Hooters,

1378
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,260
walking all the way back.

1379
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,540
You're just walking along I drive.

1380
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,140
I did. Oh, I walked so much that Monday.

1381
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,500
I was at City Walk.

1382
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,220
I walked through the hotels and then I ended up on I drive.

1383
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,900
You want to walk up to the Hooters, open the door, closed your eyes, said,

1384
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,420
you all should be ashamed of yourselves, slammed the door and marched away.

1385
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,220
Yes. I saw the seafood place

1386
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,380
that had like a big three different cars that deliver

1387
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,300
seafood with giant crabs.

1388
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,700
Did you see this? I posted this on Instagram.

1389
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,980
These photos were insane.

1390
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,780
I'll show you these. Talk amongst yourselves.

1391
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,780
OK, it's crazy. They were crazy.

1392
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:17,820
Like I drive is I mean, we just there's a lot to learn about it.

1393
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,620
There's a lot about its history is a lot about what it is today.

1394
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,060
I think we could do a trip where we only do I drive

1395
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,260
and don't go to parks.

1396
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,500
Oh, God. A Boston lobster feast on I drive has,

1397
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,700
I guess, a fleet of vehicles that look like this.

1398
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,060
Wow. A giant lobster on the lobster is bigger than the car itself.

1399
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,140
Yeah. Is that street legal?

1400
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,140
I know they're like VW bugs.

1401
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,660
That looks like an accident happened in a in a parade in a crazy movie,

1402
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,100
like Jingle All the Way.

1403
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,220
Yeah, he was driving through Lobster Day, the parade.

1404
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,900
And then like and then it ends up attached to his car.

1405
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,340
And he's like, ah, if you order seafood from there,

1406
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,700
I think you get it delivered in a VW bug with a giant lobster

1407
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,100
attached to the top of the car.

1408
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,700
It looks like the the red VW bug is being delivered

1409
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,140
like at like a baby by the lobster. Yeah, it does.

1410
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,620
And I was so excited.

1411
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,820
Mike, I know you want to be optimistic,

1412
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,380
but those kind of look like 20 year old VW bugs

1413
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,260
that have been moved in a long time.

1414
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,580
You think they're just parked there for 20 years?

1415
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,180
Yeah. No, I think that they look like the paint looks sort of new.

1416
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,700
Orlando listeners, let us know.

1417
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,220
Have you seen this proud fleet of lobster cars?

1418
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,540
I mean, maybe you're going around your neighborhood.

1419
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,420
Let us know or if not, send them your way.

1420
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:41,300
Order Smith, place an order and watch this armada arrive in your house.

1421
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,860
A lot of this thematic decay that you're talking about

1422
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:49,420
kind of reminds me of family friendly era Vegas.

1423
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,140
Yes, where a lot of stuff is still standing

1424
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,940
and a lot of it has been torn down and the stuff that's still standing.

1425
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:02,380
Some of it is begrudging, like begrudging

1426
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,620
that we have to run a knockoff medieval times and Excalibur

1427
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,860
that we have to do with.

1428
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,980
Do you think it's begrudge? I bet people like that.

1429
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,660
I know. I think people like I think guests like it.

1430
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,380
Mm hmm. But you think that would you think that would tell is like,

1431
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,140
let's just put a cheap gastropub in here.

1432
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,740
Just like throw some stencil art up.

1433
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,740
Yeah. I'd have to pay all these performers

1434
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,380
or like the roller coaster in New York, New York.

1435
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,580
And it's like we could take this stuff down

1436
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:32,460
and have another room of slot machines and make the same amount of money.

1437
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,260
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1438
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,980
Yes. Well, yeah, that roller coaster is begrudgingly kept up

1439
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:43,060
like the like the person doing the repairs, I think.

1440
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,740
I was barely fine.

1441
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,820
I'll fix one of the five screws.

1442
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,780
It was unpleasant like 19, 20 years ago when I went on it.

1443
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,100
So I can't imagine now. I don't think it ever worked.

1444
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,980
Anyway, none of this has anything to do with America.

1445
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,140
Just I guess it's it's all to say the pedigree of people

1446
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,740
who were putting this American gladiators experience to get a guy,

1447
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,700
an acolyte of Robert Earl himself, a friend of C.L.

1448
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,860
Whomp Hopper, a Padawan of Robert.

1449
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:21,180
This is the story of Dorff Plagueis, the wise

1450
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,260
and a guy who I consider a roguish Han Solo type character,

1451
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:30,540
Barham Korsandi, who marches to the beat of his own drum

1452
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:34,580
and doesn't care if his game show idea doesn't make any sense

1453
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,740
or if he ever gets caught at the Miami airport for stealing from the state.

1454
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,020
These this is the rogues gallery putting together this remarkable thing.

1455
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,860
And that's not all, because the real stars of the show,

1456
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,620
I think we've got a name.

1457
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:53,380
I'm just going to say all of the gladiators who you could see at this show.

1458
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,420
Some were from the TV series.

1459
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,700
Some were new additions just for Orlando.

1460
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,140
And here is the heart of the show.

1461
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:05,460
Dallas flame flash hawk ice.

1462
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:10,660
Jade jazz laser quake saber siren

1463
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:17,980
sky tank Thor Titan tower man in tower turbo viper

1464
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:22,860
Cobra rage raven electra and Tigra.

1465
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1466
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,020
That now that that's like a like a list of random words

1467
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,300
that I would say into a computer so that now I could be scanned

1468
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,460
and used as a forever. Oh, yeah.

1469
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:37,180
Just just put all that in and you can steal my voice after I'm dead.

1470
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,980
So that's the group.

1471
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,740
Now, I don't remember who exactly is from the show

1472
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,620
in this infomercial that you referred to, Mike.

1473
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:49,140
You definitely meet some people who were from the show.

1474
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:50,980
Let's see that.

1475
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,860
I know that I'm going off the Netflix documentary.

1476
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,700
Sky is original TV American laser ice.

1477
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,340
Someone named Dan, I don't remember what his gladiator name was,

1478
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,460
but Dan came for several shows and then

1479
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,980
realized it was shady and got out of there.

1480
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:11,380
Would be great if you saw Jade and laser and

1481
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,420
turbo and then Dan.

1482
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,260
He's proud of who he is.

1483
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,580
He doesn't need to impress you with a fancy word.

1484
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,140
He loves himself.

1485
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:26,660
Zap did not go, quote Zap in the documentary.

1486
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,420
I didn't go. I'm so happy I didn't go.

1487
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,180
That was a debacle.

1488
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:36,100
And it's hard to tell exactly what made it a debacle.

1489
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,980
This is what's a little mysterious.

1490
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,580
I guess we can go off of that infomercial a little bit

1491
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,580
that shows the promise of what it was and what it could be.

1492
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,780
You meet some of the newer gladiators.

1493
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:51,260
They get some sit down time with the host of the infomercial, John Romano.

1494
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:55,140
There's a sit down between John Romano and a guy named Tank.

1495
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,100
I love Tank.

1496
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,820
I'm really glad we got so much time with Tank, so much more than the other

1497
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,700
gladiators that you meet.

1498
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:07,380
Tank tells you during his interview, I strive on excellence.

1499
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,980
It's not I don't think of the word.

1500
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,900
He I don't want him to be smart.

1501
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,220
I want him to be strong.

1502
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,580
A couple of things in there where I don't know that he's using language correctly.

1503
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,820
It's not so far off.

1504
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:21,020
No, I know what he's going for.

1505
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:24,900
Yeah, they follow Tank to jungle land

1506
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,820
where you see exactly the kind of man Tank is.

1507
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,500
He meets up with Jeff Quattrochi.

1508
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,060
I regret not writing that down.

1509
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,860
Thank you for catching that, Mike.

1510
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,860
So Tank and Jeff Quattrochi

1511
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,100
start looking around at all the wild animals you can see at jungle land.

1512
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,220
I guess another Kissimmee attraction.

1513
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:47,860
And Tank decides it's not enough just to look.

1514
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,660
He wants to wrestle.

1515
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,540
He wants to get in there and get up close and personal with some gators.

1516
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,260
And he like, yeah, he's like he touches him.

1517
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,620
He's like got him by the mouth.

1518
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,700
He keeps like being like, I'm not going to hurt these.

1519
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,100
Don't worry. I'm not hurting him.

1520
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,700
Then he's like he's like shoving his chin to force an alligator's chin

1521
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,900
close, like an alligator's mouth closed.

1522
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,900
And you're like, guess you're not hurting him.

1523
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,340
Well, you got to be annoying animal.

1524
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,900
Yeah. Animal doesn't need you doing that.

1525
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,620
Yeah. Yeah. The animal probably wants to.

1526
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:21,420
Yeah. The gator wants to be able to open and close its own mouth.

1527
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,580
Gator jaws closed gently, right?

1528
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,300
As far as I know. OK.

1529
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,900
That's what Tank believed, at least in filming this piece.

1530
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,420
Tank also then he climbs on top of the hundred and twenty six foot

1531
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,700
alligator that is out front of jungle land.

1532
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,020
I want to know more about jungle land as well, quite frankly.

1533
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,980
Then at the end of the piece, he tells you, I'm not the prettiest one,

1534
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:47,460
but I can guarantee I'm the craziest one.

1535
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,420
So Tank, Tank, Tank's great.

1536
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,340
You meet Titan, you meet Dallas, you meet Thor.

1537
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,620
You meet Flash.

1538
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:02,540
Flash touts his own agile-ness.

1539
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,260
Yes, I caught that as well.

1540
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,700
No, they're not really the word.

1541
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,500
Yeah. I found out Flash was hired to be a referee for the show.

1542
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,660
And then original series gladiator Viper got sidelined.

1543
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,700
And before you know it, this guy became Flash.

1544
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,140
Yeah. You're in Flash.

1545
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,020
The most interesting of the.

1546
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,100
I don't know. Tank's probably the most interesting.

1547
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:33,540
But eventually you meet a female gladiator by the name of Siren.

1548
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:36,620
You get a bunch of time with Siren.

1549
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:41,660
John Romano, the host, seems especially eager to talk up Siren,

1550
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:45,260
seems really fawning over Siren in particular and telling you all about

1551
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:50,740
Siren's life story and how Siren went deaf very sadly when she was very young.

1552
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,820
But that did not stop her from becoming exceedingly strong

1553
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,020
and winning a lot of bodybuilding competitions and getting into America's

1554
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,780
Cup, the yachting competition.

1555
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,580
And you're kind of like, why are we going on and on?

1556
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:03,260
So I mean, this is all nice, but like there's an energy here.

1557
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:06,140
And then he says, and she's probably got to be one of my favorite.

1558
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:10,420
Let's say my the favorite, my favorite of all gladiators in the show,

1559
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:14,980
because I happen to be married to her. So he goes, she I think he goes,

1560
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:18,740
she's my wife or something like he gets so like cute.

1561
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,180
He gets like so like mushy all of a sudden,

1562
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,980
because I actually didn't know where it was going.

1563
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,140
I'm just like, he's really talking about her a lot.

1564
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,980
And then he also goes like, she's my wife.

1565
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,580
Maybe I shouldn't say that, but that was the vibe.

1566
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,820
That's what I remember.

1567
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,820
He got all like, like that.

1568
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,380
That was the energy all of a sudden.

1569
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:36,620
This is the toughest, toughest gal you're going to see out on the floor.

1570
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,060
And also.

1571
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,820
So then I start having a lot of questions at this point.

1572
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,780
Don't get me in this interaction.

1573
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,500
Everything seems fine, but I'm also like, why?

1574
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,260
Why is this guy the host of this?

1575
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,620
And I thought I saw him in the documentary clips, too.

1576
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,420
He's the host of the live show as well.

1577
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:03,220
He's the person who introduces the gladiator dancers is the kind of thing

1578
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,980
that tells you maybe this won't be like as good as the show if they are killing

1579
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:09,780
time with dancing and if they are killing time with something

1580
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:13,260
that Siren gets to do, which is because she's deaf.

1581
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,540
She does a performance of Heal the World of Michael Jackson's Heal the World

1582
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:21,620
using sign language, yes, sung by the most questionable Michael Jackson

1583
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,620
impersonator you've ever and all of this.

1584
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,140
Like, well, like, all right, that's that's nice and fine.

1585
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:30,620
But also you're like, what's the show, though?

1586
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,860
Like it's so why is that gladiator?

1587
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,380
Yeah, it seems like a lot of extra stuff.

1588
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,980
And then, like, I'm there to see the thrust or whatever.

1589
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,620
I'm not here to see John Romano.

1590
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,740
Who's John Romano?

1591
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,900
And there's there was just enough

1592
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:48,780
shadiness to this guy that I started having some questions about John Romano.

1593
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,980
I do some googling about John Romano.

1594
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:57,660
I discover that he became because I was like, is he part of it because he's

1595
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:01,620
married to Siren or did they meet doing this?

1596
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,540
Like, what what brings him into the picture?

1597
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:09,140
And it's that he met her when they were both bodybuilders.

1598
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,620
And he said, I'll become your manager.

1599
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,100
And also, let's get married.

1600
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,340
The best arrangement that you can have.

1601
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,260
If you're looking for a manager, choose your significant other.

1602
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:24,580
Oh, just a little bit of basically I just all right.

1603
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:28,620
Let me just like look up a few interviews with John Romano, bodybuilder,

1604
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:33,580
pretty quickly find an interview where he's saying a bunch of stuff about how,

1605
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:37,860
well, I ended up in Mexico because my wife kidnapped my child.

1606
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,180
That's where he is today.

1607
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,260
He runs a gold's gym in Mexico.

1608
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,460
He also started talking about another bodybuilder.

1609
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,620
And they said, where did you meet him?

1610
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,100
He said, in prison.

1611
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,780
This guy also did some jail time.

1612
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,580
He was a commodities and stockbroker.

1613
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,060
He went to jail for wire fraud.

1614
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:59,020
OK, a lot of like a lot more white collar crime this episode than I was expecting.

1615
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,980
I know with gladiators you think it's like I went to jail for jousting a guy's head

1616
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:09,300
off, that it's all the boring reasons to go to jail.

1617
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,580
Why did you go to prison?

1618
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,660
Because I wouldn't rat out the group of guys who were ultimately culpable.

1619
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,220
I was the one exposed.

1620
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:19,220
It was me. I was a hero for going to jail.

1621
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,780
So, I don't know, a bunch of weird stuff.

1622
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,660
And I was like, wait a minute.

1623
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,380
So he was married to the gladiator.

1624
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,580
And then so they must have had a kid together.

1625
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,180
And then something shady happened and she

1626
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:33,060
left with the and then I kept going, no, married a different gladiator.

1627
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,940
He was married when this started.

1628
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,220
He was married to Siren when it ended.

1629
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:40,220
He was married to Electra, had a kid with her.

1630
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,260
Isn't that always the way?

1631
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,060
So this was gladiator on gladiator cheating.

1632
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:52,660
This guy is still around and I have a number of questions

1633
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,300
just about him and Siren, who had a very sad life.

1634
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,540
And I have questions about what happened there and comments lead me to believe

1635
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:05,620
that's not good, but also this guy, I think, is a proponent of steroid use.

1636
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:09,500
So I don't know if I want him coming after me.

1637
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,700
Just we may have a guy on our hands if you watch this infomercial.

1638
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,380
Is he the guy that wrote this cookbook called Muscle Meals?

1639
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,820
Why, yes, that is one of his claims to fame.

1640
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,780
I also saw the cover of Muscle Meals.

1641
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,860
Describe the cover of Muscle Meals.

1642
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,380
Well, he is shirtless.

1643
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,620
He's got a big whisk.

1644
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:31,620
It's a big whisk, too, like a really extra big whisk.

1645
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,820
And he's got a big chef's, a big, tall chef's hat on.

1646
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,380
And it says a cookbook to build muscle and lose fat.

1647
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:43,380
It says Muscle Meals, delicious, low fat, high protein recipes by John Romano.

1648
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,820
The giant chef's hat and the giant wick.

1649
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:53,300
And he is so muscly and so shirtless, because shirtless as you can be and kind

1650
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,820
of oiled up, it's a hell of a cover. It's a very good cover.

1651
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:03,580
He also is so much thicker today than he was when any of this was done.

1652
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,340
This is a massive man.

1653
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:10,660
He's like, I guess, like Stallone is really big at age 80.

1654
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:14,380
So and like seems sometimes bigger than he was when he was younger.

1655
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:18,140
Yeah. So, yeah, similar situation.

1656
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,260
It's a strange.

1657
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,540
I just don't. It felt very like you guys must come across people like this

1658
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,540
in the wrestling world. Really? Who is it?

1659
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:27,380
Is he one of the guys? No, he's like a promoter.

1660
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,980
But now why is he on camera?

1661
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:33,020
And people are just kind of like, oh, yeah, fish their way into things.

1662
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,940
And what it leads to ultimately, there's this clip in the Gladiators

1663
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,620
documentary that's kind of showing you how this whole thing was the nadir of like

1664
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,660
you've just heard one of the Gladiators say the whole thing was sad.

1665
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,060
And, you know, you go from like you're

1666
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:51,300
on TV and everybody's cheering you in a TV studio to now you're on a dirt floor

1667
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,540
and people are eating pork chops and and then they play a home video clip.

1668
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,100
And I think that's this guy, Romano.

1669
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,500
And he says, all right, thanks for coming out, everybody.

1670
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:04,100
Remember tomorrow, the Gladiator Grand Christmas Buffet from seven to eleven.

1671
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,540
The Gladiators will be there.

1672
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:09,020
You should be too. Drive safe, everyone.

1673
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,780
I just remember a thing that stuck out to me in the Orlando Sentinel article was

1674
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:19,220
the phrase, a number of the people have moved their families to Orlando

1675
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,700
because ended with the justification of like, well, look, Gladiators only tapes

1676
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,900
a few weeks of the year, so it's actually better.

1677
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,380
So everything got to go somewhere more work.

1678
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,620
This is better than the show.

1679
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:33,300
We they should be glad that they're here.

1680
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,540
Yeah, we give them the extra pork chops.

1681
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:40,380
I want to move my family to Orlando, so I'm jealous in general of it.

1682
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,260
I feel like clock's ticking on that one.

1683
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,380
Yeah, I can feel it. I know the days.

1684
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,340
I think I say to a different person every day in the last two or three weeks.

1685
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,380
Yeah, well, we could move to Orlando.

1686
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,660
I when we were down when we were just down there at some point, I told Aaron,

1687
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,180
Mike's going to do it.

1688
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,340
I just could feel it.

1689
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,460
If I look, if I had no connection to any family or anything else.

1690
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,260
Yeah, I'm gone.

1691
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,260
Well, you got to fix that.

1692
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,220
You got to sever your connection to that family.

1693
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,060
My wife better not kidnap my child.

1694
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,700
Then I'll be able to go to Orlando.

1695
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,340
Then I'll be able to go to Orlando guilt free.

1696
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,820
So it actually, you know, it actually worked out because, you know,

1697
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,180
there were some disagreements with my wife, but I was able to come down here

1698
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,420
and finally achieve my dinner theater dreams.

1699
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,300
It's something I've been talking about

1700
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,740
on this podcast that I stopped doing. I got rid of them, too.

1701
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,780
And I came down here.

1702
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:34,420
I gained 100 pounds in muscle weight and I and I run this awesome dinner theater.

1703
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,740
I feel like I served the shittiest steak

1704
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:41,100
in the shittiest bourbon to a bunch of a bunch of dudes.

1705
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,900
It sucks. The food sucks.

1706
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:49,380
I spent 25 cents per meal, the lowest quality steak and lowest quality.

1707
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,260
But it's protein.

1708
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,340
Fucking animals will eat it.

1709
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,300
They don't give a shit.

1710
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,900
You want to say, hey, you want to tell me there's anything full about this

1711
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,060
masculinity, rip your shirt off, flex.

1712
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,900
I'm bigger than John Romano now.

1713
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:01,860
It's my new life.

1714
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,420
Mike weighs 360 pounds.

1715
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,900
I do feel like 10 years talking about wrestling.

1716
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,660
We're out of connection.

1717
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:12,980
I feel like Mike was like, you know, you know, you can buy creativity or like

1718
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,660
human growth hormone when properly administered.

1719
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,900
It's G or what's the one that's good for your joints and skin?

1720
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:23,100
It's just powder, your collagen, collagen.

1721
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,660
And a lot of questions for Jane about red lights.

1722
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:29,220
This is we're going to come to we like at some point, Mike is going to leave.

1723
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,380
We're going to go visit Mike.

1724
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:36,860
He's going to have the home that is seven times bigger than what we have combined

1725
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:42,300
here. And he's going to he will live in it alone, but he will be alone.

1726
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,180
He'll be essentially like a human refrigerator size wise.

1727
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,340
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:54,700
I did find and jaw wise, you'll be as square as a refrigerator and I'll be young

1729
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,860
looking to Jason Scott.

1730
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,340
Oh, my God. It's been a minute.

1731
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,100
Why is your hair that color?

1732
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,620
Why is your hair so white?

1733
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,140
Come on. Can I get you guys anything?

1734
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,180
Twenty raw eggs.

1735
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,500
Anything.

1736
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,980
And this is Jason.

1737
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,060
You come around on that yet.

1738
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,340
You will. I'll make you do it.

1739
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,020
I know the good stuff.

1740
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,060
And I got black and gold in the office here.

1741
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,700
I want you to enjoy the aesthetic.

1742
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:18,900
Makes me feel good.

1743
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:19,900
This is outlaw.

1744
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,300
This is I go by outlaw now.

1745
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,900
It's funny. You gave me that name as a joke in that one episode.

1746
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,340
And I thought, huh, I can see that I can really see that.

1747
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,860
I'm talking to a couple of guys that I met overseas about investing in a couple

1748
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,260
of different restaurant ventures.

1749
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,260
You guys want to end?

1750
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,940
There's a lot of.

1751
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,500
Everyone talks about the hair science in Turkey,

1752
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,220
but the cuisine science coming out of there.

1753
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,580
I'm also marketing a new line of hair growth tonic.

1754
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,060
I also what I figured out.

1755
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,380
So I'm talking to the Ninja Turtle guys to try to get the rights.

1756
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,700
I think they're going to come around.

1757
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,180
But if they don't, it's just it's just they can't copyright the word turtle

1758
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,100
and they can't copyright martial arts in general.

1759
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,780
So it's the it's the turtle martial arts dinner theater.

1760
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,500
You root for whichever.

1761
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,820
And we know we're prepared to use different Renaissance painter names if we have to.

1762
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,660
Yeah. And look, I got look, I can fall right back on Battletoads.

1763
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,940
I got the guy who owns the Battletoads.

1764
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,220
He's ready to go. He wants to get in on this.

1765
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:17,580
He's going to invest in my hair growth tonic, too.

1766
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,940
And so he's really like, I'm in my back pocket.

1767
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,500
No problem.

1768
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,220
You guys make yourself at home.

1769
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,660
What do you want? You want the guest room over here, Jason?

1770
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:27,540
There you go.

1771
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,740
This is all future builds to the karate

1772
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,740
tortoise grand champions dinner explosion.

1773
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,380
Yeah, that is a water bed, Jason.

1774
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,260
Now it's

1775
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,620
the tortoises live in the bed.

1776
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,580
They like it in there.

1777
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:47,140
It forces them to seal their jaws shut.

1778
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,260
This is what they they prefer, actually.

1779
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,020
I take them out to wrestle with them.

1780
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,500
Then I put them back in the water bed.

1781
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,060
I'm not hurting them. Don't worry.

1782
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,140
I'm training them to not be able to use

1783
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:02,380
that snapping jaw to give to veer to pry that mattress open with their mouth.

1784
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,660
We lost a couple.

1785
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,580
No, they didn't die.

1786
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,180
It's just law. I don't know where they are.

1787
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,820
Remember, a turtle's tail is also its dick.

1788
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,660
Keep it in mind.

1789
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,140
Keep it in mind while you're playing with them.

1790
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,100
That was another thing. I always ran from that.

1791
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,580
And then I looked then I looked at that Leonardo one day.

1792
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:22,260
I saw I saw a big throbbing hog and I said, that's what I need to be like.

1793
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,580
I like not like him.

1794
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,300
Like the hog is tilled.

1795
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,740
It is green and green like dollars.

1796
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:33,860
That's that's all bad for me for me outlaw.

1797
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,580
I see green everywhere I go.

1798
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:36,900
I see Everglades green.

1799
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,060
I see green dollars.

1800
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,660
I see green karate tortoises.

1801
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,020
Hey, Jason, come on, make yourself at home in the bed.

1802
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:46,020
Why is he only talking to me?

1803
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,220
Jason, Robert Earle's fucked on that bed.

1804
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,580
I got a camera in there.

1805
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,420
I got it from the love sponge.

1806
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,900
He comes over here sometimes up from Tampa.

1807
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,300
Give me his sex cameras.

1808
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,620
I got tape of Robert Earle, man.

1809
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:03,260
You want to watch it?

1810
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,700
I'm not going to name names.

1811
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:08,780
But I remember we wondered once if the Gladiators ever listened to the show.

1812
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,180
Well, don't know about that.

1813
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,300
But I've had sex with three of them.

1814
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,020
I got the tape. You want to watch them?

1815
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,700
You want to watch the tape?

1816
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,100
I got the tape here.

1817
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,780
It's all shot in Bubba Vision.

1818
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,820
Jason, come on.

1819
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,020
It looks like you're going to throw up.

1820
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,700
You're not eating your steak.

1821
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,260
My life coach is coming over in like an hour or two.

1822
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,460
He's more of a guru.

1823
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:30,060
Do you remember Rick Flair?

1824
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,780
He's got this energy drink.

1825
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:34,780
He's 95.

1826
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,740
One more match.

1827
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:36,980
We're going to do one more match.

1828
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:39,460
He's only wrestled 20 times this last year.

1829
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:44,060
The old guy wrestlers get super strength when they punch.

1830
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,340
You guys seen my daughter around?

1831
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,540
She driving by now?

1832
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,980
No, I think she's 10.

1833
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,180
Cars don't.

1834
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,740
Also cars. You don't need to drive cars anymore, man.

1835
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:55,580
It's the future.

1836
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,780
I choose to.

1837
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:59,380
It burns as much fossil fuel as possible.

1838
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,500
Yeah, I'm an old school guy for a lot of things.

1839
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,860
Old cars powered by coal.

1840
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,140
My politics are old school too.

1841
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,340
2025 politics.

1842
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:13,820
Got Trump on my podcast.

1843
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,540
He's 95 too.

1844
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,700
Hey, he's fucked on the bed too.

1845
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,940
God, it's water bad.

1846
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,340
It's really sturdy.

1847
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,660
It must be all the tortoises.

1848
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,540
I didn't film that one just to be safe.

1849
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:30,860
But, you know, if you're wondering if there was a little white lotus action.

1850
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,980
Yeah, I might have done a little raise your hand.

1851
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,540
Go to the bathroom. Is that what you're about to say?

1852
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,820
No, no, I was going to talk about.

1853
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,820
You were about to raise your hand.

1854
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,180
I was like, oh, Jason, go to the bathroom.

1855
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:42,540
But we're on a roll here.

1856
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:47,700
No, I was going to talk about some remnants of American Gladiators live.

1857
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,500
Yes. Yeah.

1858
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,740
So the building is still standing.

1859
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,660
The building sure is still standing.

1860
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,660
Is it called?

1861
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,460
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the name.

1862
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,380
Is it the Church of the Rock?

1863
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,540
It's the Rock Church.

1864
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,500
The Rock Church is that.

1865
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,580
The building closed and the building.

1866
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:10,300
This dinner arena is has since the closure of American Gladiators been a church.

1867
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,620
It has been a church for so many years,

1868
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:17,700
for so much longer than it was ever Fortune Feast or American Gladiators.

1869
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:22,140
That this, if anything, could inspire me to start going back to church.

1870
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:26,540
If this was my local church and it's where it's where Outlaw will go.

1871
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:29,340
I go to church, I go four times a week

1872
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,100
and they left some of the lifting stuff backstage.

1873
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,340
So

1874
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:37,300
well, I mean, the hunkiest priest you've ever seen.

1875
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,900
Chaplain.

1876
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,580
In the chaplain get down, we lift.

1877
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:42,820
I was not.

1878
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:47,940
I could not tell if it was like Jesus is my rock or if it was a rock and roll church.

1879
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,620
Oh, no, no, no.

1880
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:53,820
Although that would have been a very good idea for a dinner theater experience.

1881
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,380
Another one that Outlaw could try to open while he's down there.

1882
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:01,260
No, it's well, the sign still says Orlando Arena on it

1883
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:04,620
as if it is the main arena in the town.

1884
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:09,100
But in fact, Orlando Arena equals the rock church.

1885
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,340
And then you can like, OK, here's what's this.

1886
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:18,060
It was this way during American Gladiators, too, is that it was a mixed use venue.

1887
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,820
So this footage of it in the Netflix

1888
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,980
documentary and it is like, I mean, I love it aesthetically.

1889
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,220
There's like a light, the lightest art

1890
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,620
deco, the worst art deco you've ever seen.

1891
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,220
And kind of some Miami style, just like pink neon stripe.

1892
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,420
Really like it aesthetically.

1893
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:38,620
But then it's because like they built it to where like, oh, and we can charge for

1894
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,820
stores that are underneath that are in the same.

1895
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:44,380
So there's like at the in the 90s, it was a T.C.

1896
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,980
T.C.B.Y. yogurt and then just like a liquor store.

1897
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,700
And today they're like, here's the sign, the rock church.

1898
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:56,500
There's a nails place, Indian restaurant, Farmer's Insurance.

1899
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,740
So Farmer's Insurance is just built into this mega church.

1900
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,860
Yeah, there's a Dippin' Dots,

1901
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,580
the brick and mortar store next door.

1902
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,100
I heard about Dippin' Dots.

1903
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,580
Yeah, I saw that.

1904
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:10,780
Have you ever been to a Dippin' Dots brick and mortar store?

1905
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,820
I don't think so. Always just dance.

1906
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,300
And you're a Dippin' Dots guy.

1907
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,420
I love Dippin' Dots.

1908
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:17,540
Yeah, yeah. This is an episode.

1909
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,140
I know, we've been talking about that for a long time.

1910
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,460
Let's do Dippin' Dots.

1911
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,220
There's as of 2023, there was another remnant.

1912
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:30,940
Oh, I found there's a YouTube short, a vlogger went and there is a

1913
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,660
I've never heard this phrase before,

1914
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:38,460
like a souvenir shop kind of adjacent to the Church of the Rock.

1915
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:44,780
And it says everything to $2.49 or less, that's $2.49.

1916
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,980
And on the wall of hats,

1917
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:55,180
there is a line of pristine American Gladiators Orlando live hats.

1918
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:55,820
Wow.

1919
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,220
So you may be able to still find a brand new hat.

1920
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:03,740
You can find this is an Orlando vlogger I've seen before, Mr.

1921
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,100
Nooks and Crannies.

1922
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,180
It was a funny day.

1923
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,380
We use videos and I stayed at a lot of hotels.

1924
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:12,020
I've looked up, you know,

1925
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,060
but I get Mr.

1926
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,940
Nook and Crannies over Travis Waterman.

1927
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,860
You can get a swole.

1928
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:22,100
So, yes, so if you're in Kissimmee,

1929
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:27,700
pop over to the $2.49 or less souvenir shop and you may be able to find

1930
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,460
an American Gladiators live hat.

1931
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,340
Wow.

1932
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,020
I would like that.

1933
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,380
I mean, that's like for a year.

1934
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,780
That's all I knew about this place,

1935
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,300
that there was briefly an American Gladiators thing and that it quickly

1936
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,860
turned into a church and I've like I've looked it up on Street View before,

1937
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,260
like long before we did before there was a podcast.

1938
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,740
It's just like, what does that look like?

1939
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:49,740
And there's a little, there's a little art deco thing.

1940
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,660
Like they tried to make it look cool and hip once.

1941
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:56,820
But now it's just and it's just a couple of stray details on the way out.

1942
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:01,220
Because like another few other things you notice in that old footage where it's

1943
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:05,820
up above the liquor store in the TCBY, it says American Gladiators dinner theater.

1944
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:10,220
And it's in a logo that resembles the font of the show, but is not the font of the show.

1945
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,340
I was watching this with Erin.

1946
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,460
As she pointed out, you never hear that theme song.

1947
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:16,420
You hear Mortal Kombat and other songs they probably don't have the rights to.

1948
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:19,580
But they probably the one that they had to and we could use the song, right?

1949
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,020
No. Whoever that was.

1950
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,660
That's like a great composer.

1951
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,860
I forget who wrote the

1952
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,500
Bill Conti or something, Gladiators theme.

1953
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:29,820
Bill Conti, yes.

1954
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,540
Al Nathot in one.

1955
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:33,220
I want to say.

1956
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,060
Yes. Yeah.

1957
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,460
Rocky Square composer.

1958
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,660
Batman too.

1959
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,940
Did he also? No, that's a different guy.

1960
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,020
Anyway, sorry.

1961
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,540
But yeah, the original man.

1962
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,900
Yeah. Who's Neil?

1963
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,820
Neil Heft?

1964
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:46,860
I'm confused.

1965
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,540
I'm confused.

1966
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:50,380
I'm confusing Hefty and Conti is what I'm doing.

1967
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:51,580
Is that his name? Hefty?

1968
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,100
Neil Hefty.

1969
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,180
Anyways.

1970
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,860
But so, yes, no theme, no.

1971
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:00,100
So it's this weird where they have the rights and they have some of the people,

1972
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,700
but like not exactly so good.

1973
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:03,940
So it's all a little bit wrong.

1974
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:06,860
I know that's some of the bit where it's a little bit.

1975
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,660
It's kind of a copy of a copy.

1976
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,100
Something's wrong with it.

1977
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,300
Is this sanctioned or not?

1978
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,180
I also like that in the infomercial, the number to call to get information is

1979
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,900
one eight hundred battle four.

1980
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,420
Yeah, they keep saying that.

1981
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,020
And they make people say it's a tank.

1982
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,420
Where can they go to?

1983
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,780
And they make sirens sign it.

1984
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:28,020
So everybody's got a plug one eight hundred battle four.

1985
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,020
And there's not like there's not much more to.

1986
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,340
Nobody went and filmed the thing.

1987
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:34,260
I know YouTube.

1988
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,380
So that's I can't speak to the quality of it.

1989
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,180
The only thing as far as what it was

1990
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:42,420
or the aftermath of it is that all the gladiators, it basically it has the slot

1991
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:47,660
in the gladiator documentary that OJ in Miami and Vegas has where it's just like

1992
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:50,180
and it's oh, it's all it's coming apart here.

1993
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,500
This is where it gets shady.

1994
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:55,300
And I don't think anything horrible happened while everyone was dead.

1995
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,180
But it was just like absolute misery for everyone.

1996
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,740
It made them realize this chapter is over.

1997
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,220
We can't just cling on to this lifestyle that we like.

1998
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,140
The show is done.

1999
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,300
We've got we got to move on.

2000
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,140
We have to see who we are now.

2001
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:11,940
And a number of the gladiators seem to have like unlocked a new chapter.

2002
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,660
And they're and they're still friends in their heads.

2003
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:15,460
So there's some like happy stories.

2004
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:21,900
But the this weird dinner theater just served as the wake up call of like it's over.

2005
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:25,700
That's a real hard pill to swallow once you moved across country.

2006
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,580
Yeah. Yeah.

2007
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:28,340
Brought the brought the family.

2008
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,420
One guy notably said it's hard, man.

2009
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,100
You know, it was hard.

2010
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,580
It was hard to be away from the family.

2011
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,340
And I'm like, oh, so you didn't bring them.

2012
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:38,220
Yes, Mark. Yeah, very possibly.

2013
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:40,340
What else? Anybody desperate?

2014
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,580
They called it sad.

2015
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:46,100
They called it I oh, another thing about it is that

2016
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,020
they had the same competitors every night.

2017
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,300
So there's the gladiators.

2018
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,060
And now all right.

2019
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,900
And now meet, you know, Michael Jones.

2020
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,020
But they put Michael Jones.

2021
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,780
They can't find a new Michael Jones every

2022
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,220
night to be like a new regular guy to fight the gladiators.

2023
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,900
So those were like ringers.

2024
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,700
And they say in the dock, like, we've got to be friends with those people.

2025
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,460
You don't want to go out, kick their asses.

2026
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,140
I see them every day. I like them.

2027
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,740
Yeah. So you lost the like cold gladiator

2028
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:15,740
defeating their enemy, dropping them off the wall.

2029
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,700
Yeah. I think the action wasn't good.

2030
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,780
I think there was too much

2031
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:24,380
music and bad Michael Jackson impersonation going on.

2032
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,660
Yeah. Again, no information about the food.

2033
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:29,420
If I had to venture a guess, it was probably not so good.

2034
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,140
Yeah.

2035
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,060
And yeah, I don't know.

2036
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:35,500
Like, unfortunately, this thing lights me up in concept and then just something

2037
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,380
about it, it was just a seedy affair.

2038
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:41,340
Is it because they would compete for real

2039
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:48,380
in events like it wasn't a stage show like Medieval Times is or Pirates Dinner

2040
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,980
Adventure? Yeah, I don't know.

2041
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,780
Wait, are you asking?

2042
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,860
Because this is a question Aaron had.

2043
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,540
It was like, was it fixed?

2044
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:57,580
Well, that is the overall question that I'm not sure about.

2045
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:58,060
Yeah.

2046
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:00,180
Jason, you worked on the newer version.

2047
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:01,420
Was anything fixed?

2048
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,820
You know, I don't have that question about the show.

2049
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:05,220
Yeah, I don't think this.

2050
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,140
Oh, right.

2051
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,820
I think the dinner theater, they could have gone like, you want to win tonight?

2052
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,020
Michael Jones, you in? Yeah, well, that's true.

2053
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,100
Yeah, that was a thing where I'm like,

2054
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:17,020
did they pull like athletic dads from the audience?

2055
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,900
And I'm like, no way.

2056
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:25,020
There's no way they're filling up a dad from like Tampa with clam chowder.

2057
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,860
And then they're like, get up there and joust.

2058
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,700
Well, I was planning on sipping on

2059
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:36,380
sipping on pitcher soup tonight, but I suppose I could climb the wall.

2060
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:43,420
I've had five Miller genuine drafts in the lobby and I am ready to fire the cannon

2061
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,220
at the audience. It's terrifying.

2062
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:47,460
You son of a bitch.

2063
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,100
You puked on Dallas.

2064
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,460
They didn't make it to the cheesecake that night.

2065
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,700
It's like a boxing match.

2066
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,060
So it's like a prize for like a boxing match could end in the first round.

2067
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:59,980
You might not get as exciting of a show with boxing.

2068
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:01,980
Yeah. Oh, you know what I'm saying?

2069
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,860
Like it could just they could be having

2070
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:07,100
kind of an unexciting night if everything was legit.

2071
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:10,300
Oh, and that's why you need to build why

2072
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:15,260
Robert Earl needs to weave a narrative in order to like sustain the again,

2073
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,660
to distract people from the food, like exciting things.

2074
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:22,380
Right. That's why you in the third act, you need a bunch of aerial silks.

2075
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,420
This show didn't.

2076
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:25,620
This is the rule of successful dinner theaters.

2077
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,900
Aerial silks while people are getting dessert.

2078
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:28,380
Yes.

2079
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:31,140
Or else they'll notice that it's very hard cookies.

2080
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:34,620
In pirate, it's in pirate's dinner adventure that you got to do.

2081
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,340
You're in the air with some like pieces of cloth.

2082
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:40,300
So that has to happen of the human body.

2083
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,620
So it's more beautiful.

2084
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:46,020
We saw it at at the Santa's Secret.

2085
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:51,220
There's nothing makes me feel more alive than somebody spinning around on a ribbon.

2086
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:54,740
Anyway, I it's yeah, it's it's too bad.

2087
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,060
This just didn't work for whatever reason.

2088
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:02,260
I think it opened around Christmas 95 by November 96 and it filed for bankruptcy.

2089
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,020
But it was one of those files of bankruptcy where it's like, well, it's actually

2090
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,340
it's good for us. It's good.

2091
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,180
And it's to help everyone that we're doing this.

2092
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,700
And then it did stay afloat for two more years.

2093
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,220
But that was that.

2094
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:18,820
And then they gave it over to God and and we lost our our opportunity to hang

2095
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:24,100
with the gladiators, to share a soup pitcher with Hawk.

2096
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:25,700
It was not meant to be.

2097
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:30,860
Jesus, take the wheel and our debt.

2098
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,300
So RIP dearly departed.

2099
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,380
It was as fun to talk about as I thought.

2100
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,940
I don't know what all gets promoted to episodes.

2101
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,100
I'd say Dippin Dots.

2102
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,180
I don't maybe there's not there's not a ton of information about.

2103
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,540
But I'll show you guys the flyers really quick for King Henry's Feast.

2104
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,860
Oh, yeah, I know.

2105
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:52,580
I saw those in Fort Liberty, one of which was in Mercado, Mediterranean Village.

2106
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,140
I have questions about that.

2107
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:54,820
That sounds interesting.

2108
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,180
There's no end to the amount of I drive that I want to know about.

2109
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:04,220
And I know there will be no end to the amount of I drive nights that outlaw

2110
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:09,860
hot on the town, newly unencumbered is able to

2111
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:11,300
is able to scrounge up.

2112
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,100
Yeah.

2113
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:16,060
And I just get like four or five chicken breasts.

2114
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:18,900
Kissimmee St.

2115
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,620
Cloud, the center of the action.

2116
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:21,900
Yeah. Dippin Dots.

2117
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,260
Yeah. WMAC Masters.

2118
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:29,340
My mansions literally in the center of the I showed them the ad with the bullseye.

2119
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:32,620
And I said, where can I be in the center my whole life?

2120
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:33,700
I've been on the side.

2121
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,500
I've been just watching the action.

2122
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:36,980
Not anymore, baby.

2123
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,140
I'm the action.

2124
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,220
You understand? I'm the action.

2125
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:42,420
And he throws Jason out his balcony,

2126
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:46,140
which is a big deal because it's four stories high.

2127
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:52,060
My Mike paid 250 grand and got the biggest shoddy mansion has ever been built.

2128
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,620
Floors two and three are not finished.

2129
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:57,260
And you know what? Neither is floor four.

2130
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,340
I also died, but I just stepped wrong.

2131
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:02,460
I've been building. I've been putting it together.

2132
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,980
They just dumped all the pieces on the lawn and I've been assembling it.

2133
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,980
But I can do this. I put toys together.

2134
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:08,940
I do Legos.

2135
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,540
This is like ultimate Legos.

2136
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:11,660
Yeah.

2137
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,540
Jason, I also sleep on the tortoise bed.

2138
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:17,100
So just a heads up.

2139
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,460
I'll be in here later.

2140
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,340
I'll be in here later.

2141
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,700
I do a lot of sleep punching these days.

2142
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:25,820
I'm going to be farting this room up like

2143
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,300
there ain't no God.

2144
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,140
Creatine and chicken breast don't make a good combination.

2145
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:33,300
And remember, we've got to set our alarm for 6 a.m.

2146
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:34,940
We got to go to the Rock Church in the morning.

2147
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,420
That's right.

2148
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,940
I'm playing lead guitar.

2149
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,580
We got to atone.

2150
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:44,100
Oh, I've been saved, by the way.

2151
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:46,980
I do most of Frankie Valley's hits.

2152
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,100
I mean, he's still out there.

2153
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,220
He's still out there performing, but I

2154
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,460
in a tribute to him.

2155
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:53,220
I hold him up.

2156
01:43:53,420 --> 01:44:01,180
I got baptized at the the lazy river at H2O Live, the Margaritaville Water Park.

2157
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,380
Yeah, that's no that failed years ago.

2158
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,460
Another church bought it.

2159
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,300
They had the whole lazy river blessed.

2160
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,620
So you could just crank through baptisms.

2161
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:11,220
You could do 50 an hour, you boys in.

2162
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,980
If not, I'm going to have to ask you to go back to Sinners, California.

2163
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:17,820
Most of the church bought up a lot.

2164
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:20,020
I drive, honestly, at this point.

2165
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,420
It's half more than half religion owned.

2166
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:23,380
All that olive.

2167
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:27,460
It's still Olive Garden, but the never ending pasta is all blessed.

2168
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:29,740
So it's the same as eating the hosts.

2169
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,780
Spaghetti, the old spaghetti factory is a factory.

2170
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:33,900
Hey, Jason, Mr.

2171
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:34,940
Trump brought a bag.

2172
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,340
Hey, Jason, after you're done eating the bowl, the never ending pasta bowl, you

2173
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:40,860
put our keys in it.

2174
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:45,180
You want it, you win.

2175
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,020
You know what I'm saying?

2176
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:52,260
You take the bowl home, you put your keys in it.

2177
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,820
Then we go to church next morning, though, to a tone, so don't worry.

2178
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:59,500
None of that happened since we walked through these doors and it raises all that.

2179
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,460
Dip your hands in that holy water, brother.

2180
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,300
We're clean.

2181
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,940
I know where they've been.

2182
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:08,140
We call this sizzling scene, sizzling scene.

2183
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,500
All right.

2184
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,140

Thank you, outlaw.

2191
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:28,940
Granted, it's really going to kick into

2192
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:33,420
overdrive when he starts scamming people for three mil a pop.

2193
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,380
If you could all change your pledges

2194
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:39,340
to 10 grand a month, that would really help us or me specifically.

2195
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,500
If you've ever been like, I like Dr.

2196
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:46,940
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but I wish it was just Mr. Hyde and he was crazy.

2197
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,980
I thought you were going to say Dr.

2198
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:53,020
Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, dinner show where they fight the one brain.

2199
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,660
All right, Team Hyde, let me hear you.

2200
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:59,020
The hard side, you're green.

2201
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,620
That means green for the monster Hyde.

2202
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:05,260
And where is my Jekyll eaters at?

2203
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:10,380
Now everyone come together over your shrimp skewers.

2204
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:13,580
Just like crushing up pills, snorting

2205
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:19,940
lines, say is the energy to do four shows a night of Jekyll and Hyde live.

2206
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,580
Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

2207
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,300
Fucking pumped.

2208
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,180
Let me at him.

2209
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:27,500
I'm at six more shows and get a four a.m. going.

2210
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,140
Are you not in Gorge?
