1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil is its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, What secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Police, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, you will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and what's to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Welcome to podcast the ride, the Downtown Disney ordeal. We are on level two, stage three. My name is Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Joining me is always Jason Sheridan and Scott Gardner. Yep, let's get to it.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And this is of course, this is a stage three. So who knows who lurks at the end of it. It's a boss one again.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a boss level. I'm not totally there yet. I don't know how to handle these guys, but you know, we'll be more steeled up by level five.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Right. And of course, joining us on this journey, the Sector Keeper is here.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, boys. Hey, you're with us physically manifested with us, which is always nice.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You give me such strength. Thank you so much for helping me find my cousin, the level keeper.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, we would not not help you. I mean, of course we'd have we have to. We're all you're our ward.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes. Yes. I'm your warden. You're like my three dads in a way. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Which that's yeah, that's where we're at. It's like our house kind of child. Yeah.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, yeah. Full house. Yeah. That's one thing you can't redo. Who knows things.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, my God. Well, I wait. It's November. So I don't know where we're at, but it's distinctly possible that Aunt Becky is or already has gone to jail.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, what? And Becky's in jail. It could be. I don't know. Or it's on the way.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm a little I'm not sure on the timeline. What about Uncle Jesse and her sons, Nicky and Alex, the twins?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, the character of Aunt Becky is fine. But Lori Laughlin, the actor, did some some naughty business. Oh, no.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah. Yeah. Her. How do you begin to explain her daughter is a YouTube influencer. I'm so glad you to please stay away from this. Yeah.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
As much as you can even even just dropping this at the top of a boss level episode.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is making us making you little boys.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sector Keeper, if you had to get like if you if we were the three males on full house, which ones would we be if you had to sign us the characters?

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's see. Fingers wagging.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Danny. That's me. Scott is Danny. Danny. Yes.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Organize. Hey, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I should be more of a neat freak at home, but I do.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You know, well, he's a he's a host and I try to sort of, you know, keep the just keep things moving in the episode.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's just like Danny and wake up San Francisco. Yeah. Wake up. Wake up San Francisco.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hello. I guess the right. Yeah. The cool one like that's what you were gunning for.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Honestly, I didn't even think about it before I said it. Yeah. Yeah. I play a guitar like Jesse does.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You have thought about how you want John Stamos to jam with us.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes. That is a dream of mine for us. Not musicians, except for you kind of. Yeah. I would say a musician.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm a classified as a musician. Yeah. He can you play a keyboard. Yeah.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But yeah, he'll jam with us one day. Absolutely. All right. And Jason. Joey.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I am a funny one with a hint of sadness.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just like Uncle Joey. Wait, we've got to not go through this again. My other way. We had we fell into all the thing.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My wife was very upset that we said Uncle Joey because they nobody called him Uncle Joey.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Uncle Jesse is an uncle. But didn't someone call him Uncle Joe?

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Didn't somebody point out on Twitter that there was an episode? A single example found he was not commonly

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
called. And you know who called him that was Uncle Jesse.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The children DJ Stephanie Michelle did not call him Uncle Joey. Did not give him that level of affection or respect.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This was the biggest fight Aaron and I ever had. Wow.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Never has she been so cross. Sector keeper, if you had to assign us the different characters in Three Men and a Little Lady,

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which characters would each of us be? Oh, I'm trying to remember. What? Gutenberg, Danson.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who's the other one? Selick. Selick, right? Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All by the way, three cool guys. So you can't accuse me this time of wanting to be the cool one.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you're worried for staying with funny with a twinge of sadness, that would have to be Gutenberg and therefore Jason.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Jason is Gutenberg. Hey, I retired early. Cashed out. Cashed out, retired early. Who's more Selick? Me or Scott?

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, that's awesome. Who's more organized? Danson or Selick?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good question. All right, we'll get back to that. But you're taller. Maybe you have maybe that's why you're Danson.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I guess I'm Danson in this and you're Tom Selick. Mm hmm.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Boys, boys. We're florals. All right, sorry, sorry. We're four minutes.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, sorry, sorry. But if I may, real quick, that if I, by not calling him Uncle Joey, I'm just realizing he was now just a dirt bag with a puppet.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
With a puppet who just climbed around. Yeah, it went from odd job to odd job. Failed out of all of them.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Great. Yeah, yeah. He lives in a basement industry bum. Lives in the garage.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Basement or a garage? Well, they changed. He kept moving. Was it a garage initially and then they changed it into his room?

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He ended up in the trash can outside, I think. It's like Oscar. He sleeps in the trash can like Oscar the Grudge.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're right. We got a lot to... Sad man.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sad man. Not like us. We're doing great. We're, you know, captains of our own destiny.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fighting the good fight for your cousin and we get to spend a bunch of time talking about some pretty great locations today. What are those?

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, yes. Boys, boys. You've made it so far and you still have much of a journey to go. But today will be...

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're getting tired too.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But today you will be trying to conquer by discussing and reviewing level two, stage three, Sanuk, Salt and Straw, and Wetzel's Pretzels.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Major ones. These are some of the titans in this episode. So let's kick into it with, yeah, I don't know, Sanuk. Do we know Sanuk?

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sanuk. Okay. Sanuk is a... Sanuk means fun. Sanuk the word. Okay. So in the Thai language...

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, and the brand.

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In the Thai language means to have a good time, to have fun, to enjoy oneself and to derive pleasure and joy from something. Yeah.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It doesn't mean, to be clear, Sanuk doesn't mean rise to the challenge.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right. No, that's a different word.

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's Sivakko.

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Most guidebooks to Thailand will tell you about the Thai concept of Sanuk, which often gets translated as meaning, as Jason said, fun. Fun.

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So Sanuk was a store that I never even walked by until we had to do this. We've done that until we did this to ourselves.

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not sure I'd noticed it, seen it. It's been there since 2011. Is it really? Yeah. Yeah. Some of these places. I thought it was new. No.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
2011. 2011. The brand has been around for a long time in Southern California.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wow. Well, so this is interesting. So I was looking at the first of all, the web. Did you look at the website for Sanuk? Hell, yeah.

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's when you look up locations, they all it's like confusing because it's not true Sanukes.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not listed here, but it is another one that there's a Sanuk in downtown Disney in Anaheim and Disney Springs in Orlando.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But then in Galletta, California, there's a Deckard store. Deckard Brands is the parent company. Deckard. Deckard.

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Deckard. Sorry. Deckard. Yeah. Oh, okay. Deckard. Deckard like Tim Heidecker's show.

89
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And part of Black and Deckard. Not affiliated. When you looked up locations, it also, and this is how I did this last night, it pulled up the Flip Flop shop at Universal City Walk.

90
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah. So this. Yeah. Deckard Brands. But the Flip Flop shop closed forever. Oh yeah. That's a newly fallen brother.

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What? I'm sorry to tell you. I guess you haven't been to your old haunt in a while. No, I can't. I need a ride.

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah. Because you used to live there and now. It's steep hill to walk. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This parent company also owns. Edwin wants to come up on the couch. Okay, come on up, Edwin. I guess he doesn't. He's fucking with everyone.

94
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But parent company also owns Ugg who makes Ugg boots. And Teva. Another sandal company. Another big sandal company. What? Teva? Teva.

95
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Teva was what I was wearing when I died. Sure. Whoa, you were wearing Tevas? Which I always called Tevas. Your family must have been well to do.

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But that means that this I would call this company a Flip Flop Monopoly. A Flip Flop Monop for short. Oh my God. Yeah.

97
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's maybe the worst thing you've ever said. Oh, Flip Flop. Yeah, that's tighter. That's better. That's why they pay you the big bucks.

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's most of what I'm good at is combining words. Yeah.

99
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He's taking in that time because it's so cool. Flavor on that one. But this is another big company. Flavor of jewel? Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is like Luxotica. This is like the sunglass monopoly we encountered at Sunglass Icon by Sunglass Hut.

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So this company owned the Flip Flop shop. Is that what was happening or they just carry their brand of shoes?

102
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think that was another one of their like lines. The Flip Flop shop. The Flip Flop shop. Or are they cheaper Flip Flops?

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't. I think they may have sold Sunuk brand in the Flip Flop shop. Right. That's what I that's my reading of it.

104
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But they obviously have an update of the website because when you put it in, if you put in the zip code, it comes up Flip Flop shop.

105
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I went, wait a minute, is that still there? And I was like, no, no, that's a fallen brother. That's gone. That City Walk store is gone.

106
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A lot of people feel seen right now, but that we are finally addressing the problems with Sunuk.com.

107
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes. I mean, people have been screaming at their computer screen. Our listeners have been frustrated with it for so long.

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And now there's a few things we know for sure from the Sunuk page on the downtown Disney website.

109
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We know our happiest days are spent in sandals. Yes, they do convey that.

110
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We know one of the problems. Sunuk, you know, from its early roots in the Southern California surf culture to its global lifestyle brand, it is today.

111
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We know it's a global lifestyle brand and we love it. More than just open toed shoes.

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a global lifestyle brand. And of course, your life open toed.

113
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
They invented the style of the sidewalk surfer, which combines a closed shoe with the comforting sole of a sandal.

114
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're we're doing we are.

115
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, this is how is this what we're talking about right now is like approximately like 200 feet from the Indiana Jones boulder.

116
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And we're choosing to talk about this. No. Yeah, sorry. I know. I know.

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sunuk only. Fine. This is a prison that we've created.

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Self built. This is a good practical place. Like if you're staying, if you're visiting Disneyland,

119
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if you're visiting the resort and it got really hot or your shoes got wet or something, you could go to Sunuk and buy some new shoes.

120
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But if you don't mind wet socks, as we discovered you, Jason, do not. I'm not saying.

121
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He likes Jason likes having his socks soaked in water. What?

122
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, we discovered this recently. Sexta keeper. He thinks like, you know, the what we would call an unpleasant feeling of going on Splash Mountain or the rapid ride and then your socks are what Jason likes it.

123
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So he says, you know, it's one of the worst feelings in the world.

124
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like Dalton Roadhouse says pain don't hurt. OK, pain don't hurt. This is an implied pleasure.

125
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Those Jason love squishy feet. Oh, I feel weak.

126
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, hey, you can't do that. That's only the sector keepers job. His move.

127
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My promise to Nuke is that and I brought this up on the sunglass icon.

128
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What's the name of the icon? I for sure brought it up on that episode.

129
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I remember that I feel like the too expensive. We need a cheap. What I like about CityWalk is that there's some dirt cheap options.

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like this is still a little high end. There's some sales on the website, but you're still like thirty dollars.

131
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give me some five dollar flip flops just just because I need them. You know what I mean?

132
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If you're on vacation, my whole thing with downtown Disney is I feel like it's catering a little too much to an operational.

133
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's like aspirational. Maybe that was plus the Disney tax on top of it.

134
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That Disney extra little bump that there should be some garbage stores like they have at CityWalk here for five dollar flip flops and five dollar sunglasses.

135
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's what I'm saying. You're not wrong. Well, you got to go to the CVS on Harbor.

136
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes, which, by the way, I argued should be part of this series.

137
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Scott was triumphant in keeping the harbor stores out of the downtown Disney ordeal.

138
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So you're out of bounds. Yes. Thank you for having me.

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Pass the car. You really wish that right now we were talking about, you know, a Tony Roma's and it'd be funny.

140
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll upset you were though about it. So I guess like that metal detectors to Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge van.

141
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you. All right. Sorry. Thanks for reminding us of the brackets.

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The Nukes in the brackets. The harbor hoedown is years away when we talk about all the harbor.

143
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was trying to think of it, but you got it. It's a fun one. It's not an ordeal. It's not a saga.

144
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We're going to have a great 25 episodes talking about Captain Kidd's buffet on Harbor.

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I so Jason is gleeful. I so want to unlock the mystery. Jason is gleeful thinking about it.

146
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I have a lot of I can come up with a lot of excuses to leave the podcast between now and then a lot of time to figure out why.

147
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You just take a leave of absence to spend more time with your family.

148
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Erin and Rex, Aaron and Rex. Yeah.

149
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So Newk, Newk did answer the question, where did my mother when giving me a stocking stuffer get these Mickey Mouse socks that are long, but they're not quite men's casual socks, but they're not quite like skate socks, but they are very long.

150
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And the answer was clearly a sinuke in probably the Disney Springs one because she just gone to Florida.

151
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The big thing that gets us back into familiar turf with sinuq is that this is downtown Disney's best location for novelty socks.

152
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know what? I'm looking over at the sector keeper right now and your jeans are riding up a little bit and I can see what you got there.

153
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Scottie Pippen socks. You have Scottie Pippen's big stretched out face on your cap. The way you are wearing it, his torso is very skinny and then his face is extremely wide.

154
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Because you got some muscle tone up there sector keeper. You're stretching Scottie out. Thanks. Yeah.

155
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You know, when you look at it for a second, it kind of is ugly and weird.

156
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I might say so. I posted a picture on my Instagram story of the unworn Scottie Pippen sock and it's very strange.

157
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Any of these like just a just a face on a like whatever the cardboard they put it on or a leg just makes a face seem super wide and weird.

158
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I do have to say the Mickey and Donald ones were more the spirit of them were more like their colors and their clothes. They didn't really have their face.

159
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I do want the Donald ones. I do have to go back and get them. OK, I like that.

160
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Nobody bought socks from sinuq. You didn't get the socks from sinuq sector keeper. No, these are from the stock market.

161
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, really? Oh, they're from city. OK, very good. Yeah. Scottie Pippen beloved since he is not. I'm happy to say there's been nothing since 94 whenever you got frozen that made us view him in a different light.

162
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, he rules. Yeah. He and Larsa just got divorced. I think. No, I'm sorry.

163
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That all of his records are I don't I don't I don't count basketball stats put up by a dirty divorcee. Oh, Scott. Yeah, I got to lay the law down. Yeah.

164
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I want good, clean, living basketball players. That's fair. Committed relationships. Did everyone come across sinuq's motto?

165
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, you guys know. And it's a hashtag to smile dot dot dot. Pass it on.

166
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, no, not hashtag, of course, because there's a shirt they have that says sinuq smile or die.

167
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, what? Oh, they had to get more aggressive. And it's the first one. I'll show it to you on the back.

168
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It says smile or die. There's a picture of the grim reaper with his sickle. Oh, yeah, that's him.

169
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And this is on sale for fourteen dollars. Oh, it's marked down.

170
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Those are moving. Man, he's going to be pissed when he finds out they're using his image unlicensed. Do you know him?

171
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, I spent time with him. Is he OK? Are we just judging him harshly because he looks scary? Yeah, it's I mean, he's just doing his job, right?

172
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Plowing fields, getting rid of corn stalks with his sickle. Yeah, with his sickle and what not. It's not a scary thing.

173
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He has to clear farmland with it. Like bush on his ranch. It's relaxing. He's a lot like bush on his ranch. Yeah. They hang out, I heard.

174
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey, you're not wrong.

175
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You were saying you have some things from the Sanuk.com in general. Yes. So Sanuk.com, I'm looking at their line of flip flops and a lot of their flip flops could be the names of Jimmy Buffett songs.

176
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So let me just go through a few of them. This one of the ones is called Beer Cozy or Cousy, I guess, Light. One is called Land Shark.

177
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, one is called Fault Line. So I'd be like Fault Line that he'd be like, here's my next song Fault Line. You go like, oh, yeah, that sounds like a Jimmy Buffett song.

178
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's say it's fun. If an earthquake happens, you get shaken into a fault line and there's a bunch of critters in there. You have a party.

179
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Vagabond Hemp. There's this there's one called Land Shark Hawaii. This one's called Frayed Knot. This one's called Frayed Knot Big and Tall.

180
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This one's called Pickpocket. This one's called Vagabond Tripper Slub. This one's called Chiba Quest Lace. This one's called High Five.

181
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This one's called You Got My Back. We got a lot more here. Chiba Quest Knit. Donny Funk.

182
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hold on. Did you see the yoga mat one? Oh, here we go. Here's the last one. Puff and Chill.

183
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That one's that one's eighty dollars. Yeah, I can get behind that one. Puff and Chill.

184
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, you get that now. There's Puff and Chill Low Funk. There's Chiba Chill. There's Vagabond Tripper. There's Chiba Weave.

185
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
There's Chiba Chill Cord. These are shoes. These are shoes and sandals. Chiba. Yeah.

186
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So TKO is one too. Vagabond Lace Sneakers. So they're all like kind of groovy weeded weed lifestyle adjacent, I think.

187
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And you know what? That whole store is full of grass. Oh, yeah. Physical location. Yeah. Yeah. So so kind of place.

188
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I read something about the yoga mat flip flop where they they're pushing that they turned yoga mat material into a shoe.

189
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I read some copy possibly from Sanuk.com that says move into your own away from home. Genuine left with the yoga mat flip flop made with real yoga mats for the softest, squishiest, most relaxing and meditative sandal yet.

190
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So if you want to always feel like you're about to do a downward dog.

191
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I saw a review and someone was like I think it was on the Yelp and someone was asking which kind should I get from here?

192
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And someone went well definitely the yoga mat flip flop are the most comfortable.

193
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Trust me. I have 12 pairs of Sanuk flip flops. What? I guess it's I guess if you like Sanuk you like Sanuk.

194
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, there's people probably mad at us now. Yeah. There's all these. Did you see all the ambassadors on the Sanuk website?

195
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They're like skaters and surfers and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Wakeboarder, Bob Sovin, Surfer, Brett Barley, Surfer musician, Donovan Frankenreiter.

196
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean, these are all the ambassadors. Sure they're comfortable. I mean, I have seen those sidewalk surfer kind of like.

197
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Wow. Did you say Brett Barley? Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Here's a picture of him with a pineapple in front of his face. And then there's this one guy who is using a banana like a telephone. Banana like a phone.

199
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Such a tough audience. That one got him. That one got him.

200
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh boy. That's that physical humor that kind of translates generations or transfers.

201
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So I didn't really see if there were I don't remember if there were UGG boots in the store like their other brand that Decker owns.

202
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But I was right when I like shortly after I had finished doing some research on this, I was watching Eyes Wide Shut for the first time.

203
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And there is a really weird moment where Tom Cruise, like home from a long day of work, sits down on his couch with Nicole Kim and he's wearing a t shirt and jeans and UGG boots.

204
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And it's so odd. UGG boots have been around for a long time. UGG is a brand. But like the silo boot have been around for a long time.

205
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It did get popular in the late 90s. But it's just such a startling moment in this movie because you think about Kubrick thinking everything. That's what Tom is. That's what its character hangs out in.

206
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Comfortable, casual, relaxing. Fur boots. This can be his ohm away from ohm.

207
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I didn't spend as much. You losers. I wasn't hanging out on Sanuk.com. I was on Stance.com, the website for the kind of sock that they carry and made the Sector Keepers socks.

208
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:11,000
This website, if they weren't fictional, I would say that at some point Stance became under the purview of clothing titan Jay Peterman and that he had his most trusted copyrighter, Elaine Benes, write the materials on the website because there are some flowery paragraphs going on.

209
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Go ahead. For some very strange socks. There is a sock of Johnny Cash's Mugshot. Buy that. Johnny Cash's Mugshot. Very cool. Put it on socks. The opposite of cool. We have washed it all the cool away.

210
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And I don't need to read the whole thing, but just to get a taste. If you're going to buy, if you're even looking on the website for Johnny Cash Mugshot socks, you don't need this to convince you. With a sound that transcended time and an honesty that cuts straight to the soul, Johnny Cash became an American icon.

211
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:59,000
His songs may be they about prison love, lust, hope, or redemption are inseparable from the fabric of the nation. Fuck you. Stance's Cash Flyer pays homage to the man in black thanks to its plush combed cotton and deep peel.

212
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And to keep things cool. Blah blah blah blah. I'm skipping a bunch. And to keep things cool, the Cash Flyer sports mesh vents. Walk the line with Stance's Cash Flyer.

213
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Boo. Fuck you. Someone get paid to write this? I guess so. I see the train a coming. It's bringing me some socks.

214
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I know that's going to happen, I think, with all this stuff. Because every artist, especially who's dead and was famous, their estate is just licensing them out. And it's just like the grossest. We just saw the Buddy Holly Roy Orbison hologram tour that's happening.

215
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it's just actors who recorded the performance and then you just see that. It's not even like maybe it's one thing. It's also not one thing. If you saw the actual performers hologram somehow, they recreated it from video. That's not what this is.

216
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This is what's bullshit about all these hologram things and the one that I saw at the Shady Theater. It's just some guy.

217
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Tupac was a hologram. There was no actor playing. I mean, maybe as a physical reference, but then his face was compiled from photos of Tupac. That was like a weird digital Tupac. The rest of this, they get some guy dressed up as Roy Orbison. What a piece of shit.

218
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's crazy. So I imagine they'll start taking songs like that Folsom Prison Blues and putting ads in it for whatever. Stans could afford it. After all, they were named the official sock of the NBA and MLB in 2015 and 2016 respectively.

219
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And won best socks of the year in 2017 with their tribute to rapper Gucci Mane. Wow. Who awarded them that? Well, let's check SneakScore.com just to confirm.

220
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're on a website where you just pass by some socks, some Vulture socks of Gucci Mane. Of Gucci Mane socks. Hell yes. Looking so tough. That's as tough as you can look on a sock. Sometimes you guys put words together that make my head spin.

221
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Look, it's just a lot of info to get it once I know. It's just stuff you find out on SneakScore, the top rated annual review of footwear technology and innovation. How has SneakScore.com not come up yet on this podcast in two hours? I'm using it as an.

222
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I've never heard of SneakScore.com. Oh, wow. So that is like where the sneaker head would look at for real. Is that like a sneaker heads inside the magic?

223
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Is it more like the theas for sneaker heads? I don't know. We should go to the theas for sneaker heads or whatever that is. We're not calling it the Oscars for socks. We're calling it the theas for socks. Yeah, the most prestigious award you can win.

224
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I mean, this flip flops of course went to the Gucci Mane flip flops. What?

225
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:18,000
How did Gucci Mane run away with this? Gucci Mane owns SneakScore.com. Did he buy it? Oh, I'm sorry. These are just Gucci flip flops. I fucked up. Not Gucci. Not Gucci Mane. Gucci. These are just Gucci branded flip flops. They're just next to Gucci Mane branded socks. I'm sorry. It's very confusing. I got a little overwhelmed by the majesty of these awards.

226
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean, I'm in a skull scorn. What's what? SneakScore. So what? I'm going to score ruled that the Gucci flip flops that aren't related to Gucci Mane were the best flip flops. No, but the similar color, similar color patterns. Best flip flops. Red and green. And both socks. Of course. Gucci Mane. Whoa, that's weird.

227
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And then you just got to give it up for the Nike Hyperadapt 1.0 and the Adidas Futurecraft 3D. Wait, what is the last thing you just said? The Adidas Futurecraft 3D. What is that? It's a sneaker. Yeah, I'm looking at it. Can I see it?

228
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The here's. Sorry. When you click on it, it disappears. It's like fucking the iPads fucking with you. And oh my God, what happened? SneakScore. Here's the Nike one. I like this one. Yeah, I like shoes. I'm not trying to put down the shoe community or anything here.

229
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And there are podcasts there. I know there's a lot of shoe podcasts. Be furious. We don't aren't respecting the differences between these things. They don't give a shit. The differences between, you know, level one, level one, stage three, level three, stage two.

230
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And this is a theme park podcast. Yeah, I think it's worth going to throw. We're going to throw rocks at every glass house we can find. Ours is plenty relatable. The most relatable podcast there is.

231
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:08,000
All right. Should we keep moving? I think we probably should. I mean, let me let me quickly say you can also get a sock that there's a Star Wars three pack and you can get a sock of like it's a three pack gift set for Rogue One that includes Death Trooper, Stormtrooper and Krennic, the director of the Advanced Weapons Research Division of the Imperial Military. Orson Krennic, of course.

232
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That's just the character's name. I like Krennic. Krennic is Mendelssohn. Ben Mendelssohn. So get him on your socks. I have one more thing that also will apply to I know we need to move on, but it does. This is important, I think, for future sectors.

233
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I saw. Sorry, sorry. God, I cannot do this too much. Mendelssohn is starting to set in. Big, big difference. It really is. So there was some discussion on an official Disney, Sanuk website of somebody who was confused about are they talking about the one in Florida or in Anaheim.

234
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And this might be from a time where both were called downtown. Not now. It's Disney Springs in Orlando. So this is an official Disney response. Hi, Patrick. I'm sorry for the confusion. When we say downtown Disney district, we are referring to Disneyland Resort at Walt Disney World Resort.

235
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We simply say downtown Disney. I realize that it's just a slight difference, but I hope that might help with any confusion in the future.

236
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So, guys, we fucked up the real name of this place that we're already deep into a show about a series about is the downtown is not the downtown Disney district. So this whole thing should be called downtown Disney district ordeal.

237
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Right. But now is it too late? Yes. Yes. We've done the song and how much work are we supposed to do? But I think this will change how what the audience does going forward. So no more retire your beloved hashtag DDO. It is now hashtag DDD.

238
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And rewrite your previous tweets, delete them, clear them out, pretend that they're cancelable and don't let anyone see your your shameful DDO. Everyone else in the room is rubbing their eyes.

239
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Why this person spoke to Patrick laid the law down and we have to be respectful. We've all spoken to Patrick. No, I just.

240
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It truly is an ordeal. We have a family of a district in a city and his family, even though it's town downtown district, downtown Disney district.

241
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Awful. OK, we have to buy it. So it's downtown Disney district. Yeah. From now on. OK, now let's move on to the ice cream store. All right.

242
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And I'll take a breather while Jason. Sure. I got to take the bathroom break, Jason. Please. Well, you know, like a really rich ice cream, I'm going to keep this one short and sweet.

243
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think I've made my feelings about the more bourgeois ice cream dealers kind of known in past episodes. Yeah, I don't remember.

244
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm really mixed emotions about them because I think ice cream, it's so delicious. It's for everyone.

245
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's something made in such large quantities when places like charge a lot for it. I'm like, God damn it.

246
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Really. And I find them a little exhausting. And I think salt and straw is one of the more exhausting ones.

247
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I of the nice, quote unquote, nice ice cream establishments. I am a big fan of Ample Hills located at Disney Boardwalk Resort coming soon to Disney Springs in Orlando and one here in Los Angeles.

248
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I like Ample Hills a lot. I like Santa Monica based sweet rose creamery.

249
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But salt and straw is one of the ones like that, like Jenny's where it's like the lines are so long and it costs so much money for a single spoon. You don't know what Jenny's is.

250
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You're so much more up on the ice cream scene. Jenny's is the one that gave everyone Listeria and had to shut down and scrape some batches.

251
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Salt and straw, like I like just the regular like like a salted caramel from there. They they kind of got known for doing the like Thanksgiving stuffing or cornbread flavor or they have one with olives in it.

252
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I really like it. I don't like olives in general. I like goat cheese. I've had goat cheese stuff before.

253
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But like it's more goat cheesy than. Yeah, I don't know. I like this place. I made a point of going to the other one in Studio City. I think you're right. It's it's it's a hefty price.

254
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But I don't know how much is it? What do you think? What is your price point for a cone? A cone with a scoop should be under five dollars.

255
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I would agree with that. And it is not. I don't believe it is closer to six or seven. Right. But isn't Jenny's expensive, too? I'm saying that one's too.

256
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're saying that was bad, too. But I think Ample Hill is usually right on the line and they innovate it with that ice cream flight.

257
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I really admire them for that. Yes, of course.

258
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I mean, salt and straw is definitely like it is a good get. It's very popular right now.

259
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It makes sense in terms of revitalizing the downtown and an improvement over Haagen Dazs, which I think Haagen Dazs is too expensive for what you get.

260
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's gourmet prices and more like Baskin Robbins quality. Sometimes I think it's a little better.

261
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I mean, I get why it's usually priced around like the Ben and Jerry's price point.

262
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, I like it. It was definitely like the the people's expectations, I think, have changed since the late 90s, early 2000s.

263
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You have great passion for ice cream. I sure do. Sectorkeeper.

264
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I know we've talked about before, like, you know, the Disney, the the the ones on Main Street and Buena Vista Street are just using dryers or Edie's, whatever you call it.

265
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But it's like that Disney boost. It makes it taste so much better. I do like the dryers a lot on Main Street.

266
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I have the cookie dough. I have a sherbet. I like I'm trying to find the price.

267
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It looks like obviously there's it's more at the Disney location. Sure. Yeah. Than it is anywhere else.

268
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And that's the other. It's so it's already a little pricier than your Baskin Robbins or your Haagen-Dazs, certainly.

269
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But then you get that Disney, that downtown Disney district tax on top of it. Very good.

270
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
What's your feeling on Salt and Stroum? I forgot to get it and I haven't tried it yet.

271
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, I think you'll have it and think it's a good ice cream. It's probably a little too expensive.

272
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You know what? I think I like it logo wise and their big sort of like I see land door handles.

273
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I think it's an it's appealing aesthetically. I think that it's very appealing aesthetically inside walked inside.

274
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, there was back when the line was truly, truly insane. The wood is nice. I think it looks good.

275
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a good mix between like the aesthetic of what's there right now and, you know, maybe a more modern kind of design.

276
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So it's good. It looks I mean, it looks obviously much classier than the Haagen-Dazs.

277
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And yet it's probably not much more special. I like the idea of these kinds of places having more like it's a local California.

278
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I don't know if it's a local brand and that it's not a Haagen-Dazs you can find in any mall.

279
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't like any of the things in any in where there would be CityWalker downtown Disney where this would be anywhere.

280
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It should be special. It should be something that isn't everywhere.

281
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That's what I said about the Ben & Jerry's CityWalk. It was like a little bit of a boring interior.

282
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I mean, outside there's the fun. What is it? The cow.

283
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The cow crashed in. That's fine. Yeah, you know, you were really hard on the interior.

284
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I do remember really really hard on the interior of Ben & Jerry's.

285
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
What's that? They had redone that. I feel like they slapped a bunch of wood in there. But it's not as good as the Salt and Straw.

286
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Salt and Straw looks a little I like a little more brighter pastel-y like a traditional Ben & Jerry's or an Ample Hills really has that like hand painted pastel.

287
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Go Mary Ample Hills then. That's not who moved in. Salt and Straw has got to be Salt and Straw.

288
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You're Ample Hills. Ample Hills is expensive too.

289
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And it's good. I just think. I don't know. I don't know. I really wish I didn't forget to try this yet because I think Ample Hills is good.

290
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This is fine. Do it tonight and review it in tomorrow's episode. Maybe it will.

291
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Ample Hills, I think you just like the flights. I mean, I like the flights.

292
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The flights have delighted you so much that you can have three different scoops that that I think is making you such an Ample Hills stan.

293
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
He's going to kill for him. We'll see. I don't know.

294
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You're genuinely like shutting down. You're like how dare any of these rubes question Jason's ice cream opinions.

295
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I just think it's a little much. That's definitely the newer downtown Disney stuff. It's a few dollars more on top of what was already a few dollars more.

296
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
As I said before, I think everything's a little too expensive, especially when we're dealing with clothing and sunglasses.

297
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It is. Yes. I'm just saying that.

298
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Which adds to the exhaustion of doing these things. We're all going to places that cost too much money.

299
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes. But then and then it makes us complain about doing it here within the episode that you're listening to.

300
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes, it's a true ordeal. It's on point for what the districts go for and it's on point for what we have called it.

301
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The correct word. I had a feeling it was going to be rougher this time around.

302
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It is. But I think it's an unfair note to give to say. So I don't like the inside of Salton's Draw. It should be like Ample Hills.

303
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm saying there was already an ice cream parlor, a craft ice cream parlor. Disney had an existing relationship and they did not extend it.

304
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What if they were difficult? What if it was on them? What if Ample Hills?

305
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Good. They should. Everyone should charge Disney a lot of money.

306
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But then prices go up. Then we're paying more too.

307
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We're going to have to figure that. We're going to have to figure out because Ample Hills still is very chummy with Disney and they release their Marvel flavors and their Mickey flavors.

308
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So I wonder what the situation is. And Pop Iger owns stock in them.

309
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Sure. He probably gets a case of ice cream every week for free. Free flight when he gets to work every day.

310
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh yeah. Oh my God. Jason's dream. Oh, I would love to. A free flight on the desk every morning?

311
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I eat the flight on my own once and my throat hurts so much from that amount of sugar.

312
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
One man is not meant to eat that much sugar in one sitting. But it hurts so good, baby.

313
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You've got a lot of opportunities to get sick during this ordeal. Yes. And I have.

314
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You eat ice cream like I dream of eating ice cream. Yes, that's right. Well, I'm an adult. And when you're an adult, you get to do things like that.

315
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Can we do a quick ice cream check? What do you have in the freezer right now?

316
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm out. I got to go to the store. Are you going to get some tonight? What are the orders in our deal?

317
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I might stop at Ralph's on the way home. What are you going to pick up? I don't know. Got to see what's on sale.

318
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
OK, so you just kind of wing it. You're not. Yeah, I like to wing it. You know, I wanted to try this Kit Kat kind that I think Dreier's is putting out.

319
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They have a Kit Kat. Do they have pieces of Kit Kat in it? Yeah. Or is it just flavored?

320
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh, Kit Kat. I've got a Kit Kat jewel. Cool. Wow. Do you also also Kit Kat mint? Yeah, it's Kit Kat mint.

321
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, you got really cool. I feel like you have all these mint ones. Like, I feel like these mints are like a loophole.

322
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Like if it's mint, they can get away with selling it, even if it's got like other shit crammed in. Yeah, they all have mint in them.

323
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That's the technicality. I also like we're all agitated and you're over there cool as a cucumber. Yeah.

324
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Probably from all of these jewels. Maybe this is a lesson we should be doing jewel. Yeah.

325
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well, if we took away his nicotine source, like he for sure would be agitated. Please don't do that.

326
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We don't want to see when the secret keeper gets angry. Yeah.

327
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Well, speaking of things that are in every mall and boring, wet souls pretzels. We come now to wet souls pretzels. My enemy.

328
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We meet again. Yes. This is a son of a bitch. Dual citizenship with City Walk. Yes.

329
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's one of those brands that is in both. Is that where we settle in? We should settle on.

330
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
In my head, I've been calling them like City Walk, like the cousins. Oh, sure.

331
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But I like dual citizenship. Okay, sorry, sorry.

332
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Boys, boys, I should warn you. Be careful as you speak of wet souls pretzels today. Oh, okay. That's right. It's a boss episode.

333
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh, right. Right. Okay. So we should. All right. Well, now, but you know what? We're torn now.

334
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I wish we all right. We have a choice. We can just be complimentary of wet souls pretzels.

335
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We don't incur some wrath down the line or do we say our honest opinions? And I think we owe the listener.

336
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, we do. We're journalists. That's why we started this podcast.

337
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I ain't scared of a pretzel establishment. I didn't go to this place. It got me sick.

338
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's a walk. Yep. All right. So if you didn't listen to the City Walk saga, yes, Jason shockingly combined hot dog pretzels with indoor skydiving.

339
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It was a problem. Correct. Pepperoni pretzels. Pepperoni pretzels.

340
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And when I had full sized pretzels with pepperoni before, it had been fine. These were pepperoni pretzel bites.

341
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They have. Have you ever had their hot dog pretzels? Yes. And I'm fine. I was fine.

342
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But this was me. I think this was the universe punishing me for not showing my fealty to Auntie Anne's my lifelong.

343
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Your wife. Your wife. The listener doesn't know that you're married to Auntie Anne, the woman who made the pretzel company.

344
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That never comes up. Yeah. Uncle Jason and Auntie Anne. Bunky Jason. Bunky Jason and Auntie Anne.

345
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:55,000
OK, you didn't have you didn't go to this one, did you? No. OK, yeah, good. Because I was going to say, like every picture I look at, I'm looking at ones with like, OK, here's what I'm.

346
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Also, they spruced it up and I still am like, no, they have slushes in there. It's slushes.

347
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is I will say it's a recently remodeled particularly consider it a flagship.

348
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So now it's a recently remodeled flagship, Wetzel's Pretzels and why they come they worked with local artists to bring the store to life.

349
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
There's a door handle that was made by like a sculptor. I don't forgive me.

350
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't remember. He made like some statue that's downtown of, you know, like a local leader who's important to people.

351
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then now he's making a door handle of pretzels complete with like salt rivets.

352
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And and then he's going to remodel Jason's house.

353
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Every toilet flusher. It's a hot dog.

354
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Floppy toilet handle.

355
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:57,000
There's also a mural in this in this facility now by an artist named Trek Thunder Kelly, who ran for governor of California in a performance artist way in 2003.

356
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I ran for governor of California in 2003.

357
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That's no that's no rare fact of it anyway. This is the Arnold year and there were lots of weird novelty runs and one of them.

358
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So now next time you're in Wetzel's Pretzels know that the mural was made by somebody who joined in the gov for dubernatorial fun.

359
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Sure. Got it. So now that notwithstanding the recent cosmetic refreshes,

360
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:35,000
still there is a big, you know, like vinyl sign that says the three young egos and there's a that's pepperoni twist, jalapeno cheese melt and how a roni.

361
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Looking at the pretzel makes me want to vomit, but the word makes me really how a roni.

362
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
How a roni. Yeah, it's disgusting.

363
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And the jalapenos look terrible. They're like blackened and sickly.

364
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I just in general, like it seems like I don't know why I've never been like I got to get myself a mall pretzel.

365
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Honestly, I've never had that thought. I'm not trying to act like I'm better than anyone who has.

366
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm just saying I've never had that thought. And then all they're doing is just making it seem worse by like adding all this weirdness to it.

367
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
There are dark forces at play. Oh, no.

368
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh, well, you look you don't look good.

369
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I just received a text from my cousin on his cricket wireless prepaid.

370
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Be careful, boys. You're venturing deep into a very, very risky place.

371
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's fine. I'm not scared.

372
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm not scared to call out the guy who set up this this shit establishment. I named Rick Wettsal with his partner, Bill Phelps, of course, and his wife, Elise Wettsal.

373
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:57,000
OK, yeah. One bizarre fact is that what's truly a strange fact is that they wanted to start a pretzel business and did not immediately think to call it wet so's pretzel.

374
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Right. He was I was watching an interview with Rick Wetzel on the Big Idea with Donnie Deutsch, a YouTube clip of that show that doesn't exist anymore.

375
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And he said he used to be called Wettsal's Pretzel when he was a kid.

376
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That was his name. That was like a nickname. Yeah.

377
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So I made he was like maybe he didn't want to call it that because of that.

378
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And then they finally were like, come on, man. Well, yeah, every it seems like he got a lot of attitude for not figuring that out right away.

379
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yes. I saw another interview where they said they wanted it to be like California Pizza Kitchen. So they were going to be California Pretzels.

380
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But that was already trademarked or something. And Rick Wetzel said one of my wife's friends, who was a proctor and gamble, said, you idiot, call it Wettsal's Pretzels.

381
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And they thought that was corny. So they just called it Wettsal's. So they still resisted it.

382
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And people walked up and like, what is this? They so they were not putting together what was right there.

383
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,000
He wasn't Rick Wetzel. Right now. He's gone on to great things since he's responsible for Blaze Blaze Pizza Empire.

384
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And they were talking about a place I didn't like. Yeah. I thought you liked Blaze. No, you know, weird combo.

385
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Like I fucked up where like the whole thing was. There was so much.

386
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, yeah. I remember. And all you could taste was like, yeah, they did Blaze Pizza.

387
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I watched a five minute video of Elise and Rick Wetzel talking about how they were going to enter the pizza space. And people said they were crazy to do it.

388
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So much competition out there, but they did it anyway. And they're growing still. You want to flash fire pizza folks.

389
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You go to Pizza Rev. You go to Pizza Press. Oh, you like those two. Those are the ones. Yeah, that's I got that confused.

390
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Those are all newer pizza ventures. Yeah. There's so much room for pizza, I feel like out there in the marketplace.

391
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I thought there wasn't. Everybody told them they were crazy. There's a lot of these guys get a lot of resistance. They keep like plowing through it. Yeah.

392
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But, you know, people calling them idiots. And I mean, that's insane. They didn't figure that out.

393
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Well, Rick and Bill, they were talking about this. They were talking about a pretzel business and they were on a plane.

394
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This is according to them. And they heard somebody overheard them say we're going to make a pretzel like business.

395
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And somebody turned to him that was a stranger and said, that's a great idea. And that's when they knew they were onto something.

396
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
They went to a bar. They wrote all the business plan down in a napkin. I'm so excited talking about it.

397
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
They wrote the business plan down in a napkin and it was like April or February. And they said, we'll have a store open by November.

398
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And they did. That's the story of what's pretzels. That's some Horatio Alger bootstraps bullshit.

399
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
They were working for Frisky's and whatever. Whoever owned Frisky's at the time.

400
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It feels like they're leaving something out.

401
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Well, they got a third investor, which I think was the person who actually did all of it.

402
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You know, these charming stories don't entail how you get the money.

403
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And on the big idea with Donnie Deutsch, they didn't talk about who the third investor. They didn't say the name of the investor.

404
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It was the Prince of Saudi Arabia.

405
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And I think on another interview, they were like, we had an angel investor.

406
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So they think maybe that's the silent partner that doesn't want it out there.

407
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Money ass pretzel money. What are they hiding?

408
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Okay. Any mall could have a wet'sles pretzels. Yes.

409
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
This space could be used for something like specific and Disney related.

410
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And instead they're just they're still telling the story of this guy who couldn't even figure out that his name rhymed with the product he wanted to sell.

411
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I don't like this screw wet'sles pretzels. This is the dumbest thing.

412
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yeah, I have never. That's I literally I've now once in a while in a theme park.

413
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I'll have a pretzel, but I've never wanted one in a mall.

414
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
What do you disagree? What's the problem? What?

415
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm just saying these are uncharted waters.

416
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's such a you're not you're not looking so good. A lot darker.

417
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Wait a minute. There are pretzels around us.

418
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Last time. It's happening.

419
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Oh, no.

420
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah. What do you think you're doing?

421
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, my God. It must be. It must be him.

422
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
He's got little he's got little thin hourglasses and he looks a little awkward.

423
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's right. Rick.

424
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.

425
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm not afraid of you. I still want it to be my name.

426
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I've never been sure.

427
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I've never been sure if I want my business to be called that.

428
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh, my God. The dark spirit of Rick Wet'sle has inhabited the sector keeper.

429
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah. You know, it's well, you know, it's problem.

430
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You know, you have a boring brand.

431
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know that making your door handle a pretzel.

432
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
governor in 2003.

433
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That's not that novel.

434
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's a good idea.

435
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So many people did. He failed. It didn't get any

436
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
performance or attention. The three young

437
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Migos. Did you see the poster?

438
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Did you come up with that? Yes, I came up with that.

439
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It took me years. I came up with that.

440
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I wasn't sure about it. Then a man on a plane told

441
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
me it was a good idea and I did it. I made

442
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the poster. Who was this man?

443
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Who? I don't know

444
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
his name. I think every time this

445
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
man is the third angel investor

446
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
just pumping your pockets full of cash

447
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and you present it like some folksy

448
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
story. Yeah, maybe I'm a

449
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
fucking idiot.

450
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't know what I'm doing, but you three

451
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
wandered into my

452
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
pretzel store and you had

453
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the nerve

454
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
to criticize it?

455
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You're putting pepperoni on pretzels

456
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and they've been sitting out. That's a good idea!

457
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
They've been sitting out all

458
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
day. It got Jason sick right before he

459
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
disqualified. You made one of us sick!

460
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I made you sick?

461
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
What did you do after

462
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
you ate my food?

463
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I did a normal round

464
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
of indoor skydiving.

465
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Okay.

466
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
He floated through the air.

467
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
That's a good idea.

468
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I bet you won't pull the trigger

469
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
until some guy on a plane. You're going to start an indoor skydiving

470
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
competitor. Yeah, maybe people should be

471
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
eating my pretzels while indoor

472
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
skydiving.

473
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You're not going to pull the trigger on this unless some guy on a plane

474
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
tells you it's a good idea or maybe your wife's

475
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
friend or something. You don't have any spine.

476
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
His name's Bob Phelps.

477
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I think it's Bill Phelps actually.

478
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Remember your friend's name!

479
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This guy has so many holes in his brain!

480
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What do we got in the inventory?

481
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
What do we got?

482
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Let's take this guy down.

483
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Wait a minute.

484
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I know.

485
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What we have

486
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
is a healthy item

487
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
from one of his competitors just across the way

488
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
in the same district

489
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
of downtown Disney District.

490
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
From the same level

491
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
what we have is some of

492
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Jamba's beloved

493
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
new oat milk.

494
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Hell yeah! Throw it at his fucking head!

495
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Get it in his eyes! Squish!

496
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You can see the

497
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
spirit of Rick Wetzel dissipating.

498
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The sun is coming out.

499
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
His army of pretzel guards also

500
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
has disappeared and milk has been bad.

501
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We didn't talk about the three young

502
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
egos. They appeared and now they're gone.

503
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Oat milk.

504
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Now that's a good idea.

505
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh my god.

506
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And his spirit flew away like

507
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
he was on a plane with a third man.

508
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Boys, boys, I'm back.

509
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Thank you!

510
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Dude, do you even know what happened?

511
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
No, no.

512
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You turned into super creep dumb idea

513
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
having Rick Wetzel.

514
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
No, not Rick Wetzel.

515
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
He's going down, don't worry.

516
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
To be fair, it was like the dark spirit

517
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
of Rick Wetzel so we're not quite sure

518
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
logistically if it's actually him

519
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
or if it's like sort of a dark version of him.

520
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Which couldn't

521
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
sue us for reliable.

522
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
We don't really know, honestly.

523
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's dark Rick Wetzel. All the big bosses are dark.

524
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Boys, you become braver by

525
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the level and by the stage. Thank you.

526
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Thank you. Unfortunately,

527
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
the level

528
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
keeper is not

529
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
at this stage.

530
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Oh man. Oh no.

531
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
He moved on again?

532
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
They moved on again?

533
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
She has moved on again.

534
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I guess we'll keep going on the journey.

535
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Something tells me

536
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
like I've been feeling like

537
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
do we have an out and are we going to find

538
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
in one of the

539
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
yeah, but why do I have the feeling

540
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
that it will not be until the

541
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
18th stage. I see what you're saying.

542
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
That's probably right. We'll probably

543
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
have to. Can we give up if the

544
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
level keeper is in like

545
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
the fourth one?

546
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I guess, yeah, you could.

547
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Sweet. You know it's not going to be

548
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
though. I don't think so, but you never

549
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
know. Yeah, you don't know. I don't know.

550
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I like to gamble sometimes.

551
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I think it's positive. I mean, it doesn't change what

552
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
we do. We still have to fight all these fights.

553
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh fuck, what if it was in the next one?

554
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Level three might be our level.

555
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Maybe level three, yeah.

556
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Boys, boys, as you

557
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
venture into level three,

558
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I have an item for you. Oh, thank you.

559
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What is it? Something that will help you along

560
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the way.

561
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Boys, I present to you

562
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the puff and chill ankle

563
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
boots from

564
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Sanukes. Oh,

565
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
the puff and chill ankle boot.

566
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Hmm. Thank you. This could come in

567
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
handy if a future boss

568
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
tries to hurt us in the ankle.

569
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah, our ankles are

570
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
protected. Wait, is it just one singular boot

571
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
for the three of us? Yeah,

572
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that's all I could get my hands on.

573
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Well, in the worst case, we just chuck it out their head

574
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
like we did this time. Or

575
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the way we handle all of these. Do you remember

576
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
like in Mario 3 when Mario was in that boot

577
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and he's bouncing around? We put you in the boot.

578
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I loved that feature.

579
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh, the big boot is one of the best.

580
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Michael, yes, yes, that is the idea.

581
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Okay, great. Yeah.

582
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
We're going to have to put Jason in

583
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that big boot eventually in this series.

584
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah. And we're going to have to have one of you out there

585
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
draw it.

586
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's just half of Jason's

587
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
face poking through a boot. Well,

588
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
oh my God, thank you. You just gave us maybe the most

589
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
valuable item yet. Really appreciate

590
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
it. And we that means that we

591
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
audience, all of us have

592
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
survived level

593
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
two, stage three

594
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
of the downtown Disney

595
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
ordeal. So on we move

596
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to level three. What will

597
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
we encounter there? I know that with

598
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
this, we start getting into the

599
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
wine bar district by the

600
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
old classifications of this area

601
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that they don't use anymore. So

602
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
we know that we'll encounter me being way

603
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
happier. But what will the rest

604
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
of you face?

605
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It remains to be seen. But

606
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
audience, you can follow us no matter

607
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
what happens. And the entire

608
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
downtown Disney ordeal. And

609
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
remember to use hashtag

610
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
follow us on Twitter, Instagram,

611
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Facebook and use hashtag DDD

612
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
O. Then that district

613
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Disney district ordeal hashtag.

614
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I already forget what

615
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
the other thing was. Save the levelkeeper.

616
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Save the levelkeeper

617
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
hashtag sector

618
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
keepers, cricket, wireless,

619
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
severance. Yes, that's you don't have to

620
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
use that. It's too long. I know

621
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
what you're on. Hey, don't be selfish. We're going to help

622
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
our friend out. Only. Yeah, just like toward

623
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
like ads, cricket, wireless.

624
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That one

625
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you can just direct. Yeah. And follow

626
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
us. Don't follow cricket wireless. Don't

627
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
stick around. Just tweet something. Right.

628
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
