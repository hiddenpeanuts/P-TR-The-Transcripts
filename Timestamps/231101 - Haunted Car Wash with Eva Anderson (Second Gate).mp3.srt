00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
["Frightful Narlson Theme Song"]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome, foolish mortals, to the final haunt cast, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's take these names out for one last spin.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I, for the last time, am Scottlejuice, joined by Frightful Narlson.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hello.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hello.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Sad to see it go.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And Jagged Slash and Drain.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm here too.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whoa!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That voice dropped.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The hidden voice.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That haunted doll jumped on the mic and ran away.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh no, and he dropped his phone.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And dropped his phone, oh!

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He pulled his phone out of your lap.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That haunted doll is so impolite.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Didn't even say excuse me.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Excuse me.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, this is the final cemetery gate.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's a little extra treat at the end of the week on the main feed, but Halloween may be over, but we're keeping it going here.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Especially because I think maybe we have experienced the ultimate haunted attraction of the LA area, of the country, of the world, and we're going to talk about it with...

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I took a stab at one, but feel free to give me your own.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Give me your own, but I will for now say the best ghost in haunt casting, Evil Anderscombe.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yay!

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I love it.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I love it.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's really good.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Great.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If it works for you, it works for us.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Evil, thanks for joining us.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you just calling me Evil the whole two and a half, three and a half hours?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not Evil.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I really committed to it.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Long after you've forgotten.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So glad you're here.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh my god.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And well, I don't...

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's much to address here before we get to the main topic.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I don't know, I mean, maybe we should start with the thing that is not haunt cast oriented, but you reminded us right before we started recording.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And we were like, yes, my god, how have we not cut into the regularly scheduled programming to talk about it?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you want to just break the news in case people haven't heard the news?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me give you the honor.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean, it happened yesterday, right around 5 p.m. ish.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Was it only yesterday?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wow.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Only yesterday. Is it only yesterday?

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think it happened a few days ago.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think it happened Friday because there was a appropriate follow up tweet Saturday.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
During the day that made me exclaim like, oh my god, and Jane's like, what's wrong?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I'm like, okay, sit down.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I got to start over.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I had to like when I saw the news, I had to like sit down and like put my head in my hands for like a full 30 seconds.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Breathe, breathe.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Um, I guess the only thing to say is that February of next year, David Copperfield will make the moon disappear.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wow.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And we've all been informed and we have no say in it.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, yes.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Doesn't someone need to sign off on this?

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This affects every nation.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The whole world.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Tides are affected.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh my god.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The second it happens, everything's going to go swirling around.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All the water will splatter up in the sky.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He not thought this through.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He announced it with a video of him standing.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't know where he is.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And voices are just being like, he made this disappear.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He made Statue of Liberty disappear.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The Statue of Liberty has disappeared.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Um.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
As if, wait, is the ad implying that like the news was talking about it like they didn't know what happened?

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I mean, they did at the time, they did treat those specials as news specials.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The news people would be shocked that the Statue of Liberty had disappeared.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And then it zooms out slowly and reveals that he is on the surface of the moon.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, so headline one.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's been to the moon.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's definitely actually been on the moon.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What has he been doing with his time and money?

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's been spending his time and money.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We found out 30 years out from his previous big special.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's like, now's the time with what's going on in the world.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I must.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is also it is a Mr. Show sketch.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Blow up the moon.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It is really.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It feels totally exactly like it.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We can and must.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Blow up the moon.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Blow up the moon.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then, and then the additional announcement, very 90s throwback.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He called into the Today Show or he's on a video call with the Today Show.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You watch this?

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Talking to, of all people, Carson Daly.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And he's in front of the MGM Grand.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he's like, yes, I'm going to blow up the moon.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because does anyone know that just the justification.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He said make the moon disappear.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's the Mr. Show sketch.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How is he making it disappear?

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, by blowing it up.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, maybe.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, we don't know.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We don't know his tactics.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't have the text of the justification.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Of the children of the world?

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Kind of thing.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wait, can you pull it up?

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't have my phone in my pocket.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have it.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's been blowing up the thread that is mostly about the sphere otherwise.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hold on.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're all a buzz.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
While we're looking it up, I will share something from the Sphere Facebook group I'm in.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Bono recently sang with Lady Gaga at the Sphere.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, yes.

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And they did a snippet of Shallow from the movie that she was in.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And someone was like, man, can you imagine if Bono starred in that instead of Bradley Cooper?

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then there's a couple reaction like faces that you can put on Facebook and people just had the like, like laughing so hard you're crying face.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They just clicked that.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I don't think that the comment was maybe well received.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Would have gotten that Oscar, I think.

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That would have overcome it.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You would have played that grueling part.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What's the name of the character?

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, God. Let me look it up.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Carton Myrtle?

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it Carton Myrtle?

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's pretty close.

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I knew it.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Carton Myrtle.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is the phrase.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So he's doing it for the charity Save the Children, which is not the QAnon affiliated Save the Children.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This did exist before.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And also that this charity is constantly been like QAnon, please stop using the phrase Save the Children.

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're distracting from our charity Save the Children, who do save children.

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But the quote is, by making the moon disappear, the magician will show that no challenge is impossible to overcome.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Quote, if one person can make the moon disappear from the sky, imagine how together we can make poverty, hunger and danger disappear for children on Earth.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I mean, it sounds nice.

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
However, some of those are kind of abstract concept.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Danger?

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Fully danger is going to be gone for all children on Earth.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Danger is also like there's light sockets in your house.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Danger is not necessarily, you know, a wide, it doesn't have to do with like nations warring.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm picturing like a cane toads scenario, like in Australia where they introduced cane toads and then they had no natural predators.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So what if March 1st we wake up and children all over the world have no more danger at all?

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They're just like immortal.

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The moon is gone and children are thriving worldwide.

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They cannot be killed by anything.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I wake up to find my toddler son saying, look, daddy, and he takes a steak knife and runs it along his own forehead and he doesn't bleed.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ouch. Thank you.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is a Stephen King novel being ready to happen.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Fear is the mind killer.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Pain is for cowards.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It feels very Epcot Millennials celebration of like all the big puppets and they're all, everyone's singing in gibberish.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But it's like it's we combined all languages of the world.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So it's no language in every way.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's like, what are you talking about?

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So how do we go?

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How do we watch this?

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We're still waiting.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And again, this is breaking.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So we don't know details.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We don't know where it's going to be.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We don't know how you can attend.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And we were asking questions and then Jason said there's a whole rigmarole apparently.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I feel like what I saw.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And again, it's crazy that we've all gotten different bits and pieces.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I swear on the day show there like there will be a contest.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You will enter a contest and the winners will have their names drawn and they will get to watch this.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's it?

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
At the MGM Grand.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh it is at the MGM Grand?

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think it's happening.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, I think there's.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Wait, really?

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think it's happening there.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Doesn't the theater though feel too.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, I think they're building something outside.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think maybe they're building stands.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wet Republic.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You'll be aware.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you can do the VIP.

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can watch it from a Jacuzzi.

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I am not a hundred percent.

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I think it's yet to be revealed.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If I'm at the Cosmo, does the moon disappear?

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Or do I.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You have to see it from the MGM Grand?

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have to see it from exactly where David wants me to sit.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Does that imply that how he's able to pull this off?

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That if I'm just down the stairs, if I'm up on top of the Trump Hotel, that the moon does not disappear for me.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I've been on the roof of a hotel in Rovinja, Croatia.

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is the moonshine on me or is it David Copperfield taking it from me there as well?

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, you need to be the test.

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You need to go back to Croatia if you don't win the sweepstakes.

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Guys, I've been to Croatia.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you think this is a reaction to the success of the Sphere?

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you think he's trying?

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sphere is all the talk of Las Vegas.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My question is, is the Sphere involved in this in some way?

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Will it be like the build up to the David Copperfield weekend?

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Will it be a Copperfield thing in the Sphere?

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How does he feel about Dolan?

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He probably is upset that he...

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, sorry.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was going to say one thing Dolan and Copperfield probably have in common, probably, allegedly,

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
took the Lolita Express, allegedly, probably, with Harvey Weinstein.

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think they at least both would have gotten the invite.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They would have been on the short list.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They don't know Harvey Weinstein, probably, allegedly.

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, yeah.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Copperfield should have done a magic trick to atone, to apologize for.

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How can I via a trick say I'm sorry for knowing Harvey Weinstein?

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
His little trick called.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Copperfield has probably been on the Lolita like starship to the moon.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Like a spacecraft.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why would he think he's making the moon disappear?

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No moon.

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No evidence.

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Cover the tracks.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Make the tracks disappear.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Little St. James, there's a moon base for it.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I think in the dying embers of Twitter, I feel like I should have said this,

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but I swear I saw someone defend like Eric Adams or someone not worth defending.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like was in the Little Black Book, the Rolodex.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That had dozens and dozens of names.

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And someone went, Hey, everyone was in that little black book.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it's like.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
OK, the book is different than the flight.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The book is different than the flight.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I just want to make that clear.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And you need to make that clear because.

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because Jimmy Buffett is in the book.

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Everyone was in the book.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Jason, they're right.

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Everyone was in the book.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I'm in the book.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, right.

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Eva Anderson is in the book.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I forgot.

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The other Eva Anderson.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
David Copperfield.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Right.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So we don't.

263
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait a minute.

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He's Jesus.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He said, I don't really.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's a longer article.

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm trying to find where it's happening.

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It says the MGM Grand headliner, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't know where it's going to be.

269
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But he the quote Copperfield, my secrets are on the moon.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Remember that?

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He said this.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Remember that?

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Remember that?

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm scared of that.

275
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think he did an illusion where he wrote something on the moon.

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, you're right.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Next paragraph.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yep.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To remind some of Copperfield's techniques that were etched into nickel plates as part of Arch Mission Foundation's lunar library crash landed on the moon in April 2019.

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So he.

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Remember that.

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Nickel plating that contains how he does his tricks and maybe some other things from his personal life that he wanted not to be on earth anymore.

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Jason, you're right.

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wow.

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He's put evidence on the moon and now he's going to make it disappear.

286
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And how do you think I know?

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, I guess it's time for me to disappear.

288
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, wow.

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh my God.

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So great.

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, we vow to clearly it's not in our control to say that we will be there.

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That will be the official reporters on the ground.

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But rest assured, we will us and presumably Jason Warner will do anything in our power to be there, to be as close to the action as we can.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We could.

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I mean, if we don't like we should show up and see if we get in, even if we don't win a contest.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You check your way into this.

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's what I'm thinking.

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Check your way into the disappeared moon.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Walk with confidence.

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I wonder how like people aren't going to flock to Las Vegas for this.

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't think like I'm not no offense to David, but it's not exactly like.

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The sphere.

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The sphere.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Or that race that happened.

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The F1 race.

308
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The F1 that's ruining everyone's lives in Vegas right now.

309
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's such a pain in the ass walking around there.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's such a pain in the ass.

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Even more than it already is a pain in the ass to walk around Las Vegas.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The blocking the view from the sidewalks and the foot bridges is so funny.

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We made so many when we went to Vegas just a couple of weeks ago, we made so many mistakes going places and then it's like, no F1 is blocking.

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah.

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like it's really a shitty situation.

316
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It would be cost less for us to go to see the moon disappear than it would was to meet Martin Ravenhill.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's true.

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Also, but F1, they have been slashing prices because I was getting MGM like get exclusive seats at the Bellagio and this and that to get starting at $12,000.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And it said must buy hotel room.

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So that did not include your hotel.

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh my God.

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Places have already been slashing prices because I think some Vegas news channel was already saying there are flights into Vegas with no tickets sold that weekend.

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Really?

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because the high rollers are like, I am staying away.

325
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This sounds like hell.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When is this happening?

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
November.

328
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
At some point in November or December.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Right at the beginning.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's soon.

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's very soon.

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can give you guys just the feeling of it.

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm closing my eyes imagining it.

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then so then that for like three hours.

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, it's something like 80 laps.

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I think 80 or 90 laps.

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It goes past the fountains and stuff.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It goes past the fountains which are blocked by Grand Sands right now.

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh my God.

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So you won't be able to, yeah.

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, okay, so there's going to be a lot of like, you know, black fabric that blocks stuff around the Vegas area.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do we think that Copperfield is going to buy this wholesale and string it up in the sky and maybe that's how the moon will disappear?

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know how David Copperfield does his tricks.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If he's been thinking about this for 30 years, it better be not just some black fabric in front of your face.

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I feel like it'll be better than that.

346
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know what he's going to do.

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I hope so.

348
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But in person it's got to be.

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's also such a rare opportunity.

350
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Apparently he has not done one of these since 2001.

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Tornado of fire.

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It invoked moon effects.

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's a meaningless phrase.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He thinks about the moon a lot.

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Wow.

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He lives with an extraterrestrial.

357
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh my God.

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Will he be involved in it?

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is he Dick Tracy?

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh yeah.

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh wow.

362
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Will a moon maid be part of the scheme?

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh my God.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh my God.

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, we're really going to follow every step of this and then of course keep reporting on the new beautiful world where there is no more poverty and hunger and danger, at least for children.

366
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I assume he's got to do one thing at a time.

367
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
First, disappear the moon.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Second, make it disappear for children.

369
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then hopefully for us.

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But I'll wait for children again.

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is it a Logan's Run scenario?

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There might be an age cap at first.

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you become an adult, like, oh, it's like Hunger Games for you.

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's like Purge for you.

376
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Danger.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Release the danger.

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's fair.

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Look, I want no danger for my kid.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And if Copperfield's the man to do it, then I thank him.

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

382
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, that's very exciting.

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hopefully some more stuff to come in February.

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Here now, not in October, actually.

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think it's coming out November 1st.

386
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But we've finished kind of the official Halloween season.

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I was curious, Evil.

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Probably the last one.

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I had to recur it one more time.

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I feel like you've presumably done some, like, off the beaten path and strange things in this season of Haunts.

392
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Is there anything you want to name check or mention about your October 2023?

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, first of all, I just want to say one of the best Haunts I went to, I went to last night when recording.

394
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It was the last night of the LA County High School for the Arts.

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Double Haunt night where it's a Haunt at the high school cost $25 entirely, like, designed by and starring high schoolers.

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Teens.

397
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Teens.

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But it was so great.

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Like this year, one of them was called The Mine and it was like an 1800s mine, like, disaster.

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There were teenagers in the line being like, can you help me find my son?

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then you get in and they had built into the high school like a multiple room adventure where there was a Wendigo that was making people into cannibals.

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And then there was another one with like a carnival that had like Siamese twins and like a crazy ventriloquist and kids on stilts in this like deranged carnival.

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There was like all these crazy effects and sound design.

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Really, really cool.

405
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Every year they do it.

406
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Guys, check out the Laksa Haunt.

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Wow.

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's my new number one.

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What part of town is that?

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's like just east of downtown.

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's inside Cal State LA is like where their campus is.

412
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And it's cheap and like incredible.

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's just like their kids are so good.

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's something I very specifically want to talk about because it's a show I took you guys to.

415
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Delusion.

416
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We went to the Blue Blade years ago.

417
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And I just want to say that this year, the show's in Pomona.

418
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I went with a group of people, including Jason Walliner.

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And the VIP ticket for Delusion this year was a hundred, I think it was either $130 or $160.

420
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Either way, it was like a lot of money.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So it's basically a 45 minute show.

422
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And what is it, by the way, the thing that like ties any Delusion together?

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like is it's different shows and themes?

424
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a mythology about like, well, this one was supposed to be the culmination of all the Delusions where it's like the history of all the Delusions.

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So there's monsters from previous Delusions.

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They were using monsters.

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But the thing that was super crazy was that, how to explain, we were up in an attic.

429
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They had taken one of our party away and they're like, I'm kidnapping her and you'll get her later.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And usually they usually kidnap like a character, one of you at some point.

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And then it's like that person gets to have their own side adventure and then comes back to your group.

432
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That happened to me once. I got put on a gurney like in this Delusion and then I joined back up with the group.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They took away one of our friends.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Then we got chased around by this crab monster from the previous Delusion.

435
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And the crab monster knocked over a piece of furniture that was very heavy and that like fell very close to me.

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like I pulled my hands away at the right moment, but it would have been quite bad if this thing had hit me.

437
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And so then we, the crab monster was like, and like, clearly no one knew it had hit something.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
How do I acknowledge this in crab language?

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, because he's like an upside down crab man.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But then we ran out, we ran, we went through multiple rooms.

441
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We end the show, we have the narration of like, and now the show is over and we go out into like the outside.

442
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And this producer comes up and it's like, did the furniture hit anyone?

443
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And I'm like, no, but our friend is still missing.

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And then this producer goes, oh no.

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And like gets on her mic, she's like, we figured out where that girl was from.

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And this member of our group had been in a closet, just a dark closet the whole time and never, no one ever came and got her.

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And she missed the end of the show.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
She missed the 30 minutes of the show.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Wow.

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And just heard the murmurs of what everybody else was doing.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Just heard other people going through Delusion.

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wow.

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And probably at least for a while was like, wow, they're really committing to this.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I guess that not only am I kidnapped, I got to do it for a long time.

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Exactly.

456
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But then by minute 20, probably.

457
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Playing wordle on your phone.

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
At least I got my phone on me.

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I can check my sites.

460
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I needed to talk about that because I don't think Delusion should be losing people in closets if the price point is that high, is my point.

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Losing adults.

462
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because you're supposed to like find her, right?

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Somebody's supposed to like lead you to her and then you rescue her, I assume.

464
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Or we go to another room and she's back out or you find her in the next room.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I think maybe the knocking over the furniture might have thrown everything out like into chaos because that clearly was not supposed to happen.

466
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Because I did go, have you guys ever lost someone before?

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And the producer goes like, no.

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I went, has the furniture fell over before?

469
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And she goes, no, you're special.

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Wow.

471
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Whoa.

472
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You didn't even know the half how special you were.

473
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I also did not offer a refund to the person that was in the closet.

474
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Really?

475
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
She paid that much money to be in a closet.

476
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They just said she could come back to Pomona and do it again.

477
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So that's all I want to say about Delusion, a show I took you guys to.

478
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Just for future reference, that did happen.

479
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is this the show with Manny Manners, the little puppet boy?

480
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, Manny Manners was back and you couldn't hear him very well.

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He was like.

482
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Jason's voice at the start of the show.

483
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh yeah.

484
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, is that Manny Manners?

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah.

486
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Anyway, that's all I had to say that publicly at the end of the season to be like, shame on Delusion.

487
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It does come up as it'll be the shorthand sometimes, especially in these haunt guest episodes for something that's very immersive and cool.

489
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And I think Delusion, Delusion is cool.

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But now I guess it has to be the shorthand for when it dulcer laws.

491
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The Lolli County High School of the Arts Haunt.

492
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The Lolli County High School of the Arts Haunt.

493
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So they get the name check as the ultimate from now on.

495
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm glad you didn't get locked in there.

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm glad you were not stuck in a closet so that you could join us for this and join us for the event that we got to attend.

497
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Jason didn't make this one, but Mike.

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I didn't make it, but I'm so curious to hear about your experiences because I did find some ride throughs.

499
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, wow.

500
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Go to Haunt Chronicle's Attractions 360 and Sharp Productions.

501
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They hit up all the haunts and there's so many attractions in Southern California and around the country.

502
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This was a very funny one to watch a quote unquote ride through.

503
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I also feel like it's very important, Jason.

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was thinking about this, that one of us did not go.

506
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because I was thinking about, I'm going to quote, I just want to read something really quickly.

508
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let's just pull out a very thick book.

509
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm reading from the HP Lovecraft's Great Tales of Terror.

510
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because I was trying to figure out what to say about this haunt before we get into it.

512
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And this to quote the Call of Cthulhu.

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little.

515
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vices of reality

516
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation

517
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

518
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because I do think what we're about to talk about is enough to drive one mad.

519
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah.

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And the fact that we need to have a neutral party to make sure that we haven't completely like...

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Like a mediator.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We're not a mediator, I'm an observer.

523
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, just to know that what we saw was not the way the world is.

524
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, things are still happening on the outside.

525
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That phone book size compilation was what I was trying to get people to vote to make Mike read.

526
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It is so weird.

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, right. Yeah, nobody bit on that really, no.

528
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Mike, do you not like racism?

529
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
No, no.

530
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And then I found the YA genre book that the director of the Tower of Terror movie wrote.

531
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I found it at the Burbank Library and discovered it is 336 pages.

532
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Whoa.

533
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So also kind of long.

534
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So that's what you would like to have to read for the next couple...

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I ended up reading and thankfully neither person bit on either of that.

536
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Well, there's always next month.

537
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

538
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What we're talking about today, the haunted car wash, and thank you for that proper prologue.

539
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That was beautiful.

540
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Haunted, the haunted car wash.

541
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean, this is a genre that exists and these happen I think throughout the country,

542
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but we went to one specifically in Anaheim.

543
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Some of the backstory here, if you aren't on Club 3,

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
this I think grew our interest and awareness of this grew out of one of the first Club 3 episodes

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
where the listeners requested that Eva get to talk about whatever she wanted.

546
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You wisely show us themed car washes and alerted us to a fantastic area

547
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that caused me to go to Campbell, California and have one of the best days of my life legitimately.

548
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And it certainly kept the world of themed car washes on my mind and hopefully some of the listeners as well.

549
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So it's a bit of a sequel because during that episode, I think there was the discovery that there is the,

550
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
like theme parks, there is the horror and haunt equivalent of the themed car wash.

551
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There are overlays for car washes.

552
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, they do holiday overlays.

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Christmas, I don't know. They should. I would love it.

554
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The foam could be snow.

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's true.

556
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Halloween is what we know about.

557
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
There are haunted car washes, but I didn't know where they were and how close to us they were.

558
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I was so delighted when you said several weeks ago, pretty close,

559
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Anaheim in the backyard of Disneyland and jumped on it.

560
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So excited to do it.

561
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's part of the one that we did.

562
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I think the haunted car wash, which straddles a couple of car wash brands.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
This is one in Anaheim and there's one in Lakewood, I believe.

564
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So that's what we checked out a few nights ago.

565
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And where to begin?

566
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I mean, like, should we discuss our expectations?

567
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Did anybody have an idea of what you thought it might be?

568
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I will say my one thing. Every time I saw the trailer for this, I was like,

569
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so I assume that they're just using the car wash as a tunnel

570
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and that you do not get your car washed at the haunted car wash because it only costs $50.

571
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And so just hiding people in the tunnel of the car wash and them bothering you

572
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
while you go through it, especially if you're on the rails,

573
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
then that seems like a great ride vehicle for you to get scared.

574
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That was always my impression of like, this must be what the haunted car wash is.

575
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They turn it all off and then it's just, it's a different thing that they can do.

576
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's a tunnel of love or fear, if you will. Right?

577
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes.

578
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That's what I was like, assuming we would be going to.

579
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, yeah. And that the experience would take place in this kind of cave or tunnel-like environment,

580
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
like a re-themed situation.

581
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I think we quickly discovered that the experience spills out in front of the building.

582
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes.

583
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And honestly, the experience begins, you know, probably a block and a half away

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because you immediately encounter a lot of traffic, a ton of cars.

585
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A backup.

586
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, a big backup around the block.

587
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And this is the big question I had driving up was like,

588
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
will this be a thing where they're like, oh, thanks for doing it.

589
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We appreciate it. Wow. So people came and did this and I'm so glad that you could.

590
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The opposite. It was so crowded.

591
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is one of the most successful endeavors I've witnessed recently.

592
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
When I drove up, I was like, oh, is there an in-and-out around here?

593
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Like that's the line of traffic.

594
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Exactly.

595
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's what it reminds you of if you've ever been to the West Coast staple.

596
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We all had to park separately and get into Scott's car,

597
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
which was parked in a parking lot that was in the middle of kind of like the corner where the line was winding around.

598
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes, I somehow ended up exactly boxed in into a tiny strip mall parking lot

599
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
because I was like, OK, we can all get in one car and consolidate so we don't have to do separate tickets for this.

600
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So I just on Street View was like, well, probably this little Caesar's parking lot will be a fine place to meet.

601
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And then discovered that it was completely boxed in by very much traffic.

602
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yet somehow I snuck in there. I was the only I don't know.

603
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I turned left over to it.

604
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I ended up kind of like skipping some of that line.

605
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
People were probably mad at me because they thought I was.

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I'm like, no, I'm not.

607
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Later, I will be going to the haunted car.

608
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm going to the boxed in Little Caesar's.

609
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I want a hot and ready five dollar pizza for dinner.

610
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm going to eat it in my car by myself.

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let me get the pizza.

612
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You joke. But Little Caesar's has really upped their game rates.

613
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Really? I haven't done it.

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
What do you mean?

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I had a reaction.

616
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I now live by a little close to a Little Caesar's.

617
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Really?

618
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah. I'll tell you.

619
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Tell me where your address is in there.

620
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No, I'm not.

621
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
There are a number of them in the Southland, of course, and in the San Fernando Valley, especially.

622
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And, you know, moving so many times we were tired and like, let's get a Little Caesar's.

623
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And we're like, this is really good dinner.

624
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
How many times did you get a Little Caesar's in a month?

625
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
During the move, I think we went like three times in a month, two or three times.

626
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Is it still five dollar hot and ready? Is that the deal?

627
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's like six.

628
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And they only keep pepperonis hot and ready.

629
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Cheese, you have to wait for.

630
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So cheese is hot and ready?

631
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Why wouldn't they have cheese and pepperoni?

632
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
At least at this location.

633
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The other thing is my mom had heard me talk about it a lot and she gave us some gift cards without scoring.

634
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And we discovered the app does not have gift card abilities yet.

635
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You have to go inside.

636
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So do you order?

637
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Just wait. Sorry to cut ahead in the question line.

638
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, it's OK.

639
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You continue to frequent this place despite them not taking coupons and the biggest pizza genre not being hot or ready.

640
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm ready, but we always call the head to begin with.

641
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
OK, so you weren't actually going in there unannounced and doing a hot and ready.

642
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You were ordering ahead of time.

643
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It was just Jane noticed.

644
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think once she tried to go in and pick it up and they're like, oh, only the pepperoni is hot and ready.

645
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You have to wait a couple of minutes for the cheese.

646
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So they were making your pizza hot and ready for just you.

647
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
They had a Little Ceasar's Day in my high school that has Simon game where you play Simon.

648
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And if you got up to a certain level, you got free crazy bread.

649
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Really?

650
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And then if it went very hard, like it got very hard and you could get up to like a hot and ready pizza for free.

651
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The game was free and we realized my best friend in high school and I realized very early that you could get to crazy bread pretty easily.

652
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And we did it every day until they took the Simon game out of the little.

653
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Because we could just go in there and each get a free crazy bread and walk out with it.

654
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Wow.

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
We didn't have to pay any money.

656
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That's wild.

657
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It wasn't even with an order.

658
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
No, you're just one hundred and stealing crazy bread from Little Caesar's.

659
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I am wondering if modern day teenagers are like the teenagers when we were teenagers and would go to a place and either use a freebie coupon or just order fries or just order coffee and just post up for two hours.

660
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh, yeah.

661
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, I think they are.

662
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think so.

663
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yes.

664
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Mel's Diner.

665
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
We respect these businesses and chains and we give them the money they deserve.

666
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's our generation.

667
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I don't know that some of these businesses have stuck around.

668
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Some of the funniest stuff during lockdown was like this terrible diner has to close because of lockdown measures.

669
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And it's like the reviews are like food is so expensive and it tastes like shit.

670
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No, lockdown.

671
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They don't even give me anything when I play Simon really good.

672
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Interestingly, though, one thing that was created in lockdown haunted car wash.

673
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yes.

674
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That's good context to mention, which I kind of forgot because there's nothing I guess when you think about it inherently pandemicy about it.

675
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But I guess when you like, yeah, OK, when you think about it as like a sealed environment.

676
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah.

677
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Or it's like an equivalent of some of the drive through Christmas drive through dinosaurs.

678
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I found all of them extremely depressing.

679
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes.

680
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:55,000
When I when I said I was doing this, I remember telling friend of the show Andrew Grissom and he was like, did you ever think in the year when in 2020, did you flash to years later in twenty twenty three that you would be attending a drive through haunt in a car wash?

681
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I thought, yeah, boy, when you think about it that and that I'd be like excited about it.

682
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I think this is one of the things that has maybe transcended the genre of pandemic drive through experience.

683
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
If the lion's any indication on a Thursday night.

684
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yes. Yeah.

685
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh, I shudder on a Friday or a Saturday.

686
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And the later you get, the more expensive.

687
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
If you ever want to do one of these, try to hit it like as soon as it gets dark or cheaper.

688
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I wonder, though, if it sort of grew from its origin, because, you know, pandemic year, they might not have been as aggressive in certain areas as they were in twenty twenty three.

689
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
If you know what I'm saying.

690
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes.

691
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Well, yes, we will.

692
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
This is a tease.

693
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
There are certain things that could not have been done in twenty twenty that would have gotten to would have ended the business, would have gone viral.

694
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
This is so exciting.

695
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This is are I think the answers to questions I have.

696
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But I've been biting my tongue so hard.

697
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm like, oh, I can't ask this question yet because I want to give anything away.

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know what I was thinking, too, because, you know, Scott is starting to, you know, like a like a flower.

699
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He's sort of opening up now.

700
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Like a black flower with lots of thorns that bleed.

701
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He is kind of opening up.

702
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And this is the second time this month that he's done something.

703
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But I thought this would be a perfect this would have been a perfect time.

704
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Maybe next year we get you in the haunted car wash because this is a good, I feel like, first haunt because you get to be in sort of a comfortable place.

705
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Is it?

706
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah, well, he's going to have to assess.

707
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

708
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We'll ask you at the end if you feel that way.

709
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's a good way to frame this.

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Can we sell you on if you want to do this?

711
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Or should we?

712
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes, we'll see at the end.

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We'll see at the end.

714
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Nay, should we?

715
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So, so yeah, I was immediately distressed that the place that I had picked like, hey, friends, you know what?

716
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We can all meet in this one parking lot and that should be fine.

717
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It was the opposite of fine.

718
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It was completely surrounded on all sides.

719
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We had to pivot and go to the most hoppin' bowling alley I've ever seen in my life.

720
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, this bowling alley rules.

721
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I was salivating just thinking I should show you a flower.

722
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh, god, I wish we could have hung out longer.

723
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Do you remember the name of the lounge?

724
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I didn't take pictures.

725
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It was cool.

726
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It was a cool name. It was a cool sign.

727
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This is like the real Anaheim, I think.

728
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's like 80 years old or something.

729
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Those are the best bars and lounges.

730
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes.

731
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bowling alleys are so cool.

732
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was a super like double bowling alley.

733
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You had bowling alleys on both sides of the bowling alley.

734
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's great.

735
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Was there like 60 lanes?

736
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, and a cocktail bar.

737
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Oh, my god.

738
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That was rad.

739
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
One of my favorite places in LA is Chateau Lanes in Koreatown.

740
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Incredible.

741
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's so many lanes, a snack bar, a big arcade, a bar that has never updated.

742
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The wall is mostly stonework that was very popular, I don't know, mid-60s.

743
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, definitely.

744
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And it's just stuck around.

745
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The stuff that gets like stripped out when everybody does like their Property Brothers

746
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
like landifying of houses.

747
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a crime that things like that get yanked out of.

748
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Chateau Lanes is awesome.

749
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

750
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I had a photo of it somewhere.

751
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So anyways, that didn't work.

752
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But then it led us to this bowling alley where I'd like to go back to at some point in time.

753
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And then we had to go back over, get in my car, in that parking lot.

754
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And then we're like, well, now can we kind of cut?

755
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Now can we kind of get ahead in the line?

756
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And I tried to pull out and the guys directed me.

757
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then I'm like, I am going to this.

758
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I have a ticket and he's like, I'm not even done with the sentence.

759
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And the guy directing traffic, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

760
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You go back. You go back.

761
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You back up. You go back.

762
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And so now I have to find another spot to like to cut.

763
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I didn't mean to be cutting.

764
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I didn't know I was getting in a cut position.

765
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah.

766
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Well, that, I mean, the first time I was trying to cut.

767
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I get right.

768
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
First time I wasn't trying to cut.

769
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Second time I was third time.

770
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I just, I need to get out for, you know, anyway, no matter what to go live my life.

771
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But yes, I'm going to the, but I was so stressed out in that, like trying to get somebody and we're judging what cars like.

772
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We get mad at us.

773
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What seems like a slightly weaker car that will let me in?

775
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah. As if the cars were from the movie Cars and we were judging them by who had the most muscle.

776
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
They would have the personality.

777
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I said the Escalade.

778
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No, we can't cut in front of the Escalade.

779
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Absolutely not.

780
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So we cut in right behind the Escalade and then the Escalade was in front of us for what transpired.

781
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Oh my God.

782
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And then we realized the Escalade was just full of little children.

783
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And that there was a mermaid mom who loves mermaids.

784
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

785
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, okay.

786
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
She had a mermaid license plate and mermaid stickers.

787
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh boy.

788
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Wait, wait, Jason, I know you're heading for something.

789
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Sorry.

790
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
A mermaid mom leads to another point.

791
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This is in the period of time where we were sort of caught in traffic and waiting for things to get a little more exciting.

792
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
There wasn't much to do or much to look at.

793
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But a couple things caught our eye.

794
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
One was this license plate that we're trying to parse.

795
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's like MRD and MD and is it a doctor?

796
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And we knew mom, but what is the rest?

797
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And then the frame around it had further, it was like my other car is a shell or something.

798
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So like, oh wait, that means mermaid.

799
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay.

800
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So it's a mermaid thing.

801
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And then Mike, the most matter of fact, the most like earnest you could have possibly been, you said, oh, okay, so it must be like a Jimmy Buffett fan.

802
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And then conversation kept going.

803
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And like much like on the show, I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.

804
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So because a mom has a license plate that refers to mermaids, the only possibility is that this is a Jimmy Buffett fan.

805
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Well, she's a fan of the ocean and she's a fan of like that type of like iconography, I assume.

806
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I was going to say there's some mermaid iconography in the Parrothead.

807
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Of course.

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Extending universe.

809
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay.

810
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But now let me as a parrot head lay person, as a Parrothead lay person, I only know some of this from what you guys talk about.

811
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't know any what the mermaid songs are.

812
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
None of them are famous.

813
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And I maintain that 90 percent of Jimmy Buffett fans know the three famous songs and that is all.

814
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Even if even people who would say I'm a hardcore.

815
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Six who know the six songs they know probably.

816
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I think you're underestimating them.

817
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
They know six ish.

818
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
They know.

819
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay.

820
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And I'm a light fan like Joe Biden knows three and then a expanded fan knows six.

821
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yes, exactly.

822
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay.

823
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But I that just seemed so then that like well there's no other media certainly with mermaids.

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What other famous mermaid movie or anything is there that maybe the mom is referencing?

825
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I couldn't think of any.

826
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The other thing and I'll get back to where you were going, Jason.

827
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
We had not much to look at when we were kind of in that stall there.

828
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So we're talking about mermaid mom and then there was the sign next to us that was for the detailing part of the business.

829
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, yes.

830
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Now there was an accent that we kind of missed because it was framed as a line and it was not so clearly an accent.

831
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So we realized this is this is a last name.

832
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But we're just looking at the letters P E N A S and just the only way we could say it out loud.

833
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
P P NOS P NOS.

834
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
P NOS.

835
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I just said penis.

836
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Penis detailing.

837
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

838
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay.

839
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So we're thinking about penis.

840
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
We're thinking about mermaid moms.

841
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah.

842
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Anyway, back to what you were saying.

843
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
What I was going to say, the aggressive guy directing traffic.

844
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think two of the big sources of anxiety for all those drive thru attractions that we did a few years ago.

845
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
One is the actors or employees just wandering around moving cars and, you know, seasonal hires or a few week hires.

846
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That was very stressful.

847
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Like driving car very slowly and there's people walking around you.

848
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I think the even bigger piece of stress was the people directing traffic who aren't pros at doing that.

849
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They were like learning on the job and he's getting to them.

850
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yes.

851
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And they're right.

852
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
They're right to be aggravated by this.

853
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yes.

854
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah.

855
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Well, I was because I watched the same guy try to kick other cutters out of line.

856
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I was I was glad that there was somebody laying down the street.

857
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
There's no they didn't build a lane for this.

858
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No.

859
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
On the actual street.

860
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
No, no one anticipated the incredible part.

861
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The beetle like popularity of the car was the right turn lane is completely consumed by this line.

862
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Someone just wanted to get their five dollar pepperoni hot and ready.

863
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And they did it.

864
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And they could.

865
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And they can't for a month.

866
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah.

867
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And somebody came thinking there would be cheese ready and there wasn't.

868
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There was no cheese.

869
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Pepperoni.

870
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The only applies to pepperoni.

871
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah.

872
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So we do we do get in line eventually and realizing a weird in it.

873
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is going to take a while.

874
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's moving very slowly.

875
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Once we finally get to one of the stressed out youngsters, scanning tickets and such, there's a really quick rundown of the policies and just, you know, turn your lights off and directed us to the radio station that you that goes along with the thing.

876
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then really quick tossed off unlock your doors if you want them to come in lock them if you don't.

877
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
OK, so as if that's not something that is blown.

878
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Jason has made a face as if he just like got as stressed out as if that were he was actually in the moment.

879
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I think the answer is Jason.

880
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Well, I didn't know if that was a thing that you could customize.

881
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yes, because I was watching video of them getting people's cars.

882
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah.

883
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I'm like, I think for safety, I if I go through regular car wash, I make sure it's in the parking lot.

884
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I make sure it's in the correct gear.

885
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
They tell you I locked the doors.

886
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I make sure the windows are up.

887
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So, yeah, the unlocked doors.

888
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I had a lot of questions about the line leading into the car wash.

889
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah, you're not in the actual car yet.

890
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Watch is.

891
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But how do you think we went?

892
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
What do you think happened?

893
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah.

894
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I think you likely unlock the doors and maybe a window or two down as you were maybe as you were going.

895
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'll put it down.

896
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Let me just put this thought into your mind.

897
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah.

898
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Each door can have a separate unlock or lock function.

899
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah.

900
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Can I ask where Scott?

901
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I assume you're driving.

902
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

903
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Where were you guys?

904
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I was in the back with the baby seat.

905
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
No baby in it.

906
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No, you're right.

907
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Thank God.

908
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We did not take a baby to this.

909
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And he was in the passenger seat.

910
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And you were in the passenger seat.

911
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yes.

912
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
OK.

913
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And I've ridden in your car with the baby seat.

914
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You gave us a ride back after the dynasty shows.

915
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You're familiar with the seat.

916
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm familiar with the seat, which adds a very funny complication to the unlocked doors and

917
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
what comes after the unlocked doors.

918
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Do you want to guess who locked who?

919
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I guess that Scott locked the door.

920
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I think Eva unlocked the back door quickly and bike put the window down.

921
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
What about the door?

922
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Was it locked or unlocked?

923
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm going to say unlocked for the sake of being a Fee Park journalist.

924
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Nailed it.

925
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Nailed it.

926
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You did nail it.

927
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You nailed my rationale as well.

928
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

929
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Look, you're right.

930
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I am blossoming into the thorny rose who loves haunts.

931
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
However, people coming into my car, this is an entire other level.

932
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I am taking baby steps.

933
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't think Jason should have been driving, but I do think he should have been in the back seat of the car.

934
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Because this would have been a really deep end as far as haunts.

935
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, it would have been a deep end.

936
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I would have flocked all the doors.

937
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yes.

938
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

939
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't think there's anything.

940
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
We recorded a lot of this and I filmed a lot of videos of it.

941
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And my voice is edgy.

942
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I watched them all back.

943
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I am right into precarious.

944
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
No, no, no.

945
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That's what I say at every haunt.

946
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And that's what I was saying at this.

947
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I understand fun peer pressure, but I'm sorry.

948
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I don't want these people going.

949
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's my car, damn it.

950
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You guys speculating about people being in the tunnel, whether the car wash is on or off, to be revealed.

951
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Flash me back to doing the dinosaur themed car wash.

952
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And I was like, all right, got to be very careful.

953
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Got to get on track correctly.

954
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You got to make sure I'm in the right gear.

955
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I mean, I have an automatic car, but they tell you like, oh, put in neutral sometimes.

956
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You were sort of it was unclear whether you were going to do this in general.

957
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But as soon as the idea came up, you said, not driving real fast.

958
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
No, I you would have run over someone.

959
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That was my fear.

960
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I drive through Six Flags or drive through Trick or Treat.

961
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm like, I am going to my foot is going to slip.

962
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm going to plow into class twisted.

963
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,000
If you were like in Don Knotts level nervousness mode, it would be very easy to accidentally drive over someone's foot.

964
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah. It really was shockingly easier than I even thought it would be.

965
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And can we talk about just what exactly the second we got into line, like inside the car wash line with scare actors, what happened that something went wrong?

966
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Something was wrong.

967
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yes. So the delay where we're just talking about what we can see around us,

968
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
that's partially because we were there for a while and we realized we're past the ticket point and we're not in the street anymore.

969
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We're sitting there and like no cars are coming out.

970
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
We haven't seen one car come up because we're trying to figure out do they wash the cars or not?

971
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Right. And we have nothing to support evidence on either side because no cars coming out wet or dry.

972
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But we are seeing managers having very tense conversations.

973
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
A lot of movement among sort of non-cloth like non-costumed people.

974
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Non-psycho clowns.

975
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But then also we are seeing psycho clowns go and examine what's happening.

976
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Casually.

977
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah. Casually is the word.

978
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Or like their posture is certainly not in scare mode.

979
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
They are also going to see if they can help or they can do something or they're waiting for something to happen.

980
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And then we're seeing this multiple people back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

981
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There's a security guard that's wandering who I believe has a gun.

982
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
We noticed that.

983
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, I was going to say a gun was in play at the haunted car.

984
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We are now in the scare zone.

985
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
We've entered the scare zone and now we are, everything is broken down.

986
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But they also are not quite scaring us yet because we're still too close to the street.

987
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Too close to the sidewalk, yeah.

988
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So we're not really getting our entertainment other than the radio station that I have tuned to,

989
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
which is pretty much like scary drones, but then sometimes like a big shriek or spike.

990
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Like it's a lot of just like, vroom, vroom, jing!

991
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And then suddenly a giant one.

992
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Like a knife sound effect.

993
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Which did was, I liked that.

994
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I liked that.

995
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And then it was a little staticky because it's like a local broadcast radio station.

996
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That was effectively creepy and gave it a tone.

997
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That is a radio station they told you to tune to?

998
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, that was a sign.

999
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And it sounds like it was like in film school when you would have to go to the quote unquote equipment cage

1001
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and get like sound effect CDs.

1002
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes.

1003
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And it was just, it was like, okay, that's a screaming band.

1004
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That's the Wilhelm scream.

1005
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yep.

1006
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's a spooky wind.

1007
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That's a Frankenstein.

1008
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But it's just played on a loop on this radio station.

1009
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes.

1010
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yes, yeah.

1011
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's more like a drive-in movie.

1012
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Okay.

1013
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But I thought this was, I think this was Trent Reznor level sound immersion.

1014
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I thought this was done expertly.

1015
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah.

1016
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And I've plopped into it.

1017
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Sphere quality.

1018
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yes, yes, sphere audio quality.

1020
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I feel like eventually one car somehow exits and we get in one car enough that we're in the scare zone.

1021
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

1022
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
There was not a problem despite, you were reading a lot into things.

1023
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
At one point you referred to like several of the employees have joined arms.

1024
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
They are, I feel like you were flashing to like somebody died in there.

1025
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Were you actually thinking about that?

1026
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That like, did it happen?

1027
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Did somebody's foot get run over?

1028
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It doesn't seem.

1029
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's not plausible.

1030
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
With what we know now, that seems like it might happen every night.

1031
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Right.

1032
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It seems like.

1034
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I don't think I thought anyone was dead because I think there would have been a lot more like

1035
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
traffic.

1036
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
There would have been more people running and a lot of like panic.

1037
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay, question two.

1038
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Did you see an ambulance at all?

1039
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
No.

1040
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
No.

1041
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I've been at enough theme parks.

1042
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I have seen an ambulance pull up or stretcher go by.

1043
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Kind of puts, makes you, I feel like at a Six Flags or like Hershey, like people, if someone gets heat stroke or someone like falls, they are usually security is like, oh, we have to call 911.

1044
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,000
We have to call or at least the local, you know, nurses on staff have to come and check on a person.

1045
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't know that this infrastructure is necessarily there at the haunted car wash.

1046
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Do you think that they have a nurse on staff at the car wash?

1047
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
No, I don't.

1048
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But I think in an emergency, they would just call 911 and an ambulance and a fire truck would legally show up.

1049
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And then they'd have to get in the line though.

1050
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And they'd get in the line!

1051
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We're trying.

1052
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Who do we owe?

1053
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We can't get past the escalator.

1054
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Claw, claw, claw.

1055
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
No, sir, we're trying to get to the woman that passed out.

1056
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
We're not a themed vehicle.

1057
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We are actual ambulance.

1058
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And it's like taking the fibulators off the shelf.

1059
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Anyway, everything's fine.

1060
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
No one was crushed.

1061
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's not in our hour.

1062
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We were stuck in this zone for almost, I think, 45 minutes.

1063
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That was most of the time was looking at all these people trying to figure out what was going on.

1064
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah.

1065
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But we eventually get into the territory where we are starting to get scared.

1066
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And you see, you know, really this whole thing, this should be called the haunted car wash line.

1067
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Yes.

1068
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Really what is being haunted much more so than the car wash itself is the line of cars while you wait to get into the car wash.

1069
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So it's like there's two rows of cars and characters are marching back and forth and kind of stalking and like running their heads across creepy and maybe clawing.

1070
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And then and like maybe lunging at a car with like a big axe and you think they're going to smash the window, but they pull it back right onto.

1071
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And this is this is a creepy scene.

1072
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It's a creepy scene up ahead of you.

1073
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Even before they're at your car, there's there's fog going.

1074
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
There's scary lights.

1075
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
There's definitely like they are.

1076
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
They've established some kind of like zombie apocalypse vibes at school.

1077
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So, you know, when you're in an in and out and they have a couple of employees that are just like a little bit ahead of the line versus actually the box, that's sort of what's happening here.

1078
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
There's a couple of clowns that are like they're all clowns, by the way.

1079
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So we have to say yes, I did pick that up from the writer.

1080
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
There are various forms of clowns.

1081
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And do you do you have the text of the sign that said like tunnel of terror?

1082
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think you said this on a video that it says tunnel of terror, but then terrors crossed out and it says wasteland.

1083
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Okay.

1084
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's a tunnel of wasteland.

1085
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So why would they're so different?

1086
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Kind of a lateral move.

1087
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Why are they correcting terror?

1088
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's a terror out of it.

1089
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Is populated by clowns.

1090
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
By clowns.

1091
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yes.

1092
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
We were in the time we had to wait.

1093
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We were discussing what is the story of this and the story that I had maybe in my head, I was thinking this is going to be like a zombie thing.

1094
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And then once we actually saw the characters it became clear this is clowns.

1095
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
There are not zombies.

1096
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's entirely clowns.

1097
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But the surroundings are not like dark fun house style.

1098
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
There's no theming beyond the clowns.

1099
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No.

1100
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah.

1101
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The theme is some clowns and a sign that says terror, tunnel of wasteland.

1102
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Tunnel of wasteland.

1103
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So we inch forward bit by bit.

1104
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It'll go ahead one car at a time.

1105
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And something I learned about my car is that every time you inch forward and then stop it again or put it into park, then everything unlocks.

1106
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And thus I have to like quickly lock the door and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be a big star.

1107
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So we're going to have to do that.

1108
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm going to be a big star.

1109
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm going to be a big star.

1110
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm going to be a big star.

1111
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And then it's going to be like a big star.

1112
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And then it's going to be like a big star.

1113
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Or put it into park, then everything unlocks.

1114
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And thus I have to like quickly lock, lock, lock.

1115
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And you might get concerned that, well, if they're going to check your door and see that it's locked and then they're not going to go in our doors, which are unlocked.

1116
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Then they're not going to go in our doors, which are unlocked.

1117
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But then I just said well, then that is up to the individual clown.

1118
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It is up to them to check every door handle themselves.

1119
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Individuals are allowed to make decisions.

1120
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's why all parents can lock some doors and not all.

1121
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So I found my and I had to show you how to make sure.

1122
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
No, you pull it back that way.

1123
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yes. Make sure yours is unlocked.

1124
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You do whatever you want.

1125
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And I was wrong because they thoroughly checked all the doors.

1126
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
They did. They knew that maybe one door could be locked and one door could be open.

1127
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That first moment where they rattle because they started with mine.

1128
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah. And that is a very unsettling moment.

1129
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And I'm glad that it worked.

1130
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm glad they didn't like pound and demand and points like no, no, no.

1131
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I did have agency in this.

1132
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah. And I will say we they put the most aggressive clown up front.

1133
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Someone I showed a video to somebody of that clown and they said he was a terrifier.

1134
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh, yeah. Like art the of course.

1135
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He's like art the clown from last year's argument.

1136
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Art the clown from the argument.

1137
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And they really like no other clown matched his commitment to this.

1138
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Well, he the first thing that happened was he got he opened your door.

1139
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Yes. Leaned over you and was like, yeah.

1140
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So he literally invade your personal space.

1141
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We saw him doing this to the Escalade full of children.

1142
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
He was just like sitting in there.

1143
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
He would open the trunk and just get in the trunk with the kids.

1144
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah. And the kids didn't seem that bothered.

1145
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
They were excited. They're moving all around.

1146
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes. As more than multiple clout.

1147
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That was that felt like you're watching a car get torn apart.

1148
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yes. There might have been three clowns getting into that one.

1149
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah. And the kids are just like, no problem.

1150
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The kids did not care.

1151
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What I'm so afraid of.

1152
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
A ton of kids are fine with.

1153
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But yes, the aggressive art the clown.

1154
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
He got you first.

1155
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
He got me. He opens the door.

1156
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
He like gets in there.

1157
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
He like invades my personal space pretty good.

1158
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And it becomes very clear to me very fast that this art the clown guy smells really bad.

1159
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
He stinks.

1160
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
This clown stinks.

1161
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
This clown stinks.

1162
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And not like he's been doing the job for like eight hours and his body is just.

1163
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
This is a body odor stink.

1164
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
That's what I'm thinking.

1165
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Unless it was an outfit that hadn't been washed, which I think I compared this to the.

1166
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
When Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, he's never washed that suit.

1167
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Oh, right.

1168
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So he wants to keep people.

1169
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So I was wondering, I don't know.

1170
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I like either this gentleman just maybe needed to put on deodorant or he's doing something to fuck with people.

1171
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I don't know the answer to it, but I immediately kind of pivot on my keep the door open.

1172
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Well, the smell was really bothering me.

1173
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I would say like out of every like maybe 12 times someone opened our door or did something to our car.

1174
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah.

1175
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It was like 75 percent art the clown.

1176
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yes.

1177
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He moved so fast he was back up and he's back again.

1178
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And like the other clowns, we got like one interaction with them and they were like 25 percent of the like aggressiveness of this art guy.

1179
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But then art would be back after they were back.

1180
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You would assume, well, art is he's done this car.

1181
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Now he's going to another car.

1182
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He's going to do his thing.

1183
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
No arts back.

1184
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
He's open.

1185
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Open my door again.

1186
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
He came in my door.

1187
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
He came over.

1188
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
He leaned over the baby.

1189
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The child is called a baby seat.

1190
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I think that's why.

1191
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Child.

1193
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This also really disturbed me.

1194
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
He wasn't there, but that seat is so much a part of my son's life and family.

1195
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Seeing a scary smelly clown just even near that seat.

1196
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That is pretty startling.

1197
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Really upset me.

1198
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I think the person is, I think I did have an anger.

1199
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I mean, this would have bothered me no matter what.

1200
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I think it would have bothered Jason too.

1201
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But it's not about it being my car.

1202
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I think that did just bug.

1203
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Like this is my item in the world.

1204
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And it's scary clowns all over it.

1205
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You're like, no, and you lock the trunk.

1206
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Well, I locked the trunk because my laptop was back there.

1207
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Once I saw that it was a possibility that the car ahead of us, they just popped in the trunk and then sat in it.

1208
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And I pictured them doing that exact same sit right onto my laptop.

1209
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And there are some people, some clowns of larger carriage who are working this job.

1210
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And my laptop would not stand a chance against some of the people who might sit down.

1211
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Did you tell me you have 61 unfinished screenplays on that laptop?

1212
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yes, over 200 things that I've started.

1213
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
A novel.

1214
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Anytime I try to explain like a Dropbox, I cloud.

1215
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
He just like zones out and walks away.

1216
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He doesn't listen to cloud back.

1217
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I mean, I started like 13 versions of an update on Pepe Le Pew.

1218
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And every one of them could be gone.

1219
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
The world will never get to see any of what could be my Star Wars.

1220
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You would have had to post like on Instagram, like help art.

1221
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The clown stole my laptop.

1222
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yeah, get it back.

1223
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah.

1224
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But hopefully one of my oldest friends or my oldest friends would go and actually talk to the clown and get it back.

1225
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:35,000
If you don't know the ghoul we're talking about, whatever, this is an inside joke for you know, you know, you know, you know, the horrible man, you know, the world is broken.

1226
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It must have really, by the way, must have really bugged him to have to post on social media like that.

1227
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This guy does not like attention.

1228
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
He likes to sit and do his work.

1229
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
That's why he's a writer.

1230
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah.

1231
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I got to say, watching video recaps of this experience, it felt like, do you guys know that Tim Robinson sketched the Pointer Brothers?

1232
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yes.

1233
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I think it's on his characters, Netflix episode of the characters.

1234
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And so it's a bunch of people going to watch some entertainment.

1235
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It might be at a conference or something.

1236
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And like Tim Robinson and Connor Romali and another guy just come out and start pointing at audience members.

1237
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And a guy in the audience goes, that can't be what this is.

1238
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That is how I felt watching videos of this.

1239
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I was like, that can't be what this is.

1240
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
When I realized what was the car wash in the background, the clowns in the line, I was like, oh no.

1241
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Why have the Tim Robinson flash when I was worried about my laptop back there.

1242
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I was thinking about Chunky.

1243
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh yeah, Chunky.

1244
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's my laptop.

1245
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You had all summer.

1246
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Figure out what you do.

1247
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:52,000
There's one thing though, because it wasn't all that it was, because a certain scare actor, I feel like, because we were in that scare line.

1248
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I would say 45 minutes.

1249
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I feel like that's the downtime we were in the scare line ish.

1250
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
30 minutes.

1251
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I know because you had to pee, Mike, and you kept talking about it.

1252
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah, I was stupid and didn't pee before we started.

1253
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And then that like breakdown.

1254
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That's why I had my eye on it so hard.

1255
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,000
But it did make me feel like because of the long wait that Art the Clown felt the need to escalate things.

1256
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Art the Clown proceeded to do something that redefined what I understood about haunts in general.

1257
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And I think in this moment made the haunt for me.

1258
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yes.

1259
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, let you know what is possible.

1260
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But made me satisfied with the experience.

1261
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Killed me too, yeah.

1262
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
In an unexpected way that made me both disgusted and not delighted, but impressed.

1263
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Jason, can you guess what we might be saying?

1264
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Well, I have a guess based on a Dr. Clown clip I saw.

1265
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Okay.

1266
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But does, was it poop based?

1267
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Thank God, no.

1268
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
No, no, no, no, no. Oh boy.

1269
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I mean you're in the realm of...

1270
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Correct.

1271
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But not that gross.

1272
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Just tell me because I have other things I've viewed.

1273
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Let me say a couple, let me do the first step.

1274
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Because I forgot that there were a couple iterations.

1275
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You knew that bodily things could be possible when a clown reached up their nose.

1276
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Well, that's this, right?

1277
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Is that this? Wait, wait, okay.

1278
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

1279
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1280
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes.

1281
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
He just did a gesture and yes.

1282
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The very first thing was reaching up into his nose.

1283
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That's right.

1284
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And then pulling out the contents and then making like a cross on my windshield.

1285
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I missed that.

1286
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The clown picked his nose.

1287
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, he'd say he did that too?

1288
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yes, he did both things.

1289
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
That was the first one.

1290
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That was the first one.

1291
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
He picked his nose and made a cross on the windshield and right in front of me.

1292
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That was where you were sitting.

1293
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It was Scott's car which couldn't feel good, but it was right in front of me and very aggressive.

1294
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I still had the stench in my nose.

1295
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You had just gotten the stench and then you see a cross made of boogers.

1296
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah.

1297
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And now I'm like, this thing better wash your car.

1298
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
This entire thing does not end.

1299
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That's when I knew it did, I think.

1300
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Where you go, well, of course.

1301
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
That's why you do that.

1302
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I was also worried that the cross made of boogers was some kind of weird signal.

1303
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Like these people are down for this.

1304
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
He didn't balk at my smell.

1305
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
He didn't throw up.

1306
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That means I can throw up on him.

1307
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But then he walked over to my window, tapped on the window, stuck his tongue out from the clown mask and licked the dirty car.

1308
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Wow.

1309
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Licked the window of the dirty car while we all watched.

1310
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
A clown licked my car.

1311
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The unwashed.

1312
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
A dirty, unwashed clown.

1313
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I forgot to say that part.

1314
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I was also hoping for a wash because even pre-clown booger, my car was dirty.

1315
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I was like, that would be a nice perk of this thing.

1316
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
If I get an actual car wash, I need a car wash.

1317
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
My car is specifically pretty dirty.

1318
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I've never seen something so vile in real life as the tongue of the art clown wiping across the dirty window.

1319
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
This is beyond what I...

1320
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I said, man, I wish Jason was here.

1321
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But I was like, we need to be able to explain this to somebody.

1322
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
We know we're not insane.

1323
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
We all three produce the same memory.

1324
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
He's a decorated survivor.

1325
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Scott, once we recorded a bunch of episodes back to back or something, we were working on something,

1326
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and I had a can of La Croix without thinking we were just talking and put it down on your roof.

1327
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And you're like, oh, can you put that on the ground or put it somewhere else?

1328
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I don't want water.

1329
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And I'm like, oh my God, I'm so sorry I wasn't even thinking.

1330
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It was nice of you to leave out all the profanities that I actually said.

1331
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That fucking can of piece of shit.

1332
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You called me a little pig.

1333
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You basically didn't hear Baldwin voicemail at me.

1334
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Do whatever you want.

1335
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Because I left a can of like your little pig soda, coconut La Croix on your roof for a second.

1336
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So I can't imagine.

1337
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I got very reasonable cross wearing like, oh, sorry, I wasn't thinking.

1338
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
We recorded so long.

1339
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But a clown licking your window and picking up the filth.

1340
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And Eva, you say again, you have paid for like, oh, I'm going to crawl up to your house.

1341
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It is $80 because they're like a commando who thinks World War II is still going on.

1342
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You are disgusted by it.

1343
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It must have been so gross.

1344
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It felt spontaneous.

1345
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I felt like he was like, I've been doing I've been bothering these people for too long.

1346
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I've come back to this car too many times.

1347
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I've reached the level where I needed up the game before they go in.

1348
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Gigi Allen of haunt of scare act.

1349
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And none of the other clowns are behaving this way.

1350
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Wow.

1351
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Only art.

1352
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The clown was licking cars.

1353
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I don't want to correct you.

1354
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I think that it might have not been art.

1355
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I think that because I'm looking at a video, I think this is the video.

1356
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
This is this is like this is like a bald.

1357
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No, that was that was.

1358
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That's you.

1359
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I thought this whole time you were referring to the the triple faced clown.

1360
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
No, no, no, we're talking about the white, the white.

1361
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The triple faced clown.

1362
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'll get to it.

1363
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The triple faced man did something along these lines, too.

1364
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So, you know, there's other gross outs.

1365
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You know, when I have it, why don't I play the moment?

1366
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We can hear how this actually played out, not see it because we didn't we

1367
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
nobody had a camera in prime position.

1368
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
But I can only admit, Eva, only you have to live with the scar of this

1369
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
happening next to your head.

1370
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yes.

1371
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
OK.

1372
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Right. You could not drive.

1373
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You could drive. You could run over a guy.

1374
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
You don't know.

1375
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm impressed with the lack of safety.

1376
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
He's looking at your car.

1377
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
He's looking at your car.

1378
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1379
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Oh, no.

1380
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Um, that conveys it.

1381
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I got so, so petulant.

1382
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So, no, my car even with the light of mine for one second.

1383
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And then like, yeah, you wake up the next morning.

1384
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You're like, oh, no, what have I done?

1385
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
A little perspective on it goes a long way.

1386
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And then he came into the car.

1387
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Now he's over the car seat.

1388
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Ten seconds later, he's deep into the he's on the end.

1389
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
This was I think he was scaring you.

1390
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I think I think like I think there's clowns on either side of you in this moment.

1391
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I become in that door, too.

1392
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
He just had he was overstaying his welcome.

1393
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, much.

1394
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He was.

1395
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But he was moving around so fast.

1396
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Like, I feel he was giving everyone this kind of attention.

1397
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
He was on.

1398
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Well, this is this is interesting that I, you know, because I actually was picturing

1399
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
triple faced clown because I think he was I think he was pretty solid, too.

1400
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
He did some great stuff, too.

1401
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And which here, why don't I play the moment of that?

1402
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And this I do have framed pretty nicely.

1403
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I didn't know I'd be in such a good position for it.

1404
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Here is the highlight of triple faced clown.

1405
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah, that's right.

1406
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
He just spit on the car.

1407
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Really?

1408
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Once you've even licked and snotted on the spit is like no problem.

1409
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Is it reciprocal?

1410
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Like that guy had your car in his exactly.

1411
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Yes.

1412
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah.

1413
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Yeah.

1414
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
My window was like in his body, essentially.

1415
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
My dirty window.

1416
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They should have saved arts antics for like right before you went in because I did think,

1417
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
holy shit, I didn't realize they could do this.

1418
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Now, what are we in for?

1419
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
But nothing really.

1420
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But instead, it was like it was an early climax, unfortunately.

1421
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yes.

1422
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And almost none of the performers were into it as much as that guy.

1423
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Just a car getting licked is imagery that I can't really.

1424
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Just a car getting licked is imagery that I can't really unsee in any context.

1425
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Just the mere fact and the phrase lick my car has been in my head since.

1426
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And I was thinking how two things.

1427
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
One, just like listener, try it in a moment of anger and like especially in like a road rage incident.

1428
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
See what happens if you say, hey, I'll lick my car to see what happens.

1429
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Does it diffuse the fight?

1430
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Does it escalate it?

1431
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Does it escalate it?

1432
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Because it's so strange.

1433
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Or does it make the person you're fighting with go, sorry, what?

1434
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Or lick their car.

1435
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Or do they actually do it and lick your car?

1436
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It makes me think of in high school, in college, there was a guy who went on dates with a couple of my friends.

1437
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And the things people said about him was that during making out, he would grab a woman's head and erotically lick their forehead.

1438
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And that's what I felt like they flashed you when Art licked the car.

1439
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Like licking something that you're not supposed to lick.

1440
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

1441
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It's really something.

1442
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I also thought.

1443
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
What a move.

1444
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

1445
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That was his move.

1446
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
What a trademark.

1447
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Multiple people said it.

1448
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
He's like, yeah, that's his.

1449
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That guy's move, his thing is that he licks a car.

1450
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah.

1451
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Before he goes into your house and has sex with you, he licks your car.

1452
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I also thought the other thing about the phrase that occurred to me is that like, I don't know if they still do this,

1453
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:27,000
but that whole weird practice of censoring the movies for cable with the bizarre phrases that are not profanities.

1454
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Car licker.

1455
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Hey, listen, car.

1456
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah, it's kind of a good euphemism for suck my dick.

1457
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Like, why don't you lick my car?

1458
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
For years, you know, I had only seen the cable cut of Mallrats.

1459
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:53,000
For a long time, I thought Jason Lee's catchphrase was, holy snot, because he says, holy shit, so many times.

1460
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And every time they use the same edit of, holy snot.

1461
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Which an holy shit doesn't read as a catchphrase, but holy snot, absolutely.

1462
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yeah, it does.

1463
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I was like, well, that's catchphrase.

1464
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And then I bought it on DVD because it was one of those $5 DVDs, $10 DVDs forever.

1465
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And I'm like, I want more money.

1466
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And that's it.

1467
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I thought.

1468
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
What was the thing's dick conversation when it was censored?

1469
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
What's that?

1470
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Remember he has a conversation with Stan Lee about like the superhero dick?

1471
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh, that's a great question.

1472
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I do not remember.

1473
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
What could that have been?

1474
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah, just gibberish, I guess.

1475
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It would be a fun thing to go back and watch the edit of it.

1476
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah.

1477
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Yeah, put the ad on stream.

1478
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Put the TV cuts on stream.

1479
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah, yeah, they should activate the other audio modes.

1480
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah, yeah, please.

1481
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I miss those.

1482
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Anyway, so yeah, I agree.

1483
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
At that point, I think we were all buzzing.

1484
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That was a cosmic horror for me.

1485
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Like, if this is true, what else is true?

1486
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
If this guy can lick a car, what else can happen to us tonight?

1487
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Are we going to die tonight?

1488
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Like, I really wasn't.

1489
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Put anything on the table.

1490
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Another thing that happened post-car lick was the discussion of, you know, when I got

1491
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
home, Aaron said, like, did he, like, put, like, a condom on it or something?

1492
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Was there any protection?

1493
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Like, I don't think, yeah, yeah.

1494
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
No.

1495
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Dental dam on your sedan.

1496
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Dental dam on your car wash lick.

1497
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And, Mike, you said something similar, and you skipped to some, like, is there some,

1498
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
like, wax or something that he would, and I think that's a reasonable question maybe

1499
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:32,000
in some other setting, except that I think that this is, like, this is seasonal hires

1500
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
in Anaheim, that's something that a magician might do.

1501
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It was a petulant car lick, too.

1502
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It seemed like he just decided to do it because we weren't giving him the reaction he wanted.

1503
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Wait, that's a question, because only you saw it.

1504
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Was there, like, yeah, was it angry?

1505
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Was there an attempted sensuality to it?

1506
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It was like, it was like, you're doing it very, like, fraudulent.

1507
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Because it was like, you know, there's a whole, like, face in front of the face, and he's

1508
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
sticking his tongue out of it, it's like.

1509
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh, so not that much can get out.

1510
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's as much as he can get through the mouth hole.

1511
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, because it's sticking his tongue out as far as he could get it to get it to the car.

1512
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Did you notice that he, like, spit after that, or did he swallow whatever was on his mouth from the window?

1513
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
He's in the mask.

1514
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
He kind of walked away so we didn't see, yeah, I didn't see him spitting.

1515
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
What if he went into my car right after?

1516
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
What if he spit it into my car?

1517
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
It's possible.

1518
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
You're okay to spit your car into your car.

1519
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You've got to de-louse your car.

1520
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Even the whole time you're thinking, like, well, even I get an exterior car wash, they're not going to vacuum.

1521
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
They're not going to.

1522
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, you know what? At the end of it, there were a big row of vacuums and there was nobody in that.

1523
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Like, technically I could have stopped and vacuumed and we were all like, no, thanks.

1524
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
No.

1525
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Not stopping for vacuuming.

1526
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
What if car liquor comes back?

1527
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So, should we get to the actual, the second, the turn?

1528
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah.

1529
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Well, I want to say this real quick.

1530
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
First of all, well, okay, they're walking up and down and all these cars are like in park or they're idling or something.

1531
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They're just inhaling exhausts.

1532
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1533
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
All night.

1534
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah.

1535
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And this wouldn't be the only time when they make performers inhale, like, probably toxic things.

1536
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So, for all you know, that car, he could have inhaled so much that he could have thought, like, he could have been hallucinating.

1537
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
He could have thought that car was the love of his life.

1538
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
His good lady wife.

1539
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Finally, yeah.

1540
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Hello, dear.

1541
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Or a big turkey.

1542
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Rebecca.

1543
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Rebecca.

1544
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh, yeah.

1545
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Big turkey.

1546
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Glass of water in the desert.

1547
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah.

1548
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah.

1549
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:43,000
He's like just minutes from dying from his breathing smoke or whatever, like, asphyxiating.

1550
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And he's like, yes, it's Cynthia.

1551
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
My sweet love.

1552
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Can I lick you one last time?

1553
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You know, I know a couple, a few couples at this point who met working at theme parks.

1554
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Is it possible there was a love story where like, well, the doctor clown and the cheerleader clown, you know, we met working at the horn of car wash.

1555
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Didn't you see two clowns with like their arms around each other when the breakdown was happening?

1556
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We saw someone touching someone's waist.

1557
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Wasn't that the manager?

1558
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1559
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm a fan.

1560
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Maybe married to somebody who worked or like touching someone at work.

1561
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I mean, look, on set romances, rehearsal, romance happens.

1562
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Well, I hope that if Art fell in love with my car, that he didn't write down the license plate and isn't scouring the Burbank area.

1563
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Breaking the garage.

1564
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I mean, season.

1565
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Apple key under your bumper.

1566
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Apple key tag.

1567
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I'll see you soon, my love.

1568
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
This won't be our final lick.

1569
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So there's a so can I jump ahead?

1570
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Much have we got a line.

1571
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:07,000
But the funny thing is like you get up to the end of the long line and then you're just at the place where you buy a car wash and there's the manager there in a manager outfit.

1572
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
No clown. Nothing.

1573
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Regular guy just hopping in.

1574
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Okay, let's button button button.

1575
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Okay, is that okay?

1576
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Gold wash.

1577
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Go send you know the value of the you're getting a twelve dollar car wash as part of a fifty dollar of a fifty dollar experience.

1578
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yes.

1579
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
But that answered the question.

1580
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Indeed.

1581
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It does wash your car and I got so excited since it had been licked and boogered and I was like if they're washing the car, they could have thrown blood on the car.

1582
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
They could have done like a lot more shit if they really wanted.

1583
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yes.

1584
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Could have put shit on the car or dirt.

1585
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1586
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And then getting washed anyway.

1587
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Why do they just like a little lick?

1588
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Because they only can find one guy in Anaheim or two.

1589
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I guess the spitter was not.

1590
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That's not as bad.

1591
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I would spit on a car.

1592
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I'd spit on a car in a second.

1593
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I would not lick a car though.

1594
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
If they could have thrown a bucket of blood on the car, that could be really fun if you're going to wash it anyway.

1595
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That's kind of what I was expecting.

1596
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
No, just the little lick.

1597
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Which hurt him more.

1598
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I don't want to accuse you guys of erasing my trauma.

1599
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But you're right that like the spit isn't as aggro because he didn't touch my car with his mouth.

1600
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But on my end, being that close to watching spit dribble on again one of my belongings.

1601
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And I know that it was going to be washed.

1602
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I had a feeling it was going to be washed soon, but I didn't quite know.

1603
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And I mean, we're only three days out from this as we record this.

1604
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
You better believe I've looked at that spot every single time I've gotten in and out of my car and just thought about that spit being there.

1605
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I still see it.

1606
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It's still real to me.

1607
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Oh, wow.

1608
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I get it.

1609
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That makes sense.

1610
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
But so, but thank God we are getting a wash.

1611
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Yeah.

1612
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And you were talking about the manager.

1613
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:58,000
They didn't figure out any sort of mechanism to just open up the like, whatever you call those things, the gate thing with the whatever the things that move up when you put the money into the car.

1614
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Yeah, they didn't just like, oh, we'll pull them up and then we're just going to have it on auto.

1615
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Whatever. Yeah.

1616
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
No, the manager had to keep going back and forth between two kiosks.

1617
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And punching in some sort of a free coupon, like free coupon to get them to open and for the car wash to actually work.

1618
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And he was not in character.

1619
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
He just seemed like this is the shittiest job I could possibly have back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

1620
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I saw that in a video clip.

1621
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
There was just a guy in a blue polo in black slacks.

1622
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah, that's the clown.

1623
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
That's right.

1624
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yes.

1625
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And he's like, oh, this is very funny.

1626
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:42,000
They're pulling up to the care zone and like there's a creepy cheerleader clown and rubbing a baby doll on the front of the hood and going car wash.

1627
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And then I'm like, oh, that's creepy.

1628
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And then I like kind of look and I'm like, I think they have a sponge because it's the dragon or it's like a stuffed animal.

1629
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
But just the person going car wash, car wash.

1630
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I remember the only words a clown said was he opened Mike's door.

1631
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I went to a point and went, do you like clowns?

1632
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yes.

1633
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
There was a guy and then yes, he said, do you like clowns?

1634
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I go, yes.

1635
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And he just like there was a good beat, which I thought was a pretty good like comedy beat for him.

1636
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And he just slammed the door.

1637
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And then he went, oh, and he closed the door.

1638
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Like he didn't. I didn't answer correctly.

1639
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I didn't say no.

1640
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And then he would be like, well, I'm a clown.

1641
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And then, but no, I said yes.

1642
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And then he's closed the door.

1643
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So that's like when you sense that they're not following you because they want a reaction more than they.

1644
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
He wants to scream.

1645
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Yeah.

1646
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So I ruined his fun, I think.

1647
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Another thing we haven't mentioned is that they would say if this is the fun we would have gotten if I kept my door open as the driver that they would have reached in and honked the horn.

1648
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
There was a lot of that going on all over the place.

1649
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And then some people were not dragged out.

1650
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I don't think it took, but people were definitely outside of the car.

1651
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
They were definitely trying to get people to come out.

1652
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And you seem to draw the line there, Eva.

1653
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I feel like Mike might have.

1654
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
You might have gotten out of the car.

1655
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I would have gotten out of the car.

1656
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah.

1657
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And then right after our car wash was paid for in a non-horror way, right after that was the point where a clown just fully got into the car and then drove one stop with him and then got out.

1658
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah.

1659
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
That was cool.

1660
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Erin's question about that was like, what if they could kidnap that guy?

1661
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They could just take off.

1662
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah.

1663
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
But I guess that's what, you know, he did it in the safe zone.

1664
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It's like between lots of line and the car wash.

1665
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yes.

1666
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:36,000
The funniest clip I saw, well, after you finish, I will explain the most funny clip.

1667
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But a very funny clip I saw, there was a clown in like a just seraphine and they were like mad doing a car and they weren't making any noise.

1668
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
They were just getting closer and closer and they were right up against the car and they put their hand on the windshield.

1669
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
They had a massive sponge and just started wrapping the car.

1670
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That's so funny.

1671
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Car wash related humor.

1672
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yeah.

1673
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yeah.

1674
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
We didn't get any of that.

1675
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
There was no sponge or anything.

1676
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Basically, it just hit us that, okay, we are just getting fully a regular car wash.

1677
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And it was, they didn't like theme it spooky.

1678
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It was the regular signs and the signs telling you the rules to put it in neutral and make sure the windows are up, basic stuff.

1679
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Regular got not a clown telling you that information.

1680
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
So then we're just cruising.

1681
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Now we're just on the little ride and the colors are not even particularly horror.

1682
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Sure, it's flashing green and red, but also blue and purple.

1683
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And these are not necessarily Halloween colors.

1684
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
This is just regular stuff by this point.

1685
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And I think it lures us into a false sense of security.

1686
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So that probably halfway through when somebody jumps out and waves a big skull stick or something at Mike, it was a real shock because we were not sure with car wash running.

1687
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Are there going to be people in the car wash?

1688
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
A clown in between the two big brushes getting hit by foam scaring us.

1689
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Yeah, because we had said before, well, like, well, they can't be like in the thing because it's really dangerous.

1690
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Like a big mechanism there.

1691
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And it's like coming down like somebody could get hurt.

1692
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
There were like five of them in the thing.

1693
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There were there were a lot more than I thought.

1694
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
They found a lot of pockets.

1695
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
That makes me anxious when workers are like between the brushes.

1696
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Oh, yeah.

1697
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Or like you see places sometimes where it's just like, yeah, just do my job.

1698
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
OK, I'll do a little squeegee.

1699
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And then the brush comes back down.

1700
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
They're doing those.

1701
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And so to see clowns doing that, they're just doing their job.

1702
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
This is what on the attraction 360 you can see this.

1703
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
OK, so a normal car, it's like you get blast with soap, the brush come down, then it rinses.

1704
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So in this video, a clown steps in on the rinse and without thinking, opens the passenger door.

1705
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:07,000
The door gets wet and you can they don't say anything, but you tell they kind of make the movement of like, oh, shit.

1706
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
They close it real quick.

1707
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
They forgot where they were.

1708
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
No, no, no.

1709
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Now that would have and that has nothing to do with like that.

1710
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You can't put that in the category of Scott doesn't like Hans or Scott's afraid to get it.

1711
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Scott's a no launch queen.

1712
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't want to put a car wash filling up my door.

1713
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
That is I get money back if that happens.

1714
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
That's like when you're getting in your car and it's like pouring rain and try to close it real quick and your hand slips.

1715
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
You're like, oh, shit.

1716
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And a bunch of water gets on the inside of the door.

1717
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You're like, well, the dry, but it's inconvenient right now.

1718
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And then you take all that and make it that a clown did it.

1719
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
There's a scary clown.

1720
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Oh, my God. Blowing around in the hot air area.

1721
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It's moving in a car wash.

1722
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's a moving platform.

1723
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:02,000
So to have a human being approach that platform in between two dangerous things coming from the ceiling spinning, pretty insane.

1724
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And in addition, like just inhaling what I assume are very toxic chemicals after maybe not toxic, but just soap and weird fumes, weird car soap.

1725
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Well, what do you OK, let's choose a path on this avenue.

1726
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Do we think that this is a car wash where actually we use materials that are safe and we've thought about this and we wouldn't put anyone in harm's way?

1727
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Or is the answer? Get out of here.

1728
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Why are you why are you asking these questions?

1729
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Don't think about it. Do you want to have a haunted car wash or not?

1730
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
What do you do?

1731
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
You have any sense? I don't want to throw the people who do this thing under the bus.

1732
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Do you have an answer? I don't.

1733
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
OK, I would say you have do you have a hunch?

1734
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Is it just cause is it just like fucking we're doing it?

1735
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I have a hunch because of just the way that it was set up like they never when we're waiting in line said, OK, now you come to this point and put your car in park and turn it off.

1736
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And then the actors come.

1737
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
So immediately once the cars are like, as far as anyone knows, somebody just has their foot on the brake.

1738
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
The cars may be in drive and you have a bunch of human beings coming up to it, going into the cars, scaring people.

1739
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
All bets are off.

1740
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Whoever put this together is actually not thinking that hard about safety.

1741
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
So that's why I believe that they may have just said, fuck it, throw some humans in there.

1742
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Tunnel of Wasteland is a rogue nation.

1743
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You enter the tunnel of wasteland as a prison planet.

1744
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah, anything goes.

1745
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You just try to escape.

1746
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
There's only one thing you can do.

1747
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I. Yeah, then we your new mission.

1748
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
The acolytes are scattered around the globe at the tunnel, the wasteland.

1749
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm a little wasteland tunnel of waste.

1750
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
So, I mean, it would it gave us all quite a start that we were not safe in here.

1751
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And there was one I completely forgot about.

1752
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We were at the end and I was just focusing on like, you know, lining up and wait, does the green is a green yet?

1753
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Do I go? And then somebody got somebody slammed right against that.

1754
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And it is very effective that they're just an inch from you.

1755
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And I don't know.

1756
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And the music, you know what?

1757
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I also I was making fun of the music at first and then I forgot because it went away for a while that it had like jump scares and stabs.

1758
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So the music was hitting me again.

1759
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I have to say, by the end of this, I was pretty sold on the whole thing.

1760
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Maybe this comes from me that I have not done a lot of other haunts.

1761
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Perhaps that I perhaps I'm grading this and checked over fest too high.

1762
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I don't think so.

1763
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I was I was so delighted by both of these things.

1764
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Getting my car licked.

1765
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I who knew that this was a possibility on this earth.

1766
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It's getting his car licked.

1767
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
It's getting his car licked today.

1768
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's getting his car licked.

1769
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
If you say it with any affect, it immediately seems double entendre.

1770
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
What are you doing tonight?

1771
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Going down to Anaheim, getting my car licked.

1772
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Nice.

1773
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Cool.

1774
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It's right by the Disneyland.

1775
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Just 50 bucks.

1776
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Reasonable price.

1777
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
There's I've said this phrase.

1778
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I said it about Meow Wolf and I've said about like after you do a few of these, you do want to get and I'm of course I'm on the mild side of this.

1779
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
You want to get a little fucked up.

1780
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
You want a little something to fuck you up.

1781
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
And like you're looking for that in an unexpected way.

1782
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And this did it.

1783
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Getting your car licked.

1784
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
This car licking and the snot.

1785
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I even think the snot because you were obviously saw the licking more closely than I did.

1786
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But the snot is really what got me because it was right in front of my face.

1787
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yeah.

1788
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And I couldn't unseal.

1789
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It was just sitting.

1790
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The snot was sitting there the whole time.

1791
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Right in front of me.

1792
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So we all got one.

1793
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We all got a different bodily horror done to the bit of car in front of us.

1794
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Just like Eva got a horror at Delusion.

1795
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Nazi actor character menacing me.

1796
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:56,000
The heightening of that is that a crab monster nearly shattered multiple bones in your hand with a giant table.

1797
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yes.

1798
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
What a season it's been for you.

1799
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Raise the stakes.

1800
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Raise the stakes.

1801
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Wow.

1802
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah.

1803
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I mean I kind of get it.

1804
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And it's let's say a thing we say a lot.

1805
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Moments of intimacy.

1806
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That's right.

1807
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
These are this is parts of people gave parts of their bodies.

1808
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
People gave their DNA to this experience and put it an inch away from my face.

1809
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:29,000
This is like if Optimus Prime kind of reached through the screen and said he was proud of me but he also smelled because he's been fighting a lot and there's like oil smell and like he's obviously like he's been through it.

1810
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
So it's very similar to that.

1811
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Your bravery saved the planet.

1812
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I will now lick the windshield of Evac.

1813
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
His tongue has motor oil all over it.

1814
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I'm sorry we didn't get the video of the tongue but we did get.

1815
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
We got the audio reaction.

1816
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So I'll post that.

1817
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I think there's a lot of pictures and supplementary material to post here.

1818
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But any closing thoughts about this experience.

1819
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Wait a minute.

1820
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I mean the only person who can really do closing thoughts or really make a judgment call here is the person who wasn't there.

1821
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Jason wait was the first name.

1822
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Jagged Slash and Train.

1823
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
If we decided to do this again next year where do you land.

1824
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I will be a passenger I will not drive.

1825
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Okay.

1826
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But I will come.

1827
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Will you unlock your door?

1828
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I kind of want to see.

1829
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I kind of want to see how I'm feeling in the moment.

1830
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Maybe unlock the door but window up.

1831
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I will rent a car that doesn't have a door on your side.

1832
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
That the door has been removed.

1833
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
How will that do with the car wash?

1834
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Yeah wait.

1835
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Now he's getting splashed.

1836
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
You heard what I said.

1837
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
He's getting souped.

1838
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It's not my car I rented it.

1839
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So you're checking boxes.

1840
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
You're on the website checking it.

1841
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Why don't they have an option for three doors only.

1842
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
The back right door is removed.

1843
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You have two doors and you have four doors.

1844
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
How do I remove a door?

1845
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's like that story that Tom Lennon told on a podcast once where he rented a car in his 20s.

1846
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And he paid for the extra insurance and they just fucking destroyed the car.

1847
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
By the end you will do that for the haunted car wash.

1848
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I paid the extra enterprise.

1849
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Well that might be also on our Club 3 episode I learned the joys of washing a rental car.

1850
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And I think and then on this one I learned the horrors of having one of your belongings get licked and spit on.

1851
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So maybe I will and maybe this is how it works.

1852
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Jason comes he can decide the in the moment whether he wants to unlock the door or not.

1853
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
But we rent a car.

1854
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
My laptop is staying at home.

1855
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Because the MacBook Pro may as well be made out of a single sheet of glass.

1856
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It will just shatter if you look at it cross.

1857
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
What's the funniest car we could realistically get our hands on and drive through?

1858
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Dodge Charger?

1859
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Like the fucking bullet car.

1860
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That's funny. That's pretty good.

1861
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Yeah that's pretty good.

1862
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Great.

1863
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Any notes for next time?

1864
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Would there be a next time? Would you do this again?

1865
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Is there something you want out of the next time?

1866
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Some friends of mine live in South LA and I told them this story and they said oh yeah we drove past in South LA.

1867
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
There was a car wash that just had a sign that said haunted car wash.

1868
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And the guys were like oh yeah we went to one of these in Anaheim so we decided to do it.

1869
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So my friend and his husband just drove through and just two ghouls just got in the car and rode with them.

1870
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
The whole time?

1871
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
The entire process?

1872
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
The two guys that worked at the car wash just got in the car.

1873
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What?

1874
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And they were like woo.

1875
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And so I would like to see next year is it tunnel of wasteland?

1876
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I mean driving down to Anaheim is a lot but I guess now I have to do this until I die.

1877
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Every year. That's one of your days in October.

1878
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We could do Lakewood next year.

1879
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Let's do Lakewood.

1880
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Let's do Long Beach and then we could combine it with Shacktoberfest.

1881
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Oh there you go.

1882
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Because Lakewood is Long Beach.

1883
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Because I would like to do that one again. I think you'd enjoy that.

1884
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Let's say, let's set it in stone. I'm back on all this.

1885
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I really, if I have Halloween bluffs, this has honestly been my favorite Halloween season since I was a child.

1886
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Wow.

1887
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It really feels like it's been bad. I think pandemic hurt it.

1888
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I was starting to think like am I not going to be in a costume at a party ever again?

1889
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I don't like these haunts and is it all over for me?

1890
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It's really come back and I thank Shack first and foremost.

1891
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Shack did.

1892
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:39,000
But I thank Eva second only to Shack for alerting us to this area and for coming down to Anaheim and for joining us for this.

1893
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Eva Landerskum, you survived haunt cast The Fright.

1894
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Thank you.

1895
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:50,000
At this point also, I was doing some math. I like to keep abreast of your stats.

1896
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And at this point you've now done eight paywalled episodes.

1897
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Oh my god.

1898
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Two of them are about Dick Tracy and two of them are about car washes.

1899
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Incredible numbers.

1900
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The best stats anybody has on the show.

1901
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So thank you as always for joining us and let's exit through the crypt shop.

1902
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1903
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I would like to plug. I am doing an immersive.

1904
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Me talking shit about immersive.

1905
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I'm putting on an immersive show in November at the end of November, at the beginning of December in Koreatown, Los Angeles.

1906
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
If you want to purchase tickets are available now.

1907
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The website is the shape of the night dot com.

1908
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
That's the shape of the night dot com.

1909
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It's I'm putting on with a couple other really amazing immersive creators.

1910
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's going to be about dreams and nightmares.

1911
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
There's it's got a it's got a it's got a you got a free drink with your ticket.

1912
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It's going to be really fun.

1913
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And not to tip it too much, but how much licking is involved.

1914
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh man, I mean, Scott, you're bringing your car, right?

1915
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I'm not sure now.

1916
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
If Scott's car is not there, I'm not going.

1917
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But yeah, it's not a haunt. It's something else.

1918
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
It's creepy, but it's also like dreamy.

1919
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And I just would love any local fans come check it out.

1920
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah, I well, yes, having been to the last one of these years, you've done one since the one a few years ago.

1921
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah, I've been one of these before.

1922
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Eva puts on great shows and this is, you know, you've if you've heard her on the show with like, yeah, come see something experience Eva put together.

1923
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's you know, it's going to be great.

1924
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I'll be there. We should all go. Let's figure it out.

1925
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So thank you, Eva.

1926
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:47,000
As for us this Friday on the main feed, you will hear the final haunt cast of the year, the live show that we did at Dynasty Typewriter with our pal Anthony Geo.

1927
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So you'll get that on the main feed and then we will go back to normal haunt cast season.

1928
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Unfortunately, it's over because I've had a lot of fun this time.

1929
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But on the main feed, when we switch back to normal, a fun returning guest, somebody who hasn't been on a long time, think you will like that.

1930
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:15,000
And if you enjoyed all this and you want to hear some stuff going on on Club 3 where this whole themed car wash business started, you can always upgrade to our VIP tier Club 3 where next month, I think, is Macy's Thanksgiving Parade Balloon Disasters.

1931
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Looking forward to that one. Very excited about that particular victory.

1932
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And one more thing before we go, I'm going to take it back to Eva because something that has come up that we haven't put in the poll, but that people have mentioned and it requires your permission and participation.

1933
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Obviously, great results from Eva does whatever she wants.

1934
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:48,000
If you are free and not busy to join us for to put into the poll and Eva does whatever she wants round two.

1935
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Lick.

1936
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh no.

1937
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
We didn't take a break. Eva's hallucinating.

1938
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
She thinks the microphone is the love of her life.

1939
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Or a giant turkey leg.

1940
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Or a hot and ready pizza.

1941
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Hot and ready pizza.

1942
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Yes, of course.
