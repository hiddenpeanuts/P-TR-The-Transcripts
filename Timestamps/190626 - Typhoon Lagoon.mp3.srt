1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,400
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
We're here at the beautiful, destroyed Placid Palms Resort.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
We're talking Typhoon Lagoon today.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,720
Disney's second.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,560
Destroyed for the better.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Destroyed for the better.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,760
Destroyed for the cooler.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Yeah, Disney's second water park after River Country USA.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,780
The freshwater water park that made everyone ill.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,760
Is that correct to their stories of,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
was it not chlorinated enough to fight off?

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,480
I believe it was not chlorinated at all, right?

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,320
That seems crazy though.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,520
It's the old swimming hole.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,400
I know what it is, hold on, let me Google that.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,360
I wasn't prepared for that,

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,280
but hearing that out loud is insane.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
It does sound insane.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Well I don't know that for sure.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,200
No, I know, but that is sort of the draw.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,320
Like it's the old swimming hole,

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,640
but how would they not have a,

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,140
like that's maybe when they started.

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,120
Hold on, let's look.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
You guys talk amongst yourselves.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
Well the water park was a more,

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
less tamed industry at the time,

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,280
and the rules had not been sorted out,

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,360
although the rules of a public pool had been,

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,640
so I don't know what to tell you.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,520
Okay, I'm looking at, okay, I'm trying to load.

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,960
Keep in mind at this time,

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,920
if you stayed at the Bay Lake Resorts,

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
you could go out of your hotel building,

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,280
walk down to a beach, and swim in fresh water.

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,960
Sure, okay, so I am on a website

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,200
which I've never seen before.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
It's called themainstreetmouse.com,

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
and this is the Mainstreet Mouse.

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,080
So many.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,560
Mainstreet Mouth Mythbusters,

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
River Country and Haunted Mansion Myth.

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
So let me see if this is.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Was the Haunted Mansion chlorinated?

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Yeah.

47
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,720
Was River Country abandoned due to water contamination?

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Let's see here.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,120
Well that's different. That's a whole other issue.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,880
Okay, fine, that's not exactly the myth

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
we're trying to bust here.

52
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm curious anyway if it was.

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,880
In 1980, there were four deaths in the state of Florida

54
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
connected to the amoeba,

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
there's some word I don't can't,

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,880
some sort of infection I can't pronounce.

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Sure, sure.

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
One of these deaths was connected to River Country,

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,160
but the park did not close for another 21 years.

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Well that's the bacteria stuff.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Yeah, I mean this is all for a River Country episode.

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,480
We will learn to pronounce the name of that amoeba

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,320
by the time we do River Country.

64
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,520
We'll all run drills and all be able to spit it out.

65
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,840
And it'll be, maybe we'll spin the amoeba off

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
into its own character episode.

67
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Sure.

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Yeah, yeah, sure.

69
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
Dive into the River Country amoeba.

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,640
That sounds nice.

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,760
A Disney character,

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,880
the people who met him never forgot about him.

73
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,560
I have a park star of that amoeba as well.

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,200
So I'm partially, I'm partial to him.

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,520
People said it was in bad taste

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,760
when they introduced that amoeba, but he's so cute.

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,840
Yeah, yeah, he looks like one of the Olympic mascots.

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah.

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
The rare deadly park stars

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,600
that are in the alligator that attacks them.

81
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,960
Oh God, thank God we're in the second case.

82
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
That was the other, yeah, that was the other thing.

83
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
You could walk down to the beach,

84
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,360
swim in water filled with wildlife as we learned.

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
I guess, maybe you're right.

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Maybe there was no chlorine in that,

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
but that seems insane.

88
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
It does seem insane,

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,800
but the 70s and 80s were a different time, you know?

90
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,760
Yeah, but the nights were swimming in the 90s.

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,600
And the 90s were different.

92
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
Oh true, yeah, River Country was still going.

93
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,360
No, it closed in the 2000s, or 98.

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
I forget.

95
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Folks, are we all shit?

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,880
We don't know shit about anything

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,720
unless we're doing the episode about it.

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Yeah, I mean, sometimes casually we do, but like.

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,760
No, never.

100
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,640
If anybody's holding us to the fire

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
on River Country statistics, they shouldn't be.

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm feeling defensive this morning.

103
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
Real chill vibes.

104
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Chill vibes this morning.

105
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,880
We all were at the Cantina last night also.

106
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,320
We had a late, Jason and I had a late night

107
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,800
at the Disneyland Resort.

108
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,680
Yeah, it was not worthy this time.

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,600
Octave lower than it normally is.

110
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,960
Yeah, we're feeling the chillness

111
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,320
of the Typhoon Lagoon, of the park.

112
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,680
And we're also, it's a Sunday morning, a rare Sunday.

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah, for us this is early,

114
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,400
but you guys were on Splash Mountain at midnight.

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
At midnight, yeah.

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Potential diseases marinating in your laps.

117
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh my God, I got so,

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,720
that second to last drop on Splash is the killer.

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
The one in the middle, like pitch black.

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
Yeah, yeah, the second to last.

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Second to last, yeah.

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,880
Not the crazy drop, but the second to last one

123
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
is the one that will just,

124
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,880
literally if you're in the front,

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,800
just dump two gallons of water.

126
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah, it's not spray.

127
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,480
It's the water readjusting,

128
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,080
it's the log dipping into the water level.

129
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,400
It's like two people with big gallon buckets

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,120
just kind of throwing it over the top of the log

131
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
into your lap.

132
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,000
That's what it is like for me.

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,760
You can simulate it at home

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,920
if you just sit in a chair in a living room

135
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,440
and just take a Home Depot bucket

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,400
and pour it on your legs.

137
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
That is the Splash Mountain,

138
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
that is the real experience.

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
That's the real, yeah, that's the real.

140
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
That's the real shit.

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
If you're giving yourself a foot bath

142
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,120
and then drop it on the way to the couch,

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
that's Splash Mountain.

144
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,480
Yeah, the main drop is nothing.

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,440
No, that I think they can,

146
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,000
they can control how much splash it is

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
depending on how cold it is.

148
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
Right, because you're just on a runner,

149
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
you're not actually,

150
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
like until you get back into the water,

151
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,440
like you're on a little track.

152
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah, but you're doing,

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,320
so you did this as late as you could have possibly done,

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
as cold as you could have possibly done,

155
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
although it's the summer.

156
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Yeah, it was like 11, but 58 I think we got in line.

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Wow.

158
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,880
We tried to use a FastPass.

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,200
It was closed and then we just go in.

160
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Just walk on.

161
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,560
There was no one ahead of us, no one behind us.

162
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah, fast to certain,

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
but yeah, I've had a couple of those lately

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,240
of like pre-getting the FastPass

165
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,240
and realizing all bets are off for the last 10 minutes.

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Yeah.

167
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,760
That's still, I mean, that's still when people say,

168
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,720
when do you, when, or they're not crowds at the park,

169
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,760
it's like, well, very start of the day

170
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,400
and very end of the day.

171
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
Sure, yes.

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,400
Is still your best bet.

173
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,560
So wait for those quitter children to go to bed.

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
Yep.

175
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Yeah.

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,240
They don't have to podcast in the morning.

177
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,920
They have very important work like we do.

178
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Yeah.

179
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,160
Talking about the Disney World's second water park

180
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,320
has opened in 1989.

181
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,040
See, look, facts, I got them.

182
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Facts.

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Cool.

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,840
It's not too early for me to have facts.

185
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,560
Here at Typhoon Lagoon, you can,

186
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
it's not just water level readjusting,

187
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,880
you get wet all sorts of different ways.

188
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,320
Lazy rivers, wave pools, like water being dropped on.

189
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,880
Scuba diving at one point.

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
Scuba diving at one point.

191
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Uh-huh.

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,040
Sort of, I mean, by that I mean like floating

193
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,800
at the top of a pool that you're out of within a minute.

194
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Yes.

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Yeah, all kinds of wet.

196
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,920
Whatever wets your whistle, your whistle will get wet.

197
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,920
June, 1989, so not, so within a month of MGM Studios opening.

198
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,200
We're about, by the way, this is pretty close to,

199
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,720
we should have timed this a little earlier

200
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,840
and then it could have been literally at the 30 year mark.

201
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,680
We are. Oh yeah.

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,360
We're still in June, so we are celebrating

203
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,360
the 30th anniversary, happy 30th to Typhoon Lagoon.

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
A belated, we should have gotten you something, but.

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
No, we didn't.

206
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,520
But a late podcast is better than nothing.

207
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Yeah, we, this one, yeah, I think, what is it?

208
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,080
Like we should have, is there gonna be like a big event?

209
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
You know how they do have like a big haunted mansion event

210
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,520
coming up in Orlando for the 50th anniversary

211
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
of the haunted mansion,

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,080
and there'll be a big Typhoon Lagoon event?

213
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,200
Probably not, right?

214
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,920
Well, what they've been running a lot lately

215
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,680
is like these glow events.

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,880
Where it's like Typhoon Lagoon is open late at night

217
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,720
and there's like glow sticks and neon and stuff.

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes, I watched some, and it's,

219
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Rex from Toy Story is like raving, essentially.

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,880
I mean, that's fun.

221
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,200
Have you seen a photo or video of that or anything?

222
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,840
No. I think I've seen a photo.

223
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
Party, I forget what he has.

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,200
It can't be like a pacifier.

225
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,720
He has something that's sort of like a rave nod.

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,760
I mean, Rex with a pacifier

227
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,360
and like all of those plastic jewel,

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,560
like those bracelets, like that would be incredible.

229
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,320
Is it like Rex, was there a short or something

230
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
that this is based on?

231
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,760
Like why is Rex?

232
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Yes, doesn't he like, yeah, like there's like a glow

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,240
in the dark situation in the tub.

234
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,440
He like meets all the toys.

235
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
That's so that's what this is.

236
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,800
That's right.

237
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Okay.

238
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
Yeah, so that's, I guess you get your Rex, Phil.

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,200
I was, I saw Toy Story 4, it's good.

240
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,960
I needed more Rex.

241
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah, yeah. More Wallace Shawn, please.

242
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
Not a ton of Rex, yeah.

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,240
You were saying it's, maybe they don't service

244
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,160
the old characters, but they do have to,

245
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,960
yeah, they now are fitting in 75 main characters.

246
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so insane.

247
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,160
It is insane, yeah.

248
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,960
So yeah, not enough Rex, but you guess you get him in this

249
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,120
and then you can go rave with him at that.

250
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,200
I hope they have this.

251
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,240
I hope they have this when I go next.

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
I know they don't get rid of this.

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,280
This is, if he's sort of leading the rave

254
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,280
and the other Rex is a DJ, all the Rexes are sort of like,

255
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,880
I guess if you're a Rex, you're into EDM these days.

256
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,480
All the Rexes have SoundCloud accounts.

257
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,160
They're all popping Zan.

258
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

259
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,160
Whatever the robotic or toy equivalent of Zan is.

260
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
They're all Huffin plastic.

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Oh wow, there's a, look at this colorful drink

262
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,160
you can get at the Typhoon event.

263
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
We've lost Mike for the hour.

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
There's a big sucker as well.

265
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,120
It's crazy, it's sticking out of it.

266
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,800
Oh, you can trip out on a drink with 3% alcohol content.

267
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
It's pretty fun.

268
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
It doesn't even have alcohol in it at all.

269
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
It's maybe zero.

270
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,560
It might be zero.

271
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Mike won't be able to tell the difference.

272
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
As we've learned, Mike won't know either way.

273
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
It doesn't matter to me.

274
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
It doesn't matter to him.

275
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,280
Well, he does know because if there's no alcohol

276
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,120
or very little, he declares it the best drink he's ever had.

277
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
I think I've witnessed this three times.

278
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,160
Yes.

279
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,720
Well, there's your place for it to get non-loaded.

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,280
Yeah, and there's also, at this H2O Glow,

281
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,120
they have this bath,

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,280
that's where they have the bathtub Sunday, Jason.

283
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Oh, well yeah, so this park also has the sand pail.

284
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,440
The, oh, this, oh no, this is something different.

285
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
Yeah, this is a bathtub.

286
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,360
It's a little bathtub.

287
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,160
There's a bathtub with two little rubber duckies in it.

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
Wow, that's very cute.

289
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
And you can get ice cream and they have sprinkles.

290
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,000
And I think that it looks like there's,

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
how big of a bathtub are we talking?

292
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
It's hard to tell.

293
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
I think it's like a little plastic novelty bathtub.

294
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,600
Not one that you can actually get in in a horrible fashion.

295
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,720
It would be funny if it was like a baby bath,

296
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,400
so you know the ones that you,

297
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,480
like if you have a baby, you put it in the kitchen sink,

298
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,520
fill up.

299
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,640
I mean, that would be a lot of ice cream.

300
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Bathtub party Sunday, vanilla ice cream,

301
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
confetti cake, whipped cream, and chocolate rubber ducks.

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Chocolate rubber ducks.

303
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Nice.

304
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
They're topped with sprinkles

305
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
and served in a novelty bathtub dish.

306
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
They have a, oh, Woody's boot.

307
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,920
You can eat ice cream out of Woody's boot.

308
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,760
Why'd you want to do that?

309
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
Woody's plastic boot.

310
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,240
Oh yeah.

311
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,080
That's pretty good.

312
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
They had that at Golden Horseshoe for a while.

313
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,440
If you were promising somebody something and said that,

314
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,880
or if you made a bet and said it didn't work out,

315
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,760
you would eat your shoe, this is a good like cop out.

316
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,840
I'll drink from a different character's shoe.

317
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,640
If you mutter that under your breath,

319
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,080
I will eat or drink out of a different character's shoe.

320
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,840
It's like a German beer hall.

321
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,400
They have the big boot beer mugs, you know?

322
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Mm-hmm.

323
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,080
The glowing unicorn is the drink I like.

324
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,040
And it is non-alcoholic.

325
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,120
Violet colada with a glow cube,

326
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,600
rainbow whipped cream, edible shimmer glitter,

327
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
and a twist candy lollipop, available at Leaning Palms.

328
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,240
They added another word of something

329
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,680
that you shouldn't be consuming.

330
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,360
Edible shimmer glitter.

331
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,520
I just carry some around.

332
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Is there a Play-Doh floater too?

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
Why does it link to that New York Times article

334
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
from last year that says, what is glitter?

335
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,840
The expose about the shady glitter industry.

336
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh wow, I didn't read that.

337
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,080
Really?

338
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
Something ripped the lid off a glitter?

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah, but I think there were still some mysteries left,

340
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
did it?

341
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Anyway, it's going into Mike's lungs.

342
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,760
It's going into Mike's digestive tract.

343
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,720
I carry some shimmer glitter to sprinkle on a lot of things

344
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,240
when I go to a fancy restaurant,

345
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,200
because I like to season my.

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
You spike regular drinks.

347
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,040
If you're served in old fashioned,

348
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,880
let me get some glitter in there.

349
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Like a chef who carries their own salt box.

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,240
You carry glitter and sprinkles.

351
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,000
Needs a touch up.

352
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,120
This is good, but I could make it better.

353
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
So this is modern day.

354
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah, so that's modern day.

355
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,920
Before they could dream of the outdoor water raves

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,080
that are now possible.

357
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,480
No, they just dreamed of a, what's the backstory?

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
The backstory is that this was a lush tropical resort

359
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
that gets hit by a typhoon.

360
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,520
Yes, and it's like all of it.

361
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,520
It's like a, I think also a volcano erupts and an earthquake

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,040
or it's like all the things happen in an hour.

363
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,440
And thus propelling surfboards through trees

364
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,920
and flipping boats upside down.

365
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,640
And most famously propelling a ship many, many feet

366
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,000
up into the air to like crack back down

367
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,320
onto the top of a mountain.

368
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes, Miss Tilly, the shrimp boat.

369
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,400
It was a former shrimp boat.

370
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,240
The first shrimp boat in theme park,

371
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,440
in themed entertainment predating the Bubba Gump.

372
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes.

373
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,240
Was the Bubba Gump, wait, was the ship called the Jenny

374
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
or something, what was the, I don't know.

375
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
In Forrest Gump?

376
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah.

377
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh yeah, that's a good question.

378
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,560
Was the boat called the Bubba Gump?

379
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
It doesn't matter.

380
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,760
Either way, this got to, this put shrimping

381
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
into themed entertainment first.

382
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
Yes.

383
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,360
That's, yeah, great backstory.

384
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,600
The Placid Palms Resort was now leaning palms.

385
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,280
A small harbor had been cut off from the sea,

386
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,680
trapping an overturned boat and thousands of colorful fish

387
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,200
and a couple of sharks.

388
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,840
That's why they had like a reef where you could swim

389
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,200
and meet like all the, like fish that shouldn't have been

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,960
there all got like, I guess, flew out of the sea

391
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,200
and plopped into a different pool.

392
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
Yes.

393
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah, biological anomalies.

394
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,800
To this day, the mountain tries vainly to dislodge

395
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,560
its unwelcome burden, the ship with an enormous geyser

396
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,800
of water every half hour, which I've heard

397
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
that the half hour geyser burst is not only a fun touch

398
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,400
in the park, but also a way to let parents know

399
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,000
it's been half an hour if you're like clocking the time

400
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,680
that your kid is in the wave pool or whatever.

401
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,880
A wise tale of two, oh, wait.

402
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,960
I was gonna say, yes, if you've eaten,

403
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,080
like you have to wait 30 minutes to go back in.

404
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
But maybe also if you're just trying to time out,

405
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,040
like should my kid not be in the water

406
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
in the wave pool for three hours straight.

407
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,280
My memories of the Typhoon Lagoon wave pool is that

408
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,200
in terms of wave pools, it was too much.

409
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
Those waves were too big.

410
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
How old were you at the time though?

411
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
Under like 13.

412
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,200
But even now, I feel like it brags on the website.

413
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,480
It's like six foot waves every 30 seconds.

414
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Well, cause they were trying to up the game

415
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,920
because this was by no means the first wave pool,

416
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,800
but it was the first one that you could surf on.

417
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,240
And they sometimes do close it down a section off a part

418
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
of it to do surfing lessons.

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,160
So they were trying to, yeah, have it be more,

420
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,840
more raucous than the usual.

421
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Just kind of things bob around.

422
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,840
Yeah.

423
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,600
So you're not, I don't, I guess you're just not a surf pool.

424
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Got no, had no surf pool queen.

425
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, no, no.

426
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
I did boogie board a lot growing up.

427
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
I liked boogie boarding.

428
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,280
Me too.

429
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,120
Yes.

430
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
I was a big boogie boarder.

431
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
Very satisfying.

432
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Catch wave, ride it all the way in.

433
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
All eight feet.

434
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,920
All eight feet.

435
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,560
Yeah.

436
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,320
The other thing I didn't like about that wave pool

437
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,160
was that you were staring at an imposing stone wall.

438
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,040
Like a 20 feet stone wall.

439
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,160
If you go all the way out there,

440
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,920
yeah, that's a pretty like severe.

441
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah. I could see why you'd find that kind of scary.

442
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,200
Which it is, I mean, it's practical.

443
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,840
It's meant to hide the massive machinery used

444
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,760
to generate wave pools, water slides,

445
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,120
move water up to water slides.

446
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
Cause there's water slides and paths

447
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,880
in Mount May Day as well.

448
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
Okay.

449
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
So all of the machinery is like they have to.

450
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Yeah, I think all of it is kind of hidden in that.

451
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,200
Cover with planks and such.

452
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,520
Yeah.

453
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,480
I was, I got interested in the,

454
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,280
where wave pools came from in general.

455
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah.

456
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,400
I guess they existed in, they existed in Germany.

457
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
And then like, there's a couple in,

458
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,480
there's two in America that claim to be the first in America.

459
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,040
But the important one is that there was one

460
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,080
in Decatur, Alabama.

461
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,600
And this was spotted by a guy named George Malay.

462
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,440
There is this incredible Grantland article

463
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,040
that I don't have the name of it handy,

464
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,920
but that's about the men who birthed the modern water park.

465
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,360
And it takes you through the story of George Malay,

466
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,240
who was a SeaWorld investor,

467
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,720
maybe primarily responsible for SeaWorld,

468
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,600
initially starting up.

469
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,280
And then he moved on to start Wet n Wild in Orlando,

470
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,640
which probably without Wet n Wild, there's probably,

471
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,920
I mean, that's the first real modern water park.

472
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,320
And probably there's no Typhoon Lagoon without it,

473
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,520
without Disney wanting to cut into that business.

474
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
But George Malay is this crazy, like militant guy,

475
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
like an oddly, so people compared him to Patton.

476
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,520
He was really severe and he looks like

477
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,280
a crazy Keenan Wynn dude.

478
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,920
He's like, like weird curled mustache.

479
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,480
He just seems like a guy, like a shell shocked man.

480
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Should have been a member of Sea maybe.

481
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,920
He looks so much like, yes, absolutely.

482
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,920
He looks like any of those guys, Bullion or what's the other,

483
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,400
who's the mystic?

484
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,240
No, no, not mystic.

485
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
Mortimery Mystic.

486
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,280
Who's the Joe Roady in Harrison Hightower?

487
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
Yeah, yeah, right.

488
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,920
He looks so much like both of those guys, absolutely.

489
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,280
He was a guy who, he was 12 years old,

490
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,480
living at Pearl Harbor during the bombing.

491
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,320
Oh my God.

492
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,160
So he slept through, or he stayed awake all night,

493
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,440
clutching a BB gun in case anybody came in.

494
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,200
So he's this super, which made him a little unsavory

495
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,200
in the race department as he went through his career

496
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,080
as a water park man.

497
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,600
In fact, they opened this gigantic slide

498
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
and called it the kamikaze.

499
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,240
People in the 70s were trying to convince him

500
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,480
this is not a good idea, but he's got his opinions

501
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,000
about who he's got his opinions about.

502
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,160
But anyway, this guy.

503
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,920
I cannot wrap my head around a child's war trauma

504
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,920
leading to water park dictatorship.

505
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
Yeah.

506
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,440
Leading to, that is a different brand of weird

507
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,520
than the Schlitterbond brothers, like those guys.

508
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,920
Well, the article is about the two men

509
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,240
primarily responsible for water parks in this country,

510
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,280
George Malay, this like Patton dude.

511
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,160
And then in the 70s, it kind of gave away this

512
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,760
to Jeff Henry, the Henry brothers behind Schlitterbond.

513
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,960
And they're considered like the kooky 70s,

514
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,040
like easy going, experimental.

515
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,400
They were like Jim Henson or something

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
compared to the militant nature.

517
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,360
They even down to like the Henry brothers were like,

518
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,000
how about foam on the slides?

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Or how about like a soft little pool

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
at the bottom of the slide that you crash into

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
instead of just it's concrete

522
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,720
and you scrape your knees the whole way down.

523
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,760
Like George Malay built like rides that banged you up.

524
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
Right.

525
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,240
And yeah, and they like interacted a little

526
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
and they asked Jeff Henry in the article,

527
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,320
did you, what'd you think of George Malay?

528
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,440
And he said, he's the meanest man I ever met.

529
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,880
And I'd like to leave it at that.

530
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Wow.

531
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,600
Another, I shouldn't just make this all about George Malay,

532
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
but this article was so great.

533
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,280
There's also a thing where he like,

534
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,960
he had a meeting with, he hated the hippies.

535
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,040
He had anybody with long hair and beards.

536
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,440
And he had a meeting with a guy who he was gonna

537
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
maybe try to do some work with.

538
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,720
And he went, or there was a, he went out in the hallway,

539
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,480
saw a guy who he regarded as a hippie and just like,

540
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,640
hey, we don't allow long hair in this office

541
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,760
and tried to like, you're gonna have to leave sir.

542
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,440
And the guy was like, I'm Raleigh Crump.

543
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm who you are taking a meeting with today.

544
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,480
Whoa.

545
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,840
And he had to apologize and deal with the fact

546
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,560
that maybe a hippie could have some good ideas.

547
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
And Raleigh, maybe he looked different as we went on.

548
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,160
Some of the early shots of him,

549
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,320
he looks just as square as any Disney Imagineer

550
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,640
with a rolled up or short sleeve dress shirt or like,

551
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,440
maybe he had long hair at this point, I don't know.

552
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
But still like the idea that he's like,

553
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
could spot a hippie just from the look of him.

554
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
Maybe they didn't even have to have the tight eye

555
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
or anything on.

556
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,320
It's that Simpsons joke where Mr. Burns

557
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
making the baseball player cut his sideburns.

558
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,600
Maddingly gave those sideburns.

559
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,320
I don't know what you think sideburns are,

560
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,920
but the whole history of Watergate does give away,

561
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,040
it starts with George Malay and then Jeff Henry

562
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,000
kind of takes it into the 90s and 2000s

563
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,160
and he takes it too far with that slide

564
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,480
that killed that person.

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,080
And he's now being sued by everyone

566
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,160
and even was arrested for meth possession.

567
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, wow.

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,160
That's the update on Jeff Henry.

569
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Hippies in the 70s, manslaughter charges in the 2000s.

570
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,400
At least George Malay didn't kill anybody.

571
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,720
That's true that we know of.

572
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah, sure, yes.

573
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,760
Who knows what Universal found

574
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,560
when they demolished Wet n Wild?

575
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,080
Let us never speak of this.

576
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
Unmarked graves, littered Wet n Wild.

577
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
A lot of bomb shelters for when the shit went down.

578
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,200
But anyway, that is the guy, George Malay,

579
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,800
his crimes were kind of taking ideas

580
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,480
from little podunk water parks and just using them.

581
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,560
So he's really responsible for the Lazy River,

582
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,000
which you have at Typhoon Lagoon.

583
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,040
And for popularizing the wave pool.

584
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,480
And he also is responsible for the modern water park layout

585
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,440
where the wave pool is the first thing you see

586
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,520
when you come in and it's all centered around that,

587
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,240
which also Typhoon Lagoon.

588
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
There were other wave pools

589
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,520
that are hidden way in the back.

590
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,160
You gotta go find them.

591
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,800
He wanted it first thing you see,

592
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,240
you're gonna wanna sit here all day,

593
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,440
big grand vista as you come in

594
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,560
and something you wanna go tell your friends about.

595
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,600
So without this crazy military man,

596
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,880
probably no Typhoon Lagoon.

597
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,960
God bless him, except for the older races.

598
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,320
Except for LD, yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,160
Nevermind.

600
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,840
Cool mustache though.

601
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,680
Yeah, cool.

602
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,080
This is, I mean, Disney and Universal both will,

603
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,280
are often not the originators of stuff.

604
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,560
There's plenty of stuff, they both originated,

605
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,960
but they will, yeah, similar to this guy

606
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,680
doing it to podunk water parks,

607
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,440
then they see him doing this at Wet n Wild,

608
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,240
which is now part of the Universal property.

609
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,880
Universal bought it and demolished it

610
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,600
and expanded onto it.

611
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,520
Is that where Volcano Bay is,

612
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,600
the old Wet n Wild site, or is that?

613
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,920
Is it, or they don't build it?

614
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
I don't know.

615
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,880
Is that where they have the fourth park, yeah.

616
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,280
Well that's not, or yeah,

617
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,840
is the Wet n Wild site where the new one's going?

618
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Yeah.

619
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
Yeah, maybe that's right.

620
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,880
But it's all recent Universal expansion

621
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,480
in the last 10 years they've bought up property.

622
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,680
Well my mom would be really upset

623
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
because my mom was always so freaked.

624
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,080
Like water parks in general,

625
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
I've said this before on the show,

626
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,480
we're the enemy, wave pools, we're the enemy.

627
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,160
Like we were taught to fear the wave pool.

628
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,600
She was very freaked out.

629
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
Why is that?

630
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,920
She didn't want it to drown.

631
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,440
She thought we were gonna drown easy

632
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,120
when a wave would come over and knock us down.

633
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,680
Was there ever a scare?

634
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,520
Was there something where you tumbled for too long?

635
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
You just didn't even get to that point.

636
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,880
Never got to the point.

637
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,840
Can I ask, how often did you go,

638
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,880
because you grew up in the Midwest,

639
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,760
how often did you go to the ocean growing up?

640
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,680
Almost never.

641
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,520
Pretty much never.

642
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,080
So like, I feel like we were less concerned with it going.

643
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,120
Because you were so used to the ocean.

644
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,360
We were used to the ocean, which is chaotic.

645
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,600
The waves are not every 30 seconds.

646
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,680
They are whenever the ocean,

647
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,920
whenever the tides decide.

648
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Well we went to Noah's Ark in Wisconsin Dells once.

649
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Sure.

650
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,580
That's a water park?

651
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,600
Yeah.

652
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,440
It's a big water park up in Wisconsin Dells.

653
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,960
And we went once and I think,

654
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,160
maybe my sister, maybe my sister,

655
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,040
my mom got freaked out, maybe something,

656
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,480
like she started coughing or something once

657
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
when she got too much water.

658
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,720
Maybe, maybe.

659
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,000
But we had to lie and say,

660
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,840
I couldn't go to my friend's birthday

661
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
that was at a water park every year.

662
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Geez.

663
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,760
So we had to say like, oh, we're going.

664
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,520
There was a, I believe the story was that my parents,

665
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,680
we're all celebrating my parents' anniversary

666
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,400
and it was always falling on the same weekend

667
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,720
where my friend would invite me to his water park birthday.

668
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,200
That's a convenient refillable excuse.

669
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah, sure.

670
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
So yeah.

671
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,560
And they didn't, it wasn't in the social media age

672
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,760
where it's like, you could have cross-checked it with,

673
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,220
celebrating anniversary and it's in October

674
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,120
and the kid can go, wait a minute.

675
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,000
In this scenario where your friend is caught on

676
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,600
to the third year of you making this excuse

677
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,040
and decides to get to the bottom of it

678
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,400
by looking at your parents' social media.

679
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,820
That is the age we're living in.

680
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,280
So luckily, yeah, we skated by,

681
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,880
their anniversary was like around the same time,

682
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
but we didn't celebrate it.

683
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Let me ask.

684
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
Yeah, what do you do?

685
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,400
I still find it awkward.

686
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,680
How do you celebrate your parents' anniversary?

687
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah, you don't.

688
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,180
Unclear.

689
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,060
One time I left a big like spray painted sign

690
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,080
on their garage door that was just an inconvenience

691
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,920
more than anything.

692
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,560
I was like, happy anniversary.

693
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,800
I don't know why I did it,

694
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,440
but just so they pull up and see happy anniversary

695
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,960
and then they had to like take it down themselves.

696
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,440
Just start filming,

697
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,920
because there's writing on the garage.

698
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,200
They didn't have their glasses on,

699
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,240
so they thought it said like Helter Skelter.

700
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,040
They thought Raleigh Crump wrote it.

701
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,160
Yeah.

702
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,400
These damn hippies.

703
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,720
Why didn't George Malay kill them all?

704
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,960
Mike, can I ask though,

705
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,840
was it at like a local town water park?

706
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,200
Yeah, somewhere not too far.

707
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,920
Your mom may have been right on that.

708
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,760
Like we had a-

709
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Sure, they were shittier.

710
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,640
They had a local, like I don't think I ever went,

711
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,080
there were some birthday party,

712
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,040
I never went to any of there,

713
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
but it was like two or three water slides

714
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,040
and a very tiny pool next to the I-95 on ramp.

715
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,880
So like-

716
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
Yeah, I mean, I forget what-

717
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,280
Probably poorly staffed.

718
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,000
Raging Waters was maybe what it was?

719
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,560
Raging Waters is a chain.

720
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,640
Yeah, are there's multiple of those?

721
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes, I believe Not Soaked City

722
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,920
was at one point a Raging Waters.

723
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,040
I don't think it was.

725
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,560
I think Not's built that from the ground up.

726
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,400
Oh, okay.

727
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,920
I say with my vague SoCal knowledge.

728
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,240
Let's see here.

729
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
So many looking up things today.

730
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,800
Raging Waters Los Angeles,

731
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,640
Raging Waters Buena Park.

732
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh, maybe it was.

733
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
Hold on.

734
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,120
This is very exciting to learn.

735
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,240
Well, hold on.

736
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,080
I think it's-

737
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,920
We're waiting for Google results.

738
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,000
You know, there's that certain

739
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,760
Paramount Park, Cedar Fair kind of section of the industry

740
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,320
that is constantly buying each other and merging and stuff.

741
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
Yeah, to a confusing degree.

742
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,800
All the weird up for grabs like Miscellany.

743
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah.

744
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah, the Riff Raff.

745
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Those are the lost toys of the theme park world

746
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,480
to put it in Toy Story terms.

747
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,040
Water parks are interesting.

748
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,560
I think we're all on the record

749
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,880
as not being water park guys to any extent.

750
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean, I liked them as a kid.

751
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,760
I really liked Typhoon Lagoon growing up.

752
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,600
Yeah.

753
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,840
But I sort of, I've said this before, I think.

754
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,240
My wife has turned me against them with her fear of diseases

755
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,760
and she's probably not incorrect.

756
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,880
I think it helped my immunity

757
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,680
going to all of these places growing up.

758
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,120
Going to theme parks so much

759
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,560
and going to the water parks and all.

760
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, it like battle tested you.

761
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,240
You like faced a lot of diseases.

762
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,080
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,480
And certainly the Petri dishes

764
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,120
that were comic book stores.

765
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,920
That helped too.

766
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I think my parents' big argument,

767
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
well, when we were in the vacation club,

768
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,440
it was such a cheap add-on

769
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,520
or they would just give you the water parks for free.

770
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
There was all sorts of,

771
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
they did a lot more deals back in the 90s

772
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,960
because they were trying to get like middle-class people

773
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,880
like in there.

774
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,080
Now they mostly want rich people, very rich people ideally.

775
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Maybe buy a home at Disney World.

776
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
Yes, that's the new.

777
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,520
That's the new subset.

778
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,280
We're gonna have to do that and then review that.

779
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
Well, sure.

780
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,280
That's an episode coming up.

781
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,400
We all split a McMansion in that,

782
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,760
what's that, it's called like Golden Oaks or something.

783
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I have a thing from it in the mail.

784
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
We can be Pat Sajak's neighbor.

785
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,080
I don't think there was a Raging Waters,

786
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,600
but I'm confused because there were.

787
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,560
Because I don't think it existed before.

788
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,640
There were multiple not soaked cities though.

789
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,200
There was one in Palm Springs

790
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
and one in San Diego.

791
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,440
You know, I should do,

792
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,600
maybe a future episode is the weird abandoned parks.

793
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Like the one, like if you've done that Vegas drive,

794
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,480
what happened to that water park?

795
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,960
It's just like rusting away.

796
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,800
And I think there's another one on the way to Palm Springs

797
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,760
or it's maybe just like rarely open.

798
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
There's like a big pyramid.

799
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
It's maybe in like San Bernardino area.

800
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,080
I know what you're talking about.

801
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,360
But I'm sure there's multiple abandoned water parks

802
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,280
and I'd like to know what's going on in there.

803
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,760
Are there like mega crocs growing inside?

804
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,280
Like you went inside one of those slides.

805
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,440
They've just been incubating and growing and growing.

806
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,480
Crocodiles or the rubber shoes?

807
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,120
Like mutated rubber shoes.

808
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,720
People may have left stray crocs around

809
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,160
and yeah, all of the various like water diseases

810
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,840
are making them grow and grow.

811
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,440
Maybe a mega croc will put on mega crocs

812
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,240
and then start ravaging San Bernardino County.

813
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,080
Yeah.

814
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,960
It'll be a fun movie though.

815
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Oh, so my family's big thing with the water parks

816
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,520
at Disney World at least was always,

817
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,160
this was always the give and take of like,

818
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,640
well, we could do it,

819
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,480
but that's one last day in the parks.

820
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,240
Like any sort of thing.

821
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,000
It's like, well, we're going to the shopping village

822
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,720
one day, let's try to get it all done.

823
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,760
Because if we come back, it's less time at the parks.

824
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
We're less time at the pool.

825
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,120
What's gonna make it so hard for us

826
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,520
when we have to ignore the parks

827
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,240
and do 13 straight days of research

828
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,640
on the Disney Springs saga?

829
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,120
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty irritating to go on no rides,

830
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,960
but you know, that's what we're just walking through.

831
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,080
Hopefully by that point we'll be owned

832
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,800
by Monsanto Productions or something or some.

833
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
The Monsanto streaming service?

834
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,040
Yeah, Monsanto streaming service.

835
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,560
So we're like making, you know, like, you know,

836
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,840
mega bucks for, I'm sure they spring for streaming.

837
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,280
Sure, well they're paying us in Monsanto bucks

838
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240
in Monsanto's script and they're putting us up

839
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,320
at the Monsanto Inn in Orlando.

840
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,320
So we get paid in like corn syrup.

841
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
What does Monsanto make?

842
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Yeah, corn syrup, seeds.

843
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,600
We can exchange.

844
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Yeah, proprietary seed blends.

845
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes, seed blends not yet released to the market.

846
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,760
Sure.

847
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,320
Great, I'll sign that deal.

848
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,200
Sounds good to me.

849
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,440
Mike, you mentioned the mega crock would be a good movie.

850
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,480
Do you think the backstory of Typhoon Lagoon

851
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,800
would make a good movie?

852
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,600
What would the ship getting, you know,

853
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
a ship landing on a mountain, what a story.

854
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah, you know, it would be like a very,

855
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,760
too intense for a child I think maybe.

856
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,600
Yeah.

857
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,720
The movie might be a bit scary.

858
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,440
A perfect storm, just a very serious.

859
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,880
I believe this is a movie kind of, a few years ago.

860
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
The Chris Pine movie?

861
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,880
No, Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts.

862
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,720
What?

863
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,720
At a resort in, like an all-inclusive resort,

864
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,120
a hurricane hits and it's like trying to survive.

865
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,360
The impossible.

866
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
Eugh.

867
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,600
Well, I say this because I ran into this bizarre piece

868
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,880
of info that, and this is backed up because it is still

869
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,960
on this writer's website that apparently there was

870
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,840
a Typhoon Lagoon script written at the time by a writer

871
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,320
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Gary Wolf.

872
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,400
So there was a script of the story and somehow it was deemed

873
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,760
not crucial enough to make, but there was a press release

874
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,200
when Typhoon Lagoon opened where Disney said,

875
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,520
this is an unprecedented undertaking whereby a motion

876
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,960
picture and a themed attraction will perfectly

877
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,240
complement each other in a unique demonstration

878
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,200
of the abilities of the Walt Disney Company.

879
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,720
So they thought they were gonna build this water park

880
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,880
and then that will be the backdrop for the film.

881
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Right.

882
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,960
So we're getting two uses out of it.

883
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,800
Wow.

884
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
What happened there?

885
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,280
Just totally abandoned.

886
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, I mean, there's been so many abandoned park specific

887
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,160
things over the years.

888
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
Sure.

889
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,040
Like the big thunder pilot and so yeah, I wonder,

890
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,200
was it bad?

891
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Did someone say this isn't that fun of a story to what?

892
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,160
I mean, people had to die in the narrative of this, right?

893
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
On Typhoon Lagoon, like.

894
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,520
Yeah, it's a little.

895
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,240
Maybe not in the Disney version.

896
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,080
Well, how would a ship.

897
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,920
A ship flew around and it was fun.

898
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,280
It was like bed knobs and broomsticks, the hijinks.

899
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,160
A ship shoots out of the water

900
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,680
and gets like impaled essentially.

901
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
It's like the bottle episode of a sitcom where it's like,

902
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,880
oh, there's a tornado warning.

903
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,360
We gotta hang out in the basement for 30 minutes.

904
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,520
You know.

905
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm just saying there, you would have had to really do some

906
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,640
like, show all the characters float to safety

907
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,400
from the whatever, to Typhoon, of course,

908
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,080
into the lifeboats, I guess, to make it like,

909
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,000
oh, the ship, are we all here?

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,960
Yes, we're all here.

911
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,240
Okay.

912
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,800
What if there was like a pre crystal skull situation

913
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,480
if they all got into an industrial strength shrimp fridge

914
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,320
in the boat.

915
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,160
Oh, there we go.

916
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,560
Everybody's just hidden in there,

917
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,800
but that like protected them enough from the,

918
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
but then it becomes the adventure of climbing down the ship,

919
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
down the mountain and like everybody leaning too far

920
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,240
and then the ship's tilting this way

921
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,000
and they're worried it's gonna snap in half.

922
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Oh, and then they inflate life rafts

923
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,040
and slide down the mountain.

924
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
And at the bottom, they're like, hey, that was pretty fun.

925
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Maybe these are the fixes.

926
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,920
Maybe these were the fixes though

927
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,200
that would have made the movie happen.

928
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Well, who owns the, so do we gotta talk to Gary Wolf

929
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
and get this moving?

930
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm sure Gary Wolf, I'm sure Disney owns the script.

931
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,840
And like Hollywood loves jerking people around

933
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,040
on screenplays and ripping them away from people.

934
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,600
So yeah.

935
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,440
Gary Wolf's script.

936
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Give us the script to punch up.

937
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,360
Disney plus, baby, you know you need that content.

938
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
Yeah.

939
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,840
If Disney plus doesn't become every single property,

940
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,680
every ride.

941
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,840
Yeah, every ride, everything we've ever covered

942
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,680
on this show has to turn into.

943
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,200
The motto is just quantity, not quantity over quality,

944
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,560
just quantity.

945
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,840
Yes, yeah, yeah.

946
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,040
So I want my, so I should start going in and pitching,

947
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,040
like it's, imagine the story of Tony Solaroni

948
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
in the Pangolite to Pizza Port,

949
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,680
you got it mixed with a little bit of chef flavor.

950
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,960
Or it's the other, or it's, what's that,

951
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,280
what was that Bradley Cooper asshole?

952
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,120
The Burt?

953
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

954
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,320
It's a little bit, let's say it's Tony Solaroni's Burt.

955
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,600
And Jason's thing is the Mark Twain movie,

956
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
the Mark Twain Riverboat movie.

957
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
Yeah.

958
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,200
It's just about the boat, not about Mark Twain.

959
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,880
It's a documentary about you sitting on the Mark Twain

961
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,720
for an afternoon.

962
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,320
Yeah.

963
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,160
It's like, or it's like Southern bells,

964
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,320
like wishing like, like we haven't had a good captain

965
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,560
around these parts in years.

966
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,520
That's good too, yeah.

967
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Well, hello ladies.

968
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,200
Hello.

969
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
I think I'm a little lost.

970
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,640
I'm still getting acquainted to town.

971
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,400
Well, we can help you find your way.

972
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,520
Oh, capital.

973
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,240
This sounds like it's gonna be

974
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,000
some sort of like a sexy romp

975
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,000
on the Mark Twain with Jason.

976
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Three Southern sisters competing

977
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,040
for Jason's affections on the Mark Twain.

978
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,640
Okay, well actually that's really great.

979
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,080
I was one trying to figure out what ride

980
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,760
would be the most fun to pitch to Disney Plus

981
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
and like a Don Draper sort of like,

982
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,960
it's not, it's your childhood.

983
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,960
It's not just Aladdin's magic carpets.

984
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,280
The carpets fade away.

985
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,920
You only remember the good stuff.

986
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,720
You don't remember getting stuck on it.

987
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,680
Well, that's when it's, if it's a thing

988
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,480
about the mad tea party, but it's a bizarre scenario

989
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,000
of people getting trapped and like boiling hot cauldrons

990
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,160
of actual tea.

991
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, sure.

992
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,480
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Why can't we make dark shows out of these rides?

994
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,840
My pitch of course is just Fast Pass the movie

995
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,640
or Max Pass specifically.

996
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's just you on a bench for an afternoon.

997
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Well, yeah, it's a very exciting movie.

998
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,960
You were showing us how you refresh the other,

999
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,040
yesterday at the park.

1000
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,880
Like, and then you refresh like this.

1001
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,160
It's a very tense, exciting movie.

1002
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,840
It's like a Mission Impossible movie for me.

1003
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,560
I'll do it like 50 times, he said.

1004
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,000
Guys, drop everything.

1005
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,960
Our Matterhorn pass for 525 can maybe be superseded

1006
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,200
by a new reservation time at 510.

1007
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,000
And then it's all characters going,

1008
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,760
wow, it's really great that you told us this.

1009
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,040
This is very valuable information.

1010
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,880
This is great.

1011
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,960
This is gonna optimize our time in a new way,

1012
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,800
in a great new way.

1013
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,640
Thank you.

1014
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,040
We'll be able to start mobile ordering diet cokes

1015
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,640
sooner than later.

1016
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,080
It's honestly, it's not, that sounds like a great movie.

1017
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,320
That sounds tense though.

1018
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,360
So Typhoon Lagoon, the number two most attended

1019
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
water park in the world.

1020
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,680
Blizzard Beach, number three.

1021
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Number one, Chime Long Water Park in Guangzhou, China.

1022
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,520
I believe this was the same statistic

1023
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,840
on the Blizzard Beach episode,

1024
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,480
but this is the updated 2018 numbers.

1025
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,080
Beat them by a few hundred thousand.

1026
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,600
Chime Long, 2,740,000 guests.

1027
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,160
Typhoon Lagoon, 2,271,000 guests.

1028
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,000
Mm-hmm.

1029
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,880
So second most popular, but number one in America.

1030
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,640
But on the plus side for Typhoon Lagoon,

1031
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,840
you are allowed to use Google and the free internet.

1032
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,160
That is true, yeah.

1033
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
There's less restrictions.

1034
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,800
You can get whatever you want on Alibaba,

1035
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,480
our new partner, Alibaba.

1036
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,320
What is Alibaba?

1037
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,600
Is that their search?

1038
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,440
Amazon.

1039
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
Oh, they're Amazon.

1040
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Yeah.

1041
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,680
Okay, huh, huh.

1042
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Which I assume is nefarious in some regard.

1043
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,560
I think it's just, it's like anything,

1044
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,040
but it can be like very unregulated.

1045
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,600
They have, it's got a charismatic chairman named Jack Ma,

1046
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,760
who like always does like rock show

1047
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,360
at the annual like shareholders thing.

1048
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,200
What?

1049
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,120
I watched a special on it once.

1050
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,960
Whoa.

1051
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,560
It's like, like he plays music.

1052
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,400
Oh.

1053
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,240
Like the company presentation.

1054
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,720
He doesn't play the wing song rock show?

1055
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,680
Maybe he does.

1056
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,120
Oh, I just went, I was wondering if you meant rock show.

1057
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,940
Yeah.

1058
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,780
What does he do?

1059
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,620
He performs a rock and roll show.

1060
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,580
He performs a rock and roll.

1061
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,020
You don't see Jeff Bezos doing that.

1062
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,620
No, he wishes he could do that.

1063
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,500
Where's your album, Jeff Bezos?

1064
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,820
Yeah.

1065
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,900
Forget the money or your math.

1066
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,500
Oh, I would love divorced billionaire album.

1067
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,180
I would love to hear like,

1068
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,700
I've just had a lot of feelings I need to process.

1069
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,140
Well, all these guys might be in the Eddie Murphy scenario

1070
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,060
where they make albums and then give it

1071
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,580
to their underlings to release.

1072
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,620
And they like, hey, so did that album ever come out?

1073
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,460
Oh yeah, it's number one.

1074
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,340
Isn't that the rumor with Eddie Murphy

1075
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,340
that he like thinks his music is.

1076
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,380
Is that right?

1077
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,820
Yeah, I don't know where I've heard that.

1078
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,380
That like, I think he thinks that his albums

1079
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,860
are always coming out and like America loves them.

1080
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,140
Wow. I've never heard that.

1081
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,820
I mean, I know like he, I thought he had just like

1082
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,300
made a bunch of albums and then like

1083
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,740
never really releases them.

1084
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,820
But then that one song, Red Light,

1085
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,180
a couple of years ago, you remember that?

1086
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,020
I sort of.

1087
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,860
Reggae song he released, I think Snoop Lion was on it.

1088
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,180
Okay. Maybe I'm making this up.

1089
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,940
Maybe I'm creating a scenario where he's so protected.

1090
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,900
He's like this king who thinks that all of his.

1091
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,100
Another hole in one, sir.

1092
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,220
It's the same like Trump or something.

1093
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
I hope that's right.

1094
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,180
I hope he thinks like, he's like, it's like, okay.

1095
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,860
So the top selling artists of all time,

1096
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,860
the Beatles, you, Mariah Carey.

1097
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,740
He's like, wow, that's great.

1098
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,100
All right, anyway, back to doing weird stuff.

1099
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,620
Doing whatever it is I do.

1100
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,460
Yeah.

1101
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,300
Okay.

1102
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,500
You've crushed Garth Brooks into the ground.

1103
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,260
Oh wow. Five times over.

1104
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,860
Congratulations, Mr. Murphy.

1105
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,780
A bad Photoshop billboard magazine.

1106
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,940
He's on the cover and he's like, wow, this is great.

1107
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,660
Shall I put out another press release

1108
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,380
about a coming to America sequel that will never happen?

1109
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,900
Yes, please.

1110
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
That would be insane.

1111
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
If that does happen, did you guys see the story

1112
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,940
going around about Eddie Murphy on the set

1113
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,140
coming to America, grabbing John Landis by the throat,

1114
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,420
choking him and grabbing him by the throat.

1115
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,260
And then Landis was still being an asshole.

1116
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,300
So then he started to choke him.

1117
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,340
Whoa. I did not read this.

1118
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,900
Some insane thing.

1119
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean, I had heard that he like made everybody,

1120
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,220
like that he, Landis had to like direct via middlemen.

1121
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Like that, like Eddie would not talk to him anymore.

1122
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,060
So he had to like go talk, like tell the guy like,

1123
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,860
here, Tom, go talk to Eddie.

1124
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,780
I mean, I would believe that. Yeah.

1125
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,900
That is like a bull in a china shop

1126
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,860
encountering a second bull in a china shop.

1127
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,740
It's amazing. But different types of bulls.

1128
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,380
Yes, different types of bulls.

1129
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,220
I'm guessing.

1130
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,820
Well, it's like Millennium Falcon smugglers.

1131
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,580
One bull can run left to right

1132
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,020
and the other can run up and down.

1133
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
So.

1134
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,420
Amazingly, they landed the ship.

1135
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
Yeah, they did.

1136
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,740
Coming of America is a very funny movie.

1137
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,300
Then one of the bulls had the worst bull child

1138
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,860
in the history of time.

1139
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,700
Oh.

1140
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,780
Anyway, Typhoon Lagoon.

1141
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,860
Typhoon Lagoon.

1142
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,940
Let's see, what else?

1143
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,700
Let's talk about Typhoon Lagoon's original character,

1144
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,740
who now, well, now if you were gonna make a film out of it,

1145
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,900
now it'd be easier because there is some great mythology

1146
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,500
to go off of Laguna Gator.

1147
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,660
Laguna Gator, now less clean than Ice Gator,

1148
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,220
the Blizzard Beach mascot.

1149
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,140
That's a pun, Ice Gator.

1150
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,980
Yes.

1151
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,820
But Laguna Gator.

1152
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,700
What is he?

1153
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,540
He's just a gator?

1154
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,380
He's a gator, he's a gator.

1155
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,220
He's a funny gator.

1156
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,380
He's a fun orange gator.

1157
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,060
Yes, who surfs, he's very cute.

1158
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,020
In canon, is it that he's related to Ice Gator?

1159
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,860
I mean, they don't know.

1160
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,100
They seem pretty.

1161
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,940
They look very similar.

1162
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,140
There's no, like, oh, they're first cousins

1163
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,820
or second cousins, twice removed or something.

1164
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,660
Right.

1165
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,480
Right, we don't know.

1166
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,800
I think we should add that into the show,

1167
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,640
into the movie or show.

1168
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,520
That seems like right for the pickin', you know?

1169
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,440
Yeah, figuring out the lineage of Disney blizzards.

1170
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,480
We will figure out how they are related.

1171
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,160
Are they brothers, are they second cousins,

1172
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,000
what are they?

1173
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,160
Give it to us and we'll do it.

1174
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,560
Are they lovers?

1175
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,400
We could introduce.

1176
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,840
Could be, oh, now that is the way to go.

1177
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,600
Ice Gator and Laguna Gator are husbands

1178
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,160
and one of Laguna Gator,

1179
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,680
he didn't have the last name Gator,

1180
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,320
despite being a gator, he took Ice Gator's name.

1181
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,160
Oh, he took it.

1182
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,920
I would like to introduce the sort of country mouse,

1183
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,360
city mouse dynamic and introduce Riv-a-gator,

1184
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,280
which would be, I mean, this is an original creation.

1185
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,120
So.

1186
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,480
Somebody isolate that clip of Jason saying.

1187
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,320
Riv-a-gator.

1188
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,160
I won't do it.

1189
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,680
Like House of Cards, Kevin Spacey.

1190
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,520
Oh, man.

1191
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,400
Come on, it's not what you.

1192
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,160
Give it with the tail of Riv-a-gator.

1193
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,480
Put a third gator in there.

1194
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,320
I like it.

1195
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,760
Yes, for a defunct water park,

1196
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,240
but still.

1197
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,560
And his Riv-a-gator story is also about him moving

1198
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,240
to a new town and being fawned over

1199
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,120
by three Southern bell gators.

1200
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,960
Sure.

1201
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,800
Come on, new gator in town.

1202
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,440
Does anyone know where I can find

1203
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,600
the big hunks of raw chicken?

1204
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,400
You are definitely playing Riv-a-gator.

1205
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,240
I mean.

1206
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,480
Motion capturing at least.

1207
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,320
Oh my God.

1208
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,800
If not regular, just prosthetics.

1209
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,640
I would love to just destroy my legs and hips

1210
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,160
by trying to do like the full gator.

1211
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,000
Why do all the other gators.

1212
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,840
You're on the ground.

1213
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,760
You're walking on two legs.

1214
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
Oh, okay, that's probably better for my health.

1215
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,600
Ice gator.

1216
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,200
They do kind of walk around on two legs.

1217
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,000
Maybe because he's a country gator.

1218
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,320
He's like, I still walk.

1219
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,280
I can't do this fancy city.

1220
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,400
Hey, you, if you're playing the character,

1221
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,680
it's open to your interpretation as far as I'm concerned.

1222
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,480
So if you want to walk around like a gator.

1223
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,320
I'll have to workshop.

1224
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,840
I'll have to go rent a black box theater to workshop.

1225
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,760
Like Mike Myers' workshopping love guru.

1226
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,280
Yes, like Mike Myers' workshopping

1227
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,360
at the People's Improv Theater in New York, workshopping.

1228
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,760
He's got a new character, folks, a limited run,

1229
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,000
a new character.

1230
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,640
That was the salesmanship of him workshopping

1231
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,240
the love guru in the mid-2000s.

1232
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,880
I bet it was killing there.

1233
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,720
Yeah, probably.

1234
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,540
Probably.

1235
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,760
I'm excited to see a secret show with him.

1236
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,120
Yeah.

1237
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,560
And if you're watching it live,

1238
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,840
you are not getting his face superimposed

1239
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,160
onto a child's head.

1240
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,720
That is that kind of thing is what makes that movie.

1241
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,560
Yeah.

1242
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,000
But yeah, start doing your one man show.

1243
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,560
As Jason performing to crowds of two.

1244
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,600
I have to workshop.

1245
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,120
Me and Mike Myers and Sacha Baron Cohen,

1246
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,080
we need to flesh the characters out a little.

1247
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,920
You gotta live.

1248
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,280
It's like the Marx brothers, they'd like tour it

1249
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,120
before they.

1250
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,960
Yeah.

1251
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,600
Jason Sheridan is Rivagator.

1252
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,440
Rivagator.

1253
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,640
Make that play, that play bill.

1254
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,480
Yeah, yeah.

1255
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,720
Somebody's gonna do that for us.

1256
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,800
As for Laguna Gator, there's this amazing art,

1257
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,040
this is legitimately beautiful to me.

1258
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,880
This, here he is looking over.

1259
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,720
Oh yeah.

1260
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,640
It's May Day over the sunset.

1261
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,160
It's beautiful dusk.

1262
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,440
It's legitimately great artwork.

1263
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,440
And I went down this rabbit hole of all of the mythology

1264
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,440
of Laguna Gator that you can pick up by going to his house

1265
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,880
or his shed or shack or wherever he lives

1266
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,480
because there's a lot of clues just based on what's

1267
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,840
on the wall about this otherwise not really fleshed out

1268
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,840
character, we know that he likes Surfin' Reptile Magazine.

1269
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,600
Right.

1270
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,600
And he has a cover up in his shack of Surfin' Reptile

1271
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Magazine with a pretty sexy girl gator whose name is

1272
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,040
Kathy Kamen, it's not particularly gatorified.

1273
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,480
I don't know, the Kamen name after the Kamen Islands,

1274
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,320
I assume?

1275
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,160
I guess so, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,720
She's an international gator gal surfing invitational

1277
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,000
gold medalist.

1278
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,440
So this would go against, I guess, him having a husband

1279
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,760
if he, but maybe he just admires Kathy Kamen,

1280
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,680
maybe he's not.

1281
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,080
There was a question in the blog that I read this on,

1282
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,280
like is Kathy Kamen just like an idol of his?

1283
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,840
Is he having crush on Kathy Kamen?

1284
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,920
Is he actually dating Kathy Kamen?

1285
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,120
Is that like a Farrah Fawcett where it's just like,

1286
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,640
oh, this is an iconic character that, or a person

1287
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,320
that he likes, animal that he likes.

1288
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,520
And it's a classic poster.

1289
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,560
If you're a surfing gator, you for sure have the famous

1290
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,560
Kathy Kamen poster.

1291
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,800
Cause like, would he have a post, it's a poster, right?

1292
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,640
I think I saw that picture.

1293
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,000
It's like a blown up magazine cover.

1294
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,160
You wouldn't, if he was dating her, would he have a

1295
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,240
magazine cover of her on the wall?

1296
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,360
That's a little weird.

1297
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,640
If he's proud of her.

1298
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,840
Yeah, but wouldn't it be a photo of the two of them?

1299
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, more likely, I suppose.

1300
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That would be weird.

1301
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,640
Yeah, maybe it's just a crush.

1302
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,680
Maybe it's just a crush.

1303
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,040
Yeah, yeah, it's an aspirational.

1304
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,440
But this of course goes against what we just said

1305
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,800
in the narrative of him being lovers with the ice skater.

1306
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,240
Or they were married before and his last name was,

1307
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,400
that's his last name.

1308
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,360
He's Laguna Kamen.

1309
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, I see.

1310
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,920
And then he had a crisis and realized it wasn't for him.

1311
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,880
And he was in love with ice skater all along.

1312
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,320
Yeah, that works.

1313
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,000
Everything's fluid in Gator country.

1314
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,680
No, River Gator, are you by as well?

1315
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,520
Whatever.

1316
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,480
Don't put those labels on it.

1317
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,400
Whatever way the Delta takes me.

1318
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,320
We're gonna do a Patreon exclusive where I just

1319
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,800
interview River Gator for an hour.

1320
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,000
Can I speak to River Gator?

1321
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,840
Riv-uh-gator.

1322
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,800
Riv-uh-gator.

1323
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,760
That's like that old bit that you and I would do just for us.

1324
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,120
No one wanted this where Yogi Bear would interview

1325
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,440
Peter Bogdanovich.

1326
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
I think it was the other way around, but yes.

1327
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,360
Or vice versa.

1328
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
But you would do Yogi Bear and I would just be

1329
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,880
Peter Bogdanovich talking about making movies in the 70s.

1330
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Yes, yes, no one wanted that.

1331
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,280
This isn't a bit anyone can recite like who's on first.

1332
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,760
No, I don't even.

1333
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,160
I don't even.

1334
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,520
We would both essentially just say things

1335
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,680
that that character would say.

1336
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,400
What does Peter Bogdanovich sound like?

1337
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,640
I don't even know that you had like a break Bogdanovich.

1338
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,800
I don't think I can do it now.

1339
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,440
We were listening to the Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich.

1340
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,840
Oh yeah, because I had all those tapes.

1341
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,680
You had all those tapes.

1342
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,400
I had all those files of that interview.

1343
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,960
A very boring interview.

1344
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,040
Did you have literal tapes?

1345
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,000
Did you buy them from the bootleg market?

1346
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah, when I met Mike, he was a tape trader.

1347
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,960
He just had VHS and cassette tapes everywhere.

1348
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,040
Makes sense.

1349
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,640
If you're gonna trade tapes,

1350
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,640
you'd wanna get into some bootlegs of Laguna Gators band.

1351
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,680
Do you know about Laguna Gators band?

1352
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,640
I don't actually.

1353
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,600
Oh my God, he's got a poster.

1354
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,680
This is another clue from his place.

1355
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,640
He plays with the Beach Gators.

1356
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,480
Oh man.

1357
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,320
Talk in my language.

1358
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,840
I miss the Beach Gators.

1359
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,720
And they're all named, there's pictures of them.

1360
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,000
Boy, you think that a water park

1361
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,600
isn't gonna have original mythology and original characters,

1362
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,760
but there's so many.

1363
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,200
Laguna Gator is the lead singer, obviously,

1364
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,920
but you got Scarf on the bongos,

1365
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,480
Wipeout on lead guitar, and Gnarly on bass guitar.

1366
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,760
Wow, Gnarly.

1367
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,840
Gnarly seems to have, he's got a big,

1368
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,920
one of those classic Southern hats over his eyes.

1369
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,960
You can't see his eyes

1370
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,800
because there's such a dip in the hat.

1371
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,080
I think Wipeout is my favorite because he has stars,

1372
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,520
he has star sunglasses like Bootsy Collins.

1373
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,280
Oh yeah, so that's cool.

1374
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,320
And some of their songs are listed.

1375
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,880
Two girls for every gator.

1376
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,360
They had human girls.

1377
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,040
To eat, potentially, that's the question.

1378
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,240
A little grim, but oh well.

1379
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,200
The little old gator from Pasadena.

1380
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,440
That's good.

1381
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,000
Not really a swamp area,

1382
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,640
but I guess a gator could be from there.

1383
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,840
And gator vibrations.

1384
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,920
And little surfer gator as well.

1385
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,200
So they cover.

1386
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,880
Gator vibrations.

1387
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,520
Was scribbled down five minutes before the deadline.

1388
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,160
For the printing, was they, to get the stinking goes?

1389
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,200
Yeah.

1390
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
Yeah, the other ones kind of make sense.

1391
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,560
That one nonetheless so.

1392
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,960
If you were picking up gator vibrations,

1393
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,840
you'd have to get the hell out of wherever you were.

1394
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,800
That means that that big gator came to life

1395
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,600
at the abandoned water park.

1396
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,520
And it's shaking like Jurassic Park.

1397
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,680
Do they sense vibrations in the water?

1398
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,000
Is that the justification for that?

1399
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,720
I think the justification is it starts with a G.

1400
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,560
Yeah.

1401
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,160
So anyways, please Disney make these songs.

1402
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,840
We want to hear them.

1403
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,960
But there's, I didn't know until looking at Typhoon Lagoon,

1404
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,080
there's a lot, there's even more mythology here.

1405
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,760
There's a fucking robot.

1406
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,840
The first robot on our side.

1407
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,240
Misadventure Falls.

1408
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,080
Yeah.

1409
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes.

1410
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,160
Yes.

1411
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,000
Sorry.

1412
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,200
New raft attraction, new in the last few years.

1413
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,160
That brings the Society of Explorer and Ventures.

1414
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,000
Yeah, sea baby.

1415
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
Sea baby.

1416
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,040
Yeah.

1417
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,320
Merry Oceaneer.

1418
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,160
Merry Oceaneer, because when you look at those oars

1419
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,320
that were put up at the tropical hideaway,

1420
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,880
a lot of them, I don't know who they're referring to.

1421
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,960
And one of them is M. Oceaneer.

1422
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,440
I didn't know what that was about.

1423
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,520
But I guess that's a character that existed

1424
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,480
in cruise ship mythology.

1425
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,320
Right, right.

1426
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,080
Which, oh my God, there's so much to,

1427
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,640
I didn't know we would be responsible

1428
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,040
for knowing cruise ship stuff.

1429
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,320
But I guess we are when it comes to sea.

1430
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,880
But Merry Oceaneer then made it into Typhoon Lagoon via,

1431
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,960
this is a slide where you are like seeing her collection,

1432
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,880
I guess, things that she's gathered up in her wanderings.

1433
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,920
And you get to meet her parrot companion, Duncan.

1434
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,760
Mm-hmm.

1435
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,600
Yes.

1436
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,960
And, oh, Merry Oceaneer also is a portrait

1437
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,600
in Mystic Manor, apparently.

1438
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,440
Okay.

1439
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,280
So it represented in that way too.

1440
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,640
But yeah, probably the first purely water attraction

1441
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,280
with an animatronic.

1442
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,600
And it's kind of on the lift hill

1443
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,880
so you couldn't splash it and short it out.

1444
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,840
People I'm sure have tried.

1445
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,680
Yeah, sure.

1446
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,400
Hey, even I would sort of like to

1447
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,200
if I could watch a robot explode.

1448
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,360
What about Duncan though?

1449
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Yeah, Duncan's cute.

1450
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,440
I don't want to hurt Duncan.

1451
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,280
It's a recent, it's the last couple years animatronic,

1452
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,480
so it's got that fluidity.

1453
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,320
It's really great.

1454
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,880
One of the longest water rides in Orlando,

1455
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,360
is about two minutes.

1456
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,200
Wow.

1457
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,120
You think about water slides and water coasters.

1458
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,320
They are pretty fast, pretty speedy.

1459
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,760
But this is nice and long.

1460
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,720
And yeah, there's lots of sunken,

1461
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,440
there's treasure and stuff.

1462
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,120
Did you see the diving bell?

1463
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,040
When you enter the queue,

1464
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,880
there's the big Merry Oceaneer diving bell

1465
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,040
that like a one person submarine that you get inside of.

1466
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,800
And on the bottom of it is a warning saying like,

1467
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,280
I come in peace, I believe,

1468
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,000
written in the Atlantean language from the movie,

1469
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,320
Atlantis, The Lost Empire.

1470
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,440
Oh wow.

1471
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,280
Yeah.

1472
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,120
Jeez.

1473
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,960
That level of detail on just for this

1474
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,040
piece of set scene making.

1475
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,440
And that's new, is that new or is that there from,

1476
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,360
No, I think that's when they put the ride in.

1477
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,200
Right.

1478
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,320
There's this big diving bell right at the entrance.

1479
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,160
That's funny.

1480
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,640
And Confuet, boy.

1481
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,480
Maybe another final four is Disney's languages.

1482
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,240
Atlantean would be one.

1483
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,840
Or maybe just theme park languages in general,

1484
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,360
because I guess Klingon in Star Trek experience

1485
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,200
would have to count.

1486
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,280
But the Indiana Jones Mara language.

1487
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Navi.

1488
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,360
Navi.

1489
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,280
Arabush.

1490
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,120
Arabush.

1491
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,200
What's Arabush?

1492
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,400
That's the Batu language, Star Wars language.

1493
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,800
Okay, I didn't know that.

1494
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,040
Yeah, there's gotta be more.

1495
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,280
Does Yoda's language count as language?

1496
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,120
Like backward talk?

1497
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,960
Yeah.

1498
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,780
Yes.

1499
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,800
Backward talk, which is the canon phrase.

1500
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,080
Don't look into it further.

1501
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,360
Sure.

1502
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,080
Yeah, a lot of, and then just, do you have to count then,

1503
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,960
do English and Spanish have to count as well?

1504
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,760
Because they are used at Disneyland.

1505
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,080
I would think that is in there.

1506
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,360
We have to rank what's the better language.

1507
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,200
So we've made it to Klingon versus Spanish.

1508
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,760
What's the best language?

1509
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,320
I think Klingon's gonna win, unfortunately.

1510
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,720
It's my favorite language.

1511
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,280
Not the first, or yeah, around the same time

1512
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,600
as Misadventure Falls.

1513
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,680
Crush and Gush Water Coaster

1514
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,160
is also have some theming to it.

1515
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,960
It's themed after a dilapidated fruit processing plant

1516
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,840
and is sponsored by Chiquita.

1517
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,400
So you can have the experience of going to Latin America

1518
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,880
and having a coup d'etat to have your factory

1519
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,160
eventually be overrun and abandoned.

1520
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,920
So you can pretend that you were in the last empty crate

1521
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,400
of spoiled bananas.

1522
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,680
The last helicopter.

1523
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,800
The ramps have like, I thought, like I was reading about it

1524
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,560
and it said like, the ramps are fruit themed.

1525
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,360
And I was like, oh, were there pictures of fruit?

1526
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,200
That could be fun.

1527
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,360
And I looked at the video and it's just ramps

1528
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,880
that are stamped with like the words, coconut, banana.

1529
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,960
So it's like the cars on Mr. Toad or on Snow White,

1530
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,800
which just says the name of a character.

1531
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,760
It's a fruit.

1532
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,480
Yes, Tell Toad Show.

1533
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,720
But how often can you pretend to be multiple items at once?

1534
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,960
Like when I'm on that ride,

1535
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,160
I can pretend that I'm 12 coconuts.

1536
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,400
That's a good point.

1537
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,520
If you're after pluralism.

1538
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,960
If you're trying to not cosplay,

1539
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,600
cosplay is fruit or something.

1540
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,800
Well then, I mean, then you just wanna dress as the,

1541
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,440
yeah, yeah, then just being Carmen Miranda would do it.

1542
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,280
Right.

1543
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,720
Or Minnie, Minnie used to be,

1544
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,960
I remember like the Polynesian had like one of the men,

1545
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,240
either the room service menu or the pizza menu

1546
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,920
or had like Chiquita Mickey or Chiquita Minnie

1547
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,240
with the fruit headdress.

1548
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,560
Didn't she, wasn't there a big float with the headdress?

1549
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,760
Yes, and there was a big float.

1550
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,600
Oh, in the Mardi Gras.

1551
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,480
But like they had it in the hotel stuff too.

1552
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,680
Another competition, best fruit headdress

1553
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,360
on a Disney character.

1554
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,600
Is it, doesn't like Timon end up in one in?

1555
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,960
Oh yeah, yeah, that's true.

1556
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,800
Yeah.

1557
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,760
The whole thing is there's no food left in the kingdom.

1558
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,720
Because that scene happens at the height

1559
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,760
of the Scar administration.

1560
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,600
Oh right, right, right.

1561
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,920
There's no food or water anywhere.

1562
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,080
So how does Timon come across fresh fruit?

1563
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,480
I mean, that's one of the flights of fancy

1564
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,160
dream sequencing kind of moments.

1565
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,760
Oh, we aren't like meant to believe that that is literal.

1566
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,120
No, I think that's like Bugs Bunny.

1567
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,560
I think that's the equivalent of like putting a hole,

1568
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,720
like drawing a hole on a mountain wall.

1569
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,760
Sure, I see what you're saying.

1570
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,160
Or they're just so hungry, they're hallucinating.

1571
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,680
In that point, we'd go to the POV of the hyenas.

1572
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,520
Yes.

1573
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,360
I think they know the good spots.

1574
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,360
I think Timon and Puma know sort of where to look.

1575
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,040
Well, they're kind of on the outskirts, right?

1576
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,480
So they may be out of Scar's control.

1577
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,200
They're in the neighboring country.

1578
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,600
How far away is where Timon and Puma live

1579
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,320
and the pride rock?

1580
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,560
That's very unclear.

1581
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,520
Because for them to have not looked over there

1582
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,280
and found food there, I mean, Nala does eventually,

1583
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,040
which is why Simba comes back.

1584
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,440
But is it two hours away?

1585
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,960
Is it five hours away?

1586
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,560
Very good question.

1587
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,160
Or because I was watching it and thinking,

1588
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,040
what if it was just like kind of around the block

1589
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,440
and just nobody ever bothered?

1590
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,960
Like Simba's journey as he went like a thousand feet away.

1591
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,440
But to an animal, yeah, who knows what their sense of time

1592
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,640
or sense of space and distances.

1593
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,920
So yeah, perhaps.

1594
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,520
They'll explain it in the live action one,

1595
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,880
like really explain.

1596
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,960
Yeah, exactly, like over explain.

1597
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,120
They'll give the longitude and latitude

1598
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,200
of all the places around the pride rock.

1599
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,880
All the characters have pedometers for some reason.

1600
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,600
How many steps are all the lions given?

1601
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,840
There's a B story of someone trying to get their steps in,

1602
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,920
of like Nala trying to get her steps in.

1603
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,600
Just a refresher for the listeners,

1604
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,080
water slide versus water coaster.

1605
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,800
Water slide traditionally moves the water up.

1606
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,880
So the water flows down and you ride the waters down.

1607
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,840
Water coaster mimics a roller coaster that has,

1608
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,160
it provides both descents and ascents.

1609
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,000
So you go up and that can be done using water jets,

1610
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,360
conveyor belts or linear induction motors.

1611
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,600
I am not smart enough to understand the mechanics

1612
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,280
of a linear induction motor.

1613
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,360
No, you're not, huh?

1614
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,840
Do you?

1615
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,400
Oh yeah, I know all about it.

1616
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,720
You're just ignoring all the skills you have

1617
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,040
from engineering school.

1618
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,880
Yeah.

1619
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,160
I believe also, I think the water coaster technology

1620
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,880
potentially pioneered by the Jeff Henry,

1621
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,240
the meth possessing.

1622
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,080
Oh wow.

1623
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,520
Or I think.

1624
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,880
Slitterbond, yeah, I think Slitterbond.

1625
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,520
All of the water technology came from

1626
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,080
strange, unsavory people.

1627
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,160
I think the first.

1628
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,800
I think they were after,

1629
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,800
I believe it says the first one was in,

1630
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,200
or no, I'm sorry, these are different types.

1631
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,760
But yeah, you're right.

1632
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,080
New Braunfels, Texas.

1633
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,160
Hey, there we go.

1634
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,720
If you remember also, by the way,

1635
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,120
that when we'd covered Slitterbond a long time ago

1636
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,640
and I read this crazy email where a guy was like,

1637
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,120
yelling at his own brother,

1638
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,200
hell is where you both belong.

1639
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,200
Judges will eat you both.

1640
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,880
That is the man responsible for that horrible accident too

1641
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,880
now, it's like, what a crazy,

1642
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,960
how could these water park people be so fucking bonkers?

1643
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,880
The water turns people insane too.

1644
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,520
The chlorine, the bromine.

1645
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,840
Draws the insane people to it, I guess,

1646
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,200
because they were crazy before.

1647
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,920
I have to look into who made Noah's Ark

1649
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,520
and Wisconsin Dells, if there's a mad man behind it.

1650
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,080
How much of that is Noah's Ark is public domain,

1651
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,080
you don't have to pay,

1652
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,880
it's a convenient water-based thing that everyone knows.

1653
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,040
Was there religious elements of that park?

1654
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,280
Nothing overt that I noticed at least,

1655
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,320
because the last time I went I was probably 18.

1656
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,400
I don't think so, but that's worth a look, certainly.

1657
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,920
But that's another water park theme that like,

1658
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,240
yeah, a lot of people and animals got on that boat,

1659
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,760
but everyone else drowned in the fucking flood.

1660
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,840
So that's another ghoulish premise for a water park.

1661
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Yeah, yeah, an initial rapture, yeah.

1662
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,800
Rapture, climate change, these are the,

1663
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,960
volcano, these are the three storylines for water parks.

1664
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,320
It's almost sacrilegious in the idea that like,

1665
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,000
we're gonna have a fun time in the middle of the great flood

1666
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,080
that killed most humans.

1667
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,720
But it killed a lot of mostly bad humans,

1668
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,840
the ones that God wanted to smite.

1669
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,280
So it's good, we should be celebrating.

1670
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,880
That said, the Sodom and Gomorrah buffet,

1671
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,720
well reviewed on TripAdvisor at the Noah's Ark water park.

1672
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,960
I see there's an ad on the Noah's Ark website

1673
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,600
for the Father's Day flop.

1674
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,640
Which shows a-

1675
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,120
So is Father's Day considered a religious holiday?

1676
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,080
I don't know, there's a man about to flop

1677
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,360
on his belly into the water.

1678
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,760
We are so sorry we did not cover the Father's Day flop

1679
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,280
for this podcast, we have let you down, our audience.

1680
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,160
Yeah.

1681
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,240
Next year we will be flown out by the Noah's Ark people,

1682
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,640
and we will cover it live, we'll do play by play

1683
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,880
like a sporting event, the three of us.

1684
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,000
This podcast is gonna get real sad.

1685
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,120
Folks, the dads are here and they're ready to flop.

1686
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,040
You know, I liked podcast the right when it was about,

1687
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,840
you know, Big Thunder Mountain,

1688
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,280
but it's been about the Wisconsin Dells

1689
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,440
for the last year and a half now.

1690
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,400
It's less relatable.

1691
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,440
What have we not covered from Taif?

1692
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,520
Oh, Humonga, Cowabunga.

1693
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,360
Oh yeah.

1694
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,480
Those three enclosed, the speed slides.

1695
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,920
I gotta say, I like water slides.

1696
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,880
There's never one for speed slides.

1697
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,120
I think as I got older, I tried them,

1698
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,200
but like, I like the kind of curving water slides

1699
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,360
where you splash down and like a little pool,

1700
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,000
or like a pool that's like three feet deep.

1701
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,440
I'm not wild about the ones that go like straight down

1702
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,680
and the water is like an air break.

1703
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,120
Those always like freaked me out as a kid.

1704
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,760
I think I'd done like one or two smaller ones,

1705
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,960
but I never did the one at Blizzard Beach

1706
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,560
where the floor drops out and drops you.

1707
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,280
There's a similar one at Volcano Bay as well.

1708
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,040
There's like a little red, there's like a little red cabin

1709
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,640
you go in and then it just drops out.

1710
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,120
And I didn't do it either,

1711
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,080
but I'm wondering if I should do it next time.

1712
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,560
I would try it now.

1713
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,280
Cause it does seem, that does scare me

1714
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,240
and it seems unpleasant,

1715
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,760
but also everyone does it and it's fine.

1716
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,680
I'll say this, I'll try most attractions,

1717
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,520
but like there's the two things I am not wild about.

1718
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,440
One, standing up coasters, which I have ridden before,

1719
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,280
but they are not made for a person of my stature.

1720
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,280
I see.

1721
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,920
Cause there's kind of like a bicycle seat sort of thing

1722
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,760
that goes between your legs.

1723
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,080
And that is unpleasant

1724
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,600
cause they think you're much taller.

1725
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,520
Well, the mummy coaster at Universal

1726
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,000
is very unpleasant for me, a taller man.

1727
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,080
Because you're scrunched in so much.

1728
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,080
Cause it compacts my genitals.

1729
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:22,920
Yes.

1730
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080
But for me, it's all just right.

1731
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,960
Perfect for baby bear.

1732
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,880
The average bear, sorry.

1733
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,880
So stand up roller coaster.

1734
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,640
The other thing is that thing you see at carnivals

1735
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,640
it has different names, but it like spins.

1736
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,480
Oh God.

1737
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,640
And it's, you go inside, you stand inside

1738
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,920
and the walls are mats and you kind of lean against the mat

1739
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,200
and then it spins and it spins so much that the G force,

1740
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,840
then the floor drops out.

1741
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1742
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,040
And you're just pressed against the wall.

1743
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,480
I like that ride.

1744
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,680
But are there ever,

1745
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,000
there's no sort of belts or restraints or anything.

1746
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,440
It's just gravity.

1747
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,600
Yeah, we had the Gravitron.

1748
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,040
Yes, that's like the one generic name kind of thing.

1749
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,840
Yeah, and I loved it.

1750
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,200
And there was no belts.

1751
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,040
Have you ever done this?

1752
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,880
No.

1753
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,720
Do you know, have you ever seen one?

1754
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,560
Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1755
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,520
Yeah, it's a big like UFO that spins around essentially.

1756
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,880
So yeah, you would get inside

1757
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,960
and there was no restraints or anything.

1758
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,520
So when the thing was going so fast,

1759
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,840
you'd be pressed against the wall

1760
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,080
and you could do also, you could like turn upside down

1761
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,840
sort of in the thing. Yeah, you could do bits.

1762
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,280
You could do any like, yeah, you could move around.

1763
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,040
I mean, you couldn't move so far,

1764
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,440
but you could do whatever you wanted

1765
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,560
within your little space probably,

1766
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,880
cause you couldn't get like, it was hard.

1767
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,720
The forces would keep you mostly in place,

1768
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,000
but you could spin around yourself.

1769
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,800
So I would like spin around in a circle

1770
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,400
while I'm being pressed against the wall.

1771
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,440
It was fun, I don't know, I loved it as a kid.

1772
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,280
I like that.

1773
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,280
And that wasn't too scary or anything.

1774
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,120
You think it'd probably be better for a child,

1775
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,320
probably better small.

1776
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,560
Yeah, I would imagine that I couldn't fit

1777
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,000
so comfortably on it now,

1778
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,080
but maybe there's a big gravitron somewhere.

1779
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,920
Maybe.

1780
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,200
But speed slides, what you have described

1781
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,600
in Volcano Bay, I am intrigued by that.

1782
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:14,120
I think the novelty aspect would override my fear aspect.

1783
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,960
We were up there and I was like,

1784
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,880
I don't wanna do this and then we didn't do it,

1785
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,560
but I feel like I should have been forced to do it.

1786
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,360
I should have shoved me in and ran away.

1787
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,200
Did she do it?

1788
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,200
No. Oh, okay.

1789
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,880
No, no, she didn't wanna do that either.

1790
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,040
Yeah, those, yeah, I'll do it next.

1791
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,400
Okay, I'll pledge I'll do it next time.

1792
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,080
I'll pledge to you, the listener.

1793
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,520
Humonga cowabunga.

1794
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,680
I'll do humonga cowabunga, I'll do whatever.

1795
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,640
Gangplank falls.

1796
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,800
Gangplank falls. Well, that's just a family

1797
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,720
raft ride.

1798
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,080
I'll do gangplank falls.

1799
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,240
That's my pledge.

1800
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,280
I'll do sitting in the wave pool.

1801
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,760
I will do Castaway Creek lazy river,

1802
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,520
which is one of the ones you can use a tube

1803
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,280
or you can just kind of float yourself and be propelled.

1804
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,360
I always like that.

1805
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
If I want.

1806
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,600
None of us are allowed to go to Ketchakitty Creek,

1807
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,480
the unpleasantly named child play area.

1808
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,320
For the best, we not go there.

1809
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,160
Don't go to Ketchakitty?

1810
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,520
Yeah. Bullshit.

1811
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,920
I don't, this came up before,

1812
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,240
before we get too far away from it,

1813
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,160
I hate to get us off track again.

1814
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,440
At Noah's Ark, they have something called

1815
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,880
the 4D Dive-In Theater, and there's a picture of the rock

1816
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,080
from Journey to the Center of the Earth on it.

1817
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,720
In our 4D theater, the fun comes at you

1818
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,560
from every direction.

1819
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,680
You'll duck flying objects, feel every splash

1820
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,960
and even smell what's on screen.

1821
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,720
Part eye popping movie, part hair raising ride.

1822
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,760
Totally unforgettable fun for the entire family.

1823
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,280
So we got to investigate what that is.

1824
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,520
The Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D Water Ride.

1825
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,160
So it's still possible to go see the rocks famous

1826
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,240
bee flight and experience it yourself.

1827
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,080
Yes.

1828
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,920
All right. Anyway, back to the type of.

1829
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,080
A movie made, the budget for that movie came

1830
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,360
from a country that no longer exists.

1831
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,920
That always, see, I remember the summer that came out.

1832
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,520
I was like, this ain't a movie.

1833
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,880
No, this ain't real.

1834
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,440
Is that River Gator commenting?

1835
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,800
Oh, this ain't, this ain't real movie.

1836
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,320
It's in variety, but I don't believe it.

1837
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,400
I don't go for motion pictures.

1838
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,160
Just give me a washboard and a hootin' nanny

1839
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,720
and I'll be entertained all night.

1840
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,640
Here's something we haven't talked about.

1841
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,720
The food options at food options at water parks.

1842
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,040
Never, never like amazing.

1843
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,360
I remember when you went to volcano Bay

1844
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,240
that the opening summer, they were really pushing.

1845
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,480
It's like the food and drinks are fun and good.

1846
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,280
And it seems like they've already scaled back on that.

1847
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,640
Yeah, they were trying to do something interesting

1848
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,720
with the food and then in two months

1849
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,920
it's a chicken sandwich.

1850
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,400
Typhoon Lagoon, you get that sandpale ice cream

1851
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,760
that comes in a bucket.

1852
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:51,120
And then everything else seems to be like various iterations

1853
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,640
of burger, maybe burger with guacamole or pulled pork,

1854
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,320
something a little interesting.

1855
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,760
There's like rice bowls and acai bowls.

1856
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,600
Like they're branching out a little,

1857
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,800
but like people are eating this stuff on the go

1858
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,280
in their bathing suits.

1859
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,080
So it's not like you can have fine dining or something.

1860
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,160
Jason, you mean you don't wanna eat a jerk chicken

1861
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,600
Cobb salad while you're sitting by the pool?

1862
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,760
I mean, that is probably one of the fresher items

1863
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,320
available for sale.

1864
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,920
It just feels like a lot to have to deal with

1865
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,760
while you're there.

1866
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,320
Sitting on a lazy river too.

1867
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,000
Real jerk chicken, like I feel like so much.

1868
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,960
You eating a big salad in a lazy river?

1869
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,480
So much like lightly spiced grilled chicken.

1870
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,840
They're like, here, jerk chicken.

1871
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,440
It's like, oh no, this isn't good.

1872
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,280
You look, I've had real.

1873
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,720
It was like kind of flipped twice in some way.

1874
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,560
Yes.

1875
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,200
You know, like little trough of powder.

1876
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1877
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,120
They have an Italian deli sandwich on the menu.

1878
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,200
That's all it's called.

1879
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,360
It doesn't have a fun name.

1880
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,200
Italian deli.

1881
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,400
And then they, yeah.

1882
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,200
If you're a kid on crustables, you can get a turkey sandwich.

1883
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Sweet. Exciting.

1884
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,040
Yeah.

1885
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,040
The other place is called Let's Go Slurpin'.

1886
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,120
Yes, the bar is called Let's Go Slurpin'.

1887
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:00,960
All right.

1888
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,800
I like that.

1889
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,640
Approved.

1890
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,040
So that's good.

1891
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,160
There's still like, the names aren't that fun

1892
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,400
for these drinks though.

1893
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,920
There's a Typhoon Tilly, which is fun.

1894
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,760
Okay.

1895
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,280
And a Pina Colava, but it's like Grand Margarita,

1896
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,120
Banana Cabana.

1897
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:16,960
Well.

1898
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,800
Banana Cabana's fun. Banana Cabana's fun.

1899
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,640
That's fucking fun, Michael.

1900
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,800
Okay. Half of it's not fun.

1901
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,640
Half of it's fun.

1902
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,480
Yeah.

1903
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,080
I want all of it to be fun.

1904
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,400
Banana Cabana is fun.

1905
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,240
How do you guys feel about Cabana rentals

1906
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,200
at pools or at like water parks and stuff?

1907
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,120
I never go for it.

1908
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,960
I never go for it.

1909
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,800
I never go for it.

1910
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,640
Yeah, I don't ever.

1911
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,360
It's just because it's always like $200.

1912
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,200
Yeah.

1913
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,440
It's not like $20.

1914
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,320
And then you can end up just in a chair

1915
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,120
two feet away from.

1916
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,040
Right. Yeah.

1917
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,760
It's not that, it depends what it is.

1918
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,480
But like in Vegas, especially never,

1919
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,400
like it's so expensive to like buy a shaded area.

1920
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,360
It's like $500 or something.

1921
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,200
Yeah.

1922
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,920
So yeah, very, I probably never, we've done maybe once,

1923
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,440
but I can't remember.

1924
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,000
I'll be in the lazy river at the MGM Grand Pool,

1925
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,320
probably tomorrow.

1926
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,160
Wow.

1927
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,760
I'm heading over there,

1928
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,840
which is in the space where the MGM Grand Adventures

1929
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,920
theme park used to be.

1930
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,080
So sadly departed, but pretty good pool area,

1931
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,360
but it's pretty like, you know, it's pretty clubby.

1932
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,480
Yeah. It's pretty loud.

1933
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,560
And if you're not particularly a fan of Pitbull

1934
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,280
or whatever, it's, you know, you got no tropical theme.

1935
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,000
It's not just like, like,

1936
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,280
I want generic Calypso playing quietly.

1937
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,240
I want Cassio Calypso.

1938
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,240
You are hearing Flowrida and Lunch Money Lewis.

1939
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,080
There was.

1940
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,800
I'm guaranteed to hear Flowrida and Lunch Money Lewis.

1941
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,680
Lunch, yeah, we all know Lunch Money Lewis.

1942
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,600
Yeah.

1943
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,200
I like a douchey pool a few times a year.

1944
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,640
I went, I was in Vegas just a couple of weeks ago,

1945
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,640
and they had at their douchey pool,

1946
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,080
which wasn't that douchey, honestly.

1947
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,760
It was pretty nice at the park MGM.

1948
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,760
They had a DJ and a live saxophonist.

1949
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,640
Whoa.

1950
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,840
Like Questlove was coming on later,

1951
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,920
but we had to leave and go to the wrestling show.

1952
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,000
We didn't get to see Questlove there.

1953
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,680
We saw him at the club the night before though, DJing.

1954
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,640
But there was a man playing live saxophone

1955
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,680
walking around by the deck over the DJ, which was awesome.

1956
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,840
That's a good idea.

1957
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,680
It was great, yeah.

1958
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,760
Was he playing in a way coordinated to?

1959
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,600
Yeah.

1960
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,420
Oh, wow.

1961
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah, he was like soloing over the music.

1962
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,840
Jeez.

1963
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,680
And we didn't even realize it

1964
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,760
because he was sitting down closer

1965
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,520
to the DJ booth for a while.

1966
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,160
And then I was like, that's nice.

1967
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,920
Like, are they sampling the sax over?

1968
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,360
And I looked over and there was just a man playing sax.

1969
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,200
Wow.

1970
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,040
I was like, this is great.

1971
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,400
Yeah, I like that.

1972
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,360
The only way it'd be better

1973
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,560
is if the sax was also blowing bubbles.

1974
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,800
They could figure that out.

1975
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,600
Well, if he was in the pool with us,

1976
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,440
like doing it and bubbles were coming out.

1977
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,760
Destroying his instrument.

1978
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,120
It's a waterproof sax.

1979
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,600
Or it's like the coral sax from Little Mermaid.

1980
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,440
Oh, okay.

1981
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,280
With that fish head.

1982
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,120
Yeah.

1983
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,360
It may look like it was made out of coral.

1984
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,680
Scott, is there a quiet pool at the MGM grant?

1985
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,040
It's literally labeled quiet pool.

1986
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,480
There is a quieter end.

1987
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,320
Yes, yes, yes.

1988
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,360
I can happily report that.

1989
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,160
But yeah, even that, there's still the faint strains

1990
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,240
of Lunch Money Lewis.

1991
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,080
What's this?

1992
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,560
Is he the, does he rap?

1993
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,400
Does he do the hooks?

1994
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,880
He's one of the, he's on the Pitbull song,

1995
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,080
Greenlight flow ride on Lunch Money Lewis trade versus.

1996
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,920
I see.

1997
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,760
Pitbull.

1998
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,600
You know Greenlight.

1999
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,240
This is the official song of WrestleMania a few years ago.

2000
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,640
We heard it a lot as we were watching.

2001
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,480
The lead up to it, they were really playing that song a lot.

2002
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,640
Because if you watch a six hour WrestleMania,

2003
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,960
it's like you hear that theme over and over.

2004
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,800
And then of course they come out and sing it.

2005
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,640
Right.

2006
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,240
Maybe there's an upcharge this year at the pool

2007
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,200
where I can ride Lunch Money Lewis around the pool.

2008
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,200
I can ride him like a floatie and he'll take me around.

2009
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,360
All of them seen performing in a big puffy bathrobe.

2010
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,760
So a lot of camaraderie.

2011
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,120
That's why he's your hero.

2012
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,960
Yeah.

2013
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,800
Yeah.

2014
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,040
Wow.

2015
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,840
Bathrobe where's he gonna stick together?

2016
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,160
What have we missed?

2017
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,120
Surf doggies.

2018
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,400
There's a food option called surf doggies.

2019
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,240
That's cute.

2020
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,280
Yeah.

2021
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,440
I did not go to, I haven't been,

2022
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,680
I did go to Typhoon Lagoon years ago,

2023
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,480
but I did not go in the last couple of trips.

2024
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,600
We did Blizzard Beach.

2025
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,320
Cause it's more colorful and more 90s.

2026
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,880
This is such a much more like,

2027
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,240
this doesn't feel stuck in the era that it was made

2028
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,320
because of the way it was made.

2029
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,160
Like the-

2030
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,560
Oh yeah, we were saying, yeah, yeah.

2031
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,920
Blizzard Beach is very 90s

2032
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,240
and the plasticky nature of it.

2033
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,080
Right, which is good.

2034
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,440
I mean, that was the idea, but it is like a little bit,

2035
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,120
you can feel the 90s in there as well.

2036
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,240
And this one I think probably is a little more timeless.

2037
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,640
Tropical is pretty timeless.

2038
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,480
I mean, I like the blues and stuff,

2039
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,120
the blues and whites of Blizzard Beach.

2040
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,760
I do find soothing.

2041
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,680
It's like a wild berry pop tart.

2042
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,920
Yes, that's perfect.

2043
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,760
Yeah, yeah.

2044
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,920
Which is in the most 90s food there is.

2045
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,760
Yes.

2046
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,600
In my mind.

2047
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,440
Sure.

2048
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,080
And your optimal beverage would be a wild berry pop tart,

2049
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,920
just like-

2050
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,920
Shoved into that rainbow drink

2051
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,280
I showed you earlier. Into that blue Pepsi

2052
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,120
or crystal Pepsi.

2053
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,680
No, the drink from the H2O.

2054
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,520
Yeah. Oh yeah.

2055
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,640
And then all of it in a bathtub,

2056
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,680
in a little plastic bathtub with chocolate.

2057
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,680
But if you then could sit in a bathtub as well and-

2058
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,720
Yeah, like-

2059
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,920
In a small bathtub.

2060
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,480
I don't know why, like what's,

2061
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,640
Kanan's all that character, Pierre Escargot.

2062
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,320
You know, we all know it.

2063
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,000
Pierre Escargot was pretty good.

2064
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,720
He was pretty good.

2065
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,280
And he was like pretty dialed in.

2066
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,560
He was like, so like exactly as confident as he is

2067
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,680
on this set out. Yeah, really.

2068
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,760
Now. Yeah.

2069
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,600
Yeah.

2070
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,960
It's like what, 15 at the time?

2071
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,800
Yeah, God.

2072
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,080
Or younger maybe.

2073
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,920
They're doing the tapings right now for the,

2074
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,200
all that reboot. Sure.

2075
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,040
We love a Pierre Escargot cameo.

2076
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,200
I don't think that's out of the question.

2077
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,040
No, I don't think so at all.

2078
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,960
I think it might be due to unwillingness

2079
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,200
to pay a Kenan Thompson salary to Kenan Thompson.

2080
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,040
Oh, to do it?

2081
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,880
I think he's been in some of the promotional stuff.

2082
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,840
I think he's doing a sketch or two.

2083
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,680
I'm not sure.

2084
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,800
I don't think he's appeared.

2085
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,080
I think they all have been.

2086
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,640
He does the, oh, if they got Lori Beth,

2087
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,480
then they'll for sure get Kenan.

2088
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,080
Lori Beth and the other guy.

2089
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,840
I think it would be great if it's like,

2090
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,640
they need a job in the sketch.

2091
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,480
Yeah.

2092
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,320
Oh, I know it'd be great,

2093
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
but I think he's a tougher.

2094
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,360
You think he's just. I guess so.

2095
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,200
He's just showing up.

2096
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,640
He definitely has a producer credit.

2097
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,080
And he says the open, he says, stop, look and watch.

2098
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,240
He does, he's taking, he's there, Darrell Hammond,

2099
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,800
is what he is. Okay.

2100
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,240
Kel, Kel has definitely been in some of the promotional stuff.

2101
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,520
Kel's in it a bunch.

2102
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,360
Yeah. Yes.

2103
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,400
You seem like you know a lot about it.

2104
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,920
I have oddly checked out all that.

2105
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,040
I'm not sure why.

2106
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,680
It sounds like you have insider information.

2107
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,680
Yeah.

2108
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,480
They released a very odd video on Twitter.

2109
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,760
That's why I know about it.

2110
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,880
Yes. I'm funny.

2111
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,720
I saw that.

2112
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,960
Yeah. That was weird.

2113
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:08,800
But I saw the.

2114
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,440
It was jokeless rap about being.

2115
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,280
It is.

2116
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,120
That is why I've looked into it.

2117
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,600
But friends posted videos like of the tapings

2118
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,880
and like the kids are in silly costumes

2119
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,080
and they're very, they're.

2120
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,400
Just got back from the taping.

2121
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,800
Good news, silly costume's still part of the show.

2122
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,840
They're in silly costumes, they're getting laughs.

2123
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,080
And it's like that this seems better than I'm funny.

2124
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,920
Like this seems better than the.

2125
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,760
Okay, yes.

2126
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,600
I'm funny.

2127
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,440
I'm so funny the rap misrepresented.

2128
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,280
I'm so funny.

2129
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,120
Yeah.

2130
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,040
Okay, okay.

2131
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:39,120
The people are going to the tapings and live tweeting.

2132
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,960
Yeah.

2133
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,040
I think there are tickets available.

2134
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,120
Are we going to a taping?

2135
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,120
I guess we are.

2136
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,960
I don't know.

2137
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,400
I just want to, I'd be much more interested in a water park.

2138
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,080
You see like one of those Nickelodeon water park settings

2139
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,480
should include bathtubs where you can pretend to be.

2140
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,320
Piers Cargo.

2141
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,160
Yeah.

2142
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah.

2143
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,840
I think that's good.

2144
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,680
I like that.

2145
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,160
That is the water park innovation I want.

2146
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,000
Well, what else?

2147
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,840
We should probably start winding it down.

2148
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,480
The shark reef has been closed since 2016.

2149
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,520
You could swim with sharks,

2150
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,040
like kind of like nothing, tiger sharks.

2151
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,360
There was, people did not really like this experience

2152
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,800
because the water was very cold

2153
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,600
and you were just supposed to swim in a straight line

2154
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,120
for a hundred feet and then get out of the pool immediately.

2155
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:23,960
Yes.

2156
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,680
And of course it was an upcharge.

2157
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,520
God, really?

2158
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,360
That too?

2159
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,960
Yeah, that wasn't included.

2160
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,320
You had to pay extra to swim with the animals.

2161
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:36,720
I will say Disney does sell a pass of like unlimited visits

2162
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,120
for just the two water parks.

2163
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,960
And if you're a local, if you live close by,

2164
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,920
that's not bad.

2165
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,440
Florida gets hot in the summer.

2166
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,320
So like, yeah.

2167
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,400
Couple of water, 50, 60 bucks, just go to the water park.

2168
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,440
But I should also be,

2169
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,200
if I'm gonna do that upcharge for the shark,

2170
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,560
I should be able to like rattle one and take it home.

2171
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,400
Yeah. Okay.

2172
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,240
Grill it and eat it.

2173
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,080
You wanna buy a shark.

2174
01:19:59,080 --> 01:19:59,920
Yes.

2175
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,040
I'm taking a shark home with me.

2176
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,880
Sure.

2177
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,520
Just if I finds it, I keeps it.

2178
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,520
Okay.

2179
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,640
That is your motto.

2180
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,680
Yeah, yeah, famously.

2181
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,000
Jason, did you look through the menu

2182
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,720
of the Happy Landings ice cream?

2183
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,280
I believe I did.

2184
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,120
Okay, anything, because that there,

2185
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,800
as you mentioned earlier, the sand pail,

2186
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,240
that's obviously the big thing.

2187
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,080
Yeah.

2188
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,600
I don't think there's anything fun really,

2189
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,320
other than that on the regular menu.

2190
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,240
It's that, I think it's mostly soft,

2191
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,000
like the same soft serve as Blizzard Beach.

2192
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,360
You know, you maybe switch it up, get a float.

2193
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:34,360
But I mean, the novelty of that sand pail is special.

2194
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,600
And you've never gotten the sand pail.

2195
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,480
I've never gotten it.

2196
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,200
No, I think that was introduced after I've been there.

2197
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,120
Maybe not.

2198
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,040
When we all go to Orlando,

2199
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:48,000
you should have like one like big thing like that a day.

2200
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,920
Oh, a day?

2201
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,760
Yeah.

2202
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,880
I mean, we should get the kitchen sink then.

2203
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,640
I don't think I've ever gotten a kitchen sink.

2204
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,040
You should get the kitchen sink, yes.

2205
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,720
Yeah, okay.

2206
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,560
I see where you're going.

2207
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,560
We're gonna end up in Orlando for 28 days

2208
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,640
with eating ice cream, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

2209
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,000
Out of sinks. And a separate dessert also.

2210
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,800
Eating out of bathtubs, out of sinks, out of pails.

2211
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,600
Flights out of custom made flight containers.

2212
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,400
Pails, shoes, shoes.

2213
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,040
The Ample Hills in Los Angeles,

2214
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,080
they just put it in a little,

2215
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,600
they just put the mini scoops in a dish.

2216
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,280
Like at the boardwalk.

2217
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,520
Well, Ample Hills, as you know,

2218
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,760
Ample Hills is next to my beloved Abracadabra.

2219
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,760
Yeah.

2220
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,040
So you get hammered and then you go over

2221
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,760
and have a flight of ice cream.

2222
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,280
And then walk into Epcot Center through the World Showcase.

2223
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,320
And you're like, this is the greatest moment of my life.

2224
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,160
Nothing better.

2225
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,480
This is the greatest few hours of my life.

2226
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,800
That classic hat trick of alcohol,

2227
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,560
dairy and a footpath in humidity.

2228
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,760
Oh, just the makings of fun.

2229
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,760
I'm so fine with such fond memories of being there last year.

2230
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,680
Mike sees no irony in what you're saying.

2231
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,520
No.

2232
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,320
Yeah. I'm like, yeah, humidity is great.

2233
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,000
Jason and I are humidity fans.

2234
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,840
Yeah, we do like humidity.

2235
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,800
I think I can handle it, but there is a,

2236
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,600
the scales, you know, the scales must be balanced.

2237
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,280
If you go too much in the alcohol

2238
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,000
or too much in the ice cream direction,

2239
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,840
you end up feeling like I do today.

2240
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,080
So you just have to eat a ton of dairy

2241
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,920
and drink a ton of alcohol to keep it all balanced.

2242
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,760
Right.

2243
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,200
And it's gonna be a ton of humidity.

2244
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,360
And sorry, go running on that footpath.

2245
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,200
Hey, yeah, yeah.

2246
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,280
So if you go out, go all the way up,

2247
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,280
like if you go out, like all out,

2248
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,600
yeah, you're right, it's fine.

2249
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:33,600
So eat like a, you know, eat a tub's worth of ice cream,

2250
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,240
balance it with a sink's worth of liquor,

2251
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,520
and then go run.

2252
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,360
Sure.

2253
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,200
And show for a sprint.

2254
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,040
Yeah.

2255
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:41,880
And go see the American Adventure.

2256
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,840
And then go watch Mark Twain

2257
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,320
shake hands with Benjamin Franklin.

2258
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,080
Caffeine ice cream, has anyone made caffeine ice cream yet?

2259
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:48,920
I think.

2260
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,000
You've seen caffeine gum.

2261
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,680
You mean like energy ice cream?

2262
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,680
Like energy ice cream?

2263
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,520
I'm sure that exists.

2264
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,320
That feels like an untapped market.

2265
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,360
Like Monster Ice Cream?

2266
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,760
Yeah, that'll keep you going at the parks.

2267
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,720
Yeah, sure.

2268
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,520
There's energy vape.

2269
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,360
Right.

2270
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,180
Oh, wow.

2271
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah, I filmed a weird shady commercial for energy vape.

2272
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,840
Energy vape.

2273
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,680
In Canada.

2274
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,240
Oh yeah.

2275
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,600
I'm not sure the product exists anymore.

2276
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,920
And I tried it at the end of the shoot

2277
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,680
and was up all night.

2278
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,240
It was a nightmare.

2279
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,080
Wow.

2280
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:23,920
Wow, wow.

2281
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,920
It definitely worked.

2282
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,600
So yeah, of all the things I could say, for sure.

2283
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,440
Wow.

2284
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:33,040
I can, yes, my terrifying sleepless hours.

2285
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,480
Can we give them a plug if they're still around?

2286
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,800
Yeah, I'd rather not.

2287
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,840
It's actually a felony to promote it anymore now.

2288
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,120
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

2289
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,880
Since the incidents.

2290
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,320
Fine, fine.

2291
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,640
Yeah, no, the factory is now abandoned

2292
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,440
and that's a viable theme for a slide,

2293
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,480
an abandoned energy vape factory.

2294
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,320
Yes.

2295
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,280
Now the head of that company in real life actually

2296
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,360
landed a shrimp boat on top of a volcano.

2297
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,280
So kind of ties it all back together.

2298
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,280
And of course the mascot is the vape gator.

2299
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,760
Vape gator.

2300
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,840
Hey, what's up fam?

2301
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,200
Vape gator here.

2302
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,040
Hey, thanks.

2303
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,360
He sounds actually too nice.

2304
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,240
He sounds too nice.

2305
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,520
I think vape gator would be a dick.

2306
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,920
Go.

2307
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,720
And he'd talk at 10 times that speed.

2308
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,560
Yeah, vape gator.

2309
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,560
We've made some more IP today though, so that's good.

2310
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,440
Yeah, yeah, several types of gator figured out.

2311
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,360
We got anything else?

2312
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,400
I don't know, I don't think we might have to.

2313
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,120
It's fun, it's tropical, yeah.

2314
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,520
I just, you know, watch out for that stone wall.

2315
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,160
This is a lot of like weird unpleasant tangents,

2316
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,040
but hey, it's a good water park.

2317
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,000
You should go there if you're in Florida.

2318
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,080
Yeah, kick off summer right.

2319
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,360
And then go to H2O Live, honestly.

2320
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,800
Yeah, H2O, wait, what is?

2321
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,640
Isn't that what it's called?

2322
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,760
Is that the Jimmy Buffett or the non-Jimmy Buffett?

2323
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,480
You're right, because Jimmy Buffett's water park

2324
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,280
is called H2O Live.

2325
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,600
Live, you're right.

2326
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,040
With like retweet racers.

2327
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,440
Oh, it's called H2O Glow Nights is what I'm talking about.

2328
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,840
Go to H2O Glow Nights.

2329
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,680
H2O Glow Nights.

2330
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,600
Typhoon Lagoon.

2331
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,400
Don't go to the water park with like, you know,

2332
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,360
canceled catastrophe or whatever that water slide is.

2333
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,520
Go to both of them.

2334
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,400
It's by the Amaco.

2335
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,280
This is the one that has the rainbow drink I want.

2336
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,880
So take a picture of it or send it to me in the mail.

2337
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,720
Great, all right, well, Easter Vibe Bug has the ride.

2338
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,200
The second gate, thanks for checking us out.

2339
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,920
Happy summer, and if I could send things out

2340
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,520
on a truly unpleasant note,

2341
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,920
there's one thing I missed that George Malay said,

2342
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,520
and you know, if you're thinking about getting

2343
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,760
into the water park business

2344
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,840
and you want some advice and to know how your,

2345
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,800
if your water park is succeeding or not,

2346
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,800
here's a real quote from this Pearl Harbor survivor

2347
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,800
about building a water park.

2348
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,120
Hey, when they're nipple to nipple and bun to bun,

2349
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,000
we know the turnstiles have really spun.

2350
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,840
Oh.

2351
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,080
See you on the bow.

2352
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,240
Oh, God.
