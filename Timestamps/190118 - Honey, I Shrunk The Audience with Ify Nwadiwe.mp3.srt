Welcome to Podcast The Riot, the only theme park podcast that will promise you at least 45 minutes of discussion on the Disney parks

00:00:56,976 --> 00:01:05,316
Exclusive Eric Idle character, Dr. Nigel Channing. I'm Mike Carlson. Joining me as always Jason Sheridan. Hi and Scott Gardner

Yep, it's finally time to 45 minutes. I think is what we're gonna give to him

10
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:15,436
Uh-huh a lot of thoughts on dr. Nigel Channing and he factors into several attractions

11
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:19,836
How many characters can say that they're in more than one? That is very exciting

12
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:23,496
We were talking a lot about see Disney Society of explorers and adventurers

13
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:28,636
Which they have like like kind of connecting universe, but this did it before see this this ride

14
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:32,136
We're talking about today this character the imagination Institute

15
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,396
Yeah, world

16
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,856
expanded universe with II

17
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:37,176
you

18
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:40,716
Is very fleshed out? Yeah

19
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:46,716
He is an expert on this in many different ways

20
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:49,216
I

21
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:49,976
He seems surprised

22
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:54,856
What I said, but that's okay, I believe it in my heart

23
00:01:54,856 --> 00:02:01,276
You know from the comedy group white women and the podcast nerd efficient ladies and gentlemen if he waddy way. Hey, how's it going?

24
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:08,236
Good. How you doing? Good. So you're particularly qualified today to talk about honey. I shrunk the audience

25
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:12,136
Yes, and why is that would you tell our listeners?

26
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:13,556
I'd say

27
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:14,936
for the year of

28
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:18,456
2007 I worked for Disneyland

29
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:26,836
Yeah, Disneyland the one in California the the only one that Walt has stepped foot in so

30
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:32,576
He has the magic right and I worked on honey. I shrunk the audience in Astro orbiter

31
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,716
I was there for the launch of Nemo and so I've got the suit and

32
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:43,216
You know, I was real loose with some of the rules because technically you're not supposed to wear your cast member outfits outside

33
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:46,816
But like I I thought the coat was so cool for the Nemo ride

34
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:54,016
So I took it like to one of improv show and like wore it on stage and everyone was like you look like Paddington Bay

35
00:02:54,016 --> 00:03:00,476
Which would be very fashionable now because people love those movies they love it now, but this is back

36
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:03,496
This is when he was just in the books. Yeah

37
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:10,616
So yeah, and then let me see I never got to work Space Mountain everyone went to work for if you don't know

38
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:14,236
Space Mountain is like the cool Tomorrowland ride. Everyone wants to work space

39
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:19,096
I don't want that. Yeah, because it's it's the cool one and everyone loves sitting in the control room

40
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:21,636
So like when you wave at them and someone doesn't wave back

41
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:25,776
That's the one trying to be too cool for school like everyone when I when I was there

42
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:32,596
It was like Space Mountain was the git but that made it harder to get it right honey. I shrunk the audience Astro orbiter

43
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,276
I don't know how people I feel like no

44
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:41,076
Honestly like the jobs are kind of ranked how you imagine the cooler the ride the cooler the job is

45
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:46,896
So because you want to be working the cool ride, you'll probably have more people there Astro orbiter

46
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,336
Surprised me because I assume like oh no one's gonna be there

47
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:54,856
but Astro orbiter was pretty consistent in its like

48
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:59,516
Lines like people like it's it's still one of the quickest lines out of all the rides in tomorrowland

49
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:06,656
But like people would come for it and there are people who would come and go this is my favorite ride and I was like, okay

50
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:13,356
Like I'm not on your side even though I work this right were they older folks

51
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:16,136
it was like it was like

52
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,576
Middle-aged folks. Uh-huh. Yeah, so

53
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,416
Yeah, yeah, that's what I imagine

54
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,636
people always

55
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:29,436
would try and weasel in a way to try and like get you to talk about the people mover and more so trying to see if

56
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:35,636
You can get me to talk about the people who died on the people mover. Oh, right jumping from car to car

57
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:41,836
Yeah, it's like I one I don't know about that too. I was not working here that long three even if I did come on

58
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,736
Y'all know it's Disneyland. I'm not gonna talk about dead people

59
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:51,236
So so growing up as a kid like was that Disneyland a place where you were like, it'd be fun to work here

60
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:57,736
It was just like hey, why not? I'm no it's so I grew up out here in Southern, California and

61
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:00,476
Got there probably when I was like

62
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:06,796
1920 and like it just was known as like Disney is the easiest place to get hired

63
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,996
Like there's such a high turnover rate

64
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:14,636
They're like you need a job go to Disney and I think like I really need a job my best friend Wells and was like

65
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:15,656
Oh go to Disney

66
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:21,596
They'll hire you on the spot because they do their interviews and hiring like right there as a matter of fact if they're like

67
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,976
We'll call you back. You didn't get the job

68
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:29,056
So like so I was like, oh tight this I need a job it's very easy to get a job here

69
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:32,976
Let me go work Disney this thing we described as the dream

70
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:43,296
So, yeah, I went in and and like the key to Disney getting a job at Disney is exactly what you think just being like

71
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:51,256
you know a happy, you know perky person a

72
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:57,156
About you where you know you can because that's all the conversation is they're asking you about yourself and they're really just gauging like

73
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,616
how you can like

74
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:03,356
communicate while conveying like a happy attitude because the people who I saw got

75
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:08,956
Will call you later were people who were like very like here's why I'm good very busy, you know

76
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,956
business-minded and you know

77
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:15,736
People who like by Disney standards you assume they think they're ne'er-do-wells

78
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:20,616
Like there was a guy with like who was tatted up and I was like, you know, have you been to Disneyland?

79
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:28,056
I get it, but I'm not he was like now I'm gonna be in a costume like that. That's my goal. Oh sure. Yeah

80
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,676
So yeah, so I got the job there

81
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:36,956
and it's funny because like it's the perfect job for that age like that that like

82
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:43,416
18 to 20 because you're very malleable at that time. So like when they give you that like

83
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:50,376
Orientation pitch about creating the magic and how important it is you you buy in I was like all about it

84
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:56,116
I was like I got to create the magic and this that whatever and I was like all in I got I was so hyped

85
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,756
When I had the job that I went to what was that weird online game?

86
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:06,676
Disney had for a while where you were in the digital park. Oh, oh was it online or was it a CD-ROM?

87
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:10,076
No, it was online. It was like an online flash based

88
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:17,416
It was a massively online game where you would go to the different lands in every and it was like a

89
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:24,556
Park so they had adventure land tomorrow land and they had all these different levels based off of the rides

90
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,256
And I was so stumping us here

91
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:35,376
Signed up for an account and was just walking around the park and just like I need to learn this place

92
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:47,396
Virtual Magic Kingdom, yes

93
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,576
I was like, okay, cool

94
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:54,096
I'm like, okay, cool. Let me just get it and then I started and

95
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,116
Honestly Hista is for short which is honey

96
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:03,416
I shrunk the audience was the perfect spot for someone like me who was like a comedian because

97
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,796
Like I like they showed me the actual order stuff and I was like, alright cool

98
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,196
This is basic stuff and then they were like, alright

99
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:17,376
So for Hista you're gonna when you are the like lead scientist when you put on the coat you put on the lab

100
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:23,876
Coat. Yeah, you're in the lab coat and you go up there and you give the spiel and they basically were like you can kind of

101
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:29,136
Do what you want and improvise stuff. You just need to make sure you hit these points and I was like

102
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:33,736
Oh, I get to just go up there and be funny as long as I hit the point

103
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:39,996
That was like my favorite thing cuz I would just like and then also like it was cool too because it wasn't just from my comedy

104
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:43,796
Brain, it was like the comedy brain and indoctrinated by Disney brain

105
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:48,396
It was all about not just being funny but making it like a magical experience

106
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:53,216
So I still to this day think I was probably one of the best like head scientists

107
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:59,276
I believe I just you know one if you don't know by now, I'm a great comedian but two

108
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:05,656
Two I was like really committed to like not, you know breaking the bubble of what is Disney

109
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:13,416
So you have to know the mythology that you you're it's in your head that it is an open house at the imagination

110
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:20,176
Institute. Oh, yeah, and you were coming at it from that narrative point. Yeah, and what's an example of like?

111
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:26,256
Like what is something you do beyond just here walk this way? Oh, well when you're a head scientist

112
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:32,716
Yeah, you you don't let anyone in you are at the podium and you walk up to the podium and you're just like we're about to

113
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,676
have a presentation from

114
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:41,616
So what's his name? What is the character's name in the honey? I shrunk the out of Wayne Zelinski or dr.

115
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:43,156
Channing yeah

116
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:49,536
Channing is presenting an award to dr. Right the letter of the year award

117
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:53,216
Yeah, it was like this is gonna be great and he's gonna showcase this new

118
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:57,756
This new invention he has it's really exciting. We haven't seen it yet

119
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:03,596
It's the first of its kind and and you just we got to make sure we have the safety goggles cuz we don't know what may

120
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:09,796
Happen but this is this is history in the making y'all get excited and like making people cheer

121
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:13,656
It was it and and I I had a blast I had a lot of people come up to me

122
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,456
It's like man. I've done like this ride

123
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:20,996
I was like I've seen this before but like you have or have the best feel

124
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:27,336
I I do find like it that show kind of things like that when the cast member is really good when the presenter is really

125
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:33,736
Good and the thing is over. I inevitably lean over to whoever I'm with and go like that guy was really good, right?

126
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:42,096
There there's a guy there's just a profile on him a guy who's worked at the enchanted tiki room for years and he like

127
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:47,976
Gives it a hundred and percent waking up those birds that I have seen him before and it's like

128
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:52,936
Yeah, it does. It does add to the experience. It does make it feel very theatrical

129
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:58,736
It's it's also it's only it's also the only thing that can change slightly from ride to ride like a from

130
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,376
experience to experience cuz like

131
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:03,716
You know like like us we've gone a few times to these things

132
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:09,196
So like that's the deck can be like the difference in just like a normal ride versus like, oh wow

133
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:15,676
That was really great. And now I remember this particular ride over the other 50 you went on because

134
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:19,256
The performer Lord knows these movies

135
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:24,716
Run the risk of becoming very repetitive because it is literally the same thing over and over

136
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:30,356
So you have the slight it's almost like being a like an audience warm-up guy at a show date

137
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:38,056
Or like the host of the stand-up show the guy like keeping the energy up. Yeah, just set it up for the main show

138
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,596
That's that's something else

139
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:42,376
so you did it for

140
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:48,616
for a year for a summer yeah for about a year because I was I was there for a while and

141
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:55,776
Eventually my dad got me my day my day job, which was at the LA County Register recorder

142
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,536
which was right around the perfect time because

143
00:11:58,536 --> 00:11:59,496
like I said

144
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:05,196
there is that period of like from like 19 to 20 where it's good and then like

145
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:10,116
Once the kind of like dust starts to settle the rose-colored glasses come off

146
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:16,176
you you you realize some of the stuff that just gets annoying like just that the

147
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:22,956
Kind of bottom-level infrastructure is basically run by kids like all your supervisors are not that much older than you

148
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:29,476
So it gets clicky it gets you know, everything it's almost like, you know college or high school part two

149
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:33,036
and and like the supervisors like when you're

150
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,396
Forget the the actual name again

151
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:39,396
But it's like they're the dudes in like these black

152
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:45,996
kind of pea coats and they they don't have anything that discern them working for a specific ride because they are

153
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,776
Even over your the the ride lead so you have your cast members

154
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:55,436
you have kind of the shift lead and then you have the like lead over the ride and then there's like

155
00:12:55,436 --> 00:13:02,796
The leads who are over the whole land who kind of like mostly work in an office that you'd never see that's in the

156
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,736
Backlot area and those guys like they have that black pea coat

157
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:14,056
So even if you don't know who they are you you you know that there there's big stuffs and they know it too because if

158
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:19,456
You're a 20 year old in this pea coat and you know, you have this power. They're flexing, you know, so

159
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:25,156
So there was a immediate shift when I got my day job because I still like Disney and I like to have in a free

160
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:29,556
cast so I tried to like I was working for the LA County from like

161
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:34,036
Nine to five and then getting to Disneyland at six to work

162
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:39,016
I like literally driving down the five because I was in Norwalk. So it was pretty close to Anaheim

163
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,196
changing into my cast member outfit and

164
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,456
driving that and I was in and this

165
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,276
Obviously caused me to be late a little bit more my out like that hour

166
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:52,776
Especially during the week like only having like three hours really isn't worth the shift

167
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:55,536
But like I was able to make it work for a while

168
00:13:55,536 --> 00:14:00,696
but my whole attitude changed like all all that bullshit was just

169
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:03,116
didn't matter to me because I

170
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:08,856
Knew that I got paid way more than everyone now because I have this like salaried government job

171
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:15,676
so like and and it's funny because that's where the power came comes from in any job is like the person who gets paid more you're

172
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:21,556
Like oh you're you're talking good. So I just I don't want to say I became the worst

173
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,816
But I definitely

174
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:31,336
Shift like shook the ecosystem because like people being like oh man watch out because you know, they're here

175
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:40,296
It's like I don't care like yeah, it's just like and I've always hated that kind of like high school BS, but I

176
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,256
respected it because like I

177
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:49,096
before I had another job needed that job and like also did enjoy and love working at Disneyland

178
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:54,176
But that was the one thing I hated was that kind of like hierarchy that was there

179
00:14:54,176 --> 00:15:00,076
And so the moment I was able to step out and be like, oh, I don't need this and I know that I'm

180
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:07,876
Making more than all of y'all. Nah, forget y'all. You're not good. And honestly, it just like it made it cool

181
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:13,456
But it just became I was dead at the end of the week just working two jobs back-to-back

182
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:18,576
Yeah, really not making any money because I wasn't working enough at

183
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:25,076
Disneyland to like make it worth my while I was just really there for this free pass and it was like I could just

184
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:26,576
buy an annual pass

185
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:35,056
Like I worked at Universal Studios and I kept I stayed on the schedule and tried to not get shifts

186
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:39,236
So that I could park up there for free. It was entirely about keeping the parking

187
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:45,056
Yeah for a place. Well, I mean now we've we've ended up going to City Walk a ton. Yeah in the recent past

188
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:47,056
I'd like to have it now. It's oh

189
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:54,756
It's crazy to see the actual shift because remember they were giving out annual passes you brought a Coke can you were king?

190
00:15:55,316 --> 00:16:00,416
Universal and now they refuse because they have Harry Potter and voodoo doughnuts

191
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:06,496
I'm like, oh y'all are just out of this. It was so funny. They swung too far too fast

192
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:11,076
Yeah, they're like you're not gonna be able we're gonna shut down Lancashire

193
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:18,836
There's gonna be so many people and then there was a slight uptick for Harry Potter and then everyone went back to their lives

194
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:25,396
Yeah, because we all just like live around like there's homes right next to it. I know it's it's they they have a decent

195
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:31,236
Annual pass right now with AAA where it's like 119

196
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:35,756
Oh, yeah, and then like I was like that's pretty close to like just a day ticket, right?

197
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,456
That might be the move for me, but I haven't I've yet

198
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:46,836
What's the room's consensus on the Simpsons ride we haven't talked about it. We haven't done an episode on it

199
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,856
Yeah, oh do we just stay to specific?

200
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:53,696
This is a comedy podcast we don't stay specifically

201
00:16:53,696 --> 00:17:00,936
My feeling is I I really liked it the first time I went on it

202
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,456
but I think a joke packed ride is tough to

203
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:11,256
Stay good and fresh many many times over and they were letting the

204
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:16,496
projection quality lapse it was starting to get dim and

205
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:22,276
I just I think it came out of the gate really strong and now about ten years in I don't need to go on it

206
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:26,916
What have they read they did screens are different like they it's brighter now, right? I think they changed it

207
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:32,356
It's what I was early change spot. Yeah, the problem is I feel like it's the all the other rides that have been built since

208
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:38,656
Because everything's a screen ride everyone complains about that obviously we've complained about it, but it's like everything's a screen right now

209
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,756
So like that one seems extra

210
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:47,396
Okay. Yeah, I don't we don't need to go on it. I'd rather go on transformers. Oh my god better train screen ride for sure

211
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:50,136
Oh wait, I love transform. I was look

212
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:56,056
that was a real journey for me because you know, I've never been a fan of

213
00:17:56,056 --> 00:18:00,716
Transformers I was real into Armada right when the movie series came out

214
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:07,216
I hated the design of the robots. I haven't seen a Transformers movie today except bumblebee, which is amazing

215
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:14,996
And I just always had this disdain for Transformers and my sister drug me on the Transformers, right and it changed my life

216
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:19,056
I was I was rooting for optimists for bumblebee

217
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,996
I was in it and I go on that ride every single time to date

218
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:28,696
I have not been on the Simpsons ride because I'm still salty of them getting rid of back to the future

219
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:38,216
Reason there was no reason to change it. It's timeless. I gotta say I think it's literally not timeless in that

220
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:43,696
That you in that ride you go to the year 2015 and we are now past 2015

221
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:47,296
So it would be I mean you could say that it's traveling to the past

222
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:54,396
Yeah, but into this other this 2015 back to the future because the future to them and we're going back to it

223
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:55,616
Makes more

224
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:59,396
You know they hacked a system with that name

225
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:06,776
We actually we talked about this and we I think we were thinking like let's just do a new one. Yeah cuz

226
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,696
My feeling was like I love the old back to the future

227
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:15,696
But we want to see this some of the characters we want some robots with the characters

228
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:20,796
Let's do a full new e ticket in this new crazy Universal Park. I don't think it's gonna happen

229
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:24,356
But I want I want Strickland and I want you want needles

230
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:29,136
Yeah, we want these character needles from back to the future to to be a robot

231
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:34,056
That's what we want people are pounding down the yeah universal demanding needles

232
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:40,136
I'll say this I think the the Springfield next to the Simpsons ride. Oh, it's amazing is great

233
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:44,116
Yeah, it's my favorite part. It's the only reason I'm not like

234
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:49,856
So militant about it is because those donuts slap they are great

235
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,416
So hard we are like look I'm on my keto thing right now

236
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,556
I was in the bathroom debating going to fud Ruckers or steak and shake

237
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:05,376
But since I don't have it with a bun steak and shake feels like I should just get a steak versus going to

238
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:11,156
Fud Ruckers. Yeah an actual burger bun. That's a weird side. No, no, I get it. Oh, these are issues

239
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:16,416
I'm ready because we're going on a team outing for BuzzFeed to

240
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:18,456
Universal and

241
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:24,596
I'm a hundred percent ready to break keto to eat that big donut because that's my favorite thing to chomp into when I go

242
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:29,956
So is that your favorite theme park snack overall? Would you put it number one? Is there anything else dole whip?

243
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:36,236
Do you like dole whip? Oh, I'm a big dole whip head, but don't whip is that thing where you know where it's like

244
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,056
It's consistent like like it's not something

245
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:44,036
I'll lose my mind over like if I had to run into Disney and I could only choose one snack

246
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:48,696
I wouldn't think to get a dole whip, but I I do think it is the best

247
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:53,676
But like I went to Disney during the Halloween and I got

248
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,036
probably

249
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:58,376
Six different churros because they had the

250
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:07,616
Yeah, yeah, cuz I had the candy apple and the orange I had the the pumpkin spice

251
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:12,956
I had the regular churro and then I had that red hot one. No

252
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:17,616
That one's pretty good. There's one more that I think I'm missing. So I think I had this many

253
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,976
Where are all these coming from? Where are they at Disneyland?

254
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:26,916
The they're all around now. Did I say sour apple? Yes. Yes, you did. Okay. Sour apple is in Tomorrowland

255
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:35,056
pumpkin spice was in right next to a haunted mansion and I got the regular churro there the orange one was in

256
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,116
adventure land and

257
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:41,816
And there was one I think in fantasy land. Maybe that's where the red hot one was

258
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:45,476
How are these flavors conveyed? Is it through the the dusting or

259
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:53,816
Okay, so so the sour apple which I think is like was probably the best out of all the newer flavors because

260
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:57,816
With that one they dusted on like a sour apple

261
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,576
Dust like sugar on it, but you dipped it in a caramel

262
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:07,316
So it was like a caramel apple and it actually did like taste like that

263
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:13,136
Then with the pumpkin spice it was like cream cheese frosting that you would dip into

264
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:19,876
Yeah, the only thing though is you have to pay extra for the caramel the cream cheese came with the pumpkin spice

265
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,656
Which you know, that's weird. Yeah, that's weird that that's not

266
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:29,236
That made me mad, but I still paid for it. The orange one was cool, but it was just kind of like just orange

267
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:33,736
Yeah, so so small. So I was gonna say I had a s'more one one time. That was good

268
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,096
No, that is a dipping like marshmallow. So yeah

269
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:43,116
So churro over Dole Whip, but does put Simpson's pumpkin or Simpson's pumpkin Simpson's donut is that top?

270
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,936
I'm getting make my flavors mixed up here. Oh

271
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:46,716
That's good

272
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:54,216
I think it may be my top because it's something that because I feel like all those other amazing ones like a dole whip is

273
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:58,696
When I'm walking by the tea rooms, oh, yeah, these are amazing. Let's go or like a churros like oh, yeah

274
00:22:58,696 --> 00:22:59,316
These are amazing

275
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:06,076
but like I am actively thinking about those big donuts because I feel like for the price it has the value and

276
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:11,156
Has the size and as it because you know this big enough to wear like if I split in half with someone

277
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:17,936
I wouldn't feel ripped off because no number one. I hate sharing food, you know us in here with significant others

278
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:20,696
They like to share I don't I need my own get your own

279
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,696
We'll both have our own and when you don't finish yours because it's too big for you

280
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:27,616
I'll have that too Lindsay is like that but I'm not really so yeah the other way around

281
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:32,036
Yeah, I was like, hey, let's go split this. She goes no. All right. She's right. She's actually same with Aaron. Yeah, really?

282
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,856
Yes, that's funny. I don't like to split entrees

283
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:41,836
I like to share on trade you like to share yet just oh, let's just get one and we'll split and I share

284
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:46,436
Well, that's actually otter to me you share entrees but not like dessert. No, I'll share dessert

285
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:49,596
No, you share dessert with me. We've both shared desserts

286
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:55,876
We've both you and I and you and Jason and I and Scott and I have both shared the gray stuff in different times

287
00:23:55,876 --> 00:24:02,296
Yes, but then Jason has also eaten after me Jason. I pretty sure ate soup after me once

288
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:03,976
Like yeah

289
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:08,276
Soup the soup was everything I was on board to the soup

290
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:12,476
I don't think I remember someone's I'll finish most because I could be wrong

291
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:16,976
I think he had a bit was like a biscuit the Jolly Holiday or something and I kind of like had a little bit of

292
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:20,976
It and I was like I had a couple spoons of it and you were like, yeah, I'll take that

293
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:25,716
That's my memory of a couple spoons and you were like, I'm not into this like yeah, whatever

294
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,296
Yeah, it depends like if it is a couple of spoons then yeah, I'll do it

295
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:35,076
It's like, you know past halfway point I'm like nah, that's that's that that's not

296
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:38,476
I imagine the remaining two

297
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:45,396
Spoonfuls of like tomato soup or something. That was what I went to and I agree. Oh, oh with more information

298
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:49,156
I understand it. Yeah, it wasn't. Yeah. Yeah, that would have been very weird if I was like, hey

299
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,776
I got like a a little thimble full of tomato bisque you want it? Yeah

300
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:56,976
I mean that I would because that would be so novel to enjoy

301
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:07,536
Where the thimble comes from my cabinet in his pocket the Disney provided was it a cup that got shrunk down by dr

302
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:13,756
Wayne's a lint ski to a

I made it it doesn't taste like I made it. It tastes like a chef made it. It's pretty incredible

317
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,196

So

323
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,316
I'm gonna just say this one anecdote then we're gonna jump right back into hista because there's something

324
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:06,316
I love bragging about that. Oh, yeah Disney people care about place

325
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:09,556
Jolly holiday had a good Halloween

326
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:15,536
Dessert too. They had like a black rose, which was this chocolate mousse

327
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:20,836
That was just black and it was good, but it was one of those things that felt like

328
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:24,156
too decadent for where I was like too decadent for

329
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:29,156
The theme park food really like this feels like I should have it at a restaurant restaurant

330
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:35,616
But I feel like that's kind of what Jolly Holiday not Jolly Holiday. It's the one that's in Fantasyland

331
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:39,756
Oh, oh your guest. Oh the red rose red red rose red rose tavern

332
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:43,316
Yeah, I had red rose feels like they're trying to swing for that fancier vibe

333
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:48,176
But I'm like, no, this is still too fancy for here, but it was it was good. Yeah

334
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:50,356
Now the thing I want to brag about

335
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:55,496
Always bring up I could not shut up about this when this happened

336
00:27:55,496 --> 00:28:00,936
I knew Captain EO was coming back when because in the

337
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:10,936
Original like tour and orientation of hista there they show us like oh, this is the room where where the

338
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:16,656
The film is where we shoot it and they kind of showed us how the camera works

339
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:19,296
They're like you can't go in here. It's like and also

340
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:25,496
We also still have the Captain EO film and and this was back in like

341
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,616
2007 and I was like, oh

342
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:32,856
They're just gonna play it when he dies like when he dies they're gonna bring it back

343
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:37,396
Like why would you keep it? He was like, we don't know and sure enough like

344
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:42,056
Captain EO came back and I was like I knew it like I knew it the moment you were like

345
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:44,576
Oh, and we still have the Captain EO films

346
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:48,456
I was like great and I never got to see Captain EO when I was younger

347
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:51,956
So I was so glad I was able to go back and watch it and actually see it

348
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:55,456
Would you that's it's also weird that you were thinking about his death

349
00:28:55,456 --> 00:29:02,116
But it's sort of a surprise when it happened. Yeah the year before you're I mean, I didn't expect it to come that fast

350
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:09,356
When he it was kind of like when he happens to die they're gonna bring it back

351
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:14,376
But we're saying when so when it when they did put it back in it was the original Prince

352
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:19,636
Presumably if that was sitting around. Mm-hmm. Damn. So that it wasn't even like some it wasn't some remastered

353
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:24,756
No, because it was very like analog poppy like grainy grimy

354
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:31,796
So yeah, hmm, you could tell you could tell and that's like in some just giant like you did you see it physically?

355
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:39,656
Or did they know it was like a mystery room almost because the film room and I didn't get to actually see the camera

356
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:43,976
There was kind of like, you know how in the movie theater, they'll have that kind of window and they get you

357
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:52,696
But like the room itself was locked and probably so some dumbass doesn't go in there and make it be so funny

358
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:58,976
So shine a flashlight over the whole thing. So like that yeah, that was completely off limits to us

359
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,556
Huh? Do you have any idea how big like talking?

360
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:09,356
Honey again, like how big that film was is that a regular thin little film stripper is some bigger like IMAX?

361
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:16,996
It was it was kind of if I remember correctly which I'm probably not I remember it being like it was like a different

362
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:19,536
Type of film because it was displaying like

363
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:23,696
Doubled images. Oh, okay. Yeah, right. Oh, so this is not your ordinary

364
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:29,636
Yeah, which makes it even more insane. There's I talked about this on it. It's probably won't be out yet

365
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:34,516
Or maybe there's a mailbag episode. I was talking about my cockamamie plan to propose to my wife

366
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:35,936
with a

367
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,216
Custom video I would make and play in this theater

368
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:42,416
This is a good way to practice a good person to talk to about this actually

369
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:47,456
I was like what if I could make make a little move that you think Captain EO is gonna start but then it's this little

370
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:52,376
Movie I make that culminates in will you marry me? Yeah. Yeah, and now I'm going well

371
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:56,356
How could I possibly have made something and run it through a film projector?

372
00:30:56,756 --> 00:31:01,156
Yeah, that displays double image. I would have had to go to an optical lab

373
00:31:01,156 --> 00:31:02,616
I would have had to like go

374
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:07,616
Talk to the people who shot the back to the future movie and like okay, so can we print it like I'm now I'm

375
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:15,456
Spending sixty five thousand hours a conference call with marketing operations and representatives of the Kodak company

376
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,236
Figure out how to do this

377
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:23,436
Is there any like when I present that plan to you you're like that you if this had been in?

378
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:28,316
2007 you're a person who would have like helped me with it. Is that completely insane?

379
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:34,296
The idea that I could have contacted more money than the engagement ring and probably the wedding

380
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:41,236
Why did I think I'll let you wear the lab coat and at the end say will you marry?

381
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:51,836
Like whoa glad the day is saved. Thank you so much and to my beautiful girlfriend in the audience

382
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:57,176
My colleagues has an addendum to what you just witnessed

383
00:31:57,176 --> 00:32:01,716
If you'd like to join me in the the Institute of Eternal Matrimony

384
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:06,336
So you would have done if I had good now if I just gone straight up to you

385
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:10,276
You're you're an employee with some power, but I could like hey I have a thing

386
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:13,376
I want you you would you have had to run that up the flagpole

387
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:19,296
you I probably would have had to run it up the flagpole and I probably would have like

388
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:22,816
When I first started probably would have asked my lead who probably would have been like

389
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:27,636
But if you would have caught me late in my Disney career

390
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:31,616
I would have told you come back towards the end of my shift and then we'll make it

391
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,576
Norwalk money, I don't give a shit

392
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:39,536
also to like you you know like which leagues will let you do some like

393
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:44,236
Cool stuff as long as we keep it chill and which leads are trying to be by the book

394
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:45,356
So I'd be like, all right

395
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:52,676
Cool leads here and was like I'm gonna do some because like the only I think hiccup to it would be like

396
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:57,776
Like once we're letting people out we're letting people in like it's almost like simultaneous

397
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:01,356
So you would literally slow down that process?

398
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:06,036
But it would probably just be something as simple as being like all right

399
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:11,056
There's an extra presentation if we just step outside to the right. I

400
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:15,216
Okay, you can get her attention on the microphone and then all right

401
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:20,876
All right, so it's gonna be done with precision and you would been in the lab coat. I assume yes. Yeah

402
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:26,296
Which this is oh, it's a very different dream now the idea that I yeah, I'm sure

403
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,496
I'd love to

404
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:33,036
Institute professor it started out as like a cool movie playing in the Captain EO theater

405
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,536
Now it's like you're outside at the exit

406
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:41,036
Halloween adventure quality white like people are like just trying

407
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,256
to get by

408
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,476
Excuse me

409
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:46,816
They're reaching over you to dump their glasses

410
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:54,776
Although now 2018 if you reached out to like social because they have such a huge social media apparatus

411
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:59,316
At Disney now if you reached out to them and we're like, hey, let's talk like yeah

412
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:02,576
You can you do whatever you want with this video?

413
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:06,776
Like you can make this viral you can make this into a convert whatever you want

414
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,676
You would have to you would have they would have to be viral marketing for right? Yeah

415
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,936
Yeah, I have no desire for my proposal to be viral marketing

416
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:20,996
Now we know the terms I you were talking about food also. I want to ask about what's what was the what was the food situation?

417
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:26,636
As an employee there is a cafeteria or you slipping in getting food in the park. You can do either

418
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:30,736
Okay, so you there there is a cafeteria in the back which is like

419
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:35,236
It's like cafeteria food like they're not like whipping up what they're whipping up in the park

420
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:43,956
so there are but like it is gonna be cheaper whereas if you wanted like park food like it was like

421
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,436
Gosh, I'm trying to remember if I'm misremembering this

422
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:51,776
But if I remember correctly you were able to because the one spot is like if you wanted a burger

423
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,096
you can go to that Tomorrowland burger spot by Nemo and

424
00:34:56,096 --> 00:35:03,256
But it was like the employee discount with a park food was still more expensive than cafeteria food

425
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:03,836
Oh sure

426
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:05,776
Yeah, I mean

427
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:10,616
Off kind of retrospect. It's like why didn't they just feed their employees for free?

428
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,676
like I know there's a shit ton of employees, but like

429
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:17,356
It's like why why were we buying our food?

430
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:22,176
And I think it's because now I'm in an age where I work for tech companies that do feed you for free

431
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:28,316
And it's like it's like yeah, why are we paying you to eat on our lunch break? You know?

432
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,476
Well, it's a perk. It's a perk and it's like, you know

433
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:38,416
To get people in the door it's an added benefit. Yeah, but with a company that makes how much money sure why not? Yeah

434
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:42,456
Yeah, yeah, being that like a Facebook or whatever has a cafeteria or like Dreamworks

435
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:48,456
Yeah, like that they have just a cafeteria if you're on that lot, right Disney. I don't think so. I think Disney you're paying for

436
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:52,976
Yeah, yeah, Disney. I um, I was like that ABC lot

437
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:56,436
I went in there and they had like a cafeteria you pay the comment

438
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,836
I guess some some jobs you do pay so it's not that obscene

439
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:06,236
There's subsidy all the studio commissaries are like a little subsidy like they're not terribly expensive

440
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:13,096
Yeah, yeah tech campuses that there's an expectation with the job that or people are being fed and I think in San Francisco

441
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:18,116
Restaurants were even having a hard time getting head chefs or sous chefs

442
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:23,436
Because Google or Facebook or all these campuses were just snapping them up. Oh, yeah

443
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:28,116
and I think it's because and I think that's why I kind of see the correlation is the

444
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:34,956
Idea behind tech companies feeding you is if you can just walk to a cafeteria and grab food for free and walk back to your desk

445
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:40,216
You're working there and I feel like it is literally impossible to leave Disneyland

446
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:44,476
To grab something to eat and come back in time to be your shift

447
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:48,676
So you have to be there which is why it's like then just feed us free food

448
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:52,776
Like don't you know we have no choice but to buy this food because there's nowhere else

449
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:55,516
Well, I guess you can bring your own lunch, but who does that?

450
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:58,436
Yeah, it's like being on set

451
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:03,376
It's like that's why they feed you on shoots and stuff because they don't want like the cast and crew

452
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:10,916
Going to a dozen different restaurants. Yeah, there's act traffic or an accident or like no. Yeah, but

453
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:17,296
But it was cool. The food was great. I always loved doing it, but it was this thing of like since you are

454
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,576
buying cafeteria food on a

455
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:26,896
Like a little bit higher than minimum wage budget you can very easily just be burning through the money

456
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,996
You're making right buying food there. Yeah, it's all good

457
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:32,476
It was how close did you live to Disney?

458
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:38,276
Like how long did it take you to actually get into work this I lived in Long Beach at the time

459
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:41,196
Okay, but Long Beach is very close to Anaheim in Orange County

460
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:44,856
So I was I would just take the four or five straight down and be able to hit it pretty quickly

461
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,576
So it was cool and you get to you know

462
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:53,296
K lot the cattel lot and just take the shuttle over but there that was a thing where it's like

463
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:59,316
you have to be there so much earlier because there's so much transportation because you have to get there and

464
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:02,716
Even though it wasn't that far you still have Anaheim Disney traffic

465
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:08,776
Yeah, and when you get to Kayla you have to wait for the shuttle take the shuttle in and then go backstage

466
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:14,436
And then make it to your land. So you had to make sure you you had to like be

467
00:38:14,856 --> 00:38:21,916
In the parking lot probably like 15 20 minutes early just to be safe, you know, and you're not getting paid for that time

468
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:24,656
I know not at all and that's all that heads up

469
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:30,016
The clutch move is like to just go to the park on your workdays and just like, you know

470
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:34,896
Check in go in hang out at the park and then walk backstage when you're ready to go

471
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,516
But you can't just walk backstage

472
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:41,856
You have to walk out and go in through the employee entrance because it's all about keeping the magic up, right?

473
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,856
Weird and magical in the like corridors. Did you ever see?

474
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:50,936
like so some others some like secret prop or

475
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:53,236
Captain Captain Hook having a seizure or something

476
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:57,016
Was like on my first week working there

477
00:38:57,016 --> 00:39:02,536
The first thing I see backstage is Mickey Mouse smoking a cigarette with the head off and I was like, alright

478
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:04,576
Well, the magic has changed for me forever

479
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:09,776
Now you always hear that was a thing that scarred Michael Jackson was he got to go backstage at Disneyland

480
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:16,716
Around the corner and a character had the head off a cigarette. I think he was old though when that scarred him

481
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:21,316
Yes, no, he had a number of hits said it was 80 late 80s

482
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:26,916
It is like just so jarring because you when you think about it all your life up until you that point

483
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:31,236
You've never seen the character with your head off. So you've never had to even

484
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:37,756
Bounce around that suspension of disbelief like you knew there was a person there, but you never had to see it

485
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:41,016
So seeing it it's like oh man and also like

486
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:47,716
Realizing that a lot of these people are hella short because these suits are so small go on. Yeah

487
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:57,376
Yeah, I would be unnerved though if I went out to get a picture with a character and go like how this goofy really smells like

488
00:39:57,376 --> 00:39:58,796
smokes today

489
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:05,096
No, they wrote they're really good about like cleaning. Yeah, they for breeze the outfit before they go back out, right?

490
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:12,276
But yeah, that was like those were the big jobs are like your character jobs and those like speaking of the clickiness backstage is like

491
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:18,456
you know if you're in the cafeteria and you see like Cinderella or snow right or any of the

492
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:25,516
Princesses like you don't get to just go talk to him like, you know, I'm sure you can but no one does that

493
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:32,356
There's just like this unspoken rule of like oh, that's a that's a princess and usually like the princess are chilling and like they're

494
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,656
With each other or just by themselves

495
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:37,676
The hierarchy could you even identify the groups?

496
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:44,056
Like is it a mean girls scenario where you could be like there's the princesses over here. There's tomorrow land people over here

497
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:48,456
like yeah, because like the the hierarchy was of fairly

498
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:52,616
fairly simple split up to your factions which were

499
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,516
which were like

500
00:40:54,516 --> 00:41:00,196
Like your lands so like, you know, I you everyone in tomorrow land kind of kicks it

501
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:06,396
The coolest ride are the cool kids of said land so the space mountain kids, you know, they're they're the cool guys

502
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:08,336
His day I was just the funny guy

503
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:15,396
so like I kind of commingled with everyone but also you you would meet people in other lands when you would do the parades because

504
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:19,076
like people from each land would all come together and

505
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:25,596
But then like then you had like the parade leads those guys were cool, which were essentially kind of like

506
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:29,696
Just pretty much leads who just also got to do parades

507
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:33,816
and then like I said the like the big like

508
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:37,796
land leads who like wore the jackets like those were the cool guys and

509
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:42,956
Then outside of that were just the older people who like this was a job and they were above that bullshit

510
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:45,776
And you just really didn't notice because you have like lifers

511
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:50,876
Which was like you semi derogatorily which are people who like they're like, yeah

512
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:55,336
I like work in Disney and this is gonna be my career and it's like oh you're a lifer

513
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:57,296
And then you have like

514
00:41:57,296 --> 00:42:04,456
Retirees that was another big thing which were old people who retired and they didn't give a fuck about any of the like

515
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:10,276
Clicks or anything they were just their own breed and but they were kind of cool because you know, just old people stories

516
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:15,616
Sure, I heard that a lot of retirees like will do it for less for the money

517
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:21,056
But more to a like get out and about have something to do and then the perks for a grandkids

518
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:27,436
They get the discount for yep, they can buy gifts discount again and then they you get all those extra, you know

519
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:34,136
Guest passes you're like the coolest grandparent or uncle if you can get your niece or grandkid

520
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:40,036
Into Disneyland for free, you know, yeah. So yeah, the wheels are turning with all of us now. Yeah, we'll all be working

521
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:46,416
I'll see you guys it for when his to comes back his to 3.0

522
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,336
Yeah, I'll see you before my shift

523
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:53,456
Well, I think the way the way a certain point the way the annual passes are going it's going to make more sense for us

524
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:58,736
All to get jobs part-time at Disney to get tickets versus paying whatever

525
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:01,856
Dollars will cost in like five. I know

526
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,496
It's gonna be wild

527
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:07,016
Before we get deep into the ride my last question

528
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:11,356
Do you have like one specific day where something happened or a story?

529
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:17,416
Like is there a one specific story you remember from working there where you're like, oh, yeah, that was the weirdest day. Um, well

530
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:21,816
The it's the craziest story, but the story I have

531
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:28,256
Was like there was this lead who was a parade lead and this was a very important

532
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:32,156
crux to that that person's

533
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:35,996
Plan because he ended up like

534
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:44,336
Dating multiple girls at the park, but since they were separated by lands, they never knew about each other until

535
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:49,256
Yeah until like they kind of

536
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:52,096
figure one figured out and then they kind of like

537
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,536
Connected the dots and found out that this dude was like

538
00:43:55,536 --> 00:44:02,376
Cheating with them and it was the it was like the perfect crime because if you imagine you're a parade lead

539
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:09,736
You can flirt with anyone in any land and then they go back to their land and you go back to the land that you are

540
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,656
And he was in Tomorrowland

541
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:15,756
It's like a rock star having like a girl in every city

542
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:21,396
Yeah, and that's basically what it was but then it blew up in his face like right as he was

543
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:26,776
He was leaving it was a whole thing. Well, he was living in the future

544
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:34,876
He was from tomorrow and and the concept of couples have evolved in society's change and he was a poly got

545
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:38,956
You know as a poly thing moved past only having one partner

546
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:47,716
Was he was it just in the Disneyland proper or did he have like some girls over in Hollywood land over a California adventure?

547
00:44:47,996 --> 00:44:55,936
Who knows who knows because what the moment it like pops past like two it was like, oh you you were you were putting in work

548
00:44:55,936 --> 00:45:01,176
You're just Wow, but like it's like when when you you I would never think of it

549
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,656
But when you hear you're like damn, yeah

550
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:08,936
That would work because there's no the way the lands are separated like all the lands for the most part

551
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:15,516
Go to lunch in different places because it'd be so much work to come all the way over to Tomorrowland

552
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:23,956
So there is like no way that this person would be talking to this person in like the way the friend groups are dispersed

553
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:28,716
There's no way that they're they like they could probably openly talk about like oh, I'm dating

554
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:34,676
so and so and like it wouldn't get back because they're like right lands apart

555
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:39,736
He could have like he could have had a girl in Paradise Pier, but she's so far away

556
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,376
You know, you didn't even find out about the other girls. Yeah. Oh, yeah

557
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:45,956
might still be dating right

558
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:47,676
Still hasn't found out

559
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:51,116
No, it's changed to Pixar pier. Yeah

560
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:54,716
Wow, that's why I do Paradise Pier and Toontown

561
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:59,336
That's this far apart as the girls get boss you bookend it right and maybe a critter country

562
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:04,016
You just you know spread them through sure Wow. Wow. Wow. I don't even think about that

563
00:46:04,016 --> 00:46:08,556
Of course that happens. You get a job there. Yeah get to get to your parade. Yeah

564
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:15,196
Let's do it. Let's dive into the ride itself hista. Is it true that

565
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:23,956
Some website I saw said that with this abbreviation his stuff or any I shrunk the audience that the employees would call each other his stations

566
00:46:23,956 --> 00:46:26,816
Yeah, I don't

567
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:28,176
At all

568
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:31,236
I read it and thought that doesn't sound

569
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:36,916
Right that doesn't that seems too lame for anyone to actually that might have been before or after me

570
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:43,376
But when I was there no one referred to each other as his station his station community had disbanded

571
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:48,656
Yeah, yeah, cuz hista is short like it could see people calling each other that or saying oh I work at his stuff

572
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:55,296
But like adding station makes it long again. And at that point you may as well say the full name. Oh man

573
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:59,336
Yeah, I would have totally said don't ever call me a his station

574
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:01,776
Give me a favor. No

575
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:08,876
Were you familiar with honey? I shrunk the audience before you started work actually. Yes, so I even though I never

576
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:14,176
Experienced captain EO before it came back. I did experience hista

577
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:17,056
So I was actually kind of high because I was like, oh I kind of like that

578
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:24,496
I was not a fan of being part of astral orbiter cuz to me that was always the lamest ride in tomorrow land and

579
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:28,076
There's been people since who have taken offense to that where they're like, no

580
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:29,856
It's not and it is fun

581
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:35,396
If you have someone because it actually does when you get into it and it's moving and the fact that you can control it up

582
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:39,076
And down while you go around is actually a nice little hit

583
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:45,276
but I think when you're going up against like Nemo submarine space mountain and

584
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:51,756
I think it makes it harder buzz light year. You have a like video games starts our tour. It's a stacked land

585
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:56,756
Sure, yeah last year orbiter moved from when it was up on top of the platform

586
00:47:56,756 --> 00:48:01,836
Yeah, when it was just rocket jets you at least have okay. Well dumb bows down on the ground

587
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:04,836
Yeah rocket jets is way up here. It's a little more

588
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:10,636
Death defiant but back on the ground. I've never really understood the appeal of Astro orbiter

589
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:12,696
How do you shrink the audience though?

590
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:18,716
I don't think it dawned on me until like starting to read about the ride that it is it is book ended by

591
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:25,736
Like it replaced captain eo in all of the parks around the world Disneyland Disney World did

592
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:30,696
Tokyo Disney Disneyland Paris. So yeah a lot of the big

593
00:48:30,696 --> 00:48:32,896
parks and then

594
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:39,136
They all came back captain eo came back after Michael died. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And what a day

595
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:41,776
I'm sure I've talked about it. I got a hotel room

596
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:45,496
I made such when that log seeing that sign go back

597
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:51,176
Michael died you know, no, no, I was not celebrating Michael's death. No

598
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:56,516
But it did occur to me. It was in the back of my head on a sad day like oh, but you know what?

599
00:48:56,896 --> 00:49:00,596
I bet and sure enough a couple months later. Yeah

600
00:49:00,596 --> 00:49:04,736
Which you know, maybe I this is okay

601
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:09,996
This isn't just because it replaced captain eo or was counter to captain eo in any way

602
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:14,996
I swear that's not why but I will go ahead and say I am not a big fan of honey

603
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:19,816
I shrunk the audience I do I'm like I I found this thing

604
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:24,516
Kind of unpleasant and I sort of didn't do it past the first couple

605
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:32,616
Opportunities to do it. I will say as a child I did it at Epcot. It scared the absolute shit out of me

606
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:38,736
And I don't I think I just did it once and never did it again because I was terrified of it much like when I was

607
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:44,976
Terrified of captain eo as a child too when those monsters poked their staffs out at the screen and I had to be removed

608
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:48,576
From the theater by my mother because I was having a meltdown

609
00:49:48,576 --> 00:49:53,756
So I will go on record as saying my memory of it is oh

610
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:59,056
Shit, there's mice at my feet. This is real. Oh my god. I hate this

611
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:02,716
Yeah, so that's my memory of it and I never I

612
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:08,136
Started going but to Disneyland when I moved out here right around the time of Captain eo coming back

613
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:13,496
So this might have been still there for one or two visits, but I think I was like no

614
00:50:13,496 --> 00:50:19,836
Thank you. I will not be scared again. I I liked it cuz I like these movies

615
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:25,156
Okay, I'll say this I did not like the snake in the feet the mice I could tolerate

616
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:29,956
But when they're like, oh the snake is loose. I just did not like I didn't like the snake either

617
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:33,016
I really did not like that and even after I had done it a few times

618
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:37,756
I'm like, why do I always forget that snake is coming cuz I I I did not like it

619
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:42,316
But I as a kid I loved Rick Moranis cuz I was like sure I

620
00:50:42,516 --> 00:50:44,676
Moranis I honey I shrunk the

621
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:49,796
Kid and I remember seeing I feel like we saw an advanced screening of honey

622
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:54,236
I blew up the kid for some every now and then my dad's company would get like

623
00:50:54,236 --> 00:50:57,936
early movie preview tickets and then

624
00:50:57,936 --> 00:51:04,076
And then as him as Louis Tolley, right? That's a character in Ghostbusters. Yeah, I just loved him

625
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:08,936
Sure, I loved him but I and I'll say this I never saw the first honey

626
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:12,836
I shrunk the kids because the giant bee scared the shit out of

627
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:18,516
It and you knew it was in there I knew it was in there in the tray in the commercials and I we did not

628
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:20,336
See it. I was so scared. I did see honey

629
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:25,516
I blew up the kid cuz I big things Scott scared of big things that didn't bother me as much

630
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:29,876
Kids getting small on insects. Ooh, I hated it. We didn't see it

631
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:34,556
So I think I was even going into this still with the memory of the first movie

632
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:37,656
With like giants of I didn't even like the Playland very much

633
00:51:37,896 --> 00:51:42,096
I like the Playland. I did like the Playland loved the play. I

634
00:51:42,096 --> 00:51:46,036
Like I never had the first I don't think we had the first movie on tape

635
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,736
But I feel like all my friends had it

636
00:51:47,736 --> 00:51:50,996
So I will always end up watching it at friends houses in that first honey

637
00:51:50,996 --> 00:51:57,196
I shrunk the kids is a little unnerving the second movie. The only unnerving thing is corporate malfeasance

638
00:51:57,196 --> 00:52:00,296
Like he's trying to stay steal his inventions, right?

639
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:05,996
Well, and it's similar to it's scary in a similar way to Beethoven where there's like yes trying it

640
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:12,396
What what's the word like like it's like darts to tranquilize a dog or a baby

641
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:18,256
Like yeah, I guess I was freaked out as a kid by yeah, yeah, like scary needles and darts

642
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:23,416
Cute things and I'm trying I'm forgetting the actor's name, but he's the bad guy in Beethoven

643
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:27,416
He always played a good guy on TV, but he was a bad guy in that movie and he gets a Dean Jones

644
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:33,716
Oh, yeah, Dean Jones. Yeah, yeah mainstay Dean Jones. He's a bad guy and he gets all chest full of

645
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:37,856
Syringes at the end of Beethoven and it's terrifying

646
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:44,716
Even as a child I knew like that's justice you deserve 16 syringes

647
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:49,016
Daddy had a heart attack

648
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:55,896
Like Beethoven is pretty like oh, yeah, and also grodin falls through a skylight before that happens

649
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:57,476
Oh in Beethoven too

650
00:52:57,476 --> 00:53:03,536
so like there's a very dark ending because Beethoven is such so light and like the David Duchovny part where they like

651
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:08,896
Beethoven no, he tangles his leash around the chair and they go flying down the street

652
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:14,756
Haha at the end Charles grodin eats shit through a skylight like Raphael in the Ninja Turtle movie

653
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:22,196
And then Dean Jones takes a chest full of syringes. That's there's different shades of gray different shades of justice

654
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:24,236
Yeah, well the good news though

655
00:53:24,236 --> 00:53:31,156
I bet Dean Jones got high as shit right before he did that was like euphoria for five seconds

656
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:35,856
He was like Rush Limbaugh in his Oxycontin times a hundred

657
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:40,316
So he got it I bet he went out and it was like like it was like all the morphine in the world

658
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:43,816
Here's a bit of insight into my time scared childhood brain

659
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:48,656
And I just remembered we saw the Lassie movie in theaters, which had come out around that zone

660
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:54,096
Maybe it was like a 90s Lassie movie. Yeah, ninety-two ninety-three and I remember in the movie going

661
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:58,096
Oh here comes cuz my brain knew here comes the like climax of the movie

662
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:02,856
I didn't know it in that term, but I knew this is one like the scarier intense stuff happens

663
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,996
It didn't happen in Lassie

664
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:10,356
There was like no almost no resolution and it was just like sort of ended and I was so relieved

665
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:14,676
I remember feeling like oh the movie's gonna get like darker like scary now

666
00:54:14,676 --> 00:54:21,136
It didn't the movie was over and I was so happy that nothing dramatic happened at the end of last

667
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:28,076
Oh, that's good. I heard there's that um what a dog's journey home. It's by the same guy that new movie

668
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:30,656
It's based on a book

669
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:34,836
Written by the same guy who wrote a dog's purpose. Yes, and the new movie

670
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:37,416
I was reading an article about it and they're like in theory

671
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:42,856
This is a feel-good family movie, but a major plot point involves a corpse

672
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:48,236
I'm like, whoa, what is yeah, what exactly is this movie? Oh, no

673
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:54,996
They also in the trailer give it away that the dog gets home. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed I was like what why?

674
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:57,516
Attempt to journey home

675
00:54:57,516 --> 00:55:03,896
Unless there's like an addendum to that where like the dog gets a bunch of needles in the chest

676
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:10,236
How weird would it be that this was like some fever dream and the dog wakes up and was like you didn't make it home

677
00:55:10,236 --> 00:55:14,296
Yeah, he's in like a kennel somewhere in the south or something. You are a corpse

678
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:15,376
Yeah, do you remember?

679
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:19,336
I always ask any group of people around my age about this commercial

680
00:55:19,336 --> 00:55:23,876
Because it happened once in the middle of the night when I was watching MTV

681
00:55:23,896 --> 00:55:28,396
I never saw it again. I always google it every now and then I could never find it

682
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:29,776
but there was a

683
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,536
Like it must have been Peter or something

684
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:38,076
but it was a commercial about like putting your dog in the cages the doggy cages and then like it was like

685
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:42,816
It's this like woman and she's like looking at her dog and she's like, you're my best friend

686
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:46,116
she was like I hope that if

687
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:49,876
If the like something like I hope like if the roles were

688
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:55,656
You treat me the same or something like that and then it just cuts to her in a cage

689
00:55:55,656 --> 00:56:01,556
Freaking out and it's fucked with me for so long because it's like she's like

690
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:09,256
Like screaming for her life and no one's ever seen that commercial but me. What is it a commercial for? Yeah

691
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:11,016
dog in a cage

692
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:13,976
Be like

693
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:19,036
What was it liquid television was that that was the shorts the weird shorts on MTV

694
00:56:19,036 --> 00:56:22,976
That could have just been a liquid television. No, that could be true

695
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:32,136
There is like as much as everything's documented on the internet a ton of stuff isn't yeah like there that rare

696
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:38,836
Like somebody was just telling me that I think it was little Debbie made something called like a tiger

697
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:44,076
Cake or something and it was like it looked like a tiger and I was like I've never heard of that or whatever

698
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:44,916
And he's like it exists

699
00:56:46,356 --> 00:56:51,436
Nothing shows up and then you I did some digging and on a Facebook page official little Debbie page

700
00:56:51,436 --> 00:56:54,396
It was like yes, we did have like people were asking questions

701
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:57,436
They're like yes, we did have this product in the 90s

702
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:02,416
But there's not a picture of it and I was shocked that there wouldn't be one picture of a product from the 90s

703
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,876
So like there's plenty of stuff

704
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:11,436
I feel like out there like a little very large product line a lot of variations seasonal variations, you know

705
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:13,696
You're like complicated things get lost

706
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:19,196
You feel very I know you you are sort of lobbying for a PR job at little Debbie

707
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:24,396
Well, I would just like because I mean you can get little Debbie's in Southern, California, but back east

708
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:31,036
I feel like there's a lot more variety of little Debbie's available. So I would like oh you mean little Debbie had more products in the east

709
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:37,056
Yeah, and a lot more like convenience store like single serving versions of those products

710
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:41,716
I feel like you just get the hits out here. You also had like Drake's caught like Drake's cake

711
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:47,116
Yeah, Drake's coffee cakes and that sort of thing. All right. Well, let's talk about

712
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:52,956
Too much, yeah

713
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:57,776
Comfortable with it. I just want to make sure we hit all the points cuz we've all case

714
00:57:57,776 --> 00:58:02,756
So we've established if he did you like the ride or the juice into the show? Oh, yeah, I loved it

715
00:58:02,756 --> 00:58:05,536
I when I was a kid, I loved the show. I thought it was fun

716
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:10,276
You know, I was I was big in 40 I liked Shrek 4d I like to be sure

717
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:15,316
So yeah, no, I never got scared and I was a scaredy-cat

718
00:58:15,316 --> 00:58:20,016
But I think I was just so into the experience that did you like the movies? Did you see the movies?

719
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:23,736
Yeah, I saw honey. I blew up the kid honey. I shrunk the kids, you know

720
00:58:23,736 --> 00:58:30,496
I did also think the bee the bee was weird. Actually the thing that was weird to me than the bee was the ant

721
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:33,196
I don't like that ant up close

722
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:42,016
Yeah, it's marked and it's supposed to be a sad moment I was like good riddance stay dead

723
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:47,316
Don't ever come back into my life again. Oh my gosh. It was so gross and he flew. Oh

724
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:54,196
Yeah, so that so yeah, so we have two likers and two haters sort of of the riotous kids at least

725
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:57,736
Yeah, I liked them. I liked the movies. I was a big fan of blew up the kid

726
00:58:57,736 --> 00:58:59,696
Uh-huh, I like the blew up the kid fine

727
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:04,576
So sad when he touches that guitar and it shocks him

728
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:10,976
Oh, yeah starts crying like that made me so sad. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. That is very upsetting

729
00:59:10,976 --> 00:59:17,556
Well, so this I always like to talk personnel here comes Scott's dry facts the personnel

730
00:59:17,556 --> 00:59:20,696
It's right. Yeah. Yeah. This movie was honey

731
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:25,716
I think the audience was directed by the same director as honey. I blew up the kid

732
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:31,736
So he stayed in the family. You know, he knows the French as he knows Wayne Zelinski's voice

733
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:35,036
Also do honey we shrunk ourselves the direct

734
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:39,276
I'll get to that. Okay, let me take you through the honey

735
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:45,796
I shrunk a verse in terms of a directorial staff Randall Kleisner or not Kleisner Kleiser

736
00:59:45,796 --> 00:59:48,156
crazy filmography, let me list his

737
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:49,356
I

738
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:56,016
Put this down to yeah, so really odd ones. So before honey, I should blew up the kid. He did Greece

739
00:59:56,016 --> 01:00:02,316
This is the director of Greece. Oh, it's kind of crazy. You don't think more about who directed Greece, but it's this guy Randall Kleiser

740
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:06,516
Blue Lagoon was him flight of the Navigator

741
01:00:06,516 --> 01:00:11,536
Big Top Pee-wee and then two of the most notoriously odd

742
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:19,176
TV movies of the 70s Don portrait of a teenage runaway with Eve plum from the Brady Bunch and

743
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:24,576
Boy in the plastic bubble with John Travolta. So Greece was his second Travolta joint

744
01:00:24,576 --> 01:00:28,036
and then he did honey, I blew up the kid now the

745
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:32,956
but the most impressive name in the list of worked on this probably is

746
01:00:32,956 --> 01:00:39,536
Dean Cundy who who shot it Dean Cundy was the DP. Did you guys know Dean Cundy's name?

747
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,176
I did often

748
01:00:41,176 --> 01:00:50,156
His the list of the films he is shot Halloween escape from New York the thing he did all the Carpenters all

749
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:57,276
Three back to the futures Wow big trouble in Little China who friend Roger Rabbit hook the Flintstones Casper

750
01:00:57,276 --> 01:01:04,836
Apollo 13 and Jurassic Park all shot by the same guy who also did the 3d spectacle

751
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:07,696
Honey, honey, I shrunk the audience

752
01:01:09,076 --> 01:01:14,096
Then with his honey experience he went on to make his

753
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:21,556
Directorial debut with honey we shrunk ourselves and past that point his filmography

754
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:26,336
Gets really odd and spotty. It says it feels like honey like cursed him

755
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:32,736
So he went on to shoot Garfield both Garfield's he shot one of the worst films

756
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,036
I've ever seen which is this Reese Witherspoon

757
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:42,276
From a couple years ago that has this bland title. I can't even remember. It's really it's done by the kid of

758
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:45,296
Who's the like rom-com? Oh?

759
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:50,616
Is it Nancy Meyers is kid? Yes? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, see Meyers is kid directed this movie

760
01:01:50,616 --> 01:01:56,636
I think I specifically horribly shot and you look up who shot this thing. It's like shaky and badly lit

761
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:59,116
Oh the DP of Jurassic Park

762
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:06,096
Like what a strange answer I'm not gonna lie I think I put myself on tape for that movie hey

763
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:10,216
I think that was a weird submission that came through UCB

764
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:16,236
And I was and and it said the name of the director and it specifically said like

765
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:19,216
Child of Nancy Mott, and I'm like what he listed it in the hell

766
01:02:19,216 --> 01:02:26,496
Just tape yourself or maybe I googled it and and the Hollywood Reporter article just kept mentioning child of Nancy Meyers child of Nancy

767
01:02:26,596 --> 01:02:28,176
I wish you'd been in this

768
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:38,356
Let me also say about honey we shrunk ourselves the forgotten piece of this this was a TV movie for like Wonderful World Disney

769
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:43,776
That oddly was written by Joel Hodgson of oh yeah, it's theater fame and Nell

770
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:51,576
Scoville who oh the letter wait letterman and like like one of the only letterman and Simpsons female writers

771
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:56,376
Yeah, I think she has a book out that's supposed to be pretty like she has a crazy like story

772
01:02:56,376 --> 01:03:01,516
Her career she's worked on so many huge things sure sure and then but my the best fact about

773
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:05,656
Honey, we shrunk ourselves and probably the main reason to revisit it is it features a performance by?

774
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:12,216
Allison Mack perhaps better known as pimp Mac one of the leaders of the Nixxiom sex cult

775
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:16,936
How do you however you say that NX IV? Yeah, from Smallville

776
01:03:16,936 --> 01:03:20,516
Yes on her rise to become pimp Mac

777
01:03:20,516 --> 01:03:23,836
Is that what they called her in the cult? Yes?

778
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:25,636
Okay all the women

779
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:32,276
And they got branded a symbol that was like if you looked at it if you thought about what the symbol was it was the

780
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:35,156
Initials of the leader of the thing and then a am

781
01:03:35,156 --> 01:03:37,236
for Alice and Mac

782
01:03:37,236 --> 01:03:40,376
But she's also part of this wonderful

783
01:03:40,376 --> 01:03:42,796
franchise the honey franchise

784
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:46,736
Anyway like top-tier talent and then the other one writer

785
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:50,736
Oh the writer well the Muppet guy Bill

786
01:03:51,056 --> 01:03:57,636
Brady Big Bang Theory the co-creator of the Big Bang Theory wrote honey, we're gonna shrunk the audience

787
01:03:57,636 --> 01:04:04,056
Who also went on to create the recent Muppet show on ABC and he wrote Muppet vision 3d

788
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:10,996
It seems like the movie version of the ball in Space Jam where the mom stars steal the power because it seems like he came

789
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:13,076
in and after that

790
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:19,356
Wildly successful and everyone else is as dark turns and he read Dean Conde

791
01:04:19,676 --> 01:04:24,596
Still all the magic everyone before I know this is weird, but can we touch the script?

792
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,676
Hands on everyone

793
01:04:28,676 --> 01:04:36,016
Moranis hasn't done a movie. Oh, that's true. Yeah, one of the last on-screen performances of

794
01:04:36,016 --> 01:04:38,476
Moranis, but also but another guy who got a lot of power

795
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:43,296
After making this thing the pre-show was shot by Peyton Reed. Oh, yeah

796
01:04:44,016 --> 01:04:47,676
Eventual director of Ant-Man and presumably he's oh he already is

797
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:51,416
I think he was involved in what they shot for Hong Kong Disneyland for Ant-Man

798
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:56,496
And presumably will be in any other attractions they do and rumors have been it's possible that

799
01:04:56,496 --> 01:05:01,956
These theaters where honey has shrunk the audience once played will be home to some Ant-Man attraction down the line

800
01:05:01,956 --> 01:05:08,416
So he was so this is Peyton Reed and shrinking well before his

801
01:05:08,776 --> 01:05:12,276
Famous shrinking work and not his first theme park thing, right?

802
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:16,156
Didn't he shoot also the future of the ride the pre-show

803
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:21,836
He shot the pre-show of this and back to the future both of which are at institutes

804
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:26,676
And both of which are like high jinx and like long like it's more like broadcast camera

805
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:31,916
like people scurrying down hallways and trying to solve mix-ups, so

806
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,376
Yeah, there's there's a big commonality

807
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:40,396
Which is a funny thing that in if you view all of theme park world as one big narrative that there's the

808
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:43,616
Imagination Institute and the Institute of Future Technology

809
01:05:43,616 --> 01:05:51,836
These are different things, but they both have open houses and invite people to come participate in their chaos 24-7

810
01:05:51,836 --> 01:05:58,696
Yeah, well, we're just that one day that they happen to invite sure Joe Schmoe and to check it out. Yeah

811
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:02,496
Which by the way, so that's the like

812
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:09,216
The convoluted nature of the plot of this thing it is the open house of the Institute

813
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:13,756
While an award show during the inventor of the year

814
01:06:13,756 --> 01:06:17,536
It is both an award show and an open house kind of a hat on a hat

815
01:06:17,536 --> 01:06:21,636
Situation kind of two weird things going on that sure they needed both of them

816
01:06:21,636 --> 01:06:25,096
And also if you're gonna open an Institute within a theme park

817
01:06:25,096 --> 01:06:30,136
Just get like you need to know people are gonna be there and you need to prepare and you need to be safe

818
01:06:30,256 --> 01:06:36,016
Like how is it catching them off guard that all these people all these regular people are flooding into the audience, right?

819
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:41,076
And it's not like Wayne Zelinski isn't a madman before this in canon

820
01:06:41,076 --> 01:06:46,276
It's always chaos as Nigel Channing is reminded with newspaper headlines

821
01:06:46,276 --> 01:06:52,296
He was so much chaos on this earth. Oh, everyone should have known this was gonna happen

822
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:58,556
Yeah, I have to say I want to know how dr. Nigel Channing got this job because he seems to resent

823
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:00,976
Imagination

824
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:03,496
In both because he shows up

825
01:07:03,496 --> 01:07:06,096
if you don't know if you've ever ridden the

826
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:07,496
journey into

827
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:11,996
Your imagination the the second generation of this Epcot ride

828
01:07:11,996 --> 01:07:17,136
Where the same Eric Idle character shows up and interacts with the character, you know about this

829
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:21,996
No, there's a separate ride that's only an Epcot with the same Eric Idle

830
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,796
Really character and it is considered to be one of the worst rides

831
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:29,356
People hate it because they love the original and this one sucks

832
01:07:29,356 --> 01:07:36,796
Yeah, and he is so annoyed by a whimsical creature. You know figment that little purple dragon. Okay, that was the original

833
01:07:36,796 --> 01:07:42,156
he's still on the ride the character but like the original was like this whimsical Dreamfinder man and

834
01:07:42,156 --> 01:07:48,176
Imagination and there's a flying contraption and the newer version is like a very like sterile

835
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:52,596
Like figment trying to explain to Eric Idle why how smells were yeah

836
01:07:53,196 --> 01:08:01,096
Toilet stuck to the ceiling and it's like weird and it's very 90s of like stodgy guy comes around at the end

837
01:08:01,096 --> 01:08:02,656
like a

838
01:08:02,656 --> 01:08:05,856
Yeah, I don't know Mrs. Doubtfire s kind of plot

839
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:12,176
Right and it's just it sucks and everyone knows it sucks the creator of the original ride hates it

840
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:17,476
Publicly talk shit about it with us on our podcast. We knew him. Yeah, he was like

841
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:19,876
I don't know how a toilet on the ceiling is

842
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:31,476
But it was so they must have thought it's Nigel Channing mania when this ride opened we got to get more Channing in the parks

843
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:36,376
Did you ever see people wearing Nigel Channing shirts Channing his name?

844
01:08:37,556 --> 01:08:39,096
Not at all

845
01:08:39,096 --> 01:08:41,316
Not a lot of merchandise

846
01:08:41,316 --> 01:08:44,236
Need more Nigel merchandise

847
01:08:44,236 --> 01:08:48,476
We really are slacking on that front. There's not a park star of Nigel

848
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:51,516
There is not a park star of Nigel the way we work though

849
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:55,156
I feel like if there was some Nigel merch would be like, oh shit. Did you see that Nigel merch?

850
01:08:55,436 --> 01:08:58,856
That's a pretty good shirt. No, you'd be like, oh, yeah, we got to get that Nigel Channing shirt

851
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:05,496
So like they're missing out. Yeah, I'm doing that. Yeah, why is he so why is such a fuss budget in charge?

852
01:09:05,636 --> 01:09:09,896
Yeah nation Institute and also like if he's such a pain in the ass character

853
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:15,356
Why was he in two rides? I could see putting figment in two rides figments awesome. He's a

854
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:23,536
Imaginative little dragon you love him. You want to buy a doll of him Nigel chant. What the hell like why I it's weird

855
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:28,096
It's a weird choice. It's fun that they're connected. It's fun that there he's in two different rides

856
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:32,976
He just had a weird contract. He was like if I do one Disney movie, I must do another

857
01:09:32,976 --> 01:09:44,156
Question I have for you is and the big thing I think about with anybody works at a theme park is is repetition

858
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:50,876
Were you be you were like leading people in and out of this movie many times a day every day

859
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:57,016
Like were you being were you driven mad by hearing the same dialogue the same?

860
01:09:57,196 --> 01:10:00,716
I don't know how if you had to stay and listen to know you didn't have to stay and listen

861
01:10:00,716 --> 01:10:05,996
What you would do is after like because you know, like I said when I was hyped

862
01:10:05,996 --> 01:10:10,676
I was in there watching and I was like, okay cool and I would try and like run up

863
01:10:10,676 --> 01:10:13,656
Frazzled where it's like, oh sorry about that

864
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,596
Once you get used to it

865
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:22,656
you're like outside talking to the exit point guy and chatting it out and then like listening for it and then like you'll peek in and

866
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:25,016
Like okay, it's about to end and then you run up and do it

867
01:10:25,016 --> 01:10:30,436
Okay, so you didn't have to like you weren't on the other end where you have to hear like hello and welcome

868
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:32,616
Yeah, you weren't like hearing that

869
01:10:32,616 --> 01:10:36,856
rant every day not random a little same bit of dialogue every day

870
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:43,016
Okay, what about music like were you in some hallway where you had to hear done done done done done?

871
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:50,496
Yeah, that yeah that one you you especially if you were in the front you were constantly hearing that and that would get kind of old

872
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:58,576
But like you're also being at the front you're constantly being inundated by questions. I it's so funny, too. I'll never

873
01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:06,496
Forget where like this like I was there on my day off and like this guy just like

874
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:13,116
Asking the cast member questions and I was like and it was really just like like I was like just talking to him

875
01:11:13,116 --> 01:11:16,576
But I was like answering the questions and he's like, yeah

876
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:22,156
Uh, I'm I want the cast member to answer answer it and like I had to stop myself because I was like

877
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:23,756
I was like gonna be like bitch

878
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:28,776
I am a cast member was like one like I can't sass him and then in the same sentence be like

879
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:30,816
Oh, I work here you dumbass

880
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:34,396
Hey, you buddy. Yeah. Fuck you you asshole

881
01:11:34,976 --> 01:11:37,636
Employee ID badge. Yeah. Yeah, like

882
01:11:37,636 --> 01:11:44,136
So so I had to like eat it, but I remember being so annoyed but then being like, oh, yeah from his perspective

883
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:50,796
I'm just some Disney super fan who's just like trying to answer all of his questions. So

884
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:56,276
And so like at the time I just didn't think to be like, oh no, it's my day off

885
01:11:56,276 --> 01:12:00,176
I work here and he's kind of busy because it was the thing of like

886
01:12:00,756 --> 01:12:08,756
Whereas like you're you being a co-worker you're like, oh this guy's being annoying and like inundating you with simple questions

887
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:13,016
While you're also trying to cuz it was also like right before show was going in

888
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:16,856
So he's trying to hand out stuff and he's like just hounding him for questions

889
01:12:16,856 --> 01:12:22,836
So I was just trying to help so it was so like it was like this weird mixed emotion where like I saw where he

890
01:12:22,836 --> 01:12:26,576
Was coming from but also like I also know from my

891
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:34,156
Friends perspective he's being asked an asshole and then me my personal pride of like this dick dad

892
01:12:34,156 --> 01:12:38,056
like sassing me like it was just so many emotions and

893
01:12:38,056 --> 01:12:41,396
I I think I just like walked away

894
01:12:41,396 --> 01:12:48,136
I think that was my solution or like I I did like I I did like a flex where like I

895
01:12:48,136 --> 01:12:50,236
Walked back state like in

896
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:52,196
Oh

897
01:12:52,196 --> 01:12:54,916
To subtly give him the information. Yeah to be like, yeah

898
01:12:54,916 --> 01:13:01,276
No, I or like did something or being like oh it's so until here cuz I start like just to like

899
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:05,916
Tip him off without trying to be too aggro, but it was like funny

900
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,656
Where it's like, oh, yeah

901
01:13:07,656 --> 01:13:15,296
when you're not in the because and that the I think the core that story was like I didn't know what I was doing because

902
01:13:15,296 --> 01:13:19,296
When you work there whether you're in your outfit or not

903
01:13:19,296 --> 01:13:24,076
You are still essentially a cast member because it still turns on and you still have that

904
01:13:24,076 --> 01:13:28,436
Eagerness of being like oh, I'm gonna give you the information you're asking for right?

905
01:13:28,656 --> 01:13:34,616
but like it's like it's like, you know the a more wholesome version of like

906
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:37,476
Cop who's off duty, you know?

907
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:41,996
I'm still do my job, but I'm technically not on the job

908
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:45,256
I remember being at the container store when I didn't work

909
01:13:45,256 --> 01:13:46,436
I was working there at the time

910
01:13:46,436 --> 01:13:51,936
But I wasn't on the shift and people would still ask me stuff because I had the air about me

911
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:56,856
Yeah, I knew what I was doing. So I would still answer and I'd be like, oh, I just trying to get through here

912
01:13:56,856 --> 01:14:02,536
But then I'm secretly I'm like, they know I feel like this is where I belong and you would just hang out because

913
01:14:02,536 --> 01:14:05,616
Stores cool place to hang out. Yeah

914
01:14:08,476 --> 01:14:08,936
I

915
01:14:08,936 --> 01:14:10,856
Big beer outside of the container store

916
01:14:10,856 --> 01:14:13,396
About closet planning

917
01:14:13,396 --> 01:14:19,276
For all my magazines in the bookshelf and no magazine. They're never gonna get out of the wrapping

918
01:14:19,276 --> 01:14:23,596
You know if you think about it a beer can is a container. Yeah

919
01:14:23,596 --> 01:14:29,376
Wow, man, I never thought of it that way Mike. Yeah, that's fucking cool. Wow. It's still funny

920
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:32,236
The fifth time you told that joke Mike

921
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:38,356
I'm punishing Mike with my joke. I'm putting this in your mouth. Fuck you Michael

922
01:14:38,356 --> 01:14:42,296
Dare you say a beer cans a container? I'll take it. I deserve it

923
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:46,776
Let me ask when you were working there any famous people

924
01:14:46,776 --> 01:14:50,676
Did you see any famous people enjoying this show while you were a cast member?

925
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:56,316
Uh, I not anyone enjoying our show there has never been a single

926
01:14:56,656 --> 01:14:59,436
Famous person to go through our ride

927
01:14:59,436 --> 01:15:04,916
But but but like Nemo just came so we heard of lots of famous people going

928
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:12,196
Over and seeing I'm trying to think of some I believe there was once a red hot chili pepper

929
01:15:12,196 --> 01:15:13,996
We were real excited about

930
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:16,836
when Stephanie sure

931
01:15:16,836 --> 01:15:18,116
and

932
01:15:18,116 --> 01:15:21,296
Those are the first ones that pop into my mind

933
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:27,356
Were you working in Tomorrowland when the red hot chili peppers music was on Space Mountain and California Screamin

934
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:31,076
Do you know I'm talking about? No, I don't there was a year or so where

935
01:15:31,076 --> 01:15:37,296
Their cover of higher ground was on Space Mountain and around the world was on California Screamin

936
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:39,976
Not because I would definitely remember that damn

937
01:15:39,976 --> 01:15:44,556
I was gonna say I'd be very magical like summer the buzzing of people like oh my god

938
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:48,556
Did you hear the red hot chili peppers are coming to and it was it was bizarre too?

939
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:51,296
Right when those songs came out years later

940
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:56,476
Yeah, I also didn't know they did a cover of higher ground that was news to me

941
01:15:56,476 --> 01:16:01,236
Well, I was a chili peppers fan as a youth so I knew all about higher ground

942
01:16:01,236 --> 01:16:04,376
I probably heard it before the Stevie Wonder version

943
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:10,516
You know what they need to do is because I was I took my very first right not to brag

944
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:16,476
I took my very first ride on the Golden Zephyr a rarely open ride in California Adventure

945
01:16:16,576 --> 01:16:21,736
Which for any Astro orbiters fans out there is a ride that goes round and round and then stops

946
01:16:21,736 --> 01:16:27,496
What a blast but I was in my head playing the song right away

947
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:36,216
That's what they need they need to bring the red hot chili peppers back and put it in that ride and then I think the

948
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:40,276
Lines out the door I put that right a bit about this effort

949
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:47,776
So what I was dating like sorry the lines just we got to get going we can't we were leaving the park lines too long

950
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:51,356
For Zephyr. It's now it's two hours for Zephyr

951
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:55,196
Maybe next time and really want to get on that Zephyr

952
01:16:55,196 --> 01:17:00,796
someday there was source for Zephyr jokes, I will have a

953
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:07,956
Weekly platform for Zephyr jokes. I mean we all have it now. We're gonna do an episode. That's two hours long on the Golden Zephyr

954
01:17:08,736 --> 01:17:13,936
Actually there is because it is modeled after an older like an original generation

955
01:17:13,936 --> 01:17:19,576
Model on an older generation

956
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:24,676
I'm in for two hours. Well, you know, there actually is two hours of material

957
01:17:24,676 --> 01:17:31,576
Yeah, no seriously at least two hours if the gold not more, you know

958
01:17:34,936 --> 01:17:35,456
You

959
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:40,316
Know what someone put me on a California adventure that I would have never went until like someone

960
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:44,176
Was like you should check it out was the Aladdin show

961
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:48,476
Into the right man. Yeah, it's a really good

962
01:17:48,476 --> 01:17:53,916
I was like this is like a really good show that's just hidden here that you would not think to go

963
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:59,716
You know, it's like uh-huh almost like you would think you'd see it at any other like play, you know

964
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,296
Broadway caliber. Yeah

965
01:18:01,296 --> 01:18:04,576
Like I didn't want to give it the full endorsement set

966
01:18:04,576 --> 01:18:10,236
You know in case some listeners are Broadway heads and scoff at me, but yeah a Broadway caliber show

967
01:18:10,236 --> 01:18:15,416
Yeah, 50 minute show and you get topical jokes galore. Yes

968
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:17,356
Kills every time

969
01:18:17,356 --> 01:18:25,016
I've seen it probably ten times. It's all it's gone now. It's frozen now. Really? Yeah, and there's no missing all those genie

970
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:27,936
Donald Trump jokes. Yes. Well, he couldn't do Trump probably

971
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:32,396
I was joking remember I when I was working

972
01:18:32,396 --> 01:18:39,776
It was the Super Bowl and we couldn't even ask people what the score was like they're like you cannot ask people you can't like

973
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:44,836
If someone was wearing like a team you couldn't be like go

974
01:18:44,836 --> 01:18:51,316
Like you had like you couldn't because in the concept was was that when people are in Disneyland

975
01:18:51,316 --> 01:18:55,236
You want them to be immersed in Disneyland? You want them to forget about the outside?

976
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:59,476
You could not exist yeah, you could not talk about

977
01:18:59,476 --> 01:19:04,336
Super Bowl at all, but Jeannie could get away with like a dr. Phil impression

978
01:19:04,336 --> 01:19:10,636
Yeah, you could get away with snooki joke. Yeah get away with the joke about Angelina Jolie's leg from the Oscars

979
01:19:10,636 --> 01:19:15,316
I saw all three of those the dr. Phil. Wait, you mean when she like

980
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:20,336
Stuck her leg out in kind of a strut pose and then he did that Jim rash

981
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:25,716
Right after her and he did the same pose. Yes, Jeannie was there was a joke about that. Yes

982
01:19:25,716 --> 01:19:28,236
Yeah, we would go that this is a side note

983
01:19:28,236 --> 01:19:33,976
Obviously we I would when I say we would go I would force Lindsey to go or whoever was with I go

984
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:38,416
I want to see what topical jokes he's gonna do today and like that's one of the big ones who are like

985
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:45,756
Jeannie did Angelina Jolie's leg joke like I wanted to see how obscure he could get and I think that was maybe the most obscure

986
01:19:45,756 --> 01:19:49,696
That was the most I think Jeannie would have a tough time in 2019

987
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:56,716
Because what material is out there that's okay. He can't do Trump. He can't do Kevin Hart. He can't do Louie

988
01:19:56,716 --> 01:20:07,336
He there's no story in the world that you could that the Jeannie could make fun of it's just dabbing. He would just be dabbing

989
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:13,096
So where are we dropping boys he would floss probably and get just a standing ovation

990
01:20:13,096 --> 01:20:16,996
Yeah, it would just people go nuts crying like in the Michael

991
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:20,316
Jordan Michael Jackson concert montages

992
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:25,836
He would do Justin Bieber stuff that would kill all the time or just still oh I

993
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:27,856
Probably still today. He would do he would

994
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:32,656
Dr. Phil he would I could go on and on about this

995
01:20:32,656 --> 01:20:37,376
But he would do a when he would list what he couldn't couldn't do with his wishes

996
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:44,376
He would say and I can't bring people back from the day. He would do the dr. Phil voice

997
01:20:45,136 --> 01:20:48,856
For some reason during that part and then like announced kind of like that

998
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:52,916
He was dr. Phil or something and the audience would think that was great. I'm dr

999
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:58,056
Phil he would say he would there was a couple where he would just be like something something something also like

1000
01:20:58,056 --> 01:21:03,216
Snooki and he like look out at the audience and say Snooki, you know

1001
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:10,256
What and then everyone everyone I would always bring would just look at me like horrified during this part of this and I'd be like

1002
01:21:11,856 --> 01:21:12,416
Great

1003
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:16,936
Anyway, that's that is two hours for sure that episode. Yeah, that was gonna go and go

1004
01:21:16,936 --> 01:21:22,276
Oh, but look at that. This is I mean with a live a breathing apparatus

1005
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:27,496
Like the Aladdin show you can change up that material the set movie

1006
01:21:27,496 --> 01:21:33,836
Honey, I shrunk the audience trots out its jokes over and over to where I did it once or twice

1007
01:21:33,836 --> 01:21:36,456
Never needed to do it again when Wayne's

1008
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:42,816
In the flying machine and then he crashes it into the inventor of the year sign and then the letters form nerd

1009
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:46,536
That's not funny more than once. I don't think was it

1010
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:48,536
It's not that funny

1011
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:53,876
It was the 90s when like you could make fun of nerds or that was more of a really dates it

1012
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:58,236
Yeah, the idea of nerd like your podcast is called nerd deficit

1013
01:21:58,236 --> 01:22:01,936
But it's like the word nerd doesn't mean what it meant in the night

1014
01:22:02,576 --> 01:22:08,476
It just means you're a pop culture enthusiast essentially that's really what it means in the old days it was like a cool down

1015
01:22:08,476 --> 01:22:10,136
But that was so yeah

1016
01:22:10,136 --> 01:22:14,676
So at the time because even at the time I was like didn't think it was that funny because I was like

1017
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:19,776
I'm kind of like nerd. I like Dexman. So it's a science institute. So like yeah

1018
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:29,036
And Wayne Zelinski if he existed in the real world's like true the greatest inventor of the century

1019
01:22:29,276 --> 01:22:36,096
Is you know messy results great family he'd be like Elon Musk or something now but better

1020
01:22:36,096 --> 01:22:43,316
I mean, it's just like he is a different you know, he would suck on Twitter Wayne Zelinski would just be awful on Twitter

1021
01:22:43,316 --> 01:22:46,136
Zolinski called me a cuck

1022
01:22:46,136 --> 01:22:51,536
In terms of repeating movie like rewatching movies in the parks

1023
01:22:51,536 --> 01:22:59,016
I will say like as a kid I was totally gay like I would rewatch the same movies and cartoons over and over

1024
01:22:59,156 --> 01:23:05,676
Again, so I didn't really think about like oh, we're gonna watch Muppets Muppets 3d again. I'm like no, we're here today

1025
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:09,836
We're gonna do it or we're at Epcot. We're gonna let's rewatch

1026
01:23:09,836 --> 01:23:16,716
Yeah, we must say it says you to your beleaguered parents again. Yes, we're here

1027
01:23:16,716 --> 01:23:17,536
We're gonna do it

1028
01:23:17,536 --> 01:23:21,556
Well in Florida a movie where it's dark and air-conditioned

1029
01:23:21,556 --> 01:23:27,136
Parents like that you can get a few little you know some winks and get a little nap in very good point

1030
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:31,436
But harder to do when the floor is vibrating and there's mice

1031
01:23:31,436 --> 01:23:34,336
Zipping around your leg like that all makes

1032
01:23:34,336 --> 01:23:41,976
All those things make this a tougher proposition. I don't ever do I mean there well, you can't do either of them now really

1033
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,376
I don't do

1034
01:23:43,376 --> 01:23:47,216
The honey I shrunk and I don't do tough to be a bug

1035
01:23:47,216 --> 01:23:52,896
So I don't like all those little vibrates and you said the thing I think which I had the same thing

1036
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:56,416
I hated when it would poke you in the back. It scared me like the

1037
01:23:56,416 --> 01:24:03,036
Yeah, I didn't like that. I'm I'm better about it now Shrek 4d pokes you in the back too

1038
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:09,316
Which I got used to it on Shrek 4d. Yeah, I like I like the little nice in the snake. You're like

1039
01:24:09,316 --> 01:24:17,316
It's fine with it. Now. There's a version of it on the mummy at Universal. I can handle it now, but on the ride on the ride

1040
01:24:17,316 --> 01:24:18,816
Yeah, the scarabs

1041
01:24:19,336 --> 01:24:25,536
The one thing I don't like that gets me is the like darts and indie like because I'm like, oh really

1042
01:24:25,536 --> 01:24:30,796
Yeah, it's like yeah, I'm not getting shot. But if air gets in my eye does kind of bug me

1043
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:37,776
Yeah, there's a ripoff of Soren in Canada that I went on and fly over Canada

1044
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:42,836
That has way more like blast and stuff in your face and it fucked up my wife's eye

1045
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:49,716
Like her like I really hurt she's like digging shit out of her contact no an hour after it was terrible

1046
01:24:49,716 --> 01:24:56,416
Well, I have definitely gotten ash in my eye from either phantasmag or the firework. Like I have definitely gotten like

1047
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:57,776
explosion debris

1048
01:24:57,776 --> 01:25:00,476
It was funny during Christmas when

1049
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:02,436
They make it snow

1050
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:06,856
That was always cool seeing the kids be excited because like I'd love to do that parade

1051
01:25:06,856 --> 01:25:12,516
But then there's a point where like kids would start trying to put their tongue. I was like no that's so don't

1052
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:19,536
It's not like not bag. It doesn't like it. Yeah. Yeah, it's also that we're shooting out. Do not put it on your tongue

1053
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:26,356
When you were standing outside as the show was going on could you track how far along it was by like our first scream?

1054
01:25:26,396 --> 01:25:32,536
That's the mice does that feel not even by the screams, but the big sounds are like boom. Okay, you know, it's a sign boom

1055
01:25:32,536 --> 01:25:38,756
Okay, I guess and you can hear that last like zap when he brings everyone to regular size

1056
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:42,996
It's like really loud would the show play

1057
01:25:42,996 --> 01:25:48,536
Pretty much the same way with most crowds like was there ever a variation where you're like, holy shit

1058
01:25:48,536 --> 01:25:51,316
This is really plain like they're laughing at everything or they're oh, yeah

1059
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:56,316
There were times like where like it's crushing and you're like damn. Okay, I guess this is a group of people

1060
01:25:56,316 --> 01:26:00,036
We've never say right but 90% of the time like silence

1061
01:26:00,036 --> 01:26:06,256
Yeah, it was pretty much like, you know, just slight chuckles people doing it because you know, they're like, yeah

1062
01:26:06,496 --> 01:26:12,596
Doing it like there were like APs who were like, yeah. No, this is this is my jam I go

1063
01:26:12,596 --> 01:26:16,876
APs I've like grew to hate they're just so

1064
01:26:16,876 --> 01:26:24,416
Just cuz like they like they never approach the park with considering the fact

1065
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,176
They're like, oh, I will be back here soon

1066
01:26:26,176 --> 01:26:30,676
This is this is that I can come back as much as I want as opposed to sometimes

1067
01:26:30,676 --> 01:26:37,216
This is someone's only chance to come to Disneyland maybe in years and I would see it someone I went to

1068
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:41,776
interventions cuz like my girlfriend at the time that's where she worked and

1069
01:26:41,776 --> 01:26:43,656
We would drive

1070
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:47,536
Home together so to kill time. I would just go there and play rock band or something

1071
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:52,136
You didn't you didn't have somebody else in critter country or in?

1072
01:26:53,276 --> 01:26:54,276
Yeah

1073
01:26:54,276 --> 01:27:00,656
so and it was it was crazy too because so Disney has this

1074
01:27:02,336 --> 01:27:02,196
like program

1075
01:27:02,196 --> 01:27:04,356
where like

1076
01:27:04,356 --> 01:27:06,676
People from college get to work over the summer

1077
01:27:06,676 --> 01:27:12,436
Yeah, and then they go and that's when I first met her and I have like the biggest crush on her in the world

1078
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:18,436
but I was like a little wimp I'd never wanted to tell her and she went back to college and I was just

1079
01:27:18,436 --> 01:27:24,916
Pined over her for so long. I was losing like I would just go like this back in my space

1080
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:29,296
I'd go to her my space and be like, let me see what she's up to. She's in college right now

1081
01:27:29,716 --> 01:27:35,796
Man she's living it up and then like she like came back to

1082
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:43,136
LA and I like lost my mind and so she was at Disneyland and I had an annual pass. I wasn't working there anymore

1083
01:27:43,136 --> 01:27:48,176
But like I was so I I would meet up with her there and wait for her

1084
01:27:48,176 --> 01:27:54,916
But like I remember sitting there and I was watching it was one of those connect games and there was this like

1085
01:27:54,916 --> 01:28:02,976
Young-ass kid who like was like waiting to play and there's these like two older APs playing and they looked back and saw the kid

1086
01:28:02,976 --> 01:28:06,776
and like started another match and I was like

1087
01:28:06,776 --> 01:28:12,616
What the hell are y'all doing? Also, it's like buy an Xbox you fucking dorks

1088
01:28:12,616 --> 01:28:15,256
Like it's not even like it was alright

1089
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:21,756
Like it's an Xbox game move out the way and let the kid like you are old enough to purchase an Xbox this kid

1090
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:28,556
Cannot you know that bugs me on Haunted Mansion when it's people who know the

1091
01:28:28,556 --> 01:28:33,036
Spiel in the elevator by heart and yeah, like hey some people in this room

1092
01:28:33,036 --> 01:28:38,616
It's definitely their first time here. Maybe let the beloved voice narration

1093
01:28:38,616 --> 01:28:41,256
Yeah, maybe let them hear this beloved

1094
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:48,776
As opposed to you guy who comes every Saturday like maybe chill out a little

1095
01:28:48,776 --> 01:28:53,896
Chill all the way out that ride, you know, the more you think about it does get really dark

1096
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:59,136
Oh, I can this is the perfect podcast to bring up this gripe. Oh, I

1097
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,816
Think the Nightmare Before Christmas

1098
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:05,996
Installment to that is always way too early. It should not

1099
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:14,296
So much and everyone always argues like it's Halloween Nightmare Before Christmas is not a Halloween movie

1100
01:29:14,296 --> 01:29:17,336
Christmas is in the movie and the movie starts when Halloween ends

1101
01:29:17,336 --> 01:29:21,936
It is not a it's a Christmas movie and it should not be around in Halloween

1102
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:30,496
That's the one scary ride at the like Haunted Mansion is legitimately scary and you make it not scary during Halloween

1103
01:29:30,496 --> 01:29:37,416
What sense does that make? Hey, I agree. We agree. I think I think you know this this issue had never occurred to me

1104
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:41,176
But Molly Lambert brought it up. You're bringing it up. I am now thinking this is a movement

1105
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:44,236
I think that they need to be heard on this issue, right?

1106
01:29:44,236 --> 01:29:49,976
And I've heard people in the I've like past conversations in the parks of people complaining about this or like, yeah

1107
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:53,256
Did you wait the iron gosselin complained about that video?

1108
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:59,256
What someone people are talking to him like people meet him in the parking garage or something and they're like what's your favorite?

1109
01:29:59,376 --> 01:30:00,636
I think oh, honey, man. Oh

1110
01:30:00,636 --> 01:30:04,676
I wish though

1111
01:30:04,676 --> 01:30:13,456
I came up with the solution the time it should be is at they they should like

1112
01:30:13,596 --> 01:30:16,816
Have it running on Halloween and then

1113
01:30:16,816 --> 01:30:22,996
Stop it like for a bit to make the change over even though there's no way it could be done this fast

1114
01:30:22,996 --> 01:30:28,356
But on the or have it closed up it to the point that you need to do these changes

1115
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:34,156
But on Halloween like night at midnight you can switch it over

1116
01:30:34,156 --> 01:30:37,396
Exactly, that's when it should go because that that's when that movie begins

1117
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:42,396
It's just all this Christmas stuff during Halloween and it just annoys me so much

1118
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:47,396
I'm like this is it it's Halloween right now and you're doing like Christmas stuff

1119
01:30:47,396 --> 01:30:51,516
They could I think it takes two and a half weeks to switch it out

1120
01:30:51,516 --> 01:30:56,176
So in theory they could do that and have it running by

1121
01:30:56,176 --> 01:31:00,516
Mid November, but now I feel like they keep starting Christmas earlier and earlier

1122
01:31:00,516 --> 01:31:06,316
They must be not wanting any of the holiday season to be lacking in

1123
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:13,116
Because if yeah if you think that it if you think on the fact that it takes two weeks that means you either have

1124
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:16,036
To deal with two weeks being down

1125
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:21,896
You have to deal with two weeks it being down during Halloween

1126
01:31:21,896 --> 01:31:26,736
Yeah, would be make would make the same party mad or

1127
01:31:26,736 --> 01:31:31,456
You would have to have two weeks during November it being down

1128
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,796
Which is essentially a quarter of quote unquote Christmas time

1129
01:31:36,056 --> 01:31:41,436
Yeah, I mean it's me get it. I think we get the logic down right now because they have to take it all out

1130
01:31:41,436 --> 01:31:41,916
Yeah

1131
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:45,216
So it's it's always down like two or three weeks at the start of the year

1132
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:49,856
And I think they use that time to like do any other cleanup they need to do on the regular ride

1133
01:31:49,856 --> 01:31:57,516
Yeah, they're the problem is I think also is that there is a big and I don't know why I think this but an Orange County

1134
01:31:57,516 --> 01:31:58,356
bro

1135
01:31:58,356 --> 01:32:00,596
project Skellington

1136
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:04,756
That wear the big Jack Skellington sweatshirts in the park

1137
01:32:04,756 --> 01:32:08,636
And I think they would riot if they don't have a Halloween

1138
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:16,216
You want to get in this fire? I'll do it so we can do the fight. There's nothing though that I hate more

1139
01:32:16,216 --> 01:32:19,516
cuz then Orange County bros as a

1140
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:26,856
La native it would be my personal Christmas present to fuck them up like I

1141
01:32:26,856 --> 01:32:27,856
candidly

1142
01:32:28,636 --> 01:32:30,696
We're getting into la oce

1143
01:32:30,696 --> 01:32:35,776
Watching you kind of like spin kick like ten jack Skellington's in the face

1144
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:38,176
I would like to see that very much

1145
01:32:38,176 --> 01:32:45,616
Speaking of which that's the one thing that I think is right because and I don't know why no one seems to think this based

1146
01:32:45,616 --> 01:32:49,916
On the kids around it, but the walking around jack Skellington is

1147
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:56,276
Terrified yeah, yeah, this is hate that face. What's going on like it looks nothing like

1148
01:32:56,716 --> 01:33:02,056
So far terrifying but kids are like yeah, I'm like that is

1149
01:33:02,056 --> 01:33:03,756
Horrifying the first time I saw it

1150
01:33:03,756 --> 01:33:08,676
I thought it was a fan made costume walker in the park and not a official Disney mascot

1151
01:33:08,676 --> 01:33:12,376
Yeah, honestly I did what if there was more of them?

1152
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:17,536
Like one day you're at the park, and you're like there's a jack Skellington in every land

1153
01:33:17,536 --> 01:33:20,136
What's going on?

1154
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:25,736
What a nightmare you're describing they need to make like a puppet jack Skellington that you can take a photo with yeah

1155
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:27,176
So slender

1156
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:30,536
But you can make the head look like his head

1157
01:33:30,536 --> 01:33:38,156
And like see easily I don't know my brother really likes nightmare for Christmas

1158
01:33:38,156 --> 01:33:42,336
I feel like anytime he comes to the parks or visits on me. That's a souvenir

1159
01:33:42,336 --> 01:33:47,236
He usually gets some sort of nightmare for Christmas thing, but I think even he would be like no, but the Haunted Mansion

1160
01:33:47,236 --> 01:33:51,156
You can buy the merch any day of the year

1161
01:33:51,156 --> 01:33:54,296
But I mean how often to get to see the Haunted Mansion so yeah

1162
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:58,576
Take it out of play for like a quarter of the year. Yeah a bizarre

1163
01:33:58,576 --> 01:34:03,596
I think we should put this on a poll. I'm curious what our audience thinks about

1164
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:09,816
Nightmare too early or not right like cuz I'm starting to think that's a good idea results gonna be like 85%

1165
01:34:09,816 --> 01:34:15,216
I don't want to tip it say what you think because I'm on the fact I could see the argument either way

1166
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:19,796
But it's interesting to me. This is like this seems to be growing to a boiling point

1167
01:34:20,116 --> 01:34:25,796
I want to take the audience's temperature because I went for Halloween again, and it just like took me out

1168
01:34:25,796 --> 01:34:31,256
You know I'm filled with five different types of churros and chocolate mousse sure I'm like

1169
01:34:31,256 --> 01:34:33,316
Oh, I'm ready for the spooks, baby

1170
01:34:33,316 --> 01:34:40,136
And it's this cute Christmas song and you get a gift at the end for anyone who wants to make that trash argument

1171
01:34:40,136 --> 01:34:44,916
That it's still a Halloween ride you get a Christmas gift in October

1172
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:48,616
Yeah, yeah, why it's Halloween you want a ghost to follow you home

1173
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:53,196
You don't want a little day glow like a box with a bone

1174
01:34:53,196 --> 01:34:55,956
I'll even take one of Oogie Boogie's little freaks

1175
01:34:55,956 --> 01:35:00,496
Yeah, those little helpers that are because they're at least a nerve egg there. They are

1176
01:35:00,496 --> 01:35:03,356
Followed me home. I'd be like oh no

1177
01:35:03,356 --> 01:35:05,336
Too early for presents

1178
01:35:05,336 --> 01:35:07,516
We gotta get back tonight. I'll change

1179
01:35:07,516 --> 01:35:09,496
another 30 minutes

1180
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:14,396
Well, you know what I'll say there's topics where I'm like, but we have to get to this we have to get to this

1181
01:35:14,396 --> 01:35:18,296
This is one of those are I'm like I don't fuck it. I really I honestly don't like this attraction

1182
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:21,936
I like I like hearing about your yeah experience on it

1183
01:35:21,936 --> 01:35:27,256
but I and here's here's one thing that I don't like about it is that as opposed to

1184
01:35:27,256 --> 01:35:32,596
we're gonna spoil everyone be talking about Muppet Muppet vision soon, and I just rewatched that and

1185
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:39,016
Muppet vision has cuts it has here's a big close and here's a wide and there's the depth of the room

1186
01:35:39,016 --> 01:35:45,136
And then you're in this void and then there's fireworks and there's all kinds of different tricks going on

1187
01:35:45,136 --> 01:35:47,016
and types of shots that

1188
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:51,876
You know accentuate the 3d effects in different ways the the

1189
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:57,976
Construct of this show it being an award show and having to stay in these big long shots for so long

1190
01:35:57,976 --> 01:35:59,836
I think it makes it dull

1191
01:35:59,836 --> 01:36:00,676
I think it yeah

1192
01:36:00,676 --> 01:36:06,796
And you and you're waiting and waiting for those things to get in your face like the hologram lion

1193
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:12,756
Excuse me a hologram lion and it's not an aesthetic that sits

1194
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:20,756
Next to the aesthetics of the honey movies him flying around on a little like hover pod doesn't like feel like the movies

1195
01:36:20,756 --> 01:36:27,016
Holograms were the thing in 1994 though like holograms were a star just the concept of holograms

1196
01:36:27,016 --> 01:36:30,736
I mean he's flying around a lot of magic. I it fits in with that

1197
01:36:30,736 --> 01:36:34,816
He's in a very similar vehicle to like Baxter Stockman in those Ninja Turtle video games

1198
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:39,456
Yeah, and like a little flying machine, and it's like yeah, he never had that he's like a super villain or something

1199
01:36:39,456 --> 01:36:42,516
Yeah, yeah, Wayne Zelinski's just a guy right

1200
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:46,296
Things weird I do like I mean Rick Moranis

1201
01:36:46,296 --> 01:36:50,496
Canadian right he's one of the SC TV when he says sorry everybody

1202
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:58,116
He doesn't show up also till like five minutes into this thing

1203
01:36:58,116 --> 01:37:02,796
Knowing about and well he should be

1204
01:37:02,796 --> 01:37:10,576
You're watching this dull and why is there so much so why would you start the award show without him there like yeah?

1205
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:15,676
The stage manager to like have made the check right like this isn't on TV

1206
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:19,116
They don't need to start at a particular time wait for him

1207
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:24,476
We don't want the fun of him showing up late and ruining the sign we want him to be on time

1208
01:37:24,476 --> 01:37:30,716
Yeah, walk out get his proper applause and that would be funny if you got if they rolled

1209
01:37:30,716 --> 01:37:33,496
There was like the the normal

1210
01:37:33,496 --> 01:37:40,556
You know

1211
01:37:40,636 --> 01:37:46,456
That would be a fun April Fool's yes like every like five or ten show would be great

1212
01:37:46,456 --> 01:37:52,836
Like it just shows one drops at some points like oh, I dropped my pen well that was the only thing that went wrong today

1213
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:59,336
Yeah, yeah, everybody dropped it right next to the cloning machine. Thank God. It didn't go in it alright. Goodbye

1214
01:37:59,336 --> 01:38:03,896
I'll say this here's a gripe. I have Mrs. Zelinski

1215
01:38:03,896 --> 01:38:09,196
I mean I it's a set piece from all the movies you want to hear him say honey

1216
01:38:09,196 --> 01:38:16,596
I shrunk the blank and she faints. This is the third time now. You gotta get the fading under control like

1217
01:38:16,596 --> 01:38:17,796
Yeah, yeah

1218
01:38:17,796 --> 01:38:22,536
She needs medical. I think she has a condition my other thing and even as a kid

1219
01:38:22,536 --> 01:38:27,916
I remember this going like man girls go wild for Nick's elit's the Sun

1220
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:35,076
There's always in like Nick has a girlfriend in the second in the first movie the second movie in this movie one of the helpers

1221
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:38,916
It's like oh Nick like swooning over him

1222
01:38:39,196 --> 01:38:43,996
He's just some dweeb to Gary Russell in number two. Oh, yes

1223
01:38:43,996 --> 01:38:51,716
First big roles, but I'll say this quark the dog. I always thought was cool quark the dog with 3d glasses on a cooler

1224
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:59,036
Yeah, yeah quark cool list I agree with that yeah quark the dog also though you could argue kind of a poor man's Einstein

1225
01:38:59,036 --> 01:39:04,336
Mmm, and we're talking institutes now. They're interested in the back to the future. Yeah, cork the dog

1226
01:39:04,336 --> 01:39:07,696
But it doesn't get big right yeah, yeah, but Einstein travels back in time

1227
01:39:07,796 --> 01:39:14,516
Have a an issue to bring it. Yes, that's and that's very cool. He's the first time traveler yes, so

1228
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:17,816
Here's a fun thing about this attraction

1229
01:39:17,816 --> 01:39:26,536
We know it as of course as hista or honey. I shrek the audience, but in Japan this was opened as micro adventure

1230
01:39:26,536 --> 01:39:29,836
Love that name crazy name

1231
01:39:29,836 --> 01:39:37,096
Because of their presumably their lack of familiarity with the with that franchise, but in addition to that

1232
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:41,116
I'm gonna show you guys some artwork. I found some concept art

1233
01:39:41,116 --> 01:39:49,136
No of my micro adventure and here is how micro adventure was presented to the Japanese public what you have here

1234
01:39:49,136 --> 01:39:54,676
There's a family that's getting hit by a shrinking ray

1235
01:39:54,676 --> 01:40:01,976
And then there is cork the dog with 3d glasses, but mainly a much much bigger Mickey Mouse

1236
01:40:01,976 --> 01:40:05,276
Well in this art it looks like quark is shooting them

1237
01:40:05,276 --> 01:40:10,136
Oh, no, I see the shrinking right now for a second it looked like coming out of coming out of quark

1238
01:40:10,136 --> 01:40:17,776
He spits shrink rays no no no this family is in Mickey Mouse's giant glove Mickey also has

1239
01:40:17,776 --> 01:40:21,836
3d glasses and so if you see this

1240
01:40:21,836 --> 01:40:29,196
You think this is a crazy shrinking world where you are going to become small and Mickey will carry you around

1241
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:34,636
You know who does not appear in micro adventure or hista or any iteration of this Mickey Mouse

1242
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:41,596
Mickey this is false advertising what a great the promise of that is so hot like that is so awesome

1243
01:40:41,596 --> 01:40:48,096
It's like you know that is you it shows no characters from the the movie at all

1244
01:40:48,096 --> 01:40:51,276
So you don't know what you're going with this family, and you're like oh my god

1245
01:40:51,276 --> 01:40:55,176
Mickey's gonna carry me around and Mickey has a different dog. That's not Pluto

1246
01:40:55,176 --> 01:40:59,256
He is a realistic dog and and then you get inside okay

1247
01:40:59,276 --> 01:41:07,096
Can't wait to be carried around the town by Mickey and then an open house of an award show hosted by dr.

1248
01:41:07,236 --> 01:41:14,376
Nigel Channing it begins in order to give an award to professor Wayne Zelinski who first tests technology of a

1249
01:41:14,376 --> 01:41:17,176
Hologram machine that may puts a lion in your face, right?

1250
01:41:17,356 --> 01:41:21,616
Bumbling guy gin being poor at science jobs

1251
01:41:21,616 --> 01:41:28,876
It's honestly if the Deus ex machina of this show was like Mickey shows up when you're small

1252
01:41:29,396 --> 01:41:37,116
I'll say I'll fix this and he picks up the audience and he fixes his shrink where a and he's like get get your shit together

1253
01:41:37,116 --> 01:41:40,176
What are you doing come on?

1254
01:41:40,316 --> 01:41:42,376
What's your life fix your life?

1255
01:41:42,736 --> 01:41:49,716
I do want to point out the Mickey in that photo doesn't look like the character Mickey it looks like a Mickey suit

1256
01:41:49,716 --> 01:41:56,636
Which which is even creepier even creepier, but even better like that's what I want

1257
01:41:57,096 --> 01:42:02,536
Like suited Mickey who doesn't talk to save the day and then I wanted to play the drums like in that special

1258
01:42:02,536 --> 01:42:05,336
I like and for that to be like 3d in your face

1259
01:42:05,336 --> 01:42:09,556
I've shown the breakdancing Mickey video to so much family over the break

1260
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:13,676
And then we just had people over from Lindsay's work, and I showed that to them, too

1261
01:42:13,676 --> 01:42:17,316
She asked for she was like show them the breakdancing Mickey kills every time

1262
01:42:17,316 --> 01:42:21,016
This is your requested entertainer. Yeah, yeah

1263
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:24,116
That in the McGruff songs. Oh sure yeah

1264
01:42:24,976 --> 01:42:26,876
So I'll praise this you know what I like

1265
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:32,216
I like the little practical when they're holding you as the audience and then you see it in like the mirror image

1266
01:42:32,216 --> 01:42:37,516
Yeah, and you're a little tiny box with little people in it. I love that. That's great. I'd like that too

1267
01:42:37,516 --> 01:42:42,156
However, I'm tripped up by the logic of it that I know either shrinks

1268
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,176
So what point does the feet and what part of it and it's separate?

1269
01:42:46,396 --> 01:42:51,676
I did the building is now like shrunk if you were outside the theater. What does that look like right?

1270
01:42:51,716 --> 01:42:57,096
What is like like this is just disconnected wall and some of the little bit of a leap to

1271
01:42:57,096 --> 01:43:02,036
Imagine that half the building I was shrunk because then you would have like seen the edges of like this is outside

1272
01:43:02,036 --> 01:43:06,136
This is tiny and how did the shrink machine know where the divide?

1273
01:43:06,896 --> 01:43:09,576
divided cleanly I

1274
01:43:09,576 --> 01:43:15,616
Just like that little practical. Well. Yeah, I do like it's a fun little trick when they take you up and show you yourself

1275
01:43:15,616 --> 01:43:18,796
That's great, but it's probably it probably misses

1276
01:43:19,716 --> 01:43:23,376
There's probably an issue in that they always show a packed theater

1277
01:43:23,376 --> 01:43:30,616
Imagine you ever had very hilarious when it's like a few people in there and it's this packed theater

1278
01:43:30,616 --> 01:43:38,576
Yeah, the show also is not in my mind structured to like have a big

1279
01:43:38,576 --> 01:43:43,276
Climax grand finale grand finale. It kind of ends with a whimper like that Lassie movie

1280
01:43:43,276 --> 01:43:47,476
I was talking about but I like when I and I liked it with Lassie a lot

1281
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:49,896
But this now is an adult assessing it

1282
01:43:49,896 --> 01:43:55,876
I was like it really should be a fun big thing that ends where it's just kind of like whimpers out and

1283
01:43:55,876 --> 01:44:00,876
Now and with if you were went into it with that micro adventure advertising

1284
01:44:00,876 --> 01:44:04,136
Oh, you want some major happening at the end, right?

1285
01:44:04,256 --> 01:44:10,456
So it's like it's I watch it and like I liked some of the things but it obviously I can't experience it now again

1286
01:44:10,456 --> 01:44:14,296
So I can't fully assess it. But yeah, I was like, okay, it's a lot of the issue

1287
01:44:14,296 --> 01:44:21,496
Like you shrink I shrink and in what's happening is a giant British man is worried about me

1288
01:44:21,496 --> 01:44:27,736
Yes, it's not like you're going like it's not like you're on some fun adventure and it's like bugs

1289
01:44:27,736 --> 01:44:34,036
Bugs life or whatever is much more fun and there's antics and stuff. Yeah, like an animatronic Shrek 4d

1290
01:44:34,036 --> 01:44:40,296
You're flying everywhere and like stuff is happening and like this one you're just sitting down and everyone's like, alright calm down everybody

1291
01:44:40,296 --> 01:44:41,876
Let's figure this out

1292
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:48,776
That's the narrative of the thing hold on everybody don't move don't move don't move don't get too excited and like no one really does

1293
01:44:48,776 --> 01:44:54,816
Move it's just like some mice running around and like it's just it's a little snakes opens his mouth at you

1294
01:44:54,816 --> 01:44:57,576
Yeah, so like nothing really bad happens. It's just like alright

1295
01:44:57,576 --> 01:45:04,636
We dropped a very tiny like battery or something like it's just like when you would if there's something like I dropped the watch battery

1296
01:45:04,636 --> 01:45:06,516
I was going to dispose of nobody moved

1297
01:45:06,896 --> 01:45:11,096
Step on it and then it's just like a couple minutes of like trying to find it and figure it out and then that's it

1298
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:16,056
That's sort of the feeling of the right. Well, I feel like it's because it stunted itself in its design

1299
01:45:16,056 --> 01:45:19,796
I think it is because they decided it was going to be presentational

1300
01:45:19,796 --> 01:45:25,436
Yeah instead of something like Captain EO, which is a movie that happens to also be 4d

1301
01:45:25,436 --> 01:45:31,616
And I think that's the I think that's the same thing with the bugs life one where it's like everyone's talking to us

1302
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:37,876
You can have all those effects with us getting poked in the butt and stuff and still have us moving about your world

1303
01:45:37,876 --> 01:45:39,916
Yeah, it's a show it never thought about that

1304
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:40,196
Yeah

1305
01:45:40,196 --> 01:45:46,796
It's like one long shot and things have to be trotted out to you as opposed to cut to this cut exactly

1306
01:45:46,796 --> 01:45:48,236
It's more passive than active

1307
01:45:48,236 --> 01:45:54,296
But like you like you can see where the cuts are in the movie when like a thing rolls by like a they roll like a cart

1308
01:45:54,296 --> 01:45:59,816
By and it's clear that they cut the film there and then there's another shot. Oh, yeah. Yeah stuff like but like

1309
01:45:59,816 --> 01:46:03,076
There should be I mean this is I guess a plus it up idea where it's like

1310
01:46:03,076 --> 01:46:07,796
Why didn't a villain come by and steal the tiny theater and go on like, you know what?

1311
01:46:07,796 --> 01:46:12,836
I mean, you're in the real world with the box now. That's that's the crazy thing is like

1312
01:46:12,836 --> 01:46:16,236
They kept it in a way where they felt trapped, but you're right

1313
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:22,796
It didn't someone could have stolen us and took us on an adventure when like gone out into the street

1314
01:46:22,796 --> 01:46:25,136
All out into the sewer

1315
01:46:26,276 --> 01:46:31,356
That's so much more fun and it seems like that's what they would do now and I don't know why they do it plus up

1316
01:46:31,356 --> 01:46:36,256
We have to stay in the auditorium or an inventor of the year award is being given out

1317
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:41,376
Yeah, I will admire it for its realism because that is what would really happen. Everyone just be calm down

1318
01:46:41,376 --> 01:46:43,596
We're gonna figure this out and everyone will be safe

1319
01:46:43,596 --> 01:46:44,736
That's probably what would happen

1320
01:46:44,736 --> 01:46:49,316
But you we want a fun villain was there a villain in the first movie because I haven't seen it

1321
01:46:49,316 --> 01:46:53,956
I don't know the B was there a Dean Jones. I think it was just Wayne's incompetence

1322
01:46:53,956 --> 01:47:00,616
Okay, and and the bees well, let's get a crossover. Let's have a Biff Tannin's cousin or brother

1323
01:47:00,616 --> 01:47:07,396
Mmm, come over and like steal we'll make up a character. I'm gonna take this theater for a little joy ride

1324
01:47:07,396 --> 01:47:16,056
Since it seems like we're doing we're all on the agreement of like yeah, this could be plused up a little I have another

1325
01:47:16,056 --> 01:47:23,696
Plus up which might be able to be used for the series at large if we were to you know, plus it up now

1326
01:47:23,956 --> 01:47:32,036
I would like to see a an old man Logan sort of story of Wayne Zelinski. I would like to see like

1327
01:47:32,036 --> 01:47:33,016
modern

1328
01:47:33,016 --> 01:47:40,816
Rick Moranis comes back and maybe he's doing a symposium a presentation about his life's work

1329
01:47:40,816 --> 01:47:46,436
But he's bitter and grizzled, but he's got a fire up the shrinking machine one more time

1330
01:47:46,436 --> 01:47:50,036
You know would be cool is if like he there was some

1331
01:47:50,576 --> 01:47:57,556
Experiment that we didn't get to see that you could flash back to that fucked him up like Luke where like his hand shrunk permanently

1332
01:47:57,556 --> 01:48:04,976
Like there's a part of his body right? That's that's stuck and that made him like bitter and like I can't use the machine anymore

1333
01:48:04,976 --> 01:48:11,396
But now we need the machine but like Nick comes back or his wife had been estranged and he's like

1334
01:48:11,396 --> 01:48:13,896
Honey, you need to shrink again

1335
01:48:13,896 --> 01:48:18,016
Son of a bitch the name of the movie is honey. You need to shrink again

1336
01:48:20,056 --> 01:48:24,736
Works for me. I like that that's come honey. There is further shrinking to do

1337
01:48:24,736 --> 01:48:29,756
Yeah, I think there will for sure be another one of these movies. Yeah

1338
01:48:29,756 --> 01:48:35,216
Think like a year or two ago

1339
01:48:35,216 --> 01:48:41,596
There was like this article with Moranis where and he like said like it's like I don't think I'm done with acting

1340
01:48:41,596 --> 01:48:43,916
You know, I just took a break to focus on my kids

1341
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:49,116
Yeah, and there and he was like in there getting older like almost hinting like, you know

1342
01:48:49,116 --> 01:48:52,176
Hey y'all can start inviting me to auditions again

1343
01:48:52,176 --> 01:48:58,696
I would love a Keaton like a Michael Keaton older Michael Keaton sort of resurgence for my for sure

1344
01:48:58,696 --> 01:49:01,356
Yeah, be a comedy or drama

1345
01:49:01,356 --> 01:49:06,016
I mean he talked we talked about this recently that he said he almost did a role

1346
01:49:06,016 --> 01:49:08,376
But it was like a really low-budget indie thing

1347
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:12,216
You don't want to be in the desert in a motel for eight weeks or something

1348
01:49:12,216 --> 01:49:17,216
Oh, but I feel like credit when he said he was like I was offered a cameo in Ghostbusters

1349
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:21,476
But he's like it didn't quite make sense and he's like, why would I just

1350
01:49:21,476 --> 01:49:26,496
Arbitrarily show up as this character that I did a couple times like he's the only

1351
01:49:26,496 --> 01:49:29,156
Sanity in this world

1352
01:49:29,156 --> 01:49:35,736
He's just chilling out up in Canada not doing awful cameos it good for Moranis

1353
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:36,996
I say he doesn't have to do anything

1354
01:49:36,996 --> 01:49:41,276
He doesn't want to do but I think but if the right thing we'd all love to see him back

1355
01:49:41,276 --> 01:49:45,456
somebody needs to create the right vehicle for him and

1356
01:49:45,736 --> 01:49:49,896
I'd love to see him again. Yeah, I think he was as a kid one of the first people

1357
01:49:49,896 --> 01:49:52,656
I was like this is a comedy guy. This is comedy

1358
01:49:52,656 --> 01:49:57,856
This is a comedian like you see him in things and he's always funny. I like him you love him

1359
01:49:57,856 --> 01:50:02,696
Yeah, I know he and he's Fred or Barney Rubble and that's totally different than Wayne Zelinski

1360
01:50:02,696 --> 01:50:09,036
Oh, yeah, totally different than Ghostbusters. Yeah, he shows so much range and all those kids. Yeah

1361
01:50:09,036 --> 01:50:12,036
I think he'll never act again. That's a guess

1362
01:50:13,016 --> 01:50:17,876
I think he's good for him. Why do we keep saying like maybe but it's like maybe Broadway

1363
01:50:17,876 --> 01:50:21,156
I mean Daniel Stern does like a Broadway play every year

1364
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:27,916
I feel like Moranis is like that's too much work. I guess he doesn't owe anyone anything. I think that's great. Good for him

1365
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:30,516
I'd love to see him back. But what do we yeah, I don't think it's gonna happen

1366
01:50:30,516 --> 01:50:37,276
Yeah, and I don't think this attractions come I mean, I guess if they made another movie a good candidate to

1367
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:42,916
Revive somehow in the parks, but it's really it's left this black hole

1368
01:50:42,916 --> 01:50:48,756
In all of the parks both this and tough to be a bug which aren't played on the regular

1369
01:50:48,756 --> 01:50:54,156
I mean it still is an animal kingdom, but and it's torn down in California venture. Yeah now it's gone here and

1370
01:50:54,156 --> 01:50:59,116
But like all these these movie theaters are in rough states. We're just watching Star Wars clips

1371
01:50:59,116 --> 01:51:04,176
Like and Pixar that's what's in Florida right now is a Pixar film festival

1372
01:51:04,416 --> 01:51:10,356
Yes, which is crazy like who what yeah why just like who cares they gotta find

1373
01:51:10,356 --> 01:51:15,856
It's it's like the way like big box malls are all starting to go away and we got a what do we do with all this space?

1374
01:51:16,216 --> 01:51:21,176
We need to like find a good use of Disney movie theaters, and I don't know what it is. Well unlike malls

1375
01:51:21,176 --> 01:51:22,516
They can't just stick

1376
01:51:22,516 --> 01:51:23,476
climbing

1377
01:51:23,476 --> 01:51:25,816
Jim in there

1378
01:51:25,816 --> 01:51:30,396
I mean, it's pretty short. There's not a lot of height. Yeah, they're not a lot of height

1379
01:51:30,716 --> 01:51:35,096
Figure out some sort of VR thing maybe because that malls are starting to do that

1380
01:51:35,096 --> 01:51:36,216
It's not a bad use

1381
01:51:36,216 --> 01:51:42,596
I think what's gonna happen is they'll get torn these will get torn down and the redo of Tomorrowland in ten years

1382
01:51:42,596 --> 01:51:48,716
But they will sit in a bizarre half space where we watch Pixar movies and Star Wars clips until then

1383
01:51:48,716 --> 01:51:55,296
There'll be a terrible state of disarray until then and then they'll just tear it down and finally put a ride there in a deck

1384
01:51:55,296 --> 01:51:57,396
placeholder yeah, I

1385
01:51:57,796 --> 01:52:03,156
Don't know if it'll be in it well depends when is Star Wars land done this year June

1386
01:52:03,156 --> 01:52:08,416
Yeah, I think that it's tomorrow. Let's probably next because while I was working there

1387
01:52:08,416 --> 01:52:12,936
We switched the color schemes because remember was the Taco Bell colors at first

1388
01:52:12,936 --> 01:52:22,336
Then after that we got the newer kind of hipper colors and then innovations kind of turned down and now it's a Marvel

1389
01:52:22,336 --> 01:52:25,996
Showcase I think that whole area is due for an upgrade

1390
01:52:26,856 --> 01:52:34,556
The world the big problem they have is a lot of the stuff that's kind of quote-unquote dead or not that great is

1391
01:52:34,556 --> 01:52:39,316
Sandwiching one of the most popular rides in Disneyland, which is

1392
01:52:39,316 --> 01:52:42,456
Space Mountain so it's kind of hard to like do big

1393
01:52:42,456 --> 01:52:49,576
Constructions because if you try and shut down Space Mountain even though they should because Space Mountain goes down so often that needs a whole

1394
01:52:49,576 --> 01:52:55,096
New remodel so I think they should take that opportunity to just take that whole corner of

1395
01:52:55,656 --> 01:52:59,156
And redo it and re like rework Space Mountain

1396
01:52:59,156 --> 01:53:06,836
You know I think with within that if they were to do that take that opportunity to just amp up

1397
01:53:06,836 --> 01:53:13,436
Astro-orbiter some more I like that it has the up-and-down controls, but it feels very old

1398
01:53:13,436 --> 01:53:19,796
Yeah, I feel like that's also part of the now appeal as the park grows in age

1399
01:53:19,796 --> 01:53:23,816
So I think put it back up on a platform like we go through

1400
01:53:24,796 --> 01:53:31,296
Re-vamp make sure everything's safe strong new materials on everything and

1401
01:53:31,296 --> 01:53:35,136
Lift that baby up make it like when that's a choke point for crowds

1402
01:53:35,136 --> 01:53:41,856
Yeah, like it backs up right around Astro-orbiter because it's not a big entrance like yeah originally was exactly

1403
01:53:41,856 --> 01:53:47,356
so you just pop that thing up and then make room and also just it like

1404
01:53:47,356 --> 01:53:51,696
One of the big things that people like to do is try and get on Astro-orbiter

1405
01:53:51,696 --> 01:53:57,916
During the parades and get up there if you have it even higher that it's a rat

1406
01:53:57,916 --> 01:54:03,816
I think it's a great idea. I just I guess I'm really negative today because I don't expect Moranis to come out of retirement

1407
01:54:03,816 --> 01:54:07,376
I don't expect tomorrow land ever be different. I'm really getting worried

1408
01:54:07,376 --> 01:54:11,256
I feel like so long got pushed back on the docket because that movie didn't do well

1409
01:54:11,256 --> 01:54:16,236
Oh, well, that's for sure what happened if that movie crushed. Oh, we would have already been

1410
01:54:17,236 --> 01:54:20,216
Our animatronic chasing us so sad

1411
01:54:20,216 --> 01:54:27,216
But also what a weird idea that the land was gonna get devoted to that like what that they thought that was possible

1412
01:54:27,216 --> 01:54:32,196
I don't know if we've been devoted to that but there would have been references for sure. Yeah, who knows?

1413
01:54:32,736 --> 01:54:38,516
The one thing don't I swear they just don't touch that beautiful like

1414
01:54:38,516 --> 01:54:41,776
Metal wall on the way up to Space Mountain

1415
01:54:41,876 --> 01:54:46,796
I'm talking about like on the wall like on the wall of Red Rockets Pizza port

1416
01:54:46,796 --> 01:54:50,376
Yeah, it just looks so 80s lax

1417
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:56,076
Retrofuture space wonderful. I love that's what the thing well, I guess you were more probably on the other side of the theater

1418
01:54:56,076 --> 01:54:59,396
Maybe I'd want to work the load so that I could just stare at that

1419
01:54:59,396 --> 01:55:04,436
And I take that back. I said the burger spot was best. It's actually pizza port. That was the spot

1420
01:55:04,436 --> 01:55:10,876
Oh, yeah, especially for us because you just have that the pizza smells just hitting you

1421
01:55:11,996 --> 01:55:15,536
Stops, yeah, I gotta get this pizza for lunch

1422
01:55:15,536 --> 01:55:20,036
You know, it's the thing we didn't talk about is

1423
01:55:20,036 --> 01:55:23,076
last grab of details, I

1424
01:55:23,076 --> 01:55:27,336
Did kind of like that the flubber guy is in the line

1425
01:55:27,336 --> 01:55:33,736
How like there's the posters of who previously won the inventor of the year award and they nod to

1426
01:55:33,736 --> 01:55:37,956
Robin Williams. Yeah, what's his character's name like Martin flub you later?

1427
01:55:38,456 --> 01:55:44,656
Yeah, I shared universe idea work I like the imaginative imagination Institute as a concept

1428
01:55:44,656 --> 01:55:48,216
I like the logo I had a pen as a kid of the logo

1429
01:55:48,216 --> 01:55:54,056
This is this is one of those things where they could bring this back in some form whether it's on the Disney streaming service or

1430
01:55:54,056 --> 01:56:00,196
another ride where it's like bring back this and then bring back the mythology of the flubber and the

1431
01:56:00,196 --> 01:56:05,096
Nigel chant get Eric Idle back people are demanding people are demanding

1432
01:56:05,816 --> 01:56:10,816
Series there must be and then like well as Doc Brown did he ever do work at the imagination?

1433
01:56:11,176 --> 01:56:15,256
No, do not ask that question. Of course. He didn't

1434
01:56:15,256 --> 01:56:19,696
Bunkers of her Lloyd could be on the show. Yeah, they sure well, that's fine. He never left

1435
01:56:19,696 --> 01:56:24,956
Thank you. Just be this character who who like they basically are referencing

1436
01:56:24,956 --> 01:56:28,836
Back to the future but just vague enough so people know so yeah

1437
01:56:28,836 --> 01:56:34,856
He's been he's been working on a lot of time stuff and it's been interesting to see him get back to it

1438
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:37,936
But we have to look to the future. I

1439
01:56:37,936 --> 01:56:39,456
Believe he's a doctor

1440
01:56:39,456 --> 01:56:44,376
And like a character in the show is called is like named Marnie and he can go like

1441
01:56:44,376 --> 01:56:52,076
It's like old man voice so it obscures it too much but you're like if anyone tries to sue it's like we sing Marnie

1442
01:56:52,076 --> 01:56:53,416
Marry

1443
01:56:53,416 --> 01:56:57,996
Just invented Rick and Morty

1444
01:56:57,996 --> 01:57:04,836
Well, what if there were characters that were kind of like right and Marty that'd be a

1445
01:57:05,956 --> 01:57:06,436
You

1446
01:57:06,436 --> 01:57:08,716
Know one more thing occurred to me any

1447
01:57:08,716 --> 01:57:14,296
Any experience in the in the glasses washing stage? What's what's the difficulty?

1448
01:57:14,296 --> 01:57:18,396
Oh, it's very if you've ever worked like a food service job

1449
01:57:18,396 --> 01:57:23,196
And you know when you take all the dishes and there's like a system of like you put it here it dips it

1450
01:57:23,196 --> 01:57:25,936
It's very similar to that where you actually put it through

1451
01:57:25,936 --> 01:57:30,916
like this there's like a washing machine that it goes through so

1452
01:57:31,156 --> 01:57:37,636
The reason that you're giving them back to them on trays as you just put the tray to a machine and then you

1453
01:57:37,636 --> 01:57:41,776
You sanitize it and then you wipe it down. So it's a whole process

1454
01:57:41,776 --> 01:57:48,596
So like the hista line would go I think it's like the pieces of Astro orbiter

1455
01:57:48,596 --> 01:57:54,396
Then you would go to the entrance then from the entrance you work the inside of hista

1456
01:57:54,396 --> 01:58:00,896
then from the inside of hista you work that the end of the line and the end of line you collect the glasses and as

1457
01:58:00,896 --> 01:58:03,496
the show starts you walk back to the

1458
01:58:03,496 --> 01:58:09,676
Area to clean them and then bring back some fresh glasses and bring them to the person up front. Oh

1459
01:58:09,676 --> 01:58:11,316
Never steal them

1460
01:58:11,316 --> 01:58:15,416
You didn't see the value in stealing a bunch of

1461
01:58:15,416 --> 01:58:17,316
Okay

1462
01:58:17,316 --> 01:58:26,076
Too into that nemo jacket nothing else. Oh, yeah, you don't have it now do you I don't know where it is

1463
01:58:26,076 --> 01:58:29,256
I had it but I have no clue where it is

1464
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:30,916
Find that
