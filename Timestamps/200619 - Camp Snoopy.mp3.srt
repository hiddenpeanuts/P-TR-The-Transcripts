1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,640
Morning, the following podcast features depressed children, photo ops that take place in a dirty

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,880
livery stable, and a really, really great pumpkin.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
Sit down on top of a piano and gaze lovingly at your podcast listening device.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,920
It's Camp Snoopy on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast that...

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,120
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,020
You downplayed what that was, and I love it so much.

10
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,120
Joining me as always, Scott Gierner as well.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,720
Did you love it as much as Jason?

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Oh, good grief.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Yeah, you know I did though, because I like things like that.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
I like Snoopy sounds.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
You know, I like the music.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,640
There's so much aesthetically, you know, just little cues that make me so happy about the

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Peanuts universe.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
So I'm excited we're going to talk about it today.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,160
Yes, there is.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,600
Yes, there's so many different iconic parts of it.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,160
I will say Snoopy's noises sometimes are unnerving to me.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,340
Sure, sure.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,840
Like when he cries, it's so like grating and it's like makes you so sad.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,440
Like when he like, he like kind of whines.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
You know what I'm talking about?

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
That specific Snoopy whine.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,480
I don't have a full soundboard over there, do you?

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,640
I don't have a full peanut soundboard, although we should just have that in general for the

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,440
podcast where we can soundboard like a morning zoo and just have any sort of Peanuts sound

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
effect ready to go.

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,040
But only peanuts, exclusively peanuts.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
But just peanuts, yeah.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Just peanuts.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,200
I do think Peanuts is like a good thing that encompasses like all, all emotion.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Like it is good for kids because it has so many emotions.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,240
I would go so far as to say I think it's one of the few like big evergreen pieces of popular

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
culture.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,080
You mean like it'll be around forever, always relevant?

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
It'll be around forever.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,240
You can give it to anyone at any age and I think it like makes sense, you know?

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,840
It's got, yeah, it's got cute character designs.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
It's got existential dread.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
Yes.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,280
It's got a mix of things for all ages.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,520
It's very sweet without being cloyingly so.

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, there's nice messages, but it's not like the most like moralistic in your face

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
thing either.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,360
It's just perfectly pleasant.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
Like who wouldn't love to take a little trip to Peanuts world as we're doing right now?

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Right.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Sure.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,760
So we're going to talk obviously about the theme park aspects, but I assume, yeah, with

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,160
a topic like peanuts, we should probably do a little up top about just our, you know,

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,040
growing up with peanuts.

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,080
I like many kids watched the Halloween special and the Christmas special and read the cartoon

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
strips.

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
I am not a peanuts nut though.

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm not crazy because I think I just want to say that up front.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm going to probably get things wrong about peanuts because I know there are much like

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
there are Muppet people.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,480
I know there are peanuts people.

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
So I just want to say I'm not an expert.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
I feel like I've seen less evidence of that as I learned researching a little bit.

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,840
There's a very exhaustive peanuts wiki, but there's exhaustive wikis for all things on

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
this earth.

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
So I will.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, I think the peanuts people probably skew older.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah, I think the Calvin and Hobbes people are more intense.

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,160
Right.

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,640
I think that's right.

72
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,960
But I found a lot of stuff online and tell me if you found stuff like this.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,240
I found a lot of articles talking about Snoopy ruining peanuts.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
What?

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
What?

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Yes.

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Talking about.

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,640
So this I guess we should just I get this right out of the way because this is one of

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,880
the most fascinating things I found and it's not it's not theme park related at all.

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
But I found an article in the Atlantic.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Okay.

82
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Defend defending Snoopy against criticisms of him ruining peanuts.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
This argument needed to be made.

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Is there enough anti Snoopy ism out there?

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,360
I get this is what I'm saying.

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
I open up a whole world for myself of like peanuts opinions.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Is it sort of an Elmo?

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Yes.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,840
In fact, is that what the idea that like it's it's silly and really the oracleification

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,120
there is, you know, there's this whole the specific world here and now it's just become

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
all about this single character is silly and there's not as much.

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,320
If I had to guess what the line of thought was, even though it's dumb as it is about

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,520
all those other ones, too, especially Urkel.

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes. But I know it's it's fun.

95
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,360
We're taking over happy days.

96
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
It's Jimmy J.J.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,440
Walker taking over Good Times, the Sector Keeper taking over podcasts, the ride.

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,120
Exactly. There are people that believe the podcast was better before the City Walk Saga.

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,760
If you took Snoopy out of the peanuts, it would just be way too bleak.

100
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,960
Like, I think his antics and whimsy help balance out like, you know, the dread, the ennui.

101
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,960
Yes. So, yeah, well, a world without a cute dog to counterbalance everything.

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,760
That's like the Trump White House.

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
Yes, exactly.

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
So I look, I agree with you guys.

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm just saying I stumbled upon like the intelligentsia of peanuts who there's

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
a there's a multiple articles about Snoopy rooting peanuts.

107
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,360
Basically, like I think about 15 years into the strip is when they started doing more

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,560
of like Snoopy's flights of fancy.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Which is very Urkel-esque alter egos and little adventures that are entirely about him

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,280
and that leave the other peanuts in the dust.

111
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,320
This is all pre-date circle ism.

112
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,880
Right. I think this is one of the earliest examples of sort of a character like superseding

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,760
the other characters in popularity and sort of doing something that's just fun, that

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,440
more people probably respond to than the actual like original mission statement of the

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,200
TV show or cartoon strip.

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,480
Well, I've read the first few years of peanuts and it any comic strip that runs for

117
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,960
decades and decades evolved significantly as it goes along.

118
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,680
And certainly Charles Schultz's art style really evolved as the years went on.

119
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,680
That's true. But I'd like to say when I can you're talking about our personal connections

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,200
to peanuts. I don't know that I prefer it, but I really like the original peanuts

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,920
designs where they're they're they're littler.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,200
They're kind of like squatter and blanker looking like if you if you just Google

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,760
peanuts, 1952 or 1953, you guys know what I'm talking about?

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
I know. I know what you're talking about.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, I have some in front of I think the issue with some of that is a lot of the characters

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,880
aren't super fleshed out yet.

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,440
So a lot of them is kind of hard to track some of them because they all look a little

128
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,000
similar. But it is it is different but appealing.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The art style.

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
Yeah, I just find it. I wouldn't replace current Charlie Brown with it.

131
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,080
But Charlie Brown, 1953, I like can't stop looking at these.

132
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,600
So cute. I might I might be babies on the brain now, but he is more like a baby of

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,960
Charlie Brown. That's true.

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,000
The very first peanut strip is so funny.

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,080
Like, it's so it just hits the ground running.

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
Do you guys have peanuts?

137
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,880
Strip how I hate him.

138
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Is that it? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Here I'll text. I have it in front of me.

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,640
The first panel is Charlie Brown walking along and then two kids sitting on a step

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,760
and a boy says, well, here comes old Charlie Brown.

142
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
Good old Charlie Brown.

143
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes, sir. Good old Charlie Brown.

144
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
How I hate him.

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
It's so dark.

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,880
It's so dark.

147
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah, so that's what the purists were upset about.

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,240
Snoopy ruining is is that darkness?

149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,720
Which I could see I could see some points about it, but, you know, we don't have a

150
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
fun dog adventure once in a while.

151
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,120
Absolutely. I also like puppy Snoopy a lot.

152
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
Baby Snoopy is very cute as well.

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,920
My baby, Aladar, but yeah, maybe a few things are.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,200
My mom had the old dolls, the old peanuts dolls are based on more of like the first

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
designs and they were kind of beat up or they're still beat up.

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,120
But when I was in Japan, I found they like there's a they're called like ultra

157
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,640
detailed figures and I found original design peanuts figures.

158
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,400
They're new, but they're making them based on that original peanuts design that

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,320
you're talking about and not the newer ones.

160
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,200
How do you define this?

161
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,600
What do you call it? Is it just original peanuts?

162
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,760
Because I kind of want some some merch.

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,040
Well, right. I know I should look it up because.

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,560
I don't know if they even.

165
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,280
Oh, you know what? I take this back.

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,120
There's a company called Super Seven that just started making the same type of

167
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,720
designs with peanuts and they came out last year.

168
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,560
So I wonder if they I'm going to take a quick look.

169
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,640
I wonder if they designate or like they make it a specific like,

170
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,240
I don't know, brand or name for what the old style peanuts design.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh, I say, yeah, yeah, I got this in front of me now.

172
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,240
Yes, Super Seven.

173
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,160
Yeah, very good. Yeah.

174
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,920
And they come one of them comes in a package

175
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,080
with the strip that Jason just read to us.

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,520
Yes. So I guess there's probably I didn't find too many

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,920
like people arguing online about the differences, but like what's better, new or old.

178
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
But I imagine those people exist, too.

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Mm hmm. But they don't they probably don't listen to the show,

180
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,560
so they won't be upset with us. Sure.

181
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,440
I do want to I do real quick want to read a couple just to see

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,560
illustrate the type of discourse around this.

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Christopher Caldwell wrote in 2000, a month before Charles

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,720
Charles L. Charles M. Schultz, right? That's his name.

185
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,040
Died. He wrote an essay in New York Press titled Against Snoopy.

186
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,640
He wrote, but certainly by the 1970s, Snoopy had begun

187
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,080
wrecking the delicate world that Schultz had built.

188
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,320
The problem is, Caldwell saw it was that Snoopy was never a full participant

189
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,480
in the tangle of relationships that drove peanuts in its golden age.

190
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,840
He couldn't be. He doesn't talk and therefore he doesn't interact.

191
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,760
He's there to be looked at.

192
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,040
That's insane. That's insane.

193
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,240
I've got strips.

194
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,080
I've got a ton of strips in front of me of like him interacting with with all of them.

195
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,440
Like, I don't. That's bizarre.

196
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes, I agree.

197
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
I was just Christopher Caldwell.

198
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,240
What a what a miserable man.

199
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,480
What do you think of the minions?

200
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, my God. We should find his minions, I say.

201
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Although he might like them because there are inter

202
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,680
relationships between them and they they do speak to some extent.

203
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,080
Mm hmm.

204
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah, there is a tangled web as far as the minions relationships are concerned.

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,200
I will Google his name and minions right now.

206
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,600
Super seven has an action figure that is Snoopy

207
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,240
wearing Charlie Brown's shirt and a Charlie Brown mask.

208
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,680
And that is a little unsettling.

209
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh, I've seen that. Yeah, that is unsettling.

210
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah, that's fair. That's from a strip.

211
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,520
Caldwell's nightmare, you call it.

212
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,400
The first article is like he's writing about like civil rights

213
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,960
revolutions and stuff right now in Wikipedia.

214
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,400
This is I assume this is the same man who wrote about Snoopy ruining the peanuts.

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Huh?

216
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,880
He people are upset, though, like in that store, I bought those peanuts in Japan.

217
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,240
The the floor is not called peanuts.

218
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
It's called Snoopy town.

219
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,000
And that's cited as a that's cited as a problem.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
And we know we're talking about Camp Snoopy today.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So that's another thing.

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,560
People are upset that Snoopy gets the brand over peanuts.

223
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,040
The name peanuts.

224
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
It's not by people.

225
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,400
By people, you mean 12 people.

226
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,600
People, nine of whom have since died.

227
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,320
It's possible they're like 12 intellectuals

228
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,560
are really the ones who are upset about this.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
And they'd be upset anyway.

230
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

231
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,480
Are they upset about like changes in the Beatle Bailey strip?

232
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
Perhaps. Yeah.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,880
And I do want some gasoline alley.

234
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,200
And I want to say peanuts is not King features syndicate.

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,520
It's United Feature syndicate.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah, at least it was when when Schultz was making it.

237
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,040
I don't know if it's changed hands now.

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,200
So but it is as long as it's a syndicate.

239
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,840
I don't trust a comic coming from a non syndicate.

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Yes.

241
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,600
It's a syndicate, which I, of course, I think of the sinister syndicate,

242
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,280
which is another version of Spider-Man's multivillain gang

243
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,680
that tries to stop him.

244
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,520
But no, these are just nice companies that want to put comic strips,

245
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,240
cartoon strips out into the world.

246
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,280
Why does the Green Goblin get the attention over the rest of the Sinister Six?

247
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,760
We've overlooked their tangled web of right.

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,840
I mean, they would be upset like Hobgoblin would usurp Green Goblin's glory

249
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,960
because Hobgoblin was newer,

250
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,400
but he's just like an orange version of the Green Goblin.

251
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,120
So there would be anti Christopher Caldwell will write about Hobgoblin,

252
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,200
I assume soon.

253
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,640
About the injustice that was done to the Green Goblin.

254
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,360
Yeah. Yeah. Well, then I'll put a flaming bag of poo on his door.

255
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,360
That's what I'll do. All right.

256
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,200
I hate this guy. This guy's a stick in the mud.

257
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
He's like a it's like a mean principle in a movie.

258
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,200
He deserves to be to be pranked until he can't face the public anymore.

259
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,240
Mm hmm. I'm going to carry this guy.

260
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,800
You're going to become like a real bully.

261
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This guy around.

262
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,320
Can I see if he has a Twitter account?

263
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm going to start responding to everyone.

264
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,440
But like with the most anti intellectual thing I could say.

265
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Let's see. He is.

266
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm going to try to find his Twitter.

267
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,360
His first credit on Wikipedia was editor at the Weekly Standard,

268
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,280
which is kind of a right wing kook publication.

269
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,840
I think more like a weekly more like the weekly shit turd.

270
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,720
Yeah, take that.

271
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,960
Caldwell. Yeah, boy.

272
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,840
He's going to rue the day he ever wrote something that Scott heard about

273
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,200
two decades later.

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Snoopy is there to be looked at.

275
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,680
I mean, that's yeah, that's what I'm doing.

276
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,160
I'm doing that, too.

277
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,880
Yeah, that's true. He's right.

278
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
He's right about that.

279
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Well, yeah, not every not every statement that don't Caldwell makes

280
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,280
it that far off base.

281
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,320
Oh, man, I just found another anti Snoopy quote by a different writer.

282
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,280
I shouldn't read it, but I have to.

283
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,760
I am getting upset.

284
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,080
I know. Let's get to the fun ice show.

285
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Hold on. Hold on. I have to do a day.

286
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,280
I got to hear it.

287
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,840
Daniel Mendelsohn put it in a piece in the New York Times Book Review.

288
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,200
Snoopy represents the part of ourselves, the smugness, the avidity,

289
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,200
the pomposity, the rank egotism.

290
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,200
Most of us know we have, but try to keep decently hidden away.

291
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,960
All these psychos would be the people going like we've got to push on to Baghdad.

292
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,160
That oil is art like this in between their in between their warmongering pieces.

293
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
The writing about how Snoopy is a piece of shit.

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,480
This is insane.

295
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,400
Hey, you man, you, Lee Mendelsohn.

296
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,040
I was Daniel. Oh, no.

297
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
Oh, wait, Lee is a oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,200
I think Lee Mendelsohn is oddly it's the same name.

299
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,600
I think Lee Mendelsohn might be a Snoopy or a Snoopy, a peanuts producer, I think.

300
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Wait, is he the opposite of Mendelsohn?

301
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,400
I have that name in my head. I think it might be right.

302
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,480
So sorry, Daniel. It's Daniel Mendelsohn.

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,360
Yes, Daniel Mendelsohn.

304
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,400
Yes, sure. That's so weird.

305
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,880
Yeah, the producer of all because I was just looking up.

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
Oh, my God, who passed away on Christmas of 2019.

307
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, my God. I guess I was.

308
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,680
It was a total mistake to say he is the one who Mendelsohn's

309
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,280
because this guy the opposite of because I was reading about how did Vince

310
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
Garaldi, the wonderful musician buying all the peanuts music, get involved.

311
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,400
And it was that this producer just like heard some of his jazz on the radio

312
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
and like, I don't know, should be him.

313
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
And then you want to do it.

314
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,560
And two weeks later, he called and just put his phone up to the

315
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,880
put the phone up to the piano and started playing the iconic

316
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,560
Linus and Lucy that we know today. Wow.

317
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, yeah. We'll get a little.

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,520
We'll get some more of the magic very soon on the podcast.

319
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't worry. We'll get we're going to get away from this.

320
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
This negativity, this is intellectual.

321
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is like this populism.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,680
This is like people who like the Beatles but hate wings.

323
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Yes, exactly.

324
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
What would be funny?

325
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,080
No, I don't accept that at all.

326
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
What are those people?

327
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
What do you mean?

328
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Wait, on which side?

329
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,680
Oh, no, I just like wings a lot.

330
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,080
Like, yeah, hell yeah.

331
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,760
Fuck. Yeah.

332
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
You like wings and you like Snoopy as you should.

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,560
It's also I like I think of wings as just being like nice, you know?

335
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,680
I don't think of it as very.

336
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah, I don't know how you could have an agenda against wings.

337
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,640
I don't know. And it is only like snooty journalists.

338
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
That's that it's the exact same syndrome.

339
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
Only a snooty journalist because anyone else would just go, that's fun.

340
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
Yes. Yeah, it's crazy.

341
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,680
I mean, Paul McCartney solo career.

342
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
Yeah, he got so much shit.

343
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,160
And if you go through it, it's like, of course, there's some schmaltzy garbage in there.

344
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,600
But like the majority of it is good.

345
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
He was Paul McCartney.

346
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,720
It's not like he changed from the year the couple of years in the Beatles.

347
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,960
He was just making like good pop songs.

348
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know what people people's problem was.

349
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,160
The schmaltzy garbage didn't really start till like three years ago.

350
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,280
My Valentine, my Valentine.

351
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,040
OK, he has a song called My Valentine for his current wife.

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
And we saw him at Dodgers a couple of years ago and he played My Valentine.

353
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,200
And I've never seen so many people go to the bathroom.

354
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
It was in the middle of the show.

355
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,920
He sat down. Everyone was losing their mind.

356
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
It's hit after hit after hit.

357
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,720
It's like 15 hits in a row.

358
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,600
You're as high as possible.

359
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
We were lucky and had very good seats that year.

360
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
And he plays My Valentine.

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
And it was just a map.

362
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,680
People running to the bathroom.

363
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
Now, there's a flood.

364
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,840
There is suddenly on the field just a torrent of yellow.

365
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,320
And it swept Paul away.

366
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,320
And he wasn't able to finish the concert.

367
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,040
Whoops. Oh, boy.

368
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,280
Oopsie, Daisy.

369
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
Well, whoopsie, Paul.

370
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,000
Paul, you have to stop playing My Valentine.

371
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,840
It's ruining the plumbing systems of all the cities you're performing.

372
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,000
So what keeps up?

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,840
Is that what those little flood sees are?

374
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes, you have to look.

375
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
I understand you want to play it for Dancy.

376
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,640
If you want to start the show with My Valentine, maybe

377
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,680
because they won't have a full bladder at that point.

378
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,600
So be my own opening act, you mean?

379
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,360
That's fine. If that's if that's what you need to do.

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,400
But you cannot have My Valentine be played

381
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,120
any more than like five songs into the show.

382
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,640
I think I'm going to play it seven times.

383
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,960
Paul.

384
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,480
That's just Paul. That's just Paul.

385
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,520
So, yeah, my val...

386
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,120
So, yes, he's got look, I don't know if any.

387
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,360
I think that's gone.

388
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,960
I think that's mostly gone, except for like grizzled, like

389
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,360
60 year olds who are still like hung up about wings and stuff being bad.

390
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,960
I think that we're arguing a point that was that

391
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,240
should have been argued in 1978.

392
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,400
We're mad.

393
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,640
This is an issue that was maybe settled before we were born.

394
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,160
We're still in the jungle fighting the war and the war is over.

395
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Nobody told us.

396
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,560
Nobody told us.

397
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,720
We're still trying to defend the wings.

398
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,600
This is like the peanuts arguing.

399
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
I could see happening

400
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,480
because it feels very comic shop arguing, but it's the

401
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,920
it's the very niche of niche.

402
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,360
Like it's the narrow portion of the comics world

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,160
because most like classic comic strips have like the big ones

404
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,600
have collections from like fan of graphics or drawn in quarterly,

405
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,680
which has a lot of art, you know,

406
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,160
you know, acclaimed graphic novels, too.

407
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,000
And a lot of those people have very strong opinions about like

408
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
little Lulu and gasoline alley.

409
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,560
Sure. Yes.

410
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,880
I mean, we have strong opinions, too.

411
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,840
We know that, but ours are better opinion.

412
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,360
Ours are better. Yeah.

413
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,920
In general.

414
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,800
That's oh, yeah, of course.

415
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,240
And that's why you come here to listen to our better opinions.

416
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,800
Better opinions.

417
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,720
I do. I don't want to go right back to wings.

418
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,160
I just looked down and realized I'm wearing a wings jet shirt.

419
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,240
Yeah, I didn't realize that as we talked about wings,

420
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I was sporting the merchandise.

421
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,120
And when I just looked down and I am in a full Snoopy bathrobe and slippers,

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,320
I assume Jason as well.

423
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, I am in my full Red Baron gear.

424
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
As I am every podcast recording.

425
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,200
You got the goggles.

426
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,520
Those are going to be fogged up by the time this is over.

427
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,240
OK, I guess the goggles fly off my head as I start going into Snoopy's

428
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,600
extensive family tree.

429
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,120
We're going to need some fan art of that.

430
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,440
That's all I'll say.

431
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,800
Who don't want to don't want to beg, just saying, putting it out there.

432
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,880
You got quarantine time.

433
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
Let's see Jason in the goggles and Scott in the robe, too.

434
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,920
Yeah. Well, I'll just do that and post a picture.

435
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,360
I'll do my own fan art.

436
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,320
That's good. That's a good point.

437
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,560
Well, what is there more misery?

438
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,400
No, I think I mean, there is, but that's that's the gist of it.

439
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,360
And that's just what I was I kept running into, which I found fascinating.

440
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,880
We saw stuff odd, and especially because

441
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,480
the Snoopy opinions at this point boiled down to

442
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,360
mostly like a three year old going Snoopy,

443
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,400
because, you know, in the in the theme parks, especially the presence is very

444
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,400
little kid. I mean, I think that's the is there a peanuts attraction

445
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,640
or show that isn't for the youngest children?

446
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah, that's a good question. I didn't see one.

447
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, there's a lot of there's the the peanuts are in a lot of different

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
places in theme parks.

449
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,520
But I find, yeah, it's a very confusing.

450
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah. Corporate breakdown where, you know, we obviously know it

451
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,080
primarily from Knott's Berry Farm, which we're close to in our beloved B Park.

452
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,720
It is also currently in Cedar Point.

453
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
It's in Carowinds.

454
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,200
It's controlled by the Cedar Fair organization.

455
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,080
Can we? But was also.

456
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,560
Oh, sorry, I was going to say, I can go into this.

457
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,840
I have the timeline on this.

458
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,480
Sure, sure. Oh, yeah, go for it.

459
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,760
So Camp Snoopy, the camp Snoopy area, Snoopy first showed up at Knott's in 1983.

460
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,840
And so it had it was there first.

461
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,400
And the camp Snoopy area at Knott's is very good.

462
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
A lot of big trees and like fun rides.

463
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,800
And there's a big cave you can walk through.

464
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,080
And then when Knott's bought,

465
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,640
Knott's got bought by Cedar Fair in 1997,

466
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,560
they were able to adjust the agreement, the licensing agreement

467
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,760
so that it could be used at all the Cedar Fair parks.

468
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,280
And the timing was very helpful

469
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,160
down the line because Cedar Fair would start to absorb

470
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,480
a lot of the former Paramount parks.

471
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,440
So the Snoopy stuff would go on to replace a lot of

472
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,240
Nickelodeon play areas.

473
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,280
And in some cases, I remember this specifically at Doherty Park replaced

474
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Bernstein Bear play areas as well.

475
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
Oh, interesting.

476
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,200
But then also, and we're jumping all around, we'll go ahead individual ones.

477
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,640
But at the Mall of America,

478
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,240
the theme park in the center of the Mall of America was Camp Snoopy.

479
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,840
And then that got replaced by Nickelodeon stuff.

480
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,280
So Nickelodeon and Peanuts have been at war for many years.

481
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,040
It's been a turf war, really.

482
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,080
And I don't know who's winning. I think Nickelodeon might be winning.

483
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,440
I think there's more probably Nickelodeon theme park presence,

484
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,280
which we will have to get to at some point.

485
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,320
Yeah. And the American Dream Mall is Nickelodeon, right?

486
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,440
Oh, that's right. Yes, indeed.

487
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,960
Yeah, we've been we also have that's part of the the sector keeper.

488
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,280
There has also made us wants us to go do that eventually as well.

489
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,880
Oh, that's right. And we should say

490
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,000
Camp Snoopy is not Planet Snoopy.

491
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,400
They're different.

492
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,560
Own only Cedar Point has both Camp Snoopy and Planet Snoopy.

493
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,040
Most parks have Camp Snoopy or Planet Snoopy.

494
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,840
And wait, is you both separately?

495
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,440
Apparently from I saw some things and I could be wrong,

496
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,400
but at least Wikipedia was saying Cedar Point has both.

497
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
And what about this?

498
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,360
I it's it's indecipherable.

499
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,600
It I think there might be a little more space kind of stuff,

500
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,680
although Mike, you and I saw some of a Snoopy

501
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,280
space show at a camp Snoopy at the Knotts Camp Snoopy before.

502
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,000
So I think it all just kind of, you know, they they might rename some stuff

503
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,440
Planet Snoopy when they give it a fresh coat of paint or add a couple more new rides.

504
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,440
But also then confusing it even more.

505
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,360
So so peanuts are usually in these non Disney Universal parks.

506
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,520
But then in Universal Studios Japan, there is a kids area called Universal Wonderland,

507
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,640
which is home to Sesame Street, which is also all across

508
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,560
Splatter all across the universe.

509
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,880
Sesame Street, Hello Kitty and Snoopy Studio are things of that.

510
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,000
So we're the only in Japan.

511
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,920
It's a universal property.

512
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,360
Yes, because the licensing agreement Cedar Fair only operates parks.

513
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,320
I believe in America, maybe there's one Canadian Cedar Fair Park.

514
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,800
I could be wrong.

515
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,400
But mostly in America.

516
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
Right. So it's a big confusing web.

517
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
It's it's definitely hard to chart.

518
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,200
And you made it more confusing knowing that there's camps and planets

519
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,320
right next to each other.

520
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,200
Yeah. And then there's also like by the Schultz Museum,

521
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,360
there's like an ice skating rink.

522
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,120
As well. Yes.

523
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,560
Well, here, this might be I can explain some of this stuff that

524
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,600
because I didn't know the connection between I didn't know why all the ice skating

525
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,480
in not just I mean, obviously, in like in the Christmas special.

526
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
That's so iconic.

527
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,640
But then, you know, not to be doing Snoopy ice shows for a very long time.

528
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,240
And I think it's all a product of Charles Schultz growing up in Minnesota.

529
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,960
So having a very skate centric existence.

530
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,200
But since 1969 in his home in his town of Santa Rosa,

531
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,280
he has owned no longer as he's passed away, but owned it.

532
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,880
Still, his family operates this place, which is what's the official name?

533
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,600
Redwood Empire Ice Arena.

534
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,680
But then it's it's casually called Snoopy's Home Ice.

535
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah. On the website, it's Snoopy's Home Ice,

536
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,360
unless that's just a specific part of the website.

537
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,640
But I'm looking at the website that Snoopy's Home Ice.

538
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,160
And of course, it has a place to eat as well,

539
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,040
which is called, of course, the warm puppy cafe.

540
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,000
Adorable. So cute.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,480
It's got a fireplace that sounds so lovely.

542
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,960
And the whole thing is very Swiss Alps themed.

543
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,320
It's that Solvang Madonna in kind of vibe,

544
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,080
which I always like anywhere in this world, the Matterhorn to love.

545
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,680
I love 60s Swiss Alps stuff.

546
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Always. It's great.

547
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,280
And I don't know if you found this fact, but in 1973, Schultz

548
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,560
and his wife divorced, and a month later he married Jeannie Clyde,

549
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,560
a woman he met at the warm puppy cafe.

550
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Whoa. He built his own pickup spot.

551
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,800
That's right. Wow.

552
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,680
That's interesting.

553
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,320
So so then the the ice skating connection is also what led

554
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,120
to the entire Knott's relationship, because it was in 1982

555
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,400
that they were poking around like, well, we don't do a lot with IP.

556
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,480
And, you know, it might be fun to try to do something with Snoopy,

557
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,080
but they had to approach Schultz.

558
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,880
And he was interested because he has such a big ice skating connection.

559
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,480
And his daughter is an ice skater.

560
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,360
I think his whole family are ice skaters.

561
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,840
So just kind of in him trying to seal the deal, he said,

562
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,480
all right, if you do the show, could my daughter play Snoopy?

563
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,120
And that sort of that pushed it over the finish line.

564
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,000
And then that show went over so well, they decided to expand

565
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and do this do this whole area.

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,720
So there wouldn't be, I don't think any peanuts or Snoopy

567
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,840
and theme parks anywhere if not for this this tie to ice skating.

568
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,400
Wow, that's interesting.

569
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,840
Do you think that ties directly to the Snoopy on ice show?

570
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Yeah, completely.

571
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,360
I mean, that's right.

572
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,200
That's what I'm saying.

573
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,960
They they were they did a they not they did a Snoopy on ice show.

574
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,800
I misunderstood. Oh, I see what you're saying.

575
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,560
Yes. Before they built the area, that was the very first

576
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
right pillar of this relationship.

577
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,560
Of course. Yeah. Makes too much sense then.

578
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,560
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

579
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,480
So yeah. So we can thank this this series of events for

580
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,640
us seeing Snoopy dance the Gangnam style in an ice show a couple of years ago.

581
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,920
That is that is right. Yes.

582
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,480
You and I's first theme park hang.

583
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, that was that was kind of the highlight of it.

584
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,200
That was extremely exciting.

585
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
Front row at the ice show.

586
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,160
We were getting hit with ice shavings.

587
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,040
Oh, I forgot we were front row. That's right.

588
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,840
Excitedly ran down to the front row of Snoopy on ice.

589
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,000
Better seats than McCartney for a better show.

590
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
It didn't have any my Valentine in it.

591
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
No, my Valentine.

592
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,560
There was a weird Al song in it, I believe was Edith in it maybe.

593
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,720
Yeah, that sounds right.

594
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,720
I think it was Edith and it was like they were throwing stuff in and out of the refrigerator.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,880
And then the big closer was getting of a Gangnam style

596
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,480
done on ice skates, which that's not a dance.

597
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,960
That little Gangnam style step in place

598
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,160
doesn't really lend itself to ice skates in particular.

599
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,680
So no, it was very impressive physical feats on the part of the skaters.

600
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,120
Yeah, very impressive.

601
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,080
Great show. So, yeah, ice skating and obviously like kids ice skate

602
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,240
in the Peanuts Christmas special.

603
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah, which I guess is a reflection of his Minnesota upbringing,

604
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
which is very which then also

605
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,320
his Minnesota childhood is why he ended up in the Mall of America.

606
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,040
Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah.

607
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,680
And why I think it was considered a blow to the Mall of America

608
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,120
to have to shift to the Nickelodeon IP, because I think people really liked

609
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,880
that it was a Minnesota native property.

610
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,280
Right. I'm looking at Snoopy's home ice website,

611
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,800
and there's a live webcam of the ice.

612
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,080
Now we are still recording this in social distancing era.

613
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
You can just watch the ice.

614
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm assuming no one on it.

615
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,120
There is I don't see anyone in the shot.

616
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,640
It's but the the the rink is lit up

617
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,760
and it's just it's got a timestamp on the bottom, which is

618
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,760
the exact time we're doing this.

619
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,080
And I guess, yeah, I guess any time you want to go,

620
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,120
there's something next to it called the Charlie Brown Cam that is not open.

621
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,400
It doesn't work.

622
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,640
So I don't know what that is, but the ice cam is working.

623
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,440
And you can see into the building right now.

624
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
I'm very so.

625
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,080
So we'll be recording this and we'll talk about other things.

626
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,560
And then in 20 minutes, you'll go, oh, my God, I just checked the ice cam again.

627
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,960
There's been a murder.

628
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,720
There's blood on the ice.

629
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,080
I'm the only witness to it.

630
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,240
But you like looked away when it happened,

631
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,560
but you're seeing other figures sneak around.

632
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,040
Oh, right. It becomes like a like a clue scenario.

633
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,280
There's eight different people skating away from a body on the ice.

634
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,200
Was it murder? May happen.

635
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,560
It may be happening at the Charlie Brown Cam, the one that's not working.

636
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,960
Maybe they disabled it to get away with the murder.

637
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,440
Like, yeah, like an Ethan Hunt style IMF team has disabled the Charlie Brown Cam.

638
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,400
So we cannot look and cannot see what they're going to do on the ice cam.

639
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,920
Wait a minute. The Charlie Brown Cam was previously used in Epstein's cell.

640
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,760
Oh, no. Oh, no.

641
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
Two guards.

642
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,800
There's no record of the Charlie Brown Cam.

643
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,920
This conveniently broken, named after an adorable character camera.

644
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,480
And the two guys who were working there weren't even like guards.

645
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
They were just people they found off the street.

646
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,200
And they said, hey, can you come in here and watch this for a couple of minutes?

647
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
Sounds good. I like peanuts. Sure. So weird.

648
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,160
Oh, man. Well, yeah, keep it.

649
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Keep an eye on any potential wrongdoings.

650
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
I will have it open in the corner here.

651
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,440
Yeah. It means after we're done recording, too.

652
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I think you owe Snoopy's home ice being an unpaid security guard.

653
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,000
Now that you know about it. You know what? I'm going to throw it up.

654
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,640
I have I have a little TV here now that I've been using to monitor like as a monitor.

655
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm going to throw it up on the monitor and I'll take a photo of it

656
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,960
to let you guys know that I'm just watching the ice cam for any wrongdoing.

657
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,720
Wrongdoing.

658
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,920
Do we need to take shifts?

659
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
No, no, no, I want to tell you. OK.

660
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah, I only trust myself to do this.

661
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,520
I think somebody needs to watch it because I don't want something to happen to this place.

662
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,160
I know you want to go to that warm puppy cafe when all this current crap is over.

663
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,400
Exactly. I'm looking at the menu right now.

664
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Oh, if I mentioned this flyer, I can get a free coffee, tea or soft drink with any meal.

665
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,000
Wow. This place is great.

666
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,840
Jason, you want to list some of the items you can get there, some of the food?

667
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Oh, you can get the Schroeder sourdough breakfast sandwich.

668
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,480
Well, how?

669
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,120
Uh, let's see the home ice favorite turkey and Swiss on sourdough

670
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,400
lettuce, tomato and quote the best crunchy dill pickle on the side.

671
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,360
You can get the good grief grilled cheese.

672
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,880
That's good. You can get it's a good burger, Charlie Brown.

673
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Oh, that's great.

674
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,520
Remember, you know, sometimes we run into these things where they

675
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,720
were excited about some themed restaurant and then they didn't theme the menu.

676
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,560
I was I was really worried about being let down here.

677
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
Thanks to a warm puppy cafe.

678
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,240
You got it right. Yeah, it's peppermint, patty, hot chocolate.

679
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,560
That's good. Wonderful. Yeah.

680
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Fucking if fucking Caldwell went there, he'd be like,

681
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,320
the Snoopy sub is not a substantive meal.

682
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,480
It has almost no nutritional value.

683
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,560
Yeah. And then like, you know, Bill Crystal would say,

684
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,480
why, why doesn't Snoopy's brothers and sisters have any representation on the menu?

685
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,080
Where is the Olaf Chowder?

686
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,360
Well, I mean, maybe that's a good.

687
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, sorry. OK, I was going to say, I found another fact about Caldwell.

688
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,160
His 2009 book Reflections on the Revolution of in Europe,

689
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
which deals with increased Muslim immigration to Europe,

690
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,440
received mixed reactions.

691
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,120
Cool, man.

692
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Hmm. Cool, man.

693
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,080
Sounds good.

694
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,800
You probably get mixed reactions from ladies when he gets in a bed with them.

695
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah. Take it to him.

696
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,840
That's right. Take it to.

697
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,640
Do you think you ever like in a book about something like that?

698
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,120
Do you ever just like he does a chapter on Snoopy just because it's still bothering him?

699
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,360
He just tries to like shoehorn Snoopy into any argument he's making.

700
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,360
The postscript is about the menace of Woodstock.

701
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,800
Woodstock is a hat on a hat.

702
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,600
Had a hat to almost too many, even more antics than Snoopy.

703
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,320
Disgusting.

704
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,560
Well, then, yes, truly, what would he think of Snoopy's relatives?

705
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,800
I mean, he must despise these characters.

706
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,560
And this is I mean, this was maybe a good transition point,

707
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,480
because when Mike, when you wanted to talk about peanuts for an episode,

708
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,120
I know you have a longstanding affinity for the aforementioned Olaf and

709
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,760
and Spike, but I'll let you take it from here.

710
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,520
Yes. So I realize, OK, I don't I don't want to make this even more negative.

711
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,680
In that article, it claims that Schultz believes creating these characters was a mistake.

712
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,160
What? What claims? Come on.

713
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,360
OK, so it says in 1980s.

714
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,400
OK, so basically, yes, Snoopy, after a while, they introduced his brothers and sisters.

715
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,440
And I guess let's I like the brothers and sisters.

716
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
I think most of us like the brothers and sisters.

717
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,240
I will say as a kid, I was a little creeped out by Spike.

718
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,600
Spike is like his like his brother who lives.

719
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,680
He has like a long like mustache and he was kind of like a drifter.

720
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,560
Yeah, Spike lives outside of the desert town of Needles, California,

721
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,280
and he's definitely a little squirrely looking for sure.

722
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,440
He has almost his mustache is sort of cactus spike esque.

723
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,960
It's a very prickly looking mustache and a real dirty hat.

724
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,880
It was a very dirty like, yeah, hat that like seemed like somebody stepped on

725
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,160
and he put it back on his head.

726
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
So as a kid, I don't know that I trusted Spike,

727
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,000
but I like Spike now.

728
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,480
And we'll talk a little bit when Jason and I went last,

729
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,320
because there was a peanut celebration and that's and we went to an event in January

730
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,960
and we tried very hard to get a photo with Spike.

731
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,040
And it was so hard and we didn't do it.

732
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,560
He kept like he kept going on breaks.

733
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,160
There were the line was too long.

734
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,280
Like we tried three times, Jason, am I right?

735
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I yeah, we tried so many times and kept seeing the same employees,

736
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,720
probably to tell us that like Spike has to go has to take a break now.

737
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,800
It's it's possible they saw us coming and kept making up excuses

738
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,680
why Spike wouldn't take a photo with us.

739
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,240
Yeah. So wait.

740
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,960
And so Spike is is new at the Nats this year.

741
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,280
I I'm not sure if he's new this year, but they were really like,

742
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm seeing an article indicating that.

743
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,000
OK, I think it is.

744
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,680
I think that it was his debut at this peanuts celebration.

745
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,520
So that might have been some of the mania you were witnessing.

746
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,120
Sure. Right. Well, he also had a silent disco.

747
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,640
We did not get to see the silent disco either.

748
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
What would it was silent disco?

749
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,120
You don't know about these things.

750
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,920
This is a thing where a DJ plays music, but everyone's got wireless headphones on.

751
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,720
So it just looks like a bunch of people.

752
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,560
Yes. It's so it's one theme to Spike.

753
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,560
Well, why does he have a why would he be a silent disco guy?

754
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,680
I mean, he likes he likes a party.

755
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,240
I think he's maybe like a Coachella guy because he lives out in the desert.

756
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,000
He lives in Needles, California.

757
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,480
Which side note from my looking into Schultz trivia,

758
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,160
Schultz grew up in Minnesota, but his family spent one year in Needles, California.

759
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,200
Right. So when he created Spike in 1975, that's when Spike came along.

760
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,680
Yes, he was inspired by his firsthand knowledge of Needles, California.

761
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,480
Bizarre. Wait, now I'm looking at footage of this silent disco, which is packed.

762
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,480
Everybody's in glowing headphones.

763
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,480
This is like one of those pieces of footage that's so distressing to watch

764
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,680
deep into the covid crisis.

765
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,320
It's bizarre. It's bizarre to me to look at this footage.

766
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,120
So many teenagers all jammed together in this little space,

767
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,760
all with headphones that were handed to them by a theme park.

768
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,520
And it's weird to look at that and then look down and see the date.

769
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Twenty twenty just doesn't seem right.

770
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,160
I think that is a thing during this.

771
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,880
Your brain starts to like forget that stuff was made before.

772
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,400
Because I was watching.

773
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,200
I was watching.

774
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,640
I decided to watch 10 minutes of Lily Hammer

775
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,680
because I never seen it before.

776
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Cool. And he's trying and like, look, you know, it's

777
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,280
it's the ultimate comedic setup.

778
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,000
An American gangster in Norway.

779
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,680
But he's trying to bribe people.

780
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,520
And he was like putting like touching money and handing money.

781
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,320
And I like my brain kept being like, oh, you got to.

782
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,560
He's better wash his hands after that.

783
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,440
Yeah, no, it's before it's before.

784
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,040
Yeah, I'm projecting it onto every single thing that I watch.

785
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,640
Absolutely. Yeah.

786
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,440
I'm going to go ahead and say I never have to go back to handshakes

787
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,880
except for like close friend.

788
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,440
Like I never need to do handshakes again, because you either get really squeezed

789
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,840
by like some aggro guy or you get a very wet limp handshake

790
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,600
and there's no common ground.

791
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
And I'm good. I'm done. I'm done.

792
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,680
I think we leave that in the before times.

793
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,120
Can I say I think this is a bridge that I feel comfortable burning

794
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,120
because when you say limp, wet handshake,

795
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,400
let me just say on the record that the limpest, wettest handshake

796
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
I ever received in my entire life was from Jamie Kennedy.

797
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,680
In some bizarre setting, I met Jamie Kennedy one time

798
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,600
and there's no it was like 50 percent limper and wetter

799
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,680
than any other hand I ever shook.

800
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,120
And if handshakes are a thing of the past, the main thing I've seen

801
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,040
I will associate it with is Jamie Kennedy and how dripping wet he was.

802
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,760
Wow, that is now gross.

803
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,840
That is a revelation.

804
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,120
That's is this going to become click bait?

805
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,160
Am I going to see this? This is going to bite me.

806
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,400
And some again, I think I feel comfortable burning the bridge.

807
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,440
I mean, hey, I'm just stating facts.

808
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm not casting aspersions on Malibu's Most Wanted.

809
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,400
I just I shook his hand and that's what I could tell you.

810
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,760
What if we like what if like they bring like the original Star

811
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,680
Tours back, but it's Jamie Kennedy's voice and we want to have him on the show?

812
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I guess then I will be

813
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,240
that will be one of his conditions that that bastard Scott

814
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,520
with the overly dry hands will not be.

815
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,120
I will speak to you, Mike and Jason,

816
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,480
but not to that, you know, Caldwell

817
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,840
esch judgmental freak, Scott Gardner.

818
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,000
All right, that's fair. So, yes.

819
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,240
So in the in the in this situation, we have to interview Jamie Kennedy.

820
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,480
Then you will set this one out.

821
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,560
And Jason and I will right now on the record say.

822
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,080
I think he probably has a great handshake.

823
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,000
Such a fan, such a fan.

824
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,440
I'm such a I think the I think his hand is probably the right moisture.

825
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,200
I think it's like perfect, kind of.

826
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,320
It's almost like you're feeling like you feel comforted when you're in his hand.

827
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,080
That's what I'm thinking.

828
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm thinking that maybe my hands are just we're always too dry.

829
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,280
They were just brittle and chalky.

830
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,880
Yeah, no one will ever know again.

831
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,200
We'll never shake hands again.

832
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,640
So it's like getting it's like being in a hot tub and then getting in a regular pool.

833
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,640
And it's so cold, but it's not really that cold.

834
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,280
It just seemed extreme. Yeah, yeah, you're right.

835
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,920
Or it's possible that why haven't I put this together?

836
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,440
It's possible that I was getting the ultimate X.

837
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,920
Do you think right before I came in the room,

838
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,640
he dipped his hand in a bucket of water and I had been ext and I didn't realize it

839
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,760
until now. And maybe the show got canceled and then that never aired.

840
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,920
It would have been the last one.

841
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,400
His last prank they ever did.

842
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,960
The very wet handshake.

843
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,840
They ran out of money towards the end, and it was just him

844
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,800
dipping his hand in a bucket and shaking people's hands.

845
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,040
They remember is that he he laughed like he was a member of Gryph's gang.

846
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,400
During this wet handshake, he was like, ah,

847
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:23,960
ah,

848
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,000
this sounds like a memorable encounter.

849
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,160
This sounds like a scene from Son of the Mask.

850
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,920
Like this seems like he's like he's like being wacky, extra wacky or something.

851
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,160
Yeah, I mean, it'd be a funny scene, but not funnier than the scene

852
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,360
where the son of the mask performs a rip and rendition of

853
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,400
is just too good to be true.

854
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,720
Can't take my eyes off of you, but it's a rap version.

855
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,400
You're seeing this clip.

856
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,240
I know I have not seen what you're talking about.

857
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,200
Obviously, I like it already, but I've never seen it.

858
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,720
It's they're trying to do the like, you know,

859
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,920
the equivalent of the like Samba club scene or whatever the first one.

860
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,440
But they do it with a rap version of that song like you just do good to be true.

861
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,000
Can't take my eyes off of you. I love you, baby.

862
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,560
Oh, my God. It's something.

863
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,400
Bug main favorite.

864
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,640
Oh, I believe that sounds right.

865
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,760
Anyway, let's get off of this.

866
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,880
Back to us.

867
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,480
Back to someone else with what who looks like he has a wet handshake spike.

868
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
As a way to probably dogs get wet.

869
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,920
It happens. Yes, they get wet.

870
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,920
They they sweat different ways.

871
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,440
He lives in needle. It's the desert. It's hot.

872
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,920
Yeah. So he's the most popular, I think, of all those characters.

873
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,040
But the first I think that's right. Yeah.

874
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But OK, so the rest of the characters, Snoopy has a sister named Bell,

875
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,880
and she probably has my favorite character description.

876
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,360
I'm assuming you're looking at it.

877
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,000
She is Snoopy's sister and has an unnamed teenage son.

878
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,800
I read that and I texted you.

879
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,040
This seems like something you came up with.

880
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,480
Snoot Snoopy's sister who has a teenage son,

881
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,320
an unnamed teenage son,

882
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,920
unnamed, and he's long. He's real long. He's tall.

883
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,280
He's long and tall.

884
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,760
Did she forget to name him?

885
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,680
It's unclear.

886
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,720
OK, Snoopy has a brother named Marbles.

887
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,120
He was a smart one.

888
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,320
Bell was from 1976. Marbles is from 1982.

889
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,200
He is the smart one, as Jason said.

890
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,160
And then we got to the I guess probably our second favorite, I'm guessing.

891
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,400
Olaf. Yes.

892
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,880
Hmm. He's a little stout guy.

893
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,600
It seems like it's a little chubs.

894
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,560
1989, he is the family misfit

895
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,160
and was originally referred to as ugly Olaf,

896
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,400
which I do not care for. I do not care.

897
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,600
I think it's too mean when they introduce him.

898
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,520
They introduce him as winning the ugly dog contest.

899
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,960
And Lucy is very excited, but Olaf clearly does not care for it.

900
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,640
Oh, yeah. Go.

901
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,000
People should go to peanuts dot fandom dot com and find this.

902
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,960
This is great. Lucy saying he won. Olaf won.

903
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,640
Your brother won the ugly dog contest.

904
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,000
And then it cuts to him and he says rats. Rats.

905
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
Olaf is cute, first of all.

906
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,480
He's not very cute. Yeah.

907
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,280
What is what's up with his his face, though?

908
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,040
It is like these like big they like liver lips, McGraw, like big droopy lips.

909
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,320
Is that what I'm looking at?

910
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,440
Yeah, there's one picture.

911
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,520
I think he's drawn differently depending on the one picture on the wiki.

912
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,800
He has got a weird mouth.

913
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,840
I will say I will agree with that.

914
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,160
I'm looking at a color photo, which I think is from the special Snoopy's

915
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,600
reunion that gets all these characters together.

916
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,880
And in this he's got like a bright red tongue sticking out.

917
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,480
So maybe that's he's just got a permatung a lot of time. Right.

918
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,160
But he said, again, he's a dog.

919
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,120
Certain dogs have a tongue that hangs. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

920
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,120
Yeah. So that's do you do you

921
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,920
who what dog of Snoopy's family?

922
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,360
Who do you think is the closest to your dog, Edwin?

923
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,920
Well, Edwin is a very he's a small dog, but he is long.

924
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,280
I'm constantly commenting about how long he is.

925
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,280
So I guess maybe he's more most like Bell's unnamed teenage son.

926
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,080
Then in that respect,

927
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,560
as you said that he walked into the room, I swear you can't hear you.

928
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,440
But he walked into the room and is just sternly looking at me now.

929
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,040
Like just really focused on me in a strange way.

930
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
No, no, boy, I said when we've been recording remotely for so long. Yeah.

931
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,160
I will say Edwin does not miss the podcast.

932
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,560
Oh, I bet. I bet not.

933
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,000
Does the listeners know this?

934
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,680
How stressed out he gets when the equipment comes out?

935
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,280
Yeah, I don't know if we said that. Yeah, we figured out.

936
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,400
I mean, he he does not like people coming over.

937
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,280
It stresses him out.

938
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,600
And he has gotten to the point where if I just set up microphone stands

939
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,200
in the living room, he starts humping my leg like furiously.

940
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,120
And it's with things like that,

941
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,440
you would assume the dog would get more comfortable and used to it.

942
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,200
He's gotten worse.

943
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,840
He is not he has not gotten used to that.

944
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,600
So during quarantine, he's just living it up.

945
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,760
Do you feel comfortable naming the guest

946
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,440
who Edwin had the biggest amount of trouble with?

947
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,680
I think I know what you're going to say, but there's been a couple of people.

948
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,880
There have been a few, but I just I think the listeners

949
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,200
would might most want to know that he had a little bit of trouble

950
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,720
with a certain bad man.

951
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,960
Yeah, yes, it happened. Nick Mundy.

952
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,400
Mundy moves fast.

953
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,640
So what happens with Edwin is that you kind of have to come in slow.

954
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,120
You say hello to him.

955
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,160
He'll kind of walk over to you and sniff you.

956
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,720
And even then, sometimes he'll do what I call like a cheap shot.

957
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,760
He'll kind of try to nip at your heel a little bit or like grab

958
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,960
a little bit of pants because he's a coward.

959
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,400
But I think one of the first or second times that Mundy came in,

960
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,400
Mundy just barrels right into into the apartment

961
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,000
and Edwin went right at his pants, like just like

962
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,520
and like pulling on his pants a little more aggressively than normal.

963
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,600
And Mundy's funny. He's like, it's fine. It's fine.

964
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,800
Everything's fine. It's so don't worry about it.

965
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,520
Don't worry about it.

966
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,640
I go, well, just like slow down and maybe like greet the dog.

967
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,720
Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about it. It's fine.

968
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,120
No, can't do it. Yeah. Yeah.

969
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,760
I'm on the move, Duder.

970
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,880
So so, yeah, when Mundy comes over,

971
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,760
he nipped a little at Rachel Bloom, I think.

972
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,120
I think so. Yes.

973
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,920
We made her talk about a water park for hours

974
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,360
and a dog nips at her and a week later, she's like doing bits at the Emmys.

975
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
What was the classier affair?

976
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,080
I, yeah, she, yeah, she and she did all the right.

977
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,840
She like was like gentle with him and then like, yeah,

978
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,520
he's very specific about like where you pet him.

979
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,440
Sometimes Jason has even done this and he likes Jason.

980
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,040
He wags when he sees Jason.

981
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,800
But Jason, you were petting him like on his sides.

982
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,680
Sometimes he gets weird about his sides.

983
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,840
Yeah, I'm to Mary.

984
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,960
He humped Mary Holland's leg to.

985
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,400
He it was accidental, though, because he doesn't do that with strangers.

986
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,400
But what happens is somebody buzzed the door right as she came in.

987
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,560
And she when he was like comfortable with her and he gets freaked out by that

988
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,160
buzzer and he just like on instinct,

989
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,400
just like started humping the nearest leg he could find.

990
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,960
I was like, oh, God, and I like pulling him off.

991
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,160
I say that one day Edwin

992
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,520
has the possibility of humping Michael Eisner.

993
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,480
I mean, well, no, we really hit the big time.

994
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,200
How many great things about Michael Eisner, I mean, to come over to my apartment.

995
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah, we never talked about that.

996
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,040
That's how it would be.

997
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,840
But I mean, it's you know, Obama went to the garage.

998
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,200
Yeah, the garage. Yeah.

999
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,520
So why not? Yeah.

1000
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,280
And to be surprised by Edwin,

1001
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,440
I'm in his leg and say, hello.

1002
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,080
I mean, I we wouldn't even need to do the interview.

1003
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,200
Just film that. Yeah.

1004
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,400
Just him having to buzz in here, getting out of like a car.

1005
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,480
He's like 82 years old.

1006
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,080
Like like just him going, what am I doing here?

1007
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,040
And then Edwin humping him.

1008
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,080
We don't even need we can just tell the story on the podcast and we just as good.

1009
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, I think you just leave anyway.

1010
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,080
So that's probably true.

1011
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,840
That would be our only goodbye. Goodbye.

1012
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Bye bye. Goodbye.

1013
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,280
OK, let's go. All right.

1014
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,960
Oh, I was like, yeah, those are the siblings.

1015
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,480
And then Andy is the last one who appeared in 94.

1016
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,360
He is Shaggy.

1017
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,880
He's a Shaggy dog and always appears with Olaf.

1018
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,440
Yeah. And the family has been in his World War One Flying Ace fantasy.

1019
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Wait, there's two more.

1020
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,240
Oh, am I missing two? Oh, I know.

1021
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,880
Oh, yes, I see. I see. Yes. Yes. OK. Go for it. Go for it.

1022
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,160
Yeah. So this is very, very specific.

1023
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,240
There's two more siblings, Molly and Rover, and they are TV exclusive.

1024
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,200
They first appeared in Snoopy's reunion and then kind of like

1025
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,160
and later on mentioned in the comic strip Snoopy's dad says

1026
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,680
he gets like a birthday card or a father's day card.

1027
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,080
He says all eight of them signed it.

1028
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:48,280
So eight would be Snoopy, Spike, Bell, Marbles, Olaf, Andy,

1029
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,320
and then Molly and Rover. Molly and Rover as names.

1030
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,680
It does feel like those are TV people phoning it in

1031
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,440
kind of kind of simple names.

1032
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,480
Let's fund an Olaf. Yeah.

1033
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,680
You're saying it's a it's a it's a Helen test situation.

1034
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,680
Yeah, kind of kind of.

1035
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,400
I mean, Andy's kind of simple, too.

1036
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,080
But I mean, Marbles is very fun.

1037
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,200
Olaf is very fun. Bell is unique.

1038
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,040
A lot of these strips with the I mean, these are definitely worth looking up

1039
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,360
the way these characters get introduced, because there's some very funny moments

1040
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,400
like when Snoopy writes a letter to Charlie Brown

1041
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,840
about Bell and his nephew and says,

1042
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,520
as I said, my sister's son is a disappointment.

1043
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,240
This is OK.

1044
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,680
Yeah, Marbles.

1045
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,680
It's our when Marbles Marbles shows up

1046
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,200
and goes to Peppermint's Peppermint Patty's house accidentally.

1047
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,200
And there's a strip and she says, so you're Marbles.

1048
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,600
I know your weird brother.

1049
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,200
Thank you. I don't know why that's just so great.

1050
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,840
That stuff, that stuff, that sort of flies in the face

1051
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,720
of what the people are saying about the strip getting like less dark or like

1052
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,000
that's all like kind of mean, weird humor.

1053
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,200
Yeah, not like completely light and frivolous.

1054
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1055
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,520
But there was a lot of Fod, like mumbly darkness

1056
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,480
in the one of the things that I watched, because I wanted to see something good

1057
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,800
that spike factored heavily into.

1058
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,600
And, you know, I think he's mainly from the strips.

1059
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,960
But he has a very big role in the

1060
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,480
the special Snoopy's getting married, Charlie Brown,

1061
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,240
which just that in and of itself, that it's about

1062
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,400
you don't even get to meet her, really.

1063
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,360
You just suddenly in the special, you just heard the news that Snoopy's

1064
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,080
getting married to a poodle named Genevieve Genevieve.

1065
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,000
So you know about Genevieve already.

1066
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,120
Well, I found an article called the 10 Peanuts characters.

1067
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,680
You've probably forgotten. Oh, great.

1068
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,600
Uh, on Mental Floss, that common Genevieve is number three.

1069
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,480
Oh, oh, I'm so curious who tops Genevieve.

1070
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,560
I don't I don't have much to say about this special, except that it's nice to see

1071
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,000
where Spike lives, which is in a cactus with a door

1072
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,880
next to a cactus that is a mailbox where he gets the invite

1073
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,360
to Snoopy's wedding.

1074
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,080
And then he has to he has no money.

1075
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,440
He's like a bum kind of.

1076
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,240
So he has to like do little odd jobs to have the bus fare.

1077
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,640
He doesn't use a magical way to get to wherever the peanuts live.

1078
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,280
He just needs bus fare.

1079
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,640
So he has to be in a dog race, which is very humiliating for him.

1080
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,640
And he's just sitting on a bus.

1081
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,000
And and then and then at the end, especially get to hear like a really sincere

1082
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,240
like wedding song sung by Sally,

1083
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,880
who in this is one of the specials where Sally is voiced by Stacey Ferguson,

1084
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,840
a.k.a. Fergie.

1085
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,640
Did you know that? Oh, wow.

1086
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,920
I know that. Yeah.

1087
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,040
Fergie was was Sally in a couple of them.

1088
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,480
So it's this it's this wonderful, sincere, like barely even referencing the dog thing.

1089
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,640
It's just a nice love song sung to two dogs by the singer of Milk Money.

1090
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,480
And then Genevieve is just ends up

1091
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,120
cheating on him with a golden retriever, and that's it.

1092
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,040
Wait, so I hear.

1093
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,600
Well, I see Snoopy's fiance runs off with Snoopy's brother, Spike.

1094
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
What? Not in the special.

1095
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,240
Oh, oh, what?

1096
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,240
That's what the the mental floss says.

1097
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,040
That's what it says on mental floss.

1098
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,080
And then so Snoopy's heartbroken and he receives a letter from Spike

1099
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,520
after that saying that the ex fiance then ran off with a coyote.

1100
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,120
Genevieve, she gets around.

1101
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,320
I think that OK here, I think what the deal is that they cleaned it up for that special.

1102
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,920
That's too that that's too grim.

1103
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,680
Yeah. But this was the strip.

1104
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,120
I think this happened in the strip.

1105
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,720
Well, I mean, your brother stealing your fiance at the wedding.

1106
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,520
That's that'd be a little dark.

1107
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,920
Yes, this is crazy.

1108
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,600
So that quote I was referencing earlier because they were talking about Schultz,

1109
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,340
because Schultz said that he was going to be a little bit more of a

1110
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,700
I was referencing earlier because they were talking about Schultz,

1111
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,380
because Schultz said that he thinks he made a blunder in putting the siblings in.

1112
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,460
But this is all very heady, dark stuff.

1113
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,820
So I don't know what he's talking about.

1114
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,660
He said he realized a couple of years ago when I began

1115
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,660
to introduce Snoopy's brothers and sisters, it destroyed the relationship

1116
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,340
that Snoopy has with the kids.

1117
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,260
I know that it destroys the relationship.

1118
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,460
This is just a different set of characters to have horrible things happen to them.

1119
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:38,300
Well, and I also loved getting to watch the fun is less like dogs getting dressed up.

1120
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,260
And more watching Charlie Brown like, good grief, my dog's getting married,

1121
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,220
watching him have to like organize a bachelor party,

1122
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,940
which happens.

1123
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,820
I mean, that's great.

1124
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,540
That's great. Charlie Brown business.

1125
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,540
And it's like that's like Merv Griffin Seinfeld.

1126
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,740
Like, yes, is it maybe the core idea of the original strip?

1127
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,500
No. But is it great? Yes.

1128
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,380
Yeah. Things have to stretch.

1129
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,060
This is decades into peanuts.

1130
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,940
We got to have some fun.

1131
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,740
So here, I'll just read a couple of the characters

1132
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,860
that you probably forgot about.

1133
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,420
Charlotte Braun.

1134
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,580
Do you guys know Charlotte Braun?

1135
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,580
No, no.

1136
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,180
I don't know many peanuts characters with a last name.

1137
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,940
You mean Ava Braun's last name?

1138
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,180
Oh, wow.

1139
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,060
Charlotte Braun was written as the female version of Charlie Brown.

1140
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,340
In fact, she looked just like him, except she had curly hair.

1141
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,420
She, too, was ostracized by her peers, but it was because she was loud

1142
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:43,380
and obnoxious, a fact she constantly pointed out during her appearance

1143
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,220
in the comic strip.

1144
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,180
That's too fucked up for me.

1145
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,460
And she was introduced in 1954.

1146
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Huh?

1147
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,540
I love Bram Brown.

1148
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,700
The Brown equivalent being Braun is great.

1149
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,620
Yes. I mean, maybe they what?

1150
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,820
Maybe they pronounced it Brown, but it's spelled Braun.

1151
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,060
Full disclosure, that took me a second to get that wordplay.

1152
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,020
I get it makes more sense to me now.

1153
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,860
There a little bit more about her in this in this article.

1154
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,540
Shortly after her introduction in 1954, Schultz received a letter

1155
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,540
from Elizabeth Swain, a young fan in Pittsburgh, who told him to get rid

1156
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,420
of Braun because Swain found the character annoying and unfunny.

1157
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,940
Schultz wrote Swain a letter saying that he would soon discard Braun as requested.

1158
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,860
He he added a touch of dark humor by saying that Swain would have the death

1159
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,180
of an innocent child on your conscience.

1160
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,700
He wrote that to her.

1161
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,540
Are you prepared to accept such responsibility?

1162
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,500
Wow, Schultz rules.

1163
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,980
Wait, one more thing.

1164
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,980
Next to his signature, he included a sketch of Charlotte Braun

1165
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,820
with an ax stuck in her head.

1166
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,140
Wow. Wow.

1167
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,100
Amazing research, Mike.

1168
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,380
She showed up in the bronze showed up in the comic one more time,

1169
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,580
but then never returned.

1170
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,700
I have to go now. My planet needs me.

1171
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,940
Yeah.

1172
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,700
Whoa, that's amazing.

1173
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,660
That's early, like letting fans drive it.

1174
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,700
That's some pre-release the Snyder cut.

1175
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,180
Yes, it is.

1176
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,500
That was the original Snyder cut.

1177
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,300
Oh, my God.

1178
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,420
There's a character called Tapioca Pudding.

1179
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,260
Is that a person that I like?

1180
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,660
Let me see. I'm looking I should the images did not load on the website,

1181
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,420
so I need to find separate images.

1182
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,420
Here she is.

1183
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,980
She just kind of looks like Sally.

1184
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,500
So Tapioca Pudding was introduced in 1986.

1185
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,980
She said that with her blonde hair, smile and catchy name,

1186
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,340
her father believes they can make a million dollars by licensing her image

1187
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,700
for products like T-shirts, lunchboxes and greeting cards.

1188
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:03,460
She was created in the 80s purely to be licensed for use on products.

1189
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,260
She was taking it was like taking a jab at like cash grab characters.

1190
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,900
Wow. Her name, as well as other hints throughout the story,

1191
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,660
suggests that the real target of Schultz's satire was probably

1192
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:20,900
Strawberry Shortcake, a character originally featured on a line of greeting cards.

1193
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:25,460
Oh, satire with your merch. Amazing.

1194
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:33,580
Yes. So he was, yeah, doing some some satire of cash grab characters.

1195
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,380
This is made me so maybe like Charles Schultz way more.

1196
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,260
This is all awesome. Mm hmm.

1197
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,460
Let's see here.

1198
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,700
Some of these aren't as good as the other ones.

1199
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,940
The goose eggs. Have you ever heard of the goose eggs?

1200
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:52,060
No. After Charlie Brown took a bite of his old nemesis,

1201
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:56,060
the kite eating tree, he received a stern letter from the Environmental Protection Agency

1202
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,060
convinced he's headed to jail. Charlie Brown went on the lam.

1203
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:04,300
He met a group of little leaguers, Austin, Ruby, Leland and Milo,

1204
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,900
who asked him to coach their team, the goose eggs.

1205
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,060
The kids are young and small.

1206
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,540
The catcher's mask completely covers Leland's head.

1207
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,860
Milo can't even lift the bat to swing it.

1208
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:16,820
And Austin asks how he's supposed to get down from the pitcher's mound.

1209
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,340
So they're underdogs for sure.

1210
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,980
Of course, their first game is against Charlie Brown's friends

1211
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,740
who refuse to play because they're afraid they'll step on the little kids.

1212
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,860
It's here that Charlie Brown learns he can go back home

1213
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,620
as the evidence against him was destroyed when the kite

1214
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,620
eating tree blew over in a storm.

1215
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,820
Charlie Brown is on the lam and meets a bunch of tiny kids.

1216
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:40,940
What?

1217
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,140
See, OK, so this is one of my.

1218
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,740
This is one of my big things is I think as much as I like

1219
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:53,660
the peanut stuff in the parks, I need a little more of this madness.

1220
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,100
Like I went a little

1221
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,660
a little more weirdness, a little more on we, you know.

1222
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,340
It's all pretty sanitized in the parks.

1223
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,300
That's very true.

1224
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,260
So if that's our general, that's what this is.

1225
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,660
All this is saying is this is a our plus up would be

1226
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,900
let's get weird peanuts into the parks.

1227
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,900
Yes, there's a there's at least this one more.

1228
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,300
I have to because it's dark.

1229
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,100
It's very dark character.

1230
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Emily in 1995.

1231
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,660
Does anyone know Emily from Peanuts? No.

1232
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,660
Charlie Brown met a girl named Emily who asked him to be her partner

1233
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,980
in a dance class after they shared an enchanted afternoon.

1234
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,620
Charlie Brown was smitten.

1235
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,780
But at the next class, Emily was absent when Charlie Brown

1236
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,620
asked the instructor where Emily is.

1237
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,100
He's told there's no one there by that name.

1238
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,100
It turns out Charlie Brown was dancing alone

1239
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,460
and talking to himself the whole time.

1240
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,940
Emily was merely a figment of his lonely imagination.

1241
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,540
Dear God.

1242
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,660
She is.

1243
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,300
Yes, Charlie Brown is so sad, he creates a character in his mind

1244
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,340
that he believes is real.

1245
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,620
Wow. Wow.

1246
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,940
I think that plot is in a TGIF show.

1247
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,260
I want to say I wanted to say it was Urkel,

1248
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,460
but it actually might be step by step.

1249
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,860
The invention of a ghost at a dance.

1250
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,860
So you're not alone.

1251
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,100
Yes. I wonder if Schultz.

1252
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,300
I mean, this was from 95.

1253
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,300
I wonder if he stole it from TGIF.

1254
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:31,140
It itself was a satire to show that he didn't like step by step.

1255
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,900
Let's see. OK, there's Peggy Jean.

1256
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,700
Charlie Brown and his girlfriend, Peggy Jean, met on the boat docks

1257
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,140
at summer camp in 1990.

1258
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,900
Peggy Jean gave Charlie Brown his first kiss, said she loved him

1259
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,260
and wrote letters to him after camp was over.

1260
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,980
Sadly, he never received those letters.

1261
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,700
That's because upon meeting her, he was so nervous

1262
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,460
that he introduced himself as Brownie Charles.

1263
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,820
A mistake he was too embarrassed to correct.

1264
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,460
So when the mailman tried to deliver Peggy Jean's letters,

1265
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,660
Sally turned them away, saying no one by that name lived at the address,

1266
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,780
which come on, Sally.

1267
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,860
That's pretty close to your brother's name.

1268
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,740
Sally, God damn it.

1269
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,100
Brownie Charles.

1270
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,500
Which, by the way, Brownie Charles is a great name.

1271
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,020
Yeah, I'm going to use that as a pseudonym from now.

1272
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,660
I'm going to use that as like an alias.

1273
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,620
When you need to check into a hotel.

1274
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,420
Yeah, when I check in.

1275
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,060
When we're on the road doing shows.

1276
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,020
Yeah, Brownie Charles.

1277
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,940
I'll pay in cash.

1278
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,620
Jason's too famous here in Pigeon Forge.

1279
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,260
Better go by Brownie Charles.

1280
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,180
Hopefully, the hopefully the listeners don't hear this.

1281
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,700
No.

1282
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,700
Ask for Brownie Charles.

1283
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,420
I don't know the code.

1284
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,940
Oh, I have to use Charlotte Braun.

1285
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,460
So, yeah, that's basically that's the that's the next that's that's

1286
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,100
wow, there's a couple more, but they're not as good as those.

1287
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,220
Yeah, I this is this is all great.

1288
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,740
It's it's nice to hear about this this expanded universe.

1289
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,140
And I would like to see more of this in the parks.

1290
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,580
You know, if I could bring it back to theme park world into Camp Snoopy,

1291
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:19,980
I think maybe the segue back in is that there are, you know,

1292
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:24,660
there's a couple of ways that the characters live, especially in

1293
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,180
the theme park world.

1294
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,580
There's you know, there's the camp Snoopy rides and then there's these

1295
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,140
there's little shows in a very small little outdoor amphitheater,

1296
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,660
which I find very charming,

1297
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,620
because like I'm the most familiar with the Halloween one.

1298
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,620
I think I saw it in person one time.

1299
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:43,180
And it's it's usually it's the peanuts characters and then one actress

1300
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,740
who is not dressed as a peanut,

1301
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,500
who kind of leads them in some very mild choreography.

1302
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,940
And it's really nice seeing Charlie Brown with a Frankenstein head.

1303
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,820
You know, like just the adjust the green and the flat top shoved

1304
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,380
on top of his head and doing like really slow dancing to Ghostbusters.

1305
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,380
I believe we saw that the same day we saw the ice skating show.

1306
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,180
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1307
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,740
Because there was a thriller parody.

1308
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,820
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,780
Call it which they night.

1310
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:16,900
Oh, they changed it. Yeah.

1311
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,700
They took out for a year and then put back.

1312
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,260
That's how it. Yeah.

1313
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:27,060
Because it's like, yeah, I believe it was like, because it's a spooky,

1314
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,020
spooky night.

1315
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,300
That's right. They did a parody to make it.

1316
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,060
They like scarified it.

1317
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,780
But then just to a diff, it's already scary. Right.

1318
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,780
I don't know. I don't understand either.

1319
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,660
Why changing Monster Mash to Zombie Mash?

1320
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,500
Right. The lateral move.

1321
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,020
Yes. I don't know if they like save some money that way.

1322
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,460
I don't know what the rationale behind it was.

1323
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,420
They have that. Yeah, there's this little stage at knots.

1324
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,140
And they do that show and they do that.

1325
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,300
I think Jason mentioned earlier, Space Beagle.

1326
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,820
They do the show.

1327
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,060
Jason and I saw a little bit of Space Beagle when we were there in January.

1328
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,100
They have Space Beagle was fun.

1329
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,260
Yeah, I like that.

1330
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,660
It's a similar setup, though.

1331
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:12,940
There's like one human three care, like Charlie Brown characters

1332
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,900
that come in and out and they dance to songs.

1333
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:21,180
And then what we saw, they had some fun, like Woodstock antics, too.

1334
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,900
They would like pop up different Woodstocks around the theater.

1335
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,700
I don't know if that's new. I don't know if that's a plus up, but

1336
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,540
they would do like some fun stuff with Woodstock,

1337
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,740
which I don't believe they did in when we saw the Snoopy Halloween show.

1338
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,180
Yeah, because Snoopy had gone to the moon and the aliens were lots of little

1339
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,700
Woodstocks. And that was great.

1340
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,340
There there's a dude.

1341
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,460
Yeah, there's a Snoopy in space, like series of shorts on Apple TV

1342
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,820
that I watched one of.

1343
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:53,820
And I thought like, oh, was that show connecting to this thing?

1344
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,100
And then I'm like, oh, wait, no, half of this, like over half of the Snoopy

1345
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,580
lands in the parks are called Planet Snoopy.

1346
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,180
So yeah, duh, make up Snoopy in space thing.

1347
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,300
But he went to space a good amount in the comic strip. So.

1348
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,620
Well, he has like a connection to NASA, too.

1349
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,420
Yes. Yes, he gets letters from NASA in the TV show.

1350
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,940
Like Apollo 10, he was affiliated with the Apollo 10 mission.

1351
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,740
Do you do you know what I'm talking about?

1352
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,220
What do you mean by affiliated?

1353
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,260
All right, there's here. I had to find the article here.

1354
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,100
I completely forgot about this because they were like celebrating this

1355
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,180
last year at Comic Con.

1356
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,740
NASA and peanuts celebrate Apollo 10's 50th anniversary.

1357
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:39,540
There was, let's see, the agency like he was like kind of the mascot

1358
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,540
for the mission, I believe.

1359
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,380
And hold on, I'm now I'm reading this is before the blimp,

1360
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,340
because he's also met blimp guy.

1361
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,860
Yeah, life. Yes.

1362
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,500
Yeah. Vamp for a second while I just read real quick.

1363
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,460
Well, let me what I was going to bring it around to.

1364
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,220
And you you mentioned the Woodstock thing.

1365
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,500
There's a lot of little Woodstock puppets that pop up in a show

1366
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,580
that I think maybe debuted this year.

1367
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,300
It's on a bigger stage further into the park

1368
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,460
called Woodstock's Music Festival.

1369
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:18,140
And I can't not read the these aren't original characters.

1370
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:22,140
But of course, Snoopy had a lot of different guises, you know, Joe Cool,

1371
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,060
among them.

1372
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,540
And they introduce a lot of guises within this music,

1373
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:32,300
this rock themed show why he shows up as Jimmy Houndrix

1374
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,740
as as Fido Mercury.

1375
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,700
Yes. To perform bone bone he me and Rhapsody.

1376
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:46,300
He there is a rap section where he appears as Sir Barks a lot.

1377
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:50,860
And the parody that they do there is just Snoopy got back.

1378
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,540
They just keep it back.

1379
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:55,180
And he kind of like shows you his tail.

1380
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,820
So that's nice.

1381
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,220
A little, a little body.

1382
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,220
It's a tad body for me, but it's all it'll do.

1383
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:08,140
And then Woodstock appears as Bird Cobain.

1384
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,020
This is the Woodstock Music Festival.

1385
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,980
Yeah. Yeah, that's what they call it.

1386
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,260
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1387
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:24,340
I do we think do we think Bird Cobain committed suicide or was he murdered?

1388
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,060
I don't really want to explore any of these options.

1389
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,860
All of these, these are all tragically killed.

1390
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:35,100
Yes. But the pun base bases of these names.

1391
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,540
And the one you haven't said had a bad end.

1392
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,740
The one you haven't said yet had a bad end, too.

1393
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,820
Oh, you're you're you're aware, Mike, of where I'm going with this.

1394
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know. I saw him.

1395
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1396
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:55,340
Because this show culminates in, you know, Snoopy keeps kind of disappearing

1397
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,020
and then reappearing in different guises.

1398
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,100
And at the end of the show, they want to wrap it up with him.

1399
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,420
But where is he?

1400
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,940
And then suddenly a blast of purple light and the familiar beginning

1401
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,100
said sounds of let's go crazy.

1402
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,900
And he comes out as paw prince.

1403
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:17,380
I mean, Christopher Caldwell would be so upset if he saw paw prints.

1404
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,500
He would be just his the steam would be blowing out of his ears.

1405
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,860
If I could clockwork orange Christopher Caldwell

1406
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,340
and just show him the full video of Woodstock's music festival.

1407
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,500
Yeah, he would really every every Snoopy.

1408
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,340
I should actually just Snoopy doing dancing to Gangnam Style

1409
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,140
in a 24 hour loop. Yes.

1410
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,580
I think I have a knockout blow for Christopher Caldwell.

1411
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,660
Good. Great. Good.

1412
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,300
Good. In 2020, he published a book called The Age of Entitlement

1413
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:54,740
America Since the 60s, which seems to be mostly him

1414
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,100
complaining about the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

1415
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,820
Oh, my God. What?

1416
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,220
Yes. And a review of the book quote from Jonathan Roche.

1417
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,900
If you think Caldwell sounds like Bannon, the self appointed tribute

1418
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:15,740
self appointed tribune of Trumpian working class populism, you're right.

1419
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,380
So this guy sucks shit.

1420
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,820
This guy's really bad.

1421
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,580
We got to make sure we got to make sure it's the same guy.

1422
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,100
That's how we have for one guy.

1423
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,300
Is there anything because he doesn't like Snoopy

1424
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,580
and then we say like shit on his grave.

1425
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,980
He's saying it's like some conservative ghoul, and we're just running him down.

1426
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,740
Contributor to the Atlantic Monthly.

1427
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,900
Well, I mean, all right, if it is the same person

1428
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,020
and that just goes to show that this is the kind of monster

1429
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,700
who wouldn't like Snoopy.

1430
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,580
A goblin, a living goblin.

1431
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,580
Spooky, spooky guy guy.

1432
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:01,300
I found the answer to the Apollo 10 Apollo 10 missions.

1433
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:05,300
Call signs were the names of peanuts characters, Charlie Brown and Snoopy,

1434
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,540
who became Apollo 10 semi official mascots.

1435
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,060
And peanuts creator Charles Schultz also drew mission related artwork for NASA.

1436
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,660
Oh, so that's great.

1437
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:16,500
The space connection.

1438
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,220
And that's why they did those space cartoons and stuff.

1439
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,940
Real quick about Woodstock's music festival.

1440
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:27,420
I think, Scott, you started to say there's a bunch of little Woodstock puppets in it

1441
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,660
and they pop up and they have little instruments like a little trumpet

1442
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,700
or a little harmonica.

1443
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,220
And that's just so great.

1444
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,860
I mean, it's so so good.

1445
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,940
These little shows, if just if if anyone listen,

1446
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:45,020
if anyone ends up at not very funny, if you go if you go to nots a lot,

1447
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,980
you probably know about these little shows.

1448
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,380
But if you're just in town and trying to hit parks quick,

1449
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,460
do you carve out the time to watch one of these these charming little shows?

1450
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,420
I find them so delightful.

1451
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,180
There's a lot.

1452
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:00,460
Scott, did you find the show Beach Blanket Beagle?

1453
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,340
I didn't. I have.

1454
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,500
There are some beach songs in the show Blockbuster Beagle.

1455
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,340
But but these these are different things.

1456
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,980
You go ahead.

1457
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,220
Well, I don't have too much.

1458
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,740
I just that there's a few Beach Boys songs in there.

1459
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,700
So I would I would think that Beach Blanket Beagle would be a big

1460
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,100
you'd be a big fan of it.

1461
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,180
That does sound nice.

1462
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:28,260
I was excited because Blockbuster Beagle has a big it's about Snoopy

1463
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,900
wanting to make it in Hollywood called Well Be Damned.

1464
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,900
And he there's a big sequence around Muscle Beach,

1465
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,220
where you get a mashup of David Lee Roth's California Girls

1466
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,740
and Katy Perry's California Girls.

1467
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,700
Oh, I like that.

1468
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,740
So that's that is that is a ball.

1469
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,180
That's a blast.

1470
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,940
There are there are like so many shows, especially during Peanut Celebration.

1471
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:53,020
They have like a little they didn't.

1472
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,660
Spike has obviously is disco.

1473
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,380
They have that little space show they had.

1474
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,780
I think there was a was there Snoopy on Ice still happening?

1475
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,420
I mean, usually every time we even there, we saw a Christmas show this year.

1476
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,940
We went to that Christmas event. Right.

1477
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,460
So like there's like four different shows

1478
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,500
potentially running at the same time at Nats.

1479
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,820
Maybe between two and four, I would say.

1480
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,980
Maybe more is during celebration.

1481
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,620
Mike, you and I went down for it this year and kind of blitzed through it.

1482
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,900
Like we didn't see everything.

1483
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,100
The other thing that happened, we tried to get on the train

1484
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,100
because they have little peanuts cutouts

1485
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:35,420
on during like scenes in the train.

1486
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:40,660
Like there's a scene of the Daisy Hill family, which is Snoopy and all his siblings.

1487
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,940
That's their family band.

1488
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,820
But we we try to get on the train.

1489
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,300
The train was down, too.

1490
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,740
So we couldn't get on the train.

1491
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:51,900
We miss Spike. But but but but

1492
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:57,580
we did we did get the get the thing we came for.

1493
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:01,300
The number one thing which we haven't talked about yet,

1494
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,140
which I've been excited about is that we made a beeline for it.

1495
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,700
We walked around Snoopy taking pictures to get to this.

1496
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,300
We shoved Snoopy over to get to this specific photo op.

1497
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:19,980
And that was to get Jason with Pigpen in the livery stable.

1498
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,380
Oh, boy. It was great.

1499
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,980
Mission number one. It was mission.

1500
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,500
Mission number one. I wanted a photo, too.

1501
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,380
I have a photo with Pigpen in the livery stable.

1502
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,100
Of course, I'm not a crazy person.

1503
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,660
I'm going to get that photo as well.

1504
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:39,340
So that yes, they were really they had a lot of things to offer.

1505
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,900
And that was number one on our list.

1506
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,740
And we did it right away.

1507
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,940
He gave us hugs. He was so happy to see us.

1508
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,380
Like he was feeling was mutual. Yeah.

1509
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,340
He was we yes, we hugged him.

1510
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:55,060
He was dirty. He was covered in soot, but it didn't like stick to us.

1511
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,780
Because they now operate that area as Pigpen's Pigpen.

1512
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,340
Yes. Right.

1513
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:07,540
So there are pigs in there are actual pigs in Pigpen's Pigpen.

1514
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:10,100
Wait, oh, yes, that's right.

1515
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,460
There were yes, that is right.

1516
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,900
There were horses.

1517
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,420
I think horses or dogs.

1518
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,980
They wanted to make sure that the smell was authentic.

1519
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,860
When you meet Pigpen.

1520
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:27,620
They wanted that extra bit of imagineering there to know that if this was truly a dirty,

1521
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,380
messy child, that he would he would have some sort of unpleasant smell.

1522
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,060
So I don't want to put you on the spot, Jason, but if there's any,

1523
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:37,540
it does seem like there's a particular affinity you have for Pigpen.

1524
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:42,020
Is there any way you could explain that to put your thumb on it?

1525
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,380
You know what I like about Pigpen?

1526
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:48,420
Pigpen always has a smile on his face and he's always fucking filthy.

1527
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:52,460
And I just think that is such a great

1528
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,180
one to punch. I just think that's so great.

1529
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:01,340
There is a newer ride they a few years ago for the 30th anniversary

1530
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,740
when they were redoing, I think it was 2014.

1531
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:09,180
They would read it one of the Calico rides and they read it a lot of the

1532
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:15,420
a little bit of the the camp Snoopy for the 20th anniversary to take out rides

1533
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:20,340
that had height limits that like adults couldn't go on to put in rides

1534
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,380
that families like there were no height limits, everyone could go on.

1535
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:26,820
And one of them is called Pigpen's Mud Buggy's.

1536
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,140
And I mean, that's just that's so great.

1537
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:36,900
Well, it's Pigpen's not afraid to be himself, I think is what shines through there.

1538
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:41,300
He might be the most well adjusted of all the characters in a lot of ways.

1539
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:44,500
He's well adjusted. He's always got that big cloud around him.

1540
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,140
He's very powerful.

1541
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,540
Like who can harness a cloud of filth like that? But Pigpen.

1542
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,300
The cloud of filth is almost like a sentient creature

1543
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,300
that can also help Pigpen out.

1544
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,820
Like there's a character in X-Men comics called Phantom X,

1545
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:04,780
who has a nervous system that can like leave his body and turn into a ship.

1546
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,740
Yeah, it's kind of the same thing with Pigpen in that cloud of dust.

1547
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:13,420
It's funny, Michael, as soon as we start, you said the cloud of dust is

1548
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,500
sentient, I started doing the mental math of can I describe

1549
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,100
Phantom X in a very concise way? But you did a great job.

1550
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,460
Thank you. Yes. We both love Phantom X.

1551
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,540
He was created by Grant Morrison.

1552
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,780
He's like French, but not really French.

1553
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:32,980
He's a gentleman.

1554
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,820
French is a gentleman thief,

1555
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,340
and he has a nervous system that shoots out,

1556
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,940
it kind of shoots out of his body and turns into a ship.

1557
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,340
What do we say? Let's go around.

1558
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,820
Let's go around the room here.

1559
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,580
What is everyone who would you say your favorite Peanuts character?

1560
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,020
Would it be Pigpen, Jason?

1561
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,340
I guess either Pigpen or just Snoopy.

1562
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:58,180
I mean, sure, it's hard to top hard to top the king.

1563
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,300
I mean, I love Charlie Brown, too.

1564
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,740
Well, we're not saying we don't have to put any of the other characters down,

1565
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:07,700
but if you had maybe like when you were a kid, who appealed to you the most?

1566
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,420
I think Snoopy, I had a lot of Snoopy toys.

1567
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,140
I had a lot of Peanuts collections.

1568
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:16,700
They were because you could just find them at like libraries

1569
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,500
trying to get rid of books or yard sales.

1570
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,380
There was always peanut stuff for like a quarter.

1571
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,380
And I just had a ton of them.

1572
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:27,060
I think I was I think I like Linus the best as a kid.

1573
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,820
I think I like Linus because he wasn't as sad.

1574
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:35,940
And I think I liked I liked the blanket for whatever reason.

1575
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,580
I like the blanket, too.

1576
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,820
Yeah, I had a blanket as a kid that I was very attached to.

1577
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,740
I think everyone stressed me out a little bit, except for Linus.

1578
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,660
Fair. Yeah. Yeah.

1579
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,820
I think I think maybe now my answer is original Charlie Brown.

1580
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,140
I think it is early 50s.

1581
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,940
He is so cute.

1582
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:00,020
I feel like if I the part of me that is not confident

1583
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,700
about things that I enter into, it's like deep down, you take away all the layers.

1584
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:09,020
And there's a little more baby Charlie Brown in there.

1585
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,300
This little pensive stressed out guy.

1586
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,660
I texted you the pictures of those Japanese toys.

1587
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,780
Take a look at the because they are truly the old design.

1588
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,740
You toys. Oh, gee.

1589
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,660
Oh, so they are.

1590
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,500
I like this Linus a lot.

1591
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,060
Oh, yeah, I like the Schroeder.

1592
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,780
I was so excited to see those because those are the real deal old designs.

1593
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:38,020
Yeah, yeah. Original Charlie, I think, is my is my pick.

1594
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,660
So, yeah, that's I mean, now do I like tapioca pudding?

1595
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:45,340
Yes. Do I like the goose eggs?

1596
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,980
Yes. I like all those characters.

1597
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,860
And I like I like Snoopy's backstabbing fiance, Genevieve.

1598
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:59,780
Yeah. So, I mean, are we thinking that they need to put in something?

1599
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,220
Maybe they need to get Genevieve into a show like you're a show

1600
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:06,660
that is Snoopy's wedding and you kind of watched all that.

1601
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:11,940
You watch her, you know, walk out on him and then show back up with a new guy.

1602
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:15,300
And then Snoopy gets mad and the peanuts hold him back.

1603
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,340
She shows up a spike.

1604
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,860
Yeah, let's just make it spike.

1605
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,780
Yeah, let's go further than the special.

1606
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,420
Yeah, I'd love that.

1607
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,220
She's kind of like, you know, she shows a playfully

1608
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:32,020
twirling his mustache around the biggest insult Snoopy could have at his own wedding.

1609
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:35,900
I mean, if you went to a show at Knott's Berry Farm called Snoopy's Wedding

1610
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:40,700
and then it had genuine drama in it, it was a little more of a

1611
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:45,700
an immersive theater piece where your guests maybe are even handed a backstory

1612
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,020
and you know, you could help Snoopy calm him down,

1613
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:54,300
get him a drink, give him a number of, you know, a more suitable mate.

1614
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:59,180
Yeah, I think I think that they should lean a little bit.

1615
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,740
This all the Snoopy and peanut stuff is just so strictly for kids.

1616
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,300
I mean, except maybe for Woodstock, which gets a little more of like an adult

1617
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,460
reference, and I think here and there in the show, obviously, you said Snoopy's got back.

1618
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,020
That's a little bit a little more adult.

1619
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,900
So I think we need to get a little bit very.

1620
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,620
Yeah, it upsets me.

1621
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:21,700
Lean into that a little bit more for what you're saying

1622
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:26,500
and give us some of these these stories that people might not be as familiar with.

1623
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:30,700
Well, you know, the perfect place to do it is at the

1624
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,300
scary farm, like at the Halloween events.

1625
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:39,740
You know, these don't have to be literal horror shows, but just, you know,

1626
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:44,180
if it's all adults, let's just, you know, let's let's have there be real drama.

1627
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,820
I got it. So when Jason and I were at Nats, they also have, you know,

1628
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,140
like like how they have in the animation part of California Adventure.

1629
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,860
There's a spot where they teach you how to draw peanuts characters.

1630
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,420
And I believe we drew Sally. Is that right, Jason?

1631
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:59,820
We did draw Sally. Yes, we both.

1632
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,620
And both of our they both turned out very different.

1633
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,740
Yeah, I'm sure I have a picture of it somewhere.

1634
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,620
I probably have the actual drawing somewhere, but

1635
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:17,500
they should take that building at night and they should use a Peppers ghost effect

1636
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:22,620
and have Charlie Brown dance with Emily, his imaginary girlfriend.

1637
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,780
Oh, yeah. So you get like a little spooky like dance show with a ghost,

1638
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:33,140
essentially the ghost of Emily, the projection in Charlie's mind,

1639
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:37,180
his ideal woman, and you get to see his fantasy.

1640
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,380
And then, of course, she's going to disappear.

1641
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,100
And then we'll get to watch him sob for a couple of minutes.

1642
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,660
And then he storms out at the end,

1643
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:50,220
like that's his exit from the show and you think it's over.

1644
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,460
But then she comes back right then.

1645
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,340
And like, where did he go?

1646
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,340
Like if he had just waited it out, she would have been back. Right.

1647
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,540
And now she's now she's a practical character.

1648
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,060
Now she's like just a suited up like in a suit.

1649
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,300
Oh, she's human.

1650
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,940
She's a human. Well, not well.

1651
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:10,100
Oh, yeah, maybe it's just a human woman.

1652
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,780
She's not a character.

1653
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,140
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, sure.

1654
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,180
And then and then she goes looking for him.

1655
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,820
But she uses the name.

1656
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,860
What was it? Brownie Brownie Charles?

1657
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:23,180
Yes. Yes. Brownie Charles.

1658
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,940
He's like, I'm looking for Brownie Charles.

1659
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,380
And then we all have to play along and say that. What?

1660
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:30,620
Who are you talking about?

1661
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,580
There's no such person in this theme park.

1662
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,340
We all say that doesn't even sound familiar.

1663
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,980
So it'll be one thing.

1664
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,660
So whoever is like running the show before will be like, so we

1665
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,580
you're going to be a very important part of the show.

1666
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,740
There's going to be a line you have to say at a very important part of the show.

1667
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,620
Now we're going to practice it along together.

1668
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:53,020
Can you say nobody with that name is here at this theme park?

1669
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,700
And then we all practice it together.

1670
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:01,780
And then we say that to Emily and we prevent Charlie from having love in his life.

1671
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:05,220
And it's the most haunting theme park show ever achieved.

1672
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:08,300
Yeah. Scarier than any maze.

1673
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,260
Yeah, because it's it's real fears.

1674
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,220
It's the fear of being alone. And that's right.

1675
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:16,660
Especially at like age nine.

1676
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,300
Yeah. Being alone for your entire long life.

1677
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,820
Well, that is you.

1678
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,020
You survived. Fuck, yes.

1679
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:23,740
The.

1680
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,380
The darkest note on the dark.

1681
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,700
I I yeah, I mean, check out Camp Snoopy if you're at knots or planet Snoopy,

1682
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,780
if you're at one of the other parks, they had some real quick.

1683
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:41,500
They had a couple little touches, dark, not dark touches,

1684
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,700
but stuff I wanted to point out.

1685
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,980
They do make a kite eating tree for peanut celebration.

1686
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,500
That's very good.

1687
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:53,580
And there is a standee child to teacher translator that you can speak into.

1688
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,620
And it'll make the maw sound.

1689
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,340
And then cool. Whoa. Yeah.

1690
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:06,060
And then I those those super seven figures you can find on the Hot Topic website.

1691
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:09,060
And if you type peanuts into Hot Topics website,

1692
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:13,940
they have a lot of cool peanuts T-shirts and I might have to get some.

1693
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:17,020
Oh, give yourself a little treat.

1694
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,300
Of course, there's a lot of cool shirts.

1695
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:22,260
It's like you don't know what topic is. I know.

1696
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:29,420
The I will say like there there is still so much peanut stuff.

1697
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:35,300
I mean, I don't let's not let's say like there's probably maybe in a year or two

1698
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,020
when we go to not see all the peanut shows and do a second gate.

1699
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:44,660
Because I'd love to dig into a few of these a little more eventually.

1700
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,020
But there's too much.

1701
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,420
There's just too much peanuts.

1702
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,540
Meat on the bone is what I'm saying.

1703
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:53,340
So we'll we'll we'll get I'm sure there's more characters, though,

1704
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,060
also that we've never we don't remember.

1705
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,540
Well, and this this episode is a lot of nonsense.

1706
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:01,580
But to bring it back to the theme park.

1707
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:05,500
And I do really like that stupid can be that came to be area.

1708
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,140
I think I'm walking around there.

1709
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:11,780
I always feel the 80s of it, that brown and pine green.

1710
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,540
It's just so it's it's so charming.

1711
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,820
It's like it gives me the same kind of

1712
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:21,500
theme parky feels as parts of Frontierland or the

1713
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:26,180
the Redwood Creek area of California Adventure.

1714
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:27,060
I just think they did.

1715
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,820
They did such a great job with it landscaping wise.

1716
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,260
I really like it there. And the last time we were all there together,

1717
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,660
I realized, oh, this is maybe sort of the in for me

1718
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:40,860
to take my new son to theme parks, because I think early theme park

1719
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,820
visits are tough because there are a lot of things they can't go on.

1720
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,220
But Camp Snoopy is full of little rides.

1721
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:50,100
As Jason, you just said now parents and kids can go on together.

1722
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:55,180
So I'm really psyched to get to get to take my kid on some of these cute little rides.

1723
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:58,140
And hopefully this is kind of the planting the seed

1724
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,460
for bigger theme park fandom to come.

1725
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,860
There is a ride and I'm blanking on the name of it.

1726
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,180
It's a mini drop.

1727
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:08,900
It's a mini giant drop.

1728
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,500
Jason, you remember what I'm talking about?

1729
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,900
It's like there's a postcard on it.

1730
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:13,300
Is that right?

1731
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,580
Is that called the kite because there is a kite eating tree ride

1732
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:19,100
that might be called the kite eating.

1733
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,300
I'll look it up right now.

1734
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:25,300
But yes, it's basically like a kid's version of Tower of Terror.

1735
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:28,740
OK, so you start getting him accustomed to it.

1736
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:32,060
Start him early so he doesn't end up like me.

1737
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:35,620
Do you that's look, we we all want for our children,

1738
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,900
we want them to be better than us.

1739
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:41,180
We want them to not have to do the same, have the same fears.

1740
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:44,900
So let's see if I don't think there's any sort of launch

1741
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:48,700
ride, child launch ride in the Snoopy area.

1742
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:53,500
Yeah, because I don't want him to end up being a no launch

1743
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,140
princess.

1744
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,500
Yeah, step it younger.

1745
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,420
Mini Queen.

1746
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:04,540
Yes. I mean, I like Mini Queen more.

1747
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:07,420
Yeah, Mini Queen is good.

1748
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,780
The ride I'm referencing is called Woodstocks Air Mail.

1749
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,340
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

1750
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,540
The little we haven't talked about the rides, they all seem very

1751
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,860
there's something called Huffin Puff where you you have to push it yourself.

1752
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:23,260
You're like going up and down a little lever and you have to move the mechanism.

1753
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:26,300
And that seems like that seems good, like the mini version of Davy

1754
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,580
Crockett's canoes.

1755
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,300
And the one I really I remember going on this as a kid.

1756
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,260
And I think it's in the other camp Snoopies.

1757
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,860
It's not just at Knott's Berry Farm.

1758
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,140
It's just the most basic name and most basic ride.

1759
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,180
And it's called Camp Bus.

1760
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:41,900
And you're just on a bus and the the Peanuts characters are in the window

1761
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:45,900
and the bus is on an arm and it goes goes in a big circle up and down.

1762
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:50,140
I really want to be on Camp Bus with my little boy.

1763
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:55,340
You have to be 36 inches to be on this Woodstocks Air Mail.

1764
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:58,180
Oh, no, that's right. Oh, there's still I haven't had to think about height

1765
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:00,620
requirements until until this whole thing.

1766
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,900
Yeah. Oh, boy, how big does he have to be for Camp Bus?

1767
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,340
Oh, let me look. Let me look for campus.

1768
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,780
This is why I'm saying we'll get back.

1769
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:10,500
We'll get back to peanuts just because there's so much stuff.

1770
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:14,620
I mean, we got a 36 inch tub boat.

1771
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:19,300
Joe Cool's driving school.

1772
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,460
Camp bus is 36 inches.

1773
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,100
Well, it seems like if you're accompanied, you could be under.

1774
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,180
Oh, yes, I see that. I see that.

1775
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:33,740
Yeah. And he will be accompanied by a dad who's psyched to be on Camp Bus.

1776
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:38,380
I mean, a little stressed out about the movement, but in general, psyched.

1777
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,420
Yeah, mostly. I put my fears aside.

1778
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:42,940
I got to be strong for him. Yeah.

1779
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,860
And we didn't even talk about my mother playing Lucy

1780
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:48,420
in a high school production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.

1781
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,940
I think my mom was in one as well.

1782
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:54,140
I'm pretty sure. I think so.

1783
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:55,620
You got to know what she was.

1784
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,260
Did she play Lucy? You got to find that out.

1785
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,220
I don't remember that. I'm not totally sure.

1786
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,860
I don't think there's any might have been a girls school

1787
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:04,740
where she was playing a male role. I think. Oh, interesting.

1788
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,820
Yeah. Yeah. Not sure.

1789
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,660
So she could find that out.

1790
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,940
I've been Charlie Brown. We'll do that on peanuts, too.

1791
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,780
Yeah. So for pants, too.

1792
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:15,460
Hey, but for now, this is such a fun, fun world to cover.

1793
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,820
I learned a lot. And Charles Schultz is the best.

1794
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:22,500
And yeah, hey, more fun to come, as always.

1798
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:37,660
Yes. And I would just like to say that all clear on the ice cam.

1799
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:40,740
Oh, thank you.

1800
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,900
Oh, OK, OK. No murders.

1801
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,580
No, no bodies being dropped.

1802
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,580
Not a single murder has happened.

1803
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:49,820
Great. Great.

1804
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:53,140
Not even like a pipe burst or a septic tank problem.

1805
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,220
The ice didn't turn brown.

1806
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,180
Not that I could see, though.

1807
01:36:56,180 --> 01:37:01,820
I will say I've been staring at it so long now that I start to think I see things

1808
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:07,180
like maybe like you're seeing, I don't know, a ghost girl, a ghost girl.

1809
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:10,340
I see the ghost of Charles Schultz dancing with the ghost of Emily.

1810
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,580
That's bizarre.

1811
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,780
Yeah, I don't know. It's weird.

1812
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,300
That's what I'm seeing, though.

1813
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,980
I think it's I'm hallucinating, though.

1814
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:24,420
I understand what we're all going mad, but think about peanuts.

1815
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,660
It makes us feel better.

1816
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,940
Well, I guess I'll do it.

1817
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,060
Sir, peanuts, he waited to wrap it up.

1818
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,940
I can do the boy could do the voice.

1819
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,260
Yeah, sure. Yes. Yes.

1820
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,660
Say say goodbye. Let's have an adult say goodbye.

1821
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,660
Did you run that back?

1822
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,700
I dropped I dropped my phone.

1823
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,980
It's a little too far for me, so I will just add it in and post.

1824
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,100
You blockhead.

1825
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,980
Hey, now I don't.

1826
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:50,580
Now I don't have to do it.

1827
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,460
