5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,800
Patrick Begora woke up one bright morning feeling very fine.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,080
He fixed himself a bit of breakfast and set out for his morning stroll.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,200
When he came to the doorway of his snug small house at the roots of an old orange tree,

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Patrick stretched his arms and swelled his chest for a breath of fresh morning air.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,560
Then he lit his pipe.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,720
But his pipe almost fell out of his mouth and his arms froze straight out in the air.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,760
So shocked was he at the sight he saw.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,240
There were people in his orange grove.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,640
Big people striding around as if they owned the place.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,520
Well Patrick Begora was not the last of the little people left in all of movie land for

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,720
nothing.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,440
He had courage did Patrick Begora.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,200
So he stepped right up to those big people to find out what this was all about.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
At first they wouldn't even look at him.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
But Patrick took care of that.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
He stamped down hard, right on the foot of one.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Ow!

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Cried Donald Duck.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
I've been stung.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
What must be bees around here?

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,160
He looked down then.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
What's this?

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
He cried.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Who in the world are you?

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,640
Who are you yourself is the proper question, said Patrick Begora right back.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,180
This is my home.

31
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,980
After all, has been these many years.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,660
And what may I ask are you doing here acting as if you own the place without so much as

33
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,780
a by your leave from Patrick Begora, which is me?

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Who are we?

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Cried Donald Duck.

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,940
Don't you go to the movies?

37
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,740
Don't you watch TV?

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,020
Don't you read books or newspapers?

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,340
Don't you know Goofy and Pluto?

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,020
Don't you know Donald Duck?

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:21,580
No, said Patrick, and he blew a smoke ring right in Donald's face.

42
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,220
My name is Mickey Mouse, sir, said one of the other big people, stooping down to hold

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,420
out his hand.

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,340
So this is your home here, Mr. Begora?

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,740
That it is, said Patrick Begora.

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,860
And I'd be like a little peace and quiet.

47
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,820
I'll thank you all to leave at once.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:47,700
Well, said Mickey, I'm afraid we can't do that.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,900
You see, we're going to start building here soon, going to move all these old trees.

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,340
Move these old trees, start building here, cried Patrick Begora, jumping up and down

51
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,900
in a purple rage.

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,940
Oh, no, you don't.

53
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,020
Not while I'm around.

54
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,540
And what can you do to stop us, little fellow?

55
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,220
Yes, Donald Duck with a chuckle, leaning on his shovel in a cocky way.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,540
I'll show you, said Patrick with a snap of his fingers.

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,420
And down in a heap went Donald Duck, for his shovel handle had splintered just like that.

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,900
What happened?

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,580
Cried Donald, picking himself up.

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,940
Let that be a lesson to you, said Patrick Begora.

61
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,420
Oh, don't mind him, said Goofy.

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,460
Let's start digging up those trees.

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,540
And what was it you had planned to build here?

64
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,460
Some sort of school, perhaps?

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Said, asked Patrick.

66
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,700
No, a wonderful place called Disneyland, said Mickey, with all sorts of marvelous things

67
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
for fun.

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,900
A rocket trip to the moon, for one, and a wonderful Wild West stagecoach ride, a magic

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,340
pirate ship that can really fly and a trip to the mind of the seven dwarfs.

70
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,500
Rocket trip, flying pirate ship.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,060
You must be out of your head, my boy, said Patrick Begora.

72
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,060
There's no such things.

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,020
Come along and see.

74
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,060
We'll show you the plans.

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,340
They're back at the studio, said Mickey Mouse.

76
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,460
Before he knew what he was about, Patrick Begora found himself walking along with Mickey

77
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,580
and the rest.

78
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,220
But he stopped short when they opened a door into a strange looking bubble of glass.

79
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Oh, no you don't, he cried an alarm.

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,100
I'll not go in there.

81
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
What is it anyway?

82
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,380
It's a helicopter, a kind of airplane.

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,540
Come along for the ride, said Mickey.

84
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,060
When he saw all the rest of them piling in, Patrick Begora went too.

85
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,980
Soon, with a whir and a rush of blades, up went the helicopter straight up in the air,

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,220
and the ground dropped away below.

87
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,340
My, but you should have heard Patrick yell then.

88
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,860
He had never dreamed of such a thing.

89
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,500
But soon, he was so busy watching the sights as they flew over oil wells and city streets

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,660
and towering brown hills that he had no time to be scared.

91
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,380
Then down they swooped to the studio, and soon Patrick found himself deep in Disneyland

92
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,540
plants, the lice of which he had never seen.

93
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,780
There were rows of pretty little shops, winding rivers, an overhead railroad train, so many

94
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,980
wonderful things to see that Patrick's head was spinning.

95
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,660
And this is what you're planning to build when you root up my orange trees?

96
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,900
He asked.

97
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,620
Yes, said Mickey.

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
That's our plan.

99
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,420
Then go ahead, lads, if you can, said Patrick Begora.

100
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,740
The place is yours.

101
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,540
There's just one little thing I ask.

102
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,020
May I build a wee snug little house and live there quietly after you have finished this

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
Disneyland?

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,820
Fine, said Mickey.

105
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,300
We'll build you the house.

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,100
How about one of these?

107
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,580
No, lad, no, said Patrick Begora.

108
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,020
I like a place out of sight, hidden away, so I, so to speak.

109
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,100
All right, said Mickey.

110
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,780
Just as you say.

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,280
So they shook hands on it.

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,780
The bargain was made.

113
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,140
They all flew back to the Disneyland site, and next morning the work began.

114
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,740
Every day Patrick came out to watch, and with every day that passed, it seemed, the picture

115
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,980
changed.

116
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,580
One day the railroad station went up, the entrance to Disneyland.

117
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,100
Then almost in the blink of an eye, Main Street was taking shape.

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,580
Soon it was time for the last tree to come out, the one with Patrick's home at its roots.

119
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,780
Sorry, Pat, said Mickey.

120
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,980
It's gotta go, but we'll find you a good new place.

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,780
Oh, don't bother, said Patrick.

122
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,180
I've picked one myself.

123
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,780
She would not say where his new home was.

124
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,700
He trundled out his household goods in his wee wheelbarrow.

125
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,860
And all day he sat in the barrow shade.

126
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,260
And at night, when everyone had gone home, Patrick wheeled his wee barrow through the

127
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,940
shadows of Disneyland to the secret spot he picked for his own.

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,260
So when you visit Disneyland, keep your eyes open wide.

129
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,380
Maybe you'll see a wee man in green, smoking a small clay pipe.

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,620
Maybe you'll follow him when he goes home, and find out where he lives.

131
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,620
If you do, you'll be the only one in the world who's found Patrick Begora's home.

132
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,500
The end.
