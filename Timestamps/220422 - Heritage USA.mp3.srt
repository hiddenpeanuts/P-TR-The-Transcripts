1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Warning, the following podcast contains religious fudge, massive fraud, big buckets of apocalypse

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,720
food, and a trip to Heritage USA on today's Divine Podcast, The Ride.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,160
A most pious post-Easter to all of you.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,520
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, PTR, but today that stands for Praise The Ride.

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm Scott Gerner, Jason Sheridan, most pious day to you.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
I was walking up to your house and I thought about the PTL and I was like, oh, that's fine.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,360
It's almost, hey, praise the ride.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
It's pretty close.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,120
Yeah, actually credit to Erin for that.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,920
She was noting that.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
PTR, PTL is the organization, Praise The Lord, and we're talking about them today.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
First, Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Hi.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Yeah, but Praise The Ride is good.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,000
I feel like, you know, we had, we just did a couple of live shows that were really great,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
really fun to do.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,120
The audience, very exuberant, but I feel like there should be, we should actually start

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,960
live shows now in a somber way and everyone should say sort of praise the ride.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,840
Like we should all be quiet and connect on a deeper level and chant praise the ride.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,820
Well, there's certain people who might enjoy some being more somber about things and respecting

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,600
these things and praising them a little more.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Right.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
There's a phrase that I don't know if you guys have caught this.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,600
This was just big in my Twitter feed last night as we record this, which was, might

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,800
not be relevant now, but I guess always there's this type of person and that is Epcot purists.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh yeah.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
There's a lot of discussion about being an Epcot.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,720
That's been around a little bit, but I think it was especially around with some new announcements

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,000
about the guardians cosmic rewind.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,960
At this point, I just don't want to look at construction equipment and walls anymore.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll just take anything at this point.

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Anything real and fun.

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,040
You're like an Epcot fundamentalist, I guess, if you believe that it should, it should just

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
be learning, I guess.

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Yeah.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,920
Siemens needs to come back.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,000
Raytheon needs to return.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,720
So that's interesting.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,280
There's different sects of, I guess, Epcot purists, certain people probably that think

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,160
at the nineties were good.

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
It's interesting.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,440
We should really make, we should figure out how to categorize.

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,720
And like map it on some religion.

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,160
What are those cube charts, the square charts, like the authoritarian, the libertarian.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Oh yeah.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
That are never correct.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
That are never accurate.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
What's the sample opinion within that?

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And where do we fall?

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,120
Because I feel like we're, maybe we're the, we're the extremist left in a way by even

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,360
on some people's spectrum by even liking anything new they ever do.

59
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Right.

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Yeah.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,240
So there's, yeah, Epcot fundamentalists who want it to be basically just this original.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,360
And then there's us, although I don't know, are we so radical?

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,960
I mean, we'd like, we'd like old stuff.

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,720
We certainly love the old bullshit, but I think we're not as upset as maybe people would

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,520
want us to be that any of it has ever.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,800
It doesn't keep me up at night that horizons is gone.

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
But of course, but would I, if I, if there was a time machine, it's the first place I

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
would go.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
You gotta give me points for that.

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I think.

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,600
We were also of the age where it's like, ah, charmed by like rows and rows of free Genesis

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
games.

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Maybe we don't have it home.

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,800
You know, an arcade, but free?

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Excellent.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
They never should have changed though.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,720
They never should have changed a single game.

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,920
Shouldn't have updated.

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
Retro video games very popular right now.

81
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,560
Yeah, that's a place I suppose.

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,160
There is a mall by my dad that lost a number of its anchor stores.

83
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,520
Anchor stores, what they call the big department stores, but does have a new massive arcade

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,760
and a retro video game store.

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,320
So I think they're giving away leases.

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Wow.

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Yeah.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Anything that feels confident enough, they can fill the space.

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah.

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
It's good.

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,200
It's good for the round, round one, the brand that we like.

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,200
It is a good time for dumb, for arcades and trampolines and rock climbing walls.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Yeah.

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,560
At least they all have somewhere to go.

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Yeah.

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes.

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Inflatable, inflatables.

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,280
And I guess all those are rides.

99
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
So I would praise all of them.

100
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Praise the rides.

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
We praise, yes, all of these.

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Which is an ironic phrase to use today because today's topic is a little short on rides for

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,920
a place that a lot of the retrospectives sure do refer to it as a theme park.

104
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Yeah.

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,200
And that had my head scratching a little.

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I know.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,600
Well, it's what its designation is that definitely led me to say we should do an episode about

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
it.

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,280
But yeah, once you start digging in, I was like, oh yeah, they didn't really have any.

110
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,800
It's more of a resort destination.

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,320
It almost feels like more of the other stuff that Disney World was besides Magic Kingdom.

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Yeah, the vacation kingdom.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,720
All the extra vacation kingdom stuff.

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah.

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Plus prayer.

116
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Plus the arc encounter.

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Plus a little of...

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
So a little bit of that sort of thing.

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,760
And today's topic, by the way, is Heritage USA, which was the, well, we're questioning

121
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,840
theme park.

122
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,360
It was definitely a themed experience, a resort that was set up by Jim and Tammy Faye Baker

123
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:42,520
in the 78, I believe, ran for a decade or so that was a major religious theme destination.

124
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,200
South Carolina, kind of at the border of North Carolina and South Carolina.

125
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,440
Before we get into that, really quick, I wanted to bring up a couple other things within this

126
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
realm of...

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
Because yeah, we try to do this.

128
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,840
Of course, I like to have these episodes out on Good Friday, which I was taught is supposed

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
to be a day where you sit and are sad.

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm trying to bring that energy to the podcast and discuss these Christian theme parks.

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,800
And that's what we've done for the last three years.

132
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,520
We have kind of a trilogy on our hands.

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
But I feel like...

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,440
I was wondering if this is maybe the end of this series, if that does close out a trilogy,

135
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,320
because there's not a lot of these left.

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Here's a big defunct one we're talking about.

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,040
We've talked about a few others that did not set the world on fire.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,960
I feel like Christian, in religious in general, themed experience, theme parks, it's not a

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
great line of work.

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,360
None of these have been blockbuster runaway successes, I would say.

141
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
No.

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,120
I keep bringing this up recently because I enjoyed it so much, but season two of Righteous

143
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,840
Gemstones, the park, their theme park, which is an actual traditional amusement park in

144
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,080
the world of the show, does play a pretty big role in this season, in some of the storylines

145
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,220
in the season.

146
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,960
But that is an actual theme park, amusement park, far away from...

147
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
In South Carolina, right?

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
In South Carolina is where they shoot it, I believe.

149
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I think so.

150
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I forget the name of it.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Yeah.

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,340
But in the world of the show, that's an actual amusement park, unlike the trilogy, which

153
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,840
are significantly, mostly passion plays.

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah, I think passion plays at all of them.

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Fudge, chops.

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Definitely at this.

157
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Yes, fudge has come up before.

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Weird.

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
I guess that's the format.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,360
You watch a man bleed out on the cross, and then you eat a bunch of fudge.

161
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,200
What a strange combo that some people are into, but not everybody, not enough to make

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
them work.

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,880
I just got curious with the ones that we've talked about before, what's going on?

164
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Where are they at now?

165
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,440
I think there's situations change a lot.

166
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,320
COVID has not been super kind to some of these places.

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Do you guys know what's up with the first one of these we covered, the Holy Land experience?

168
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Oh, I didn't.

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I didn't look.

170
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
I didn't look.

171
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,280
I know it was a little iffy financially and owner-wise.

172
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,800
I think it was getting iffy already.

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
COVID really did it in.

174
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,280
As a poet, Universal Studios, if you can imagine, made it through.

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,480
This other Orlando situation did not.

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,920
But I was so baffled by what it is becoming.

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,840
It has been fully sold, not owned by Trinity, which I think owned it before, and now it

178
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,560
has been bought by a company called Advent Health, which is a faith-based healthcare

179
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
system.

180
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Whatever that means.

181
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah, they're pretty big.

182
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,760
And they are turning the facilities into a hospital.

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,160
That's what that's going to be now.

184
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,880
Isn't that weird?

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,440
From the outside, it's a gold-plated coliseum.

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,200
It looks like the big Hard Rock concert venue at City Walk in Orlando, and yet it's going

187
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,240
to somehow become a hospital.

188
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Yes.

189
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Pretty funny.

190
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,120
Ironically, urgent care as doctors' offices are another thing filling malls and unused

191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,840
massive spaces across the country.

192
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Great.

193
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
It's a beautiful world.

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Kind of timely.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah.

196
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,640
Will they just use the existing facility, or is it just they're using the land?

197
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
It doesn't specify?

198
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,760
I don't know the layout of the campus exactly, but I think a big building, which I'd have

199
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,720
to imagine is the coliseum type thing, will become a bunch of emergency rooms, basically.

200
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,440
But I read an article saying specifically that they are going to deconstruct the recreation

201
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
of Jerusalem.

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,480
So Jerusalem is being torn down as we speak.

203
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,640
I guess the not deemed medically necessary for this new medical campus.

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Really weird.

205
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,160
There should be themed hospitals, though, right?

206
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,000
That would be fun, at least, to have some theming going on.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Some children's hospitals have pretty elaborate designs, some stuff.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's true.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,160
I think at the Anaheim Children's Hospital, there's a turtle talk with Crush.

210
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,720
Oh, is that right?

211
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Yeah.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Oh, that's crazy.

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
That's nice.

214
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Wow.

215
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
That's really neat.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,400
So I mean, they should keep some of the stuff around for this hospital, is what I'm saying.

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
But who knows?

219
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,020
It doesn't seem like they...

220
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,800
The vibe you're giving me, I think, is no.

221
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
I feel like no.

222
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
But yeah, why not?

223
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,760
Why not take a little trip into the...

224
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,920
It would make you appreciate the medical care that you're going inside to get if you could

225
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,400
walk through an area that showed you what it was like before there were MRIs and all

226
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,800
these machines that we have.

227
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Where the only way to be cured was to be crucified, die, and be risen from the dead several days

228
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
later.

229
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Old school medicine, they call it.

230
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,480
That cure does not work for almost anyone.

231
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,160
Children's Hospital of Orange County, yes, has its own turtle talk with Crush.

232
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
That's really neat.

233
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Oh, and weird.

234
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Just in the interest of...

235
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,360
Because we always want rides and attractions to be freestanding all over the place.

236
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,560
That one's pretty cool, and I bet very helpful for spirits and stuff.

237
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,000
Other things, Arc Encounter is still going, and a couple new innovations at the Arc Encounter.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
We talked about that last year.

239
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,920
They are now charging locals for parking, so that's good innovation.

240
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,000
And they are gathering the funds.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,440
They are asking, of course, regular people for the funds.

242
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,120
Even though they make millions a year, it is regular people who need to fund their new

243
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,160
endeavor, which is a Tower of Babel attraction.

244
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,800
They've been talking about the Tower of Babel for so long.

245
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,840
They've been trying to get that off the ground.

246
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
That is like the...

247
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,960
At Soos Land, again, Islands of Adventure, that thing that the circus ma-gurk...

248
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,080
Or the trolley in the sky, where it's just like it was going around with no one in it

249
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,200
for years, and everyone's like, when is that going to open?

250
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,920
Yes, but the only difference being that no one is asking that.

251
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
About the Tower of Babel.

252
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Except me.

253
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Except for you and Ken Ham himself.

254
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
When's the Tower going to be done?

255
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,520
If you didn't hear that last year, I think the least charismatic man in themed entertainment

256
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,160
we've ever come across, and one of the most unpleasant places we've ever come across.

257
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,480
And this will...

258
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,720
If you weren't excited, Jason, already for the Tower of Babel, just know this literal

259
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,560
quote about what they're going to do.

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,880
It's so important to build it because this is their way to tackle the racism issue.

261
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Oh, no.

262
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
No.

263
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Oh.

264
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's going to be...

265
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,960
What does that mean?

266
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,400
I don't even know what it looks like.

267
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I...

268
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,760
Yes, I don't want to know.

269
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,600
I don't want to know their definition of tackling.

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah.

271
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,640
I was thinking about this too, and I don't want to get too...

272
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,000
I mean, everybody I know is waiting to hear about heritage, so they don't want us to delay

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
any further.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Any more time than we need to.

275
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,600
Just thinking of the Bible and everything, and Christianity as IP.

276
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,240
Thinking of it as the Marvel Universe or something.

277
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
It is.

278
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
It is.

279
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
As characters.

280
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
We grew up with them.

281
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah.

282
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,720
Our religion is Epcot, and some people's religion is Christianity.

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:17,400
But it's like no one has done, I feel like, the big e-ticket level Christian rides.

284
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,160
There's still the problem, I think, of what you're saying.

285
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,880
None of this stuff is flourishing.

286
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,160
A lot of it's closing or closed.

287
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Nobody has gotten ambitious and actually put the fun in to the Christianity, because they

288
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,760
want it to be lessons learned.

289
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Fundamentalist.

290
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Exactly.

291
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
The Ark.

292
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,520
There's rooms on the Ark, Connor, which we talked about last year, where it's like, come

293
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,840
in here for the cute animals that were on the Ark.

294
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,380
No, they weren't cute.

295
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,580
They were real animals.

296
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,720
There was no fun.

297
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
There's no Disney animals in here.

298
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
You're like, well, hold on a second.

299
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
If you're a kid, you're out.

300
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Your brain is out.

301
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
You know?

302
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Yes.

303
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah.

304
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Which, oddly, I think today's topic, heritage, was less aggro on that front.

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,400
I think they were more okay with the idea that any children could have any modicum of

306
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
fun.

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Right.

308
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,720
They were more on the money, and the other ones have gotten it worse and worse as time

309
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
has gone on.

310
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,680
Let me say this really quick, though, because I have one more thing.

311
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,360
Because I was like, are there any left?

312
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,520
Is there anything we can talk about next year?

313
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,080
And I don't know if this would be the fuel for a full episode, but I was very interested

314
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
to learn about it.

315
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,720
In the town of Carthage, Missouri.

316
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
I don't think we've ever talked about anything in Missouri.

317
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,440
Oh, already that name is giving you a little nod on what direction this is going in.

318
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, though, you know what?

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Of all the...

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,760
I find this to be one of the least hateful things in this realm, and one of the cuter

321
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
things in this realm.

322
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,400
It is a place that opened in 1989, and it is called the Precious Moments Chapel.

323
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Whoa, interesting.

324
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you guys know offhand...

325
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,400
It's one of those you've got to think about for a second, but do you have any picture

326
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,720
in your mind when I say Precious Moments?

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Yeah, I absolutely do.

328
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Little statues.

329
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
The figurines.

330
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
The figurines, yeah.

331
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Okay, yeah.

332
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,720
The little doe-eyed children.

333
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,680
Is this an official branded Precious Moments?

334
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
That is correct.

335
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Yes.

336
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Wow.

337
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
The little figurines, which I feel like are those at Hallmark.

338
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,920
I've never even thought of it as a religious brand inherently.

339
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
I don't know much about it.

340
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,040
It's just, you know, you see them on grandma's shelf or whatever on a Christmas tree sometimes.

341
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,800
But look at this.

342
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Here's a photo.

343
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,400
It's all far away from you guys, but this is this pastel colored...

344
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,640
Very 89.

345
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,440
It's very bright, an indoor sky, and a big, huge Precious Moments little girl kissing

346
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,080
a goose on the lips.

347
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Wow.

348
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
It's really weird.

349
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,880
It opened in 89, which I think is the same year or around the same year as Sanrio Puroland.

350
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,800
And the whole place has a Sanrio Puroland vibe in that it's indoor.

351
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,000
It's like a similar level of it's devoted to cute characters, but it's like if Hello

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,680
Kitty and Kuro-P and everybody were praying.

353
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,480
And on stained glass recreating Jesus stories and Noah's stories.

354
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
It's really weird.

355
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
This is awesome.

356
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Yeah.

357
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
And we've never been sent this because I would remember.

358
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,080
No, not even one comment as far as I would know.

359
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah, because it would have registered with us.

360
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,480
We've gotten a number of mentions of the Cabbage Patch Hatchery.

361
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
The Cabbage Patch Dolls.

362
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh yes, which I really want to do.

363
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Baby Beavieland General.

364
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,480
And Yankee Candle Village I know a little about.

365
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,280
This kind of, yes, folksy weird things like this we know about.

366
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,480
But this is I've never come across this.

367
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
The Precious Moments Chapel.

368
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,280
Not inherently a religious brand Precious Moments, but the guy was very religious and

369
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,080
like lived very plain and then made so much money off of Precious Moments that he just

370
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,480
bought a big plot of land and was like, this will be my legacy as a place where people

371
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,880
can come pray.

372
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,960
But also there's cute stuff to take pictures of.

373
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,240
It's not like, it doesn't seem inherently evil to me.

374
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I don't know.

375
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,800
Although that might be counteracted by this photo where there's two real children walking

376
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,560
with two giant Precious Moments children and one of them is a child clown.

377
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,960
And I'm no fan of that as you can imagine.

378
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
That's scary to me.

379
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,640
So get the child clowns out of that.

380
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,840
That's like, that's worse than Satan to me as a child clown.

381
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,480
Is this still in operation?

382
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It is, yeah.

383
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Because I know Yankee Hill Village is and I think the Cabbage Patch one is as well.

384
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Oh yeah, I think that's still, I think that's a perennial.

385
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,720
No, I think it's pretty popular.

386
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,400
It's the first one of these I've ever been tempted to go to.

387
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't know when I'm going to be in Missouri exactly, but I don't know.

388
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,600
I like that it's such a specific, it feels akin to, maybe you guys would have other things

389
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,360
in your head of brands that are like this, but like Love Is.

390
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
I was going to say Love Is.

391
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,200
If there was a Love Is temple somewhere, a weird, just that there's anything devoted

392
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,280
to, you don't even think of them as characters or a specific world.

393
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,040
It's not exactly peanuts.

394
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
It's really strange.

395
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,960
No, but I haven't dug into Precious Moment.

396
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,840
Like I just did a quick search of Precious Moments and you can still buy Precious Moments.

397
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,980
And there are a lot of IP Precious, there's Batman, there's Julie Newmar, Catwoman Precious

398
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,100
Moment kissing Adam West.

399
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,540
They're both like kids.

400
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Whoa!

401
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,860
Which is, it's not that far off from Funko Pops.

402
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
No!

403
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,940
They're actually very similar with their big eyes and their bigger heads, but they are

404
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,500
short otherwise.

405
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,580
It's very Funko, but so of course these things should be thriving.

406
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,500
Yeah, Precious Moments Disney Dreamer Boy, which is a little kid.

407
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,580
Here's the second thing I don't care much for.

408
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Sorry, it's just a mirror.

409
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Am I looking at a mirror?

410
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:08,260
I'm showing Jason a picture of a little, no Jason, this is a ceramic figurine of a child

411
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,300
with mousiers and a little Mickey plush.

412
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,420
What's that podcast you listen to about, oh, it's fun.

413
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:21,460
It's these three guys, it's these three Disney Dreamer boys.

414
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,100
But isn't that weird that there's a place that you can go in Missouri, like just in

415
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,860
Pure Bible Belt where you can see these characters portraying Moses or whatever, but then you

416
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,940
can also see them as Catwoman and Batman.

417
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,700
It's so strange that it can be, very few brands can be all of this at once.

418
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Yeah, I mean, look, you've teed up a really good episode for next year.

419
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,540
Yeah, maybe we do got them and we're gonna go.

420
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,900
There are some really creepy Precious Moments ones I'm looking up here, and just to dig

421
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,700
into the history of the figurines themselves would be probably interesting.

422
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:03,260
My mom has a few, there's this guy Jim Shore and he has crafts like ceramics like this.

423
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,900
I think he started very folksy, but then started getting some licenses.

424
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,980
There is Mickey and Minnie and Donald and Goofy and you'll see these a lot of souvenir

425
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,060
shop, like a nice souvenir shop.

426
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,460
What does Jim Shore look like?

427
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
What is his trademark?

428
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,460
It's kind of like, I don't know how to describe it.

429
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,380
It's ceramic, but it's sort of like, almost looks like patchwork.

430
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,420
Huh, okay.

431
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,820
I found a child clown, porcelain figurine, Scott.

432
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,500
This is the biggest thing fighting me of wanting to do a full Precious Moments.

433
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Child clown.

434
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
The hyperponderance of clowns.

435
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,220
But there's one other, and I hate to take this off the table for if we do a full Precious

436
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,980
Moments episode, but I watched a really weird, like almost an hour long, a VHS video tour

437
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,740
of the Precious Moments chapel.

438
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,100
It takes you through every wall and every painting on every wall and tells you what

439
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,860
everything means, which is very unsettling because they're showing you lots of Precious

440
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,060
Moments children who are all based on actual children who passed away.

441
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Oh no.

442
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,460
That's very unpleasant.

443
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,740
But in the middle of all of that, it's a run of here's a bunch of actual kids being portrayed

444
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,540
And then in the middle of them in a field, in a fictional heaven, is this.

445
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:28,100
Scott, the little mischievous bear has just slid down a rainbow and is mixing the colors

446
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,260
in God's paint pot.

447
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:38,140
Yeah, here's a little like a big eyed bear, Scott mixing God's paint pot.

448
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
God's paint pot.

449
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,420
That's why your hands are stained with so many different colors of God's kingdom.

450
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,940
I can't keep my hands off out of God's paint pot.

451
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,620
I mean, I don't, you know, I don't hate this as far as fictional Scots go.

452
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
This ain't bad.

453
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
No, he's good.

454
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,180
If you have to associate me with one, you know, get Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son out

455
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,940
of your head and think of the best Scott, God's little deputy bear, Scott, and God's

456
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
paint pot.

457
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,060
I think, yeah, I think people, if look, I don't, we haven't called for fan art in a

458
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:21,820
while, but if you want to draw Scott as a bear with his paws and God's paint pot, I

459
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,900
wouldn't be upset is all I'm saying.

460
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,140
This is neither would I.

461
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,740
This is finally something that I'm OK with.

462
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,100
No, no baby clown.

463
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Scott is not paying.

464
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Scott is bear.

465
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,020
Yeah, Scott is bear at Gmail.

466
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
There we go.

467
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,260
Oh, that's now I like that one on the second gate this week that we did with Jane about

468
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,820
the Margaritaville Resort in Times Square.

469
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,820
You mentioned phrases that get stuck in your heads.

470
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,140
Oh, sure.

471
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
From the show.

472
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,700
And I think God's paint pot is now permanently thumbed at God.

473
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
God's paint pot.

474
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Scott's God's paint.

475
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
God's paint.

476
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,500
Yeah, it's kind of instantly iconic.

477
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Well, yeah, thanks to that video tour.

478
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm just so delighted that there's a religious oriented thing that I don't despise.

479
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,660
Now let's go to one that will determine the amount that we despise it.

480
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,620
My guess is pretty high, or at least the people behind it.

481
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
And that is Jim Baker's Heritage USA.

482
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,860
Yeah, I'll say something positive first.

483
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,700
We were watching the Oscars and Jessica Chastain won.

484
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:35,420
And she was talking about how much, you know, she won for the eyes of Tammy Faye.

485
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,700
She played Tammy Faye Baker and she talked about how much Tammy Faye Baker cared about

486
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
people.

487
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,300
And I leaned over to you and I was like, weren't these people con men?

488
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,780
And I didn't know a lot.

489
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,100
All I really knew of Jim and Tammy Faye when I was a kid was the crying SNL sketches.

490
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,900
Yes, yeah.

491
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,140
That very memorable church chat.

492
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,540
Bill Hartman is Jim Baker and Jan Hooks is Tammy Faye Baker and with the insane makeup,

493
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
which you assume.

494
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I saw an interview with Jessica Chastain saying the same thing.

495
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,520
She saw that sketch and thought these people cannot be real.

496
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,940
This must be greatly exaggerated because it's a sketch show and kind of not at all.

497
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,420
These were pure sketch characters in real life.

498
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,020
Yeah, and I did watch the movie.

499
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
I like the movie.

500
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,340
I mean, it's a biopic.

501
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,100
If you like bio, if you can.

502
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm not high on biopics in general, but I thought it was pretty solid and I thought she

503
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
was good in it.

504
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,060
And Tammy Faye Baker did do.

505
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,540
I mean, she showed a lot of compassion to like eat patients back when like no one was

506
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
doing that.

507
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:45,300
So to have a televangelist do that, it did seem like she did do some good things.

508
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,620
Jim Baker is a, I'm going to steal a wrestling phrase, he's a scumbag, carny piece of shit.

509
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
Yes.

510
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
Yeah, big time.

511
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
I guess still around.

512
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,100
Still around and off the deep end.

513
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Extremely.

514
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Yeah.

515
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Oh my God.

516
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,700
So these people had their peak in the in the 70s and 80s.

517
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,740
The context that I caught is that they, I heard what they did is being described as

518
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,280
a religious tonight show.

519
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,900
Like that was the format of their show, Praise the Lord.

520
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:24,380
They, as opposed to televangelism is just a preacher talking and yelling at you on TV

521
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
for an hour.

522
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,020
There is, was a little show with songs and a couch and guests.

523
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,820
Like Huckabee or something.

524
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,580
Like your favorite show.

525
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,100
Started the proudest tradition.

526
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,820
Finest entertain, the finest comedy.

528
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,580
And so it would like, it was just, they, they worked on television so well and got explosively

529
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,460
popular and sort of peaked then and it all fell apart amidst scandal.

530
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,380
But Jim Baker has held on.

531
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:59,380
He like a big exile, I mean, literal exile, imprisoned for four years due to activities

532
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,440
that we'll discuss in this episode related to the theme park.

533
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,060
But he, see, I guess he, I don't know, he laid low, but he clawed his way out and kept

534
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
going.

535
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:16,380
Because I was so shocked to learn a couple of years ago that he was still going.

536
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,220
And I'm sure it was the same for you that it came out of these bizarre bucket.

537
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,220
The food bucket.

538
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:31,380
Because so to, to real quick, Jim Baker, when he was in prison disown the prosperity gospel

539
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,440
that he used to preach, which is tied to the church, give us your money and God will repay

540
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
you in kind.

541
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Right.

542
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
God wants you to be rich.

543
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
I am very rich.

544
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,320
Which is what the arc, excuse me, the Holy Land was preaching as well.

545
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Oh, right.

546
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Right.

547
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Oh, and that was sort of their bent also.

548
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,960
And it was like the idea that Tammy Faye would be so glam and have all this makeup was revolutionary

549
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,400
because there was a, there was a, it would have been a time in Christianity where like

550
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,920
putting on a little bit of eyeliner would have been way too much.

551
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,600
That's God, God dates that.

552
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Yeah.

553
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,560
And so he disowned that in prison and then he switched to a different line of preaching.

554
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
The end is nigh.

555
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
The apocalypse.

556
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,920
And that is why he's selling survival buckets.

557
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:21,480
And during the start of COVID, a collodial, I believe you say a collodial silver solution

558
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,320
that he claimed would cure most diseases, including COVID-19.

559
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,000
If you Google collodial silver, this is a longtime snake oil kind of thing.

560
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And if you take too much of it, it will turn your skin blue.

561
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Are there people?

562
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Are there super blue people out there?

563
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Yeah.

564
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Wow.

565
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Hello.

566
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,280
Is this, didn't Alex Jones sell this too?

567
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
I, a lot of people have sold it.

568
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,840
Didn't Quentin of the Peltro sell this too?

569
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,040
She should have rebranded it.

570
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,560
So he got, he got in trouble in states.

571
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:01,240
His new apocalypse ministry, I think it couldn't take credit cards for a while.

572
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,880
Like, oh yeah, he got cut off from his credit card.

573
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,680
And every time something would happen, a shooting or a catastrophe, a train derailment, he'd

574
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,360
blame it on sinners, Barack Obama.

575
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,240
He would say he predicted it.

576
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,560
He said he predicted 9-11 in 1990.

577
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,520
He saw it in 1999.

578
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Like he's, he was off the rail.

579
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,880
Like he's so bad shit.

580
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:33,440
He the things, the downfall of the PTL and heritage USA, which happened, it all kind

581
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,880
of played out in 1987.

582
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,880
He recently was on his show attributing everything that happens to cancel culture.

583
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Okay, here we go.

584
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,240
In 87, cancel culture.

585
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,200
Here we go.

586
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Reverse predicted cancel culture.

587
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,120
Yeah, boy, he's, he's horrible.

588
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,840
Those, yeah, I tried to get a little reeducated about the buckets.

589
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:07,040
So he doesn't sell because he, it would be illegal for him to actually sell these.

590
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,680
But what you do is you give him a gift.

591
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,600
You give him a love gift.

592
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,320
And then if that love gift happens to correspond with whatever amount of money he's designated

593
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
these buckets are, then you get a bucket.

594
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
And that could be a bucket that costs $150.

595
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,080
some supply, a little bit of supply of like vegetable soup or like what looks like nacho

596
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,200
cheese goo.

597
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
They're so insane.

598
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,280
If you've never watched these or the amazing Vic burger remixes of them, uh, just some

599
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,440
of the most bizarre pieces of footage you've ever seen.

600
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,000
As he digs, he opens up these buckets and digs through them with a shovel.

601
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,360
It's a little, that's how big they are that you don't use a spoon.

602
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,240
It's a big old shovel.

603
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,600
It's a paint bucket filled with like MREs with like dehydrated big PVC material bucket.

604
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
It's not even like a small paint bucket.

605
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,160
It's a big white kind of lows, blue bucket.

606
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,600
The whole people, it is a big bucket.

607
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,240
It is a big bucket.

608
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,800
Also God's paint pot.

609
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,480
And I'd like to add love gift to the new podcast, the right phrase.

610
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,160
I, I don't like love gift.

611
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,120
No, I, I, I, yeah, it's upsetting.

612
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
It's for sure.

613
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
So it's a phrase.

614
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,640
It works, but it is not dissimilar in practice to like an NPR pledge.

615
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,200
I think it's also not dissimilar to like code word words that like, uh, sex workers have

616
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,480
used of like, give 50 kiss it.

617
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,320
Like this is a gift I'm giving you.

618
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,920
Like I'm not paying you for your service.

619
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm giving a gift.

620
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,800
How expensive is this love gift?

621
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
It's a love gift.

622
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,880
So you are giving, uh, yeah, Jim Baker, a loved gift for a bucket of powder.

623
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Big bucket of goo.

624
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,480
But then you have to fill up with water.

625
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,800
And there's been a couple articles, a couple of places, I think NPR and vice, and I'm sure

626
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,400
a myriad of other places have tried, like, let's make the buckets.

627
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Let's, let's see what the buckets are like.

628
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,100
And I think they instruct you kind of poorly on the amount of water to put in there.

629
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,200
And if you were, if it was the apocalypse, then water might be an issue anyway.

630
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,600
So does the, if adding water is correct, is required and then they don't tell you the

631
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
right amount.

632
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,840
It's not, I mean, everybody said this.

633
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,520
This is the worst food I've ever considered the worst thing that's ever been in my body.

634
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Yeah.

635
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,920
I mean, I, I, with the boy scouts and we would go backpacking sometimes you'd have a little

636
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,240
envelope of like usually beef stroganoff.

637
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,000
I mean, most it's like chicken, chicken tetra Zini or beef stroganoff.

638
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,840
It's a little vacuum sealed envelope and you pour like one cup of boiling water in it.

639
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,560
And it's not, it's pretty good because you're in the middle of the woods and there's nothing

640
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,840
else to do and it's full of salt.

641
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Yeah.

642
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah.

643
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,560
And the listener feels like sending an envelope full of beef stroganoff to Jason, which I'm

644
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,120
sure he would consider a love gift.

645
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,640
An envelope, a regular letter sized envelope full of beef stroganoff as a love gift.

646
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,200
I also liked the breakdown that, you know, there's all right, there's the $150 and that's

647
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,880
a good amount of food, but it's, it doesn't match the peace of mind final countdown offer

648
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,600
with 31,000 servings of food for $4,500.

649
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,000
The final countdown.

650
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,880
He's also, every time he does a prediction or something, he's wrong.

651
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,000
He's like the 2012 like the Mayan prophecy.

652
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,760
It's like, no, that didn't happen.

653
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Yeah.

654
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,040
And if he's able to predict these things and why didn't he predict that like his little,

655
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,760
his new heritage, USA's new little scam town, which is in Missouri, which is very two hours

656
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
away from the precious moments chapel.

657
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Yeah.

658
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,360
They like a little bit of COVID happening and just everybody's fired.

659
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,120
Everybody's like this community collapsed as soon as COVID hit.

660
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,480
So mate, why weren't you a little more on the ball with that dude?

661
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Yeah.

662
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Yeah.

663
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
I don't know.

664
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,000
Jim Baker, questionable, but he did.

665
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,760
Now look, it fell apart quickly, but there was a 10 year, an almost 10 year, no, I guess

666
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,920
this is open for 11 years to some extent built up very slowly, but he undeniably at a point

667
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,440
in time, this property was very successful.

668
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,800
He did sort of set out to be a Christian Walt Disney and for a time for a very brief time,

669
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
very brief time.

670
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Yes.

671
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,840
A number of news sites said during a short window of time, it was the third most popular

672
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,600
park after Disney world and Disneyland.

673
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Insane.

674
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,080
How can that be?

675
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,880
And again, again, what you said at the beginning that you, is it really a theme park?

676
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,920
Is that even a fair to put these next to each other?

677
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,640
But I guess the fact is tons of it.

678
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
More people went to that.

679
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,000
I believe a Knott's Berry farm was bringing up the rear and they're number four in that

680
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
list.

681
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Knott's the, we love Knott's Berry farm.

682
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm sure in 86, Kingdom of the dinosaurs was on there.

683
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Berry tales and all these things.

684
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,920
They had, they had great stuff going on then they were getting beaten by, by what?

685
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
By the fudge shop?

686
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Yeah.

687
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,200
By a water park going on for a year.

688
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,080
Jason would convert to a very strict sect of Christianity if the fudge was good.

689
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah.

690
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,680
I mean, I was a little dismayed.

691
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,160
I had this place, they're like, try the pizza at granny's kitchen.

692
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,320
I'm like that pizza, no way, no way that pizza is good.

693
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Yeah.

694
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Yeah.

695
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Probably not.

696
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Probably cranked out.

697
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,960
Uh, granny's probably as white bread of a granny as you can be.

698
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,520
Not using the seasoning.

699
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,320
Her secret ingredient is salt.

700
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,160
That is the one seasoning she has access to.

701
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Baby black pepper.

702
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,360
But you know, Scott, because you mentioned Knott's Berry farm, uh, in the eyes of Tammy

703
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,600
Faye, there is a Knott's Berry farm reference.

704
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Whoa.

705
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:06,720
When Jim Baker is trying to convince, uh, the builder, like maybe you can just loan

706
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,520
us some of the, you know, start the work on credit or loan us some money.

707
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,960
Like, you know, that sort of thing.

708
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,840
The builder goes, he talks about like, uh, not Barry.

709
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,000
He used to love not Barry farm, but then quote every year the jellies got less fresh and

710
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,080
it's because they hired the wrong kinds of people to make the preserves.

711
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,560
And that is, I, I, whether it's a line concocted for the movie or just the general vibe of

712
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,000
the time, it's like, that is such a perfect, weird sentence.

713
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,200
Cause it's like, that is probably hateful in like six different ways, but it's unclear

714
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,800
how, like, it's a riddle.

715
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,320
It's a riddle that like this guy was mad at the Christian builder who started to work

716
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,400
on heritage USA, which now I'm not sure who that is.

717
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,720
Who's being portrayed in the movie, but the guy who physically built this camper, all

718
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,160
the big things on the campus was Ro Messner, who later after it all unfolded married Tammy

719
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,360
Faye and she, she passed away as Tammy Faye Messner.

720
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Yeah.

721
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,520
So the guy who, because he was a mega church builder, like a ton of the mega churches across

722
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,680
this country were this guy.

723
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,920
And then he, this was kind of his biggest project ever.

724
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,920
And then he also was the guy who put up the hush funds to keep Jessica Hahn quiet.

725
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
Oh God.

726
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,880
Scandal part one, not the one he went to jail for, but the thing that made everybody like,

727
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,080
well, let's look at those books, shall we?

728
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,440
And then the rest of it unfold.

729
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,200
I guess that's sort of what of the trilogy of the Christian amusements.

730
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,280
One thing that sets this apart from the previous two is those previous two were just doing

731
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,920
a lot of like, yeah, tax breaks, telethons kind of things.

732
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,800
Heritage USA was a massive financial fraud, like a massive scam.

733
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,960
Well, but well, was all of it though, or just, I mean, I guess it's in its like tax exempt

734
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
status.

735
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Sure.

736
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,280
But then really it was that tower.

737
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,760
The tower was like a big literal that he did go to jail for.

738
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,320
I think the way he was allocating ministry funds to get this built was a scam.

739
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,680
They also had a deal where it's like pay us a thousands of dollars, $1,000.

740
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,600
And then for ever, you'll be able to make a four night annual trip to Heritage USA.

741
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,800
And much like Bugsy Sequel sold too many shares in the Flamingo Casino that it didn't add

742
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,960
up to a hundred percent, they sold too many.

743
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,000
They sold too many of those thousand dollars.

744
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Incredible amount.

745
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Too many.

746
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Wow.

747
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,240
So he thinks he's Christian Disney, but he's Christian Bugsy.

748
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Yes, he is Christian Bugsy.

749
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,840
That's the third iconic new phrase.

750
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Christian Bugsy.

751
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
By Guest of Rides.

752
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Yeah, Christian Bugsy.

753
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
And kind of Lord.

754
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Oh Lord.

755
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,200
And kind of in a similar way, like the other gangsters looked down on Bugsy.

756
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,240
The other mega church, like Holy Roller, like insane preachers looked down on Baker for

757
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
sure.

758
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,080
Yeah, he's kind of became enemies with all of them.

759
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,760
They were, well, that was, yeah, here's a quote.

760
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,040
I think this is from Jimmy Swagger.

761
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah, it is.

762
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,400
The idea that this was happening, that we are going to have a church campus, but that

763
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,200
also has themed entertainment and waterpark and all this stuff.

764
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,960
Jimmy Swagger said, I don't think the church ought to be involved in making hamburgers

765
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,520
or building water slides or having pony rides.

766
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Man needs salvation.

767
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,920
He doesn't need a ride down the water slide.

768
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,520
Oh, well, I disagree with that.

769
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
First of all.

770
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
Jimmy.

771
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,640
But yes, I get that they were like, well, this is too much.

772
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
You know what?

773
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
This guy's going too far.

774
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,160
I guess so.

775
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,240
But then, but his whole the thought here and to what you were saying, Mike, earlier, this

776
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,280
is what I'm saying, that he did and he spoke about this, how, you know, kids, children

777
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,720
don't want to come and sit around like revival meetings.

778
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,280
They're going to be bored.

779
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,960
So maybe the best way to get kids into this stuff is to have them come to just a regular

780
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,640
family fun place where their parents are doing religious things, but they can go run around

781
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,000
the water park or take the shitty train or whatever it is.

782
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
See one ride.

783
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,120
The single really unremarkable looking train ride.

784
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,080
And that maybe that will, you know, they'll have fun.

785
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,360
But you know, while they're here, they'll learn some stuff.

786
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,120
He was more right in a way than, you know, Ken Ham, obviously, who built the least fun

787
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,080
sounding right or heard of.

788
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,840
Well, because, I mean, people have tried to like when a kid's got Spider-Man, it's going

789
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,920
to be hard to compete with that.

790
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,400
So I don't know actually who created Bible, man.

791
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
But that was the obviously that was the idea there.

792
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You know what?

793
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,520
Well, kids like Spider-Man, let's make our own great superhero.

794
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,000
Willie Ames, was it?

795
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
Did William create Bible, man?

796
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,000
He's not sure about that.

797
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He is Bible, man.

798
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think he might have.

799
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I think this might be.

800
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I didn't know that actually.

801
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Again, this is this has been.

802
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,680
Oh, that's the maybe that's next year.

803
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,640
Maybe that is Bible, man.

804
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,840
We've been teasing about it forever.

805
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Yeah.

806
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Yeah.

807
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,320
Well, I mean, we will learn by then if Willie Ames, when are they going to have to wait

808
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,400
a whole year to find out if Billy Ames was the creator of Bible, man?

809
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,720
It also just do a Bible.

810
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,400
We could just do it this month also.

811
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeah, sure.

812
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Anytime.

813
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,280
We'll see how high the demand is.

814
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,920
We'll do it for the Pentecost holiday.

815
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,280
It has to coincide with the holiday.

816
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:03,640
Well, so basics about that, let's talk about what you could do if you came here, as we

817
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,720
said, Shady Train, what are we in before the water?

818
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,920
Because the water park showed up way later.

819
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,640
So for that first eight or so years, did anything strike anyone's fancy about like,

820
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,720
well, this sounds good.

821
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,040
Well, yeah, I found, thankfully, I found like a key.

822
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,920
I found a keystone for this because I was like, what was here?

823
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,520
This isn't super well documented, the actual activities.

824
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,600
And on eBay, there is a brochure for sale.

825
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,240
Oh, interesting.

826
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,240
And so you can get the basic elevator pitch of this place.

827
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,280
The things that stuck out to me, there was a sentence that said, the healthy activity

828
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,680
of walking is highly encouraged.

829
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
They had walking.

830
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Add a walking.

831
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
That's an attraction.

832
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
All right.

833
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,920
E-ticket walking ride.

834
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,200
The other thing was, you know, it's fully immersive experience.

835
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:14,720
They picked up the childhood home of Billy Graham and restored it on this property.

836
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
So it's like Mickey's house.

837
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,320
It's like Mickey's house.

838
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Yeah.

839
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,880
But for Billy Graham, who I believe has come up on the show before, famously told Nixon,

840
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,320
bomb the dykes in North Korea, flood the country, which the estimated would have killed one

841
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,520
million people.

842
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,440
That's like his I use the den.

843
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Yeah.

844
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,440
When I need to make a telephone call, I call Nixon and say, bomb the dykes.

845
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,880
If the Paris peace talks fall apart, bomb the dykes, Kissinger.

846
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Same exact thing.

847
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,040
Kids were just as delighted to go walk through his house.

848
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,160
Gee, that one survived too.

849
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,680
That got moved elsewhere.

850
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,640
This childhood home getting tossed across the country.

851
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,320
And Billy Graham, I think, later on, at least, because I had family members who would like

852
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,320
watch Billy Graham or have pamphlets around and stuff.

853
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:13,720
I think he did soften or at least didn't lead with the everyone's a sinner like Jerry Falwell.

854
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Like when I was in high school, I hated Jerry Falwell, like just any time there was a cool

855
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,600
movie or there was cool thing that all the news would talk about would be Jerry Falwell

856
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
complaining about.

857
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,560
Like, I'm like, who is this asshole?

858
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,200
Yeah, he really did.

859
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,600
He really spiked when we were younger because of the Teletubbies scandal.

860
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Right.

861
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Oh, the Teletubbies.

862
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,040
He was mad at Tinky Winky.

863
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,200
Tinky Winky is gay because he is purple, the gayest color, I guess.

864
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,560
And he has a triangle, the gayest shape.

865
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
What he was building this case on.

866
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,560
Yeah, was that all it was?

867
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm trying to remember.

868
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,800
Was that all it was?

869
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,520
And he carried a purse.

870
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, that's what it was?

871
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
He had a purse.

872
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The main thing, I guess.

873
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
He had a bag.

874
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You can call it a bag.

875
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't know.

876
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I don't know.

877
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't know.

878
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,760
Falwell, you can draw a straight line from Jerry Falwell to like the freaks nowadays,

879
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,440
just calling any entertainment, any public school teacher a pedophile.

880
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,360
Like it's just like you're out of your fucking minds.

881
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,880
You don't live in shared reality.

882
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,960
The rest of us live in your scumbags.

883
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
He's horrible.

884
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,080
You can also draw a straight line from Jerry Falwell to Jerry Falwell Jr.

885
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
There we go.

886
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Who's surrounded.

887
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,760
Wait, was he in a scandal?

888
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
He's not at Liberty University?

889
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:39,840
No, he is not at Liberty University anymore due to the three way affair slash business

890
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,680
endeavor they had.

891
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,080
Him and his wife with a pool boy from the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami.

892
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,080
They went into like, they gave him a hostel.

893
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,400
They like all went in a hostel together.

894
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,520
And then they claimed he was trying to blackmail them and he claimed it was a consensual related.

895
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
It's very fishy.

896
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,880
Also, there was a lot of pictures of him being like horny on a yacht in the middle of COVID.

897
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Like, Jesus.

898
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
Yeah.

899
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,960
Well, he the other the straight line I could draw then from him is to this was the subject

900
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,120
of research for an episode a few a month or so ago, which is to from Jerry Falwell Jr.

901
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:26,040
to Joe Piscopo because Joe Piscopo went and did a talk like a Q&A with Jerry Falwell Jr.

902
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
at Liberty University.

903
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Oh, wow.

904
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,680
And as part of that, he said like, you know, because it's amazing what your dad did, you

905
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,280
know, trying to build something from the ground up.

906
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,000
You know, that's kind of what we were trying to do is the new guys on Saturday Night Live.

907
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,040
The same thing he said about Star Trek, the new generation, you know, it's kind of like

908
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,560
being the new guys on Saturday Night Live.

909
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,240
He has one thing to relate anything in the world to.

910
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,880
It's and it's 45 years ago.

911
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,880
It is the era.

912
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,400
It is literally the era of Saturday Night Live that people care about the least.

913
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,760
Well, I mean, Eddie Murphy was on it.

914
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
So sure.

915
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
And our IP that was great.

916
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Gilbert.

917
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
But yeah.

918
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
But no, not Gilbert's reign.

919
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,280
Gilbert lasted half a season, right?

920
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
Yeah.

921
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,560
I don't think he was especially proud of it.

922
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
But yeah, no.

923
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,320
Are there any even like old folks that are like, you know, when SNL was good, when Piscopo

924
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,200
was doing Sinatra, when he was doing all blue eyes with that and he had so much reverence

925
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
for him?

926
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,000
That's what I loved about it.

927
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Only if their TV, if they didn't have a TV before 1980 and their TV stopped working

928
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
around 1984.

929
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,200
Piscopo, was he was he at the anniversary?

930
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,320
Yeah, because he did one of the greatest pieces they did like a here's all the musical sketches.

931
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,120
And that's where Bill Murray did probably the funniest thing in the show.

932
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,560
And then earlier in that in the audience, he is Sinatra and he does a joke free New

933
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
York, New York.

934
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,040
And sitting behind him is Bob Odenkirk, who cannot repress his grimaces.

935
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,360
He's like, you just can tell he's like, oh, good.

936
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,000
It's a wonderful piece of footage to watch.

937
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I hope he does it at the fit.

938
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What is the 50th?

939
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,280
That's in a couple of years at this point, right?

940
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
He'll probably do the exact same thing.

941
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Oh, man.

942
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
So great.

943
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Why?

944
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Why mess with perfection, baby?

945
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
That was the 50th, wasn't it?

946
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
Was it the 50th?

947
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
That was the 40th.

948
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
That was the 40th.

949
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
That was the 40th.

950
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
That would be soonish.

951
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Yeah.

952
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,280
Hang in there, Piscopo.

953
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,640
We need you.

954
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,360
The show's going to be dying.

955
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,840
Somebody's got to resuscitate it.

956
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,520
Well, he'll be on the campaign trail soon.

957
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,360
For Trump or DeSantis, it's going to be one of them.

958
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,320
He's going to be a good VP, you know?

959
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,400
You know, it's tough trying to rebuild the country.

960
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,800
You know, it's like when you're trying to rebuild

961
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,600
Saturday and then why when you're a new guy?

962
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Anyways, you know, they had horse drawn carriages,

963
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,360
but they had all the we started doing the research.

964
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,840
I'm like, all right, well, this is going to be an episode

965
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,040
all about how bad the guys are because the rides

966
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,400
do not give us anything to work with.

967
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,280
It's all the things we don't talk about.

968
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,680
Yeah. Is this there's a list I found.

969
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,320
Is this am I in the right spot here?

970
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,600
There was like the carousel and stuff.

971
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,800
There was a carousel.

972
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,400
Yeah. And a ferris wheel.

973
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,120
Well, the best was the blatant copyright theft.

974
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,920
I'm talking about, of course, Main Street Heritage USA.

975
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,840
They just took Main Street USA, created a pretty similar version

976
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,760
and stuck a different word in the middle of the name.

977
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,840
That seems not OK.

978
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,200
Just the same thing.

979
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,200
And they made it indoors and thus

980
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,680
more unpleasant, I'd say, more claustrophobic.

981
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,280
They did a lot of their tapings from around there.

982
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,680
And you know what? It looks good on on camera.

983
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,240
It's a great as a fun backdrop.

984
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,920
I will I will say aesthetically, just liking kind of dull

985
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,080
brown 80s atriums, I feel like I would walk around this

986
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,120
Main Street USA and enjoy it as long as I could avoid

987
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,320
indoctrination wherever I could.

988
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,880
If I look at pictures of it, I'm like, just aesthetically.

989
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

990
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Well, you know, and there's aesthetics at play that I like in general

991
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,120
in this place. Unfortunately, I watched a video.

992
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,640
I did find a little like brochure of what there is to do here.

993
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,800
And let me just play you a little snippet of this.

994
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,000
This is from 1987. They're still in the height.

995
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,360
So here's what we feel.

996
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,760
PtL really is.

997
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,080
This is just they're cutting to, you know, oh, they got they they got camels.

998
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,240
They make camels live here, that kind of thing.

999
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,480
But this song,

1000
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,520
I was so delighted when this came up.

1001
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,400
I've talked on the show before about how I listen to my attempt

1002
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,520
at just trying to be around people, mover, monorail type music all day, every day.

1003
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,440
This is the song. This is the key song.

1004
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,880
It's called Night Lines. It's by Dave Gruessen.

1005
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,680
I listen to this all the goddamn time.

1006
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,240
If there's ever anything that's stressing me out, a live show of ours,

1007
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,400
anything with a little bit of pressure, I'm like, you know, it'll calm me down.

1008
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,280
I was listening to that song.

1009
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,960
So I was happy to hear it because it's a perfect song.

1010
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,120
If you want to imagine like this property has many amenities.

1011
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,360
Fun for the whole family.

1012
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,200
It's like meant for little montages like that.

1013
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,080
It's meant to lull you into a feeling of like, I'm going to accept this information

1014
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,480
and I'm going to use it.

1015
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
Yeah, yes. Informative. Right.

1016
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,200
Entertaining. Right.

1017
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,760
I love if you've ever been curious about this kind of music, it's on Spotify.

1018
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,280
Dave Gruessen, Night Lines.

1019
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,200
That's my that's that's Scott's pick.

1020
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,360
Scott's Choice.

1021
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,400
Puff up those listeners on that.

1022
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
It's a delightful song.

1023
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,680
Is it on Spotify or anything?

1024
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,960
It is on Spotify. Yeah.

1025
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,120
Dave Gruessen is great in general.

1026
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,880
He did the score for Tootsie.

1027
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,360
I want to say like the firm, I think Ishtar.

1028
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,240
He did a lot of big days.

1029
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,760
Film score is a heavy hitter.

1030
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,200
Pleasant like sweater wearing guy.

1031
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,040
So anyway, just that's so if you're a little taste of that music

1032
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,360
and that's the vibe, you know, that like there's shopping and horseback riding

1033
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,000
and I don't know, balloons and it's and and reviews.

1034
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,440
It's all softball, apparently.

1035
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,160
And it's everything in it is very pleasant and the music's pleasant.

1036
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,920
But then all of a sudden, I don't know when it's going to get to it.

1037
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,760
Oh, yeah. Then right after the pool, the sizable pool,

1038
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,440
then they cut to a very distressed woman in a dark room.

1039
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,640
And then actually, that's not the part I was looking for.

1040
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,200
There's a there's a there's a very distressed woman

1041
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,680
at some point just staring at a gun as if to say, should I use the gun?

1042
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,600
And then it cuts to that woman being led into like a cabin.

1043
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,160
Like, it's OK. Be here now.

1044
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,600
OK, it's very alarming that in this place and did it.

1045
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,880
Did it like but that's the kind of thing they did was they had like

1046
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,720
they had a home for unwed mothers.

1047
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,400
That was a thing here.

1048
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,200
Or they would like take in people.

1049
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,800
Yeah, there there was a point in time where they were attempting to do outreach

1050
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,440
and they were attempting to do charity work before.

1051
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,800
It was just like, we got to make money.

1052
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,760
It seems like Baker fell into the like, we got to get some money

1053
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,400
going, you know, like pretty, pretty quickly.

1054
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah, yeah, because that's that's expensive to maintain.

1055
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,480
It's it's massive property.

1056
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,280
I read it was like it's 10 times the size of Disneyland.

1057
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,720
Oh, OK. Huge campus. Yeah.

1058
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,240
Yeah. So you got to start making some return as fast as you can.

1059
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,200
But like the vacation amenities and the like,

1060
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,840
like even that sort of promotional package with like that music,

1061
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,680
the reason they were able to get so big so fast was they were trying to

1062
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,160
meet people where they were, you know, they were trying to like

1063
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,360
use the language of like secular entertainment without the values.

1064
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,680
Because there's a twenty twenty piece online about like, you know,

1065
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,520
interviewing people who work there and stuff.

1066
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,720
And it's just like someone was like,

1067
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,520
why can't we have Christian Disneyland?

1068
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,440
And it's like, what? What is so off putting to you about Disneyland?

1069
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
Is it the hoy, Palloy? You're around.

1070
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,880
Is it the sinners are around?

1071
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,320
Like, I don't isn't that already Disneyland pretty wholesome?

1072
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,760
Yeah, let's say well, especially let's because because today

1073
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,440
the answer would be there to it.

1074
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,080
They're changing Splash Mountain.

1075
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,360
They're putting their walk in my own shit.

1076
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,080
Yeah. But in 87, what are we mad at Disneyland?

1077
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,800
What possibly? Yeah.

1078
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,000
They were, if any, they were far too more already a Christian theme park.

1079
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,520
It's already a Christian theme park.

1080
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,920
What do we do? Christian things sometimes a little more like, yes.

1081
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,800
And where you get, you know, like, yeah, are you that upset at the?

1082
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,560
Why do they have Lincoln talking solemnly at me?

1083
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,760
It should be Moses. Yeah.

1084
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,880
It's like it's very wholesome, I would say. Yeah.

1085
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,680
Yeah. And in their way of describing wholesome, yes, of course.

1086
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,600
Like it's there was no there was nothing subversive about it. Yeah.

1087
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,080
And it is.

1088
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,720
Yeah. In 87, it's like you are in this.

1089
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Is that the second Reagan administration?

1090
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,920
Like your guy won handedly twice.

1091
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,760
The evangelical. Well, they touch on that movie.

1092
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,360
They deliver the evangelical vote to Reagan.

1093
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,240
Got him elected twice.

1094
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,120
It's just like, what more do you want? You won.

1095
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:17,040
They want that. They don't want the the secular values of Main Street, USA,

1096
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,840
the tawdry.

1097
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,840
I can't even think of what a fake.

1098
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,640
So we want we want our fudge just to have a picture of a cross next to it.

1099
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,520
Isn't he's pagan fudge?

1100
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,720
Doesn't make its leaning.

1101
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
This godless fudge has no place in America.

1102
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,240
This fudge will be down.

1103
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,400
We are all eternity.

1104
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,320
We make our fudge with holy water.

1105
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,600
We every. Yeah, it's I guess.

1106
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,240
Yeah, I guess they just wanted their IP to be in the park more.

1107
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,840
They just wanted more Christian IP. Yeah.

1108
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,120
To be greeting people and doing, I guess.

1109
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,120
Well, there may be the feeling of like that they don't like that.

1110
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,680
They just they only want to be around their kind.

1111
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,680
Oh, you know what?

1112
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,440
Well, this doesn't count at Disneyland either, because at this at that point

1113
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,640
in time, you couldn't drink at Disneyland.

1114
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,720
You could probably smoke.

1115
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,760
But here you could not smoke or drink.

1116
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,200
So I guess it's that at Disneyland.

1117
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,680
There's a bunch of filthy smokers everywhere.

1118
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,480
I guess kind of true.

1119
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,400
But I guess it's so that that's the only difference.

1120
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,360
You can't smoke here.

1121
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,680
Yeah. Could you can I ask a question?

1122
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,960
This is just the Disney question.

1123
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,560
Could you at any point smoke on?

1124
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,440
We've talked about this before, but smoke on the rides.

1125
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,080
Could you or could you smoke in like Mr.

1126
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,480
Lincoln in 1960?

1127
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,600
That's a good question.

1128
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,240
That is a good question.

1129
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,160
I think in general, no, because they're like, oh, we this these things are pain

1130
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,480
in the ass to keep up.

1131
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Well, we should look.

1132
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,320
We should look that up.

1133
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,920
We should look that out.

1134
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,720
I don't think you would ever smoke on the rides because I don't think they want to

1135
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,760
let cigarettes fly and get free to read.

1136
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,880
I know. But like in a show like with Lincoln, like something stationary or like

1137
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,520
stationary, like Twain.

1138
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,960
Right. I bet you for sure could light up a cigarette on the Mark Twain.

1139
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,160
Yeah. And I said this a couple of weeks ago that if I could,

1140
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,440
if I had to smoke a cigarette, it would be on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1141
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,280
Yeah, I would do it today.

1142
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,160
I would drive down today and do it.

1143
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,080
Some people were like in agreement.

1144
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,480
I felt like non smokers.

1145
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,680
I saw an agreement on this point.

1146
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,360
Yeah. Yeah. But I wonder.

1147
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,000
I wonder what the smoking poll we should.

1148
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,880
Yeah. Look into this.

1149
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,520
That would be funny if they did like a special night.

1150
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,000
Smokers. They did 80s.

1151
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,880
They did smokers like, like,

1152
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,600
they got big fans at the end of the night.

1153
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,360
Big filtrate.

1154
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,800
Everyone's got like a small smoking system.

1155
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,720
I will pay one hundred fifty dollars for this ticketed event,

1156
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,120
and I will smoke a pack at Disneyland on every ride.

1157
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,360
It is. I mean,

1158
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,400
a number, a lot of casinos in Vegas still have pretty significant.

1159
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

1160
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,200
And it is kind of like smoking indoor.

1161
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,280
This is novel nowadays.

1162
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,520
So that or bars that have private ownership or private club membership.

1163
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,960
There's there's some sort of rule about certain bars.

1164
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,080
I guess I'm not as excited to smoke a cigarette.

1165
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,160
No, no.

1166
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,000
The vibes are around you completely already.

1167
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,080
Yeah. But if I could light up in the Tiki room, I would do it.

1168
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,480
Yeah, that's what. Yeah. I bet there. Right.

1169
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,960
Yeah. Was it like unless it was just we don't know what these robots are going

1170
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,320
to do might make them go haywire. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They'd like gain sentient.

1171
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,200
They become sentient if you they had too much cigarette smoke.

1172
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,840
Although that might be that might have been Tiki room seems pretty close.

1173
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,200
I feel like if there was just a big plumes of smoke,

1174
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,760
you wouldn't be able to see the birds.

1175
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,080
That was a concern. Yes.

1176
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,040
Maybe that's yeah.

1177
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,640
Maybe that's the issue with the airing clouds of smoke.

1178
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,600
You just hear the click clacking. Yeah.

1179
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,920
Well, let's see.

1180
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,960
OK, so, you know,

1181
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,720
Terra Seller's drunk characters, but boring stuff.

1182
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,560
But there is a little bit of stuff about Main Street Heritage USA.

1183
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,840
The Heavenly Fudge Shop says as has been addressed before.

1184
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,640
They had a little slogan I saw on some leaflet.

1185
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,720
Follow the aroma.

1186
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,960
You be the judge.

1187
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,440
Take home a stick of pure homemade fudge.

1188
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,200
Nice, cute. Yeah, I guess.

1189
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,640
Um, let's see.

1190
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,920
We got the popcorn trolley.

1191
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,920
It's not called Fads and Fancy's Fads and Fancy's,

1192
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,440
which is and Fancy's there.

1193
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,800
That's like Disney ish.

1194
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,280
Yeah, I'd say all of it is they had like a jewelry store,

1195
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,960
which I feel like is a Main Street perennial.

1196
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,760
They had some very expensive stuff.

1197
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,800
OK, so they had Tammy Faye branded things.

1198
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,560
They had Tammy Faye makeup, which, of course, you're after.

1199
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,640
You want to look like Tammy Faye. Of course.

1200
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,920
Tammy Faye branded pantyhose they sold.

1201
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,920
And then this one's really weird that you could.

1202
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,800
Maybe you couldn't buy this.

1203
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,440
This is maybe this is just on display

1204
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,080
that there was a handmade porcelain bride doll

1205
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,880
in honor of the Baker's 25th wedding anniversary.

1206
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,760
And so she is in full bride attire,

1207
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,040
complete with lacy lingerie.

1208
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,320
That is a quote.

1209
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,400
I didn't look at a little doll of Tammy Faye in bridal lingerie.

1210
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,760
Is it this doll?

1211
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,280
Ah, you have a show to me.

1212
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,840
Oh, yeah. Is that a picture of it on eBay?

1213
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,600
What is this?

1214
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,720
Click back on it for me.

1215
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,680
Sorry. Yeah.

1216
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,840
This is a vintage wire press photo of the doll

1217
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,800
of a Tammy Faye doll.

1218
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,040
Oh, my God. Yikes.

1219
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,240
Wow. You found little little lacy lingerie.

1220
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,200
That looks like Annabelle or something.

1221
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,520
That's like a very haunted doll vibe.

1222
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,880
So so well, they got the they got the memo that like

1223
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,760
people would want like the head of the company, like a Michael Eisner doll.

1224
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,520
They got that idea.

1225
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,440
I guess so, because I mean, or the founders themselves

1226
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,640
obviously wanted to get merch like, I mean, we want we want dolls of ourselves.

1227
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,440
That was kind of, you know, they started with doing the puppet shows on the one.

1228
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,800
Right. That was the beginning of their television career.

1229
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,440
It's not that far.

1230
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,560
Oh, yeah. To like dolls from there. Right. Right.

1231
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,440
You could also buy praise dolls, talking praise dolls that you squeezed.

1232
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,560
And you squeeze them and they say,

1233
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,920
I am full of joy.

1234
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,080
Jesus is Lord. Praise the Lord.

1235
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,240
Pray with me and I say my prayers.

1236
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,600
I say my prayers.

1237
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,480
Hey, Dolly, do you say your prayers?

1238
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,160
Got any audio of this, right?

1239
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,240
I just would love to know.

1240
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,040
No, no.

1241
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,800
We're always here.

1242
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,240
Yeah.

1243
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,000
Hey, when is it?

1244
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,520
It's also like inevitably if you give a kid young enough a doll,

1245
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,680
at some point they're going to stop like playing with it as intended.

1246
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,960
And they're just going to whack it against a wall or like,

1247
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,160
you know, hurl it at their sibling.

1248
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,800
So they are all of these dolls no longer have the ability to speak.

1249
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,840
That's what you're saying.

1250
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,040
Due to horseplay. Yeah. Yeah.

1251
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,760
Weird detail about the

1252
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,840
retail situation in this place.

1253
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,120
There was a restaurant manager there who said, here's one thing.

1254
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,000
Christians don't tip.

1255
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,840
They'll give you a hundred dollars if you need it, but they won't leave that 15 percent.

1256
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,760
And they don't seem to play tennis either.

1257
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,160
The courts are often empty.

1258
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,600
So I tip very well,

1259
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,320
even if the service is terrible and I play tennis.

1260
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,040
So, no, they don't.

1261
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,600
That's what they're you're the element.

1262
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,080
They're trying to keep out of this place.

1263
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,920
Oh, wow. They want they want non tippers.

1264
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,320
And I don't feel welcome.

1265
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,880
I do not feel welcome at this place.

1266
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,320
This is this. It's been raised to the ground.

1267
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,240
I found there's some copy in that brochure about the general store

1268
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,960
on Main Street.

1269
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,560
The big header, it says, everybody loves shopping.

1270
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,320
Yes, even dad will enjoy poking around in the big general store,

1271
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,560
which carries everything from camping supplies and groceries to gifts.

1272
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,440
In fact, he might just want to stay there

1273
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,880
forever. I don't know.

1274
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,800
But once mom and the kids explore Main Street's

1275
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,040
Cobblestone Avenue lined with wonderful old fashioned shops,

1276
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,800
they'll make sure dad sees it, too.

1277
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,280
I don't this copy on the brochure is so odd and inhuman.

1278
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,200
We're like, we understand people.

1279
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,680
Dad will see that desires.

1280
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,880
Dad will see camping supplies and he will want to live in a store.

1281
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,480
You're not you're going to have to drag him out.

1282
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,000
Uh huh. It's the vibe I'm getting.

1283
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,400
And then the second sentence is like, you have to force dad to look at cobblestone.

1284
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,000
It's like it'll be pretty good.

1285
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,280
He'll he'll he'll make sure he sees this area as well.

1286
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,840
If I could stay here forever, if I could, if I could, I'd drop you in a second,

1287
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,080
honey, if I could live with 100 fishing poles.

1288
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,000
I want to marry this fishing pole.

1289
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,600
Now, where is the nearest pastor?

1290
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,840
Oh, he's right over here.

1291
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,280
Oh, over here right now.

1292
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,840
Clerk is working.

1293
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,200
Oh, you're all ordained.

1294
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,080
Everyone here who works here is ordained.

1295
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,480
I'm marrying the.

1296
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,600
Boy, it's me and these 25 fishing poles, man and pull it awake.

1297
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,600
Go to the Tammy Faye store.

1298
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,680
Give me a wig. Put it on the pole.

1299
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,960
We're doing this now.

1300
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,320
Tammy Faye Rouge on fishing poles.

1301
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,720
I don't give a shit about these cobblestones.

1302
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,840
I want to marry this pole.

1303
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,440
Oh, no, I tried to kiss my new wife.

1304
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,400
Got a hook.

1305
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,960
Twenty five hooks in me.

1306
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,760
Oh, no.

1307
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,400
Women who turns to the Cameron

1308
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,800
pole. What are you going to do with them?

1309
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,160
You live without them.

1310
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,680
This is some great Christian sketch.

1311
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,880
I think we're doing very good.

1312
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,320
This would I don't know if they had any sort of dinner theater.

1313
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,200
It looked like they had some shows from that video, but yeah,

1314
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,520
you could have done this live and this.

1315
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,480
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

1316
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,120
Would have killed murders, kills.

1317
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,600
There was a lot of entertainment there because they're doing the tapings here.

1318
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,720
I mean, really became where they did the tapings for a very long time

1319
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,840
and various accommodations.

1320
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,400
So it's like Nickelodeon Studios.

1321
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,560
You go there to see the show you love live.

1322
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,120
Yeah, right.

1323
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,960
I grew up like 20, 30 minutes away from the QVC studios,

1324
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,400
which are just sort of located in the middle of like southeast P.A.

1325
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,720
And there's no theme park or is there even a gift shop?

1326
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,640
I think I think there's some sort of maybe shop.

1327
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,480
Did you ever try to go or get a tour?

1328
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,080
I didn't. It didn't dawn on me to like, oh, I could have just done an internship

1329
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,800
there like you could have been an on air host.

1330
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,080
Yeah, it could have been on air.

1331
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,440
I know people who I think at some point try or like they did a short run.

1332
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,720
Yeah. You know, you knew upstart QVC years.

1333
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,160
Wow. Could you do it? You think?

1334
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,400
Huh? I think I could do it like just vamp and like,

1335
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,720
just like, yeah, for like a couple hours, you'd have to just keep talking about.

1336
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,720
I don't know. I almost sent you a weird Lacey dolls, probably Lacey dolls.

1337
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,800
It was like like high high end watches,

1338
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,400
but it was like had Batman and the Joker on them.

1339
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,600
I was flipping the channels recently.

1340
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,040
I came across that on TVC. Well, yeah, I don't know.

1341
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,040
I thought about it.

1342
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,320
I thought not. I'm not really thinking about seriously doing it,

1343
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,520
but I was like, could I do it for a couple of hours? I guess so.

1344
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,240
There was an attempt to start like, you know, streaming

1345
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,160
shopping network for millennials. Sure.

1346
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,480
Yeah. The old meltdown comics location in West Hollywood.

1347
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,760
But it was who was it? Was it Jimmy Iovine's son?

1348
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1349
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,920
Well, no, he and he has an app now that's sort of like that called Network

1350
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,880
NTW RK, I believe.

1351
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,720
I was going to ask what letters.

1352
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,600
And there's like friends of ours host stuff on there.

1353
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,480
So people we know.

1354
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,040
I'll find out later. Yeah, we'll talk about later.

1355
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,480
But I bought them.

1356
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,840
Honestly, I bought discount toys on this app.

1357
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,920
Oh, it did work. So.

1358
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,040
But yeah, it is.

1359
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,920
The dream is alive is what I'm saying.

1360
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,400
You love new. I love network.

1361
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,120
There's also brought to you by there is a, you know, there's a Green Day side.

1362
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,120
Secret side project, I believe, called The Network or network as well.

1363
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,640
Where the letters are dropped in that.

1364
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,560
Oh, good question. Let me take a look.

1365
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,760
It was a secret ban, though.

1366
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,120
They've never admitted they are the state of secret.

1367
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,080
They have a multiple side projects.

1368
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,800
Hold on. Green Day, the network.

1369
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,240
I believe it was the network.

1370
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,400
No regular spelling of the network.

1371
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,800
OK, so when what what were they able to do in the network that

1372
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,960
it was the confines of Green Day didn't allow?

1373
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,760
I believe it was a little more like Devo sounding.

1374
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,320
I think you have said with that reference, you have guaranteed

1375
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,200
I won't like it because I because I like Devo is I will.

1376
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,000
That's what it was and go. No, not Devo as at all.

1377
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,160
We'll see. I can't remember.

1378
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,040
This was I think they actually brought the network back recently,

1379
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,280
but I think they started they started doing it like 15 years ago.

1380
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,560
OK, but there's yeah, there's multiple.

1381
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,240
There was a network zoom reunion. Yeah.

1382
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,480
Even the pandemic. Mm hmm. That's true.

1383
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,480
So anyway, Jason, QVC host. Yeah.

1384
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:15,880
I know. I know. Pennsylvania for a fact that QVC at home shopping

1385
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,280
that work same ownership now.

1386
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,160
Oh, because my mom was complaining about like they have different

1387
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,840
return policies, but they're the same company.

1388
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,120
Your mom, that makes me go like, are you still buying?

1389
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,480
Sounds like it. Yeah.

1390
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,760
Sounds like you're getting a Batman watch.

1391
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,640
You're getting a good deal. Hey, I'll take it.

1392
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,120
I wear a watch, though.

1393
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,840
Um, uh, other stuff they had here.

1394
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,600
Oh, well, here I like this in terms of attractions.

1395
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,640
This one's exciting enough to compete with walking that park guests.

1396
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:54,160
Now you are you can book as much vacation time at this place as you want.

1397
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,960
And this was not enforced, but it was strongly suggested

1398
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,200
that maybe, you know, you got a lot of vacation time.

1399
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,720
Can't you give us just a little for volunteer efforts?

1400
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,400
Can't you get on the phone bank?

1401
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,360
And if you do so, you could tell if everyone did that, shipped in a little,

1402
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,640
it could save the ministry thousands of dollars a year,

1403
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,480
which then can be spent on other PTO ventures, such as World Missions

1404
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,200
or, you know, hush money to women.

1405
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,280
Insane. So, you know, what am I going to South Carolina to do?

1406
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,040
Walk and volunteer here.

1407
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,800
And then and then but then I get to do rides.

1408
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,680
Well, I mean, if we we might have them someday,

1409
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,680
assuming the company doesn't fall into incredible swift collapse.

1410
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,480
There has to be a family who is just like, OK,

1411
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,440
what where are we going for vacation this year?

1412
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,240
OK, last year we had to sit through the two hour timeshare presentation.

1413
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,080
What do you have to do this year?

1414
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,040
You have to volunteer to phone bank.

1415
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,720
Dad, come on.

1416
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,120
Yeah, there are no I there were.

1417
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,720
I would be wonder if there's anyone listening who had to do this.

1418
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,880
If there's an old they're a little older listener.

1419
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,920
Maybe it's I mean, you know, there's one of those videos on YouTube

1420
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,960
that's like exploring the grounds of it and what's there now.

1421
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,600
And the guy, well, he was poking fun at it.

1422
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,880
He also seemed to be like, I really liked it.

1423
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,800
He didn't seem like strongly religious.

1424
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,360
And that's why I think it's possible that you, you know,

1425
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,800
it's it's like a it's a campground kind of shows.

1426
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,720
Yeah. You know, and I I was in a pool and I did horseback riding.

1427
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,320
I think it's fully possible you could have liked this.

1428
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,160
It was not aggressive in the way that the Holy Land experience was.

1429
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,240
Or yeah, I think there's a way that you could have had this experience

1430
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,640
without feeling like stuff was shoved down your throat.

1431
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,960
Because and some of it, like you're saying, has been preserved.

1432
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,800
The one hotel was preserved, I believe.

1433
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,760
Well, in a bunch.

1434
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,760
And it's like the little the guest rooms like where you would stay.

1435
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,640
All the the cottages and everything all became condit.

1436
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,840
Like people do live.

1437
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,320
And then there's new buildings that are that were built

1438
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,320
on the grounds of the water parks where the water park used to be.

1439
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,320
It's all just like really boring looking housing tracks at this point.

1440
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,640
One of the attractions we haven't mentioned yet, the upper room,

1441
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,280
a recreation of the place in Jerusalem where

1442
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,640
supposedly the Last Supper was held.

1443
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,240
Oh, that's what that is.

1444
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,640
That is still in.

1445
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,800
You can still go there.

1446
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,280
Another ministry, another ministry took over portions of this.

1447
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,400
And that is still functioning.

1448
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,520
It's not open 24 hours a day, seven days a week like it used to be.

1449
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,360
And you're. Yeah, that was the idea of it is that you would like

1450
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,400
Jim Baker's like, how do we get this perfect?

1451
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,320
Oh, you can't go pray somewhere at 3am.

1452
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,680
Yeah. So yeah.

1453
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,800
So there's that this 24 hour prayer.

1454
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,040
And you said it was a recreation.

1455
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,840
Yeah, a recreation of.

1456
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,600
So was it like figures or was it human beings playing?

1457
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,000
Do we know? I don't think any.

1458
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,240
I think it's the place. Yeah, I think it's just a table.

1459
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,200
It's just the room. So you would go.

1460
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,920
No mannequins, no robots, no, no, no, that's just a genuine place to pray.

1461
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,160
But it looks like I see a room from the year

1462
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:13,520
thirty six because you would say, you know, like I'm just blue sky here.

1463
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,840
Like, you know, if you paid money to like be part of the Last Supper,

1464
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,760
to eat at the table.

1465
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,000
Now we're talking as far as experience, the last year.

1466
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,680
Yes. So you're paying a high end ticket price to eat at the Last Supper,

1467
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,960
to be in that moment in the same way you're paying in Star Wars Hotel

1468
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,360
to experience a club on the cruise ship.

1469
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,280
Sure. Yeah. And this is now you're part of the Star Wars canon.

1470
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,640
This is now this is hardcore part of the Christianity canon here.

1471
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,440
What happened at the Last Supper?

1472
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,280
Was there like a was one of the acts of betrayal?

1473
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,720
That the last time I got to watch that happen.

1474
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,640
That's my understanding.

1475
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,040
I guess if you pay more, you could be the betrayer.

1476
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,200
You could be.

1477
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,800
I'm a good look, Scott, you're the religious guy of the three of us here.

1478
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,400
So you should really know.

1479
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,720
Is this the Judas? Is this the Judas thing?

1480
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,120
Is this the that's as close as I can get even asking the question.

1481
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,040
Some of you will betray me.

1482
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,800
He said, OK, so you get to watch that happen.

1483
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,600
That's pretty exciting. That's kind of like a and then it's like a little

1484
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,400
Kylo. It's like a body of Christ, blood of Christ, I believe.

1485
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,920
Right. But I'm just trying to that happened.

1486
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,640
And that's that, too. All right.

1487
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,960
I'm just trying to think of stuff that would get people engaged

1488
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,840
and have more fun with any of this stuff, because they never

1489
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,200
know when is like every Christian Disneyland and they talked a big game here.

1490
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,000
But like just build something as good as a haunted mansion.

1491
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,200
And even if it's like if people will go like, you know,

1492
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,800
I'm not really into the message here, but these effects,

1493
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,040
but this experience, this immersive, they've missed the point of all of that.

1494
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,480
I feel like consistently is they've never they have yet to do this.

1495
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,840
And I feel like it's the same way with most Christian entertainment.

1496
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,440
And I have not Christian Rock.

1497
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,720
And maybe I'm completely wrong and I'm missing some stuff.

1498
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,960
It's a little it's a little right.

1499
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,560
Not well done. Exactly.

1500
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,680
And you're going to be eating your words in a couple of hours

1501
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,120
when you're at that day screening of Father Stu.

1502
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,040
You don't know what that is.

1503
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,640
You know, come on, you don't know what is Father's.

1504
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,840
Barely heard of it. I understand.

1505
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,040
Yeah, but you have that's interesting.

1506
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,400
I don't think so. Tell me what it is.

1507
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,360
Oh, Father Stu is the new Mark Wahlberg movie about.

1508
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh, wait a minute.

1509
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,440
It's a real guy. It's a real guy who appears in episodes of Wahlbergers.

1510
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,160
That's how I knew about Father Stu.

1511
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,760
He's passed away at this point.

1512
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,320
Yeah, I don't see. I don't know that.

1513
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,120
I think but I think he shows I think he was alive at the time.

1514
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,000
I don't quote me on that.

1515
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,520
But on a there's a recent episode of The Best Show where Tom Sharpling

1516
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,640
just watches the trailer and describes beat by beat what is happening,

1517
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,920
because it's like it's a guy who moves to Hollywood to be an actor.

1518
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,880
But then he's an X-Boxer.

1519
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,520
But then he gets in a motorcycle accident and he stole the motorcycle

1520
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,200
and then he becomes a priest and then he gets sick.

1521
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:59,040
And his old boss, who told him not to steal something, was Mel Gibson in the movie.

1522
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Oh, yes, that's a very jarring cut to just suddenly 20 seconds in.

1523
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,240
Mel, oh, Mel's there.

1524
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,200
It's the start that Mark Wahlberg says he's going to start making

1525
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,320
all religious. Oh, this is the turn.

1526
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,120
Oh, OK. Mel's already done that.

1527
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,960
I actually haven't seen the Mel movies.

1528
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,800
The Mel's done it, but Wahlberg hasn't. Right. Right.

1529
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,240
No, I know. I'm sorry. So I'm trying to like, yeah. OK.

1530
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,520
So so maybe you're saying Wahlberg is going to be ushering in a new golden age

1531
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,360
of hardcore Christian entertainment that could lead to like theme parks

1532
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,640
finally giving us the rise of the resistance Christian experience

1533
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,000
that we've wanted for so long.

1534
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,760
Well, Father Stu the Ride, I guess.

1535
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,240
Father Stu the Ride, assuming that this movie is and I don't know what places

1536
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:45,520
you go in, but if there's well, we have a vehicle in play.

1537
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,120
If he's on a motorcycle, you could do a VR motorcycle ride.

1538
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,200
Right. Or a truck.

1539
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,440
Or I forget if you're in a sidecar, you're like you're sitting like the Hagrid.

1540
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1541
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,720
You're riding shotgun with Father Stu. All right.

1542
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,920
But getting closer, getting closer.

1543
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,360
Huh? I don't know what studio is putting this out.

1544
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,600
Is this already pictures?

1545
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,280
OK. OK. Well, they have their and they have deals with it.

1546
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,240
I don't have a big theme park present.

1547
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,880
Seven million dollars.

1548
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,000
Oh, it's out. It's out. Yeah. Hmm.

1549
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,880
OK. The box office after everything everywhere all at once.

1550
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,760
Were any of the Transformers that Mark Wahlberg was in the movie with Christian?

1551
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,040
Were any of the robots all over early Christian?

1552
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,560
Bumblebee played a lot of secular music.

1553
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,640
Yes, that's true. OK. So that's out.

1554
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,840
He would have had to.

1555
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,480
He would have had to have converted them.

1556
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,280
I see. So maybe. OK.

1557
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,760
I'm not sure what's maybe Christian robots.

1558
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,560
There's a movie in the future with Christian robots where

1559
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,200
they like preach to you instead of saying they're proud of you at the end.

1560
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,720
They give you a little like a psalm or something at the very end of the ride.

1561
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,280
Yeah, that would be nice.

1562
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,280
They say, though, I will pray for you.

1563
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,800
I will pray for you. Michael may say your name feels kind of good.

1564
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,280
Right. It feels great. Yeah.

1565
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,440
Yeah. I feel like he's going to have some sway.

1566
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,760
He's a big, big, crazy truck.

1567
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,360
God's got to listen when he talks.

1568
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,200
Michael, you've been have you've been putting your paws in.

1569
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,480
God's paint by it again, haven't you?

1570
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,400
You little scam.

1571
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,240
I will make sure you're seated at the right hand of Scott

1572
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,320
and between Scott and God's paint.

1573
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,440
Yeah. So like give us that level and we'll go to these parts.

1574
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,200
I mean, we'll go to these parts regardless, but

1575
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,240
go to the park. If we get there, we stick around.

1576
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,720
If there was, that's what I'm saying.

1577
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,400
Yeah. Somebody just has to do it as well.

1578
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,080
And what they always think they're going to do, but they they don't.

1579
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,760
Now, let me say that maybe this is a good

1580
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,760
well, actually, before I get to that,

1581
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,160
Jim Baker, if if he hadn't done

1582
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,640
many horrible things and committed crimes and this place had remained,

1583
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,040
he did have an idea for a ride.

1584
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,840
Did you come across this, Jason? No.

1585
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,040
There was a pitch for a ride and it's not very fleshed out, but it sounds good.

1586
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,600
And the ride is a roller coaster ride through heaven and hell.

1587
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,920
This is something he wanted to do. OK.

1588
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,040
Now, now that's that's that's it.

1589
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,600
That's what we want. Yeah. He's right. Mm hmm.

1590
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,000
I did you did it.

1591
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,400
Was it fleshed out at all or he just sort of had the idea?

1592
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,560
No, that's it, which isn't much that doesn't tell you.

1593
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,280
And I guess you'd have to worry that that would be what if that's only

1594
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,520
six flags level theming where the Riddler ride equals a green track?

1595
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,280
And in this world, it is a blue and white track

1596
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,400
when you're up high and a red track when you're down low.

1597
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,320
Yeah. Now, yeah, exactly.

1598
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,200
That's probably what he probably didn't think too much about it.

1599
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,880
I could be wrong. But how would you do it?

1600
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,080
I'm trying to think you would want the like

1601
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,560
hell stuff to be sort of underground.

1602
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,080
And then maybe you would want the coaster to be up,

1603
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,680
like go like there's almost like scaffolding.

1604
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,680
I'm trying to think of like in credit coaster.

1605
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,280
You would want like sort of clouds, like plastic clouds

1606
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,840
up at the top of the track, perhaps.

1607
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,320
Or yeah, like,

1608
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,360
well, it might even be enough just that it's indoor, outdoor.

1609
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,320
And when you're outdoor, you're soaring through the sky,

1610
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,040
like it gets really high and you're you're feeling the euphoria

1611
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,440
of flight as if the flight of an angel.

1612
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,360
Maybe that's it. Maybe there's angels around,

1613
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,680
whether fully animated or just Mr. Incredible style.

1614
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,720
You feel like you're soaring with the angels up there.

1615
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,160
But then the indoor part is real scary and murky.

1616
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,200
And, you know, you're watching people all like have to rotate

1617
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,200
big wooden. That's good.

1618
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,880
And demons are whipping them.

1619
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,320
So, yeah, you want it like a slow lift till up.

1620
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,080
You go slowly up and then you get to the top of the lift till.

1621
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,040
And then I think you could even put, yeah, plastic clouds and angels.

1622
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,400
And you're sort of just going around the track.

1623
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,000
And then at a certain point, I assume you commit some sort of sin.

1624
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,160
There's a representative representation of you committing sin and going.

1625
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,880
Or it just tells you like, this is what you'll see if you live a pious life.

1626
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,360
But if you don't.

1627
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,760
And then maybe it's just the drop like a severe straight drop.

1628
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,760
It's like a shell razor drop in air time, you know, like kind of

1629
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,120
what it seems like happens in Velocicoaster.

1630
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,240
It's like, you know, big transcendent.

1631
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,640
You don't get the fun. You have to be saved from this.

1632
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,520
I think hell happens early.

1633
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,520
Maybe the devil tempts you and then you take the plunge.

1634
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,360
Like you could go this way or he's holding a drive my way.

1635
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,760
He's holding a package of non-religious fudge

1636
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,720
and then your car banks to try to taste the fudge.

1637
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,400
Yeah, but it ends up plummeting to hell

1638
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,920
because you've eaten this sacrilegious fudge made with regular water,

1639
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,240
with regular water.

1640
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,640
And then it's and then it's the best representation of hell in a theme park

1641
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,120
ever. I think you have to go crazy with here, like a massive

1642
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,080
genuinely frightening.

1643
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,640
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That devil.

1644
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,000
Big pressure on that devil.

1645
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,760
That's got to be that's like the Everest Yeti.

1646
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,840
That's like Larry, the scary Rex.

1647
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,200
Yeah. All of it at once.

1648
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,240
Your car should stop for like five to ten minutes while the robot

1649
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:21,120
puts its hands all over your face to just in like the most unsettling thing.

1650
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,320
This is the first robot on a ride that touches you.

1651
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,360
Getting assaulted by a devil.

1652
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,200
Yes, because you have to know.

1653
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,040
You have to know if you make poor choices.

1654
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,800
So, yeah, you'll get the car stops for ten minutes.

1655
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,560
And it just like robot hands all over your face, like you will be here forever.

1656
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,400
And it's hot. It's unpleasant to the fingers are pokey.

1657
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,200
They really they hurt. You're right. It has to be crazy hot.

1658
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,760
I was complaining. I was saying in that Armageddon episode,

1659
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,360
I don't like indoor fire.

1660
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,120
This would have to, you know, even I have to say like it's got to be

1661
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,120
so much hotter than Armageddon than any indoor fire ever.

1662
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,440
It's got to be very unpleasant.

1663
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,640
This is like you're on stage.

1664
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,080
Yeah, on stage at a Mali crew concert right by the pyro.

1665
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,160
That's how hot it's going to be in this section of it.

1666
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,760
It's not just quick blasts. It's sustained.

1667
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,280
It's ten. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1668
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,360
Of flame. You got to start thinking maybe you're going to lose your hair in this thing.

1669
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,000
Yes. Well, maybe the end is just like it's a, you know,

1670
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,280
quick lift hill up to like a flat ride section, like a slow moving.

1671
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,360
You return to the loading station.

1672
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,520
You go through a little heaven scene.

1673
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,840
OK, that's good. This is what awaits you.

1674
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,640
And then the loading station, I don't know, it should probably be like a chapel

1675
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,960
or something.

1676
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,400
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1677
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,760
Yeah. So you come back.

1678
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,880
Well, yeah, like the chapel is like the portal between the world.

1679
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,320
It's where you make your choice.

1680
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,120
You should, you know, to get out of the devil's situation,

1681
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,040
you should go person to person in the car and you should just

1682
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,080
explain how you've sinned in your life to the devil.

1683
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,760
And so once you've once you've revealed everything that you've ever done

1684
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,680
wrong to the devil, then he goes, all right.

1685
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,600
And then and they're actually somebody is listening, somebody's manning

1686
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,880
that animatronics. You have to through virtue and honesty.

1687
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,040
You're allowed to leave. But then I think you get like a launch and some fun.

1688
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,600
And then you're soaring through.

1689
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,240
Well, maybe like, I don't know if she'd lend it out to a religious organization,

1690
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,360
but like heaven is a place on earth.

1691
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,440
Like it's got to be the heaven part has to be fun.

1692
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,040
You got to be it's. Yeah, yeah.

1693
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:24,120
How much better it is than being touched by actual by by

1694
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,440
actual robot fingers scraping against your face?

1695
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,280
Well, what if when you get into the end there into heaven, it's the song playing.

1696
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,400
And then there's a big god robot and he touches your face, too.

1697
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,760
But the fingers are softer.

1698
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,440
Yeah, it needs to be a massive god like like the guardians.

1699
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,840
Coaster has the celestial ison is the antagonist.

1700
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,440
Yes. Yes, I've read this.

1701
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,440
The savior. Right.

1702
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,760
We need a massive benevolent god.

1703
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,160
Yeah, yeah.

1704
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,240
And he you see you feel his tender touch.

1705
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,800
Yeah. And then he yells like, be with me.

1706
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,840
And then you get launched up to his kingdom.

1707
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,000
This is the type of thing.

1708
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,920
A great ride anchoring the park would like this would keep something alive.

1709
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,920
I guess it didn't help with the Knights and White Satin.

1710
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,360
So that the park went away.

1711
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,360
But supposedly that was a great ride.

1712
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,400
And at the very least, you would say, yeah, you got to go.

1713
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,040
You got to make time. Yeah.

1714
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Have you ever been on a ride where the robots touch you?

1715
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,840
Because people would go wild for it.

1716
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,320
That's the headline.

1717
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,240
The religious aspect of it is buried deep in the article.

1718
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,440
Deep in the article. Right.

1719
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,480
So, yeah, I just think I think no one's approached this correctly.

1720
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,040
So if you're a hardcore fundamentalist Christian

1721
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:41,400
and you want a smart bunch of ideas for a theme park, come to us.

1722
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,800
This is a look we've begged, by the way,

1723
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,560
other theme park companies to have us blue sky things.

1724
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,440
Crickets. Yeah.

1725
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,680
Absolutely nothing. Years and years of begging.

1726
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,040
Let us get involved.

1727
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,280
And now here's the thing. Christians come to us.

1728
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,720
We want to be involved in the theme park industry and whatever bad ideas you have.

1729
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,160
Yeah. We're willing to sell our own beliefs out

1730
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,240
if it means that we can write like dialogue for a little robot or a show.

1731
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:11,720
For St. Peter going like, come on, let's go.

1732
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,280
Oh, watch out.

1733
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,200
Well, we're like, you know, I really my my beliefs are

1734
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,920
complete opposite to some of these people, but they let me write the

1735
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,040
little pattern during a pre show for a ride.

1736
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,320
So we're willing to sell ourselves.

1737
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,040
And they need us is the point.

1738
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,800
We can. Yes, we can lift them up. Yes.

1739
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,040
And maybe convert them to being a little more fun. Right.

1740
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,280
So so so, yeah, at this point, I've given up on being

1741
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,840
like consultants at Universal Creative.

1742
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,880
We will accept. Yeah.

1743
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,160
Whatever next. The Huckster.

1744
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,560
Oh, Alex Jones wants to do a theme park

1745
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,800
and he wants the podcast, the Ride Boys to be involved.

1746
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,760
Well, everything he says is reprehensible, but fun.

1747
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,760
It's a thing. Now he's going to lose a lot of money soon, but.

1748
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,600
Yeah. So we believe that is actually see, it seems like the most likely time

1749
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,560
for him to start a theme park. Oh, yeah.

1750
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,920
And yeah, when he is diving into bankruptcy.

1751
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,400
Yes. I that's often when, yeah, a lot of the 90s theme restaurants

1752
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,040
or theme parks that never came to be or just like weird.

1753
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,240
Like you learn about a new weird foreign dignitary

1754
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,040
who's like has oil money or zinc money.

1755
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,080
And it's like, I want a Spider-Man ride here.

1756
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,800
Silver silver money. Yeah.

1757
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,800
When you oddly have the most spending powers, when you've like

1758
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,880
you're teetering on the crimes on record.

1759
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,600
Let's talk about what brought this down because it was

1760
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,280
there were literal crimes involved.

1761
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:50,560
Well, first of all, I OK, the water park Heritage Island.

1762
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,080
I enjoy that name.

1763
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,960
And this now with a water park, at least this you sort of can't

1764
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,360
argue get there are there slides and you splash and you go down the slide.

1765
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,440
And in the lead up to it, you get great music like that.

1766
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,000
I found a full episode of the PTL Club where they're about to open the water park

1767
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:16,520
and they celebrate it by singing about how, you know, this place was

1768
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,880
it was a dream of ours.

1769
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,200
You might say an impossible dream.

1770
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,600
This is a rendition of that song to dream the impossible dream.

1771
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,240
And just to say this right, just to clear this up, this is not me singing.

1772
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,120
I kind of can't believe it.

1773
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:38,000
A man impossible dream.

1774
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,800
To.

1775
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,080
It's not the warble.

1776
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,600
To.

1777
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:56,440
Over just like waterfall foot, like empty water park footage.

1778
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,280
Yeah.

1779
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,480
Oh.

1780
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,680
I.

1781
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,520
I don't I don't understand how singers like this rise to this person was

1782
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,240
allowed to sing on television, and that's what the singing was like.

1783
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,960
Also, I just there's just no consensus.

1784
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,200
It's like, wait, you think you think everyone who lives in the devil's kingdom,

1785
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,880
New York City, and the people who make Broadway shows are going to hell.

1786
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,120
But you'll borrow you'll borrow the song from man.

1787
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,320
Man of the monster.

1788
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:32,800
It also isn't like if you're starting a big ambitious endeavor,

1789
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,040
man of the mantra is kind of a sort of a cursed thing to invoke.

1790
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,360
I feel I with the true the trouble Terry Gilliams had.

1791
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,480
Oh, yeah. Well, and just like it's about a man out of his mind

1792
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,440
tilting at will be like the phrase tilting and windmills.

1793
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,800
Gus, right? Like it was jousting with a windmill because he thought it was a monster

1794
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,920
because he was out of his mind.

1795
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I don't know.

1796
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,200
This is a guy building water parks for Jesus,

1797
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,000
thinking that the hush money he paid for an awful event

1798
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,160
years prior would never come back to bite him.

1799
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,720
Then it did within the year of the water park opening.

1800
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,360
It was so fat. This opened in 86.

1801
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:23,720
Weird fact that Heritage Island had a wave pool before Disney did,

1802
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,280
because Typhoon Lagoon is three years later.

1803
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,400
So they were first to it again.

1804
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,680
So I can't argue that wave pools fun.

1805
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,120
They did have a wave. Yeah.

1806
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,520
Beat Disney to it.

1807
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,680
But that opens in 86, 87.

1808
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,640
Stuff starts going wrong right away.

1809
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,720
Falwell takes over, I think, anticipating the Jessica Hahn

1810
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,600
situation that like Baker's going to become persona on ground.

1811
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,000
Like we have to like switch up the leadership and I have to start

1812
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,840
bilking this thing for money.

1813
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,880
I think the FBI and IRS were like about to kick down the doors to for those.

1814
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,880
Oh, yes. Money fraud. Yes.

1815
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,520
Well, the Baltimore Sun was looking into his finances,

1816
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,600
discovered they were paying so much hush money

1817
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,680
for this assault, this awful thing that happened in 1980.

1818
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,280
So then Falwell takes over.

1819
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,400
They are somehow with all this, they're getting so much money for people.

1820
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,520
There's 68 million dollars in debt.

1821
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,120
So that's when Falwell did a drive for donations and the drive.

1822
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,480
We discovered this, right? The slide Falwell slide.

1823
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,840
He went down the water slide in a full suit.

1824
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,280
Yes, which was built up.

1825
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,560
This was an event Nickelodeon style built up for many months

1826
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,760
and keep sending those in because all end up it's a very like

1827
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,600
and then your principles going to get slimed.

1828
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,320
Dunk tanks, even like a high level version of that.

1829
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,640
Yeah, it's just a shame it wasn't an action park slide

1830
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,040
or that slitter punch slide.

1831
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,360
It's just a shame.

1832
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,360
So it had launched only into the air, into heaven, across a freeway.

1833
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,440
Heaven and then launched his physical body all the way to heaven.

1834
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,040
So he would end up in hell where he is now.

1835
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,560
Yes, guarantee. Yes.

1836
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,560
Can't say if there is one, he's there.

1837
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,320
Yeah. So a lot of people donated for him to go on a water slide.

1838
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,600
And he built this up like it was going to be the worst thing.

1839
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,600
And he's so scared on the thing.

1840
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:19,480
I guess I who am I to I've been scared.

1841
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,600
Who are you to make fun of him for your fear?

1842
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,400
Vincent D'Ofrio in the in the eyes of the TV

1843
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,280
favorite movie, Vincent D'Ofrio is pretty much just doing the kingpin again.

1844
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,960
But he's Jerry Falwell.

1845
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,840
Yeah, it's pretty it's good.

1846
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,480
It's yeah, same deal.

1847
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,960
So he went down a water slide.

1848
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,360
It looks pretty funny doing it in a full suit is funny,

1849
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,360
but it's all falling apart.

1850
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,760
The hush funds come out.

1851
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,640
And so like, how could this

1852
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:50,280
bastion of morality be doing these horrible things?

1853
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,280
And then the other scam unravels the one you were talking about, Jason,

1854
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:59,160
where they have this tower, the Heritage Grand Tower, which has 500 rooms.

1855
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:03,800
But they sell 160,000

1856
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,800
PPL lifetime memberships, all guaranteed four days, three nights a year for life.

1857
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,320
For a thousand dollars, this would never like the map on this.

1858
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:18,160
And like, let alone that the place is closed within two years.

1859
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,840
Well, and when I like it wasn't finished, right?

1860
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,280
Like there are stories about people like just dropping their tool.

1861
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,160
Like the government's here. Shut it down.

1862
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:27,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1863
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,960
Shut it down. Yeah, everybody ran.

1864
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,520
Yeah, there's also oh, God.

1865
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,360
And I can't remember the podcast to listen to about this,

1866
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,520
but they talk to somebody who grew up around there and it just became like

1867
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,880
it's where the teens went to get high.

1868
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,800
Like you'd go like hook up and smoke joints on top of the unfinished

1869
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,760
Heritage Grand Tower.

1870
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,040
So it just like it just all unraveled.

1871
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,920
It's still this footage of this you can watch on YouTube.

1872
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,800
It's so creepy that you can fly drones clear through windows

1873
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,960
that broke years ago that nobody's ever going to fix. Yeah.

1874
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,360
To dream the impossible dream. I guess so.

1875
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,040
So the downfall, so because of that,

1876
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,720
so that is him with these lifetime partnerships.

1877
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,400
He is offering something that he can't possibly make good on.

1878
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,280
So he actually I'm almost I love that he actually was punished

1879
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,600
for this type of person.

1880
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,920
I feel like he's never punished very rarely this kind of thing.

1881
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,960
But it's so literal and clear.

1882
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,640
And he got brought down and went to jail for four years.

1883
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,960
And he and Tammy Faye divorced.

1884
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,640
And now he's all about buckets.

1885
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,600
Yeah. Now he's got a different scam.

1886
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,680
He remarried. She helps him sling the buckets.

1887
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,520
You know. Oh, yes.

1888
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,400
A very Tammy Faye esque woman is his wife now. Yeah.

1889
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,000
So he just he cloned her as close as he could get.

1890
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,600
Oh, and I didn't mention that I

1891
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,440
I couldn't find the facts on this too much, but I think a lot of this land

1892
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,840
also rightfully belong to a Native American tribe.

1893
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,400
And they just kind of took it.

1894
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,920
So there's that. Oh, that's a hundred percent likely.

1895
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,200
Yeah. Not even the main headline about this place.

1896
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,640
Stolen from Native Americans.

1897
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,840
A lot going on here.

1898
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,960
And again, this is all a ministry.

1899
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,560
So all of this is tax exempt.

1900
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,760
Like that was the first threat that it's like the government

1901
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,240
might pull the tax exempt status.

1902
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,160
I think they did.

1903
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:25,160
I think maybe in the fall or right before Falwell, they actually in a rare move,

1904
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,200
they actually got busted on that too.

1905
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,280
Yeah, they haven't pulled Scientology yet, but they got the Baker

1906
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,880
establishment and that, you know, don't no fan of Scientology.

1907
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,240
But I think we could agree we'd like to see that theme park.

1908
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:44,400
Well, the IP of Scientology, we seen a move like at least in the abstract,

1909
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,800
like we've seen like that as spaceships and stuff.

1910
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,320
So as a kid, what would appeal to me more is the is the stories of the Bible

1911
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,320
or the Old Testament, like or story of fucking Zinni and spaceships,

1912
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,160
which I know are like public.

1913
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,360
I mean, the movie is I guess the movie is the closest thing

1914
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,560
because like in the literature, they kind of hide some of the alien element,

1915
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,600
right, the alien element.

1916
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,200
I don't know. It comes later.

1917
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,480
It comes later to get a custom to write.

1918
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,200
Yeah. But there is a movie with aliens.

1919
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,920
We know if you're if assuming the old Ron Hubbard books are fair game.

1920
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,480
Yeah. Yes, exactly.

1921
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:24,240
The the quote unquote fictional works, which they don't think are fiction.

1922
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,320
I don't know. I don't know anything of that.

1923
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,160
But yes, alien spaceships.

1924
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,680
Now we're talking as far as again, Scientology.

1925
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,880
We've seen that some of the documentaries, it seems scary,

1926
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,520
but we're willing to do whatever you want, as long as we can pick out

1927
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,480
what little plush Zinni are in the gift shop.

1928
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,440
Well, you want to imagine here your rides podcast.

1929
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:49,720
The ride will sell out to anyone who has a theme has money in a theme park idea.

1930
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:53,320
I'm just really quickly scanning the synopsis of Battlefield Earth

1931
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,640
just to pull a name out.

1932
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,560
I think you could you could have a whole land or at least a big rise

1933
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,320
of the resistance level ride that's called Battlefield Earth.

1934
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,880
Dawn of the Cyclos.

1935
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,600
Oh, yeah, the cyclos. OK.

1936
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:11,320
Sure. Yeah, that's there's a there's a ticket potential for all of this stuff.

1937
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:15,760
And the money, the fact that Dawn of the Cyclos, the billion dollar ride

1938
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,600
could operate without taxation.

1939
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,000
Yes, because the ride is considered a fantastic.

1940
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,120
Imagine if we could get our hands on that.

1941
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,000
Yeah. And then when we have that amount of money to play with,

1942
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,680
like like the suckers at Disney have to pay, you know, still probably not a lot.

1943
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,480
I say they've got some tax exemptions going on to church,

1944
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,120
but they haven't tied up every loophole.

1945
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,200
Yeah. Oh, my God.

1946
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,440
Scientology land in Hemet.

1947
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,160
They got the space for it.

1948
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:46,600
Yeah. Is this some is this the next like I think we've seen a lot

1949
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:51,040
from the early 2000s, the late 90s, reexam of like, oh, this is actually pretty good.

1950
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,880
Oh, this is pretty good.

1951
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,680
Has anyone pulled the take yet?

1952
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,440
Battlefield or Earth movie.

1953
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,200
Travolta. Pretty good.

1954
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,640
He's making some choices.

1955
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:00,760
I haven't seen it yet.

1956
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,400
It's up to bug me now.

1957
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,880
Only one man can bring it back from the dead.

1958
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,680
And that's bug me. Yeah.

1959
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,080
If he makes the call, we'll know it's true.

1960
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,120
Well, we'll blue sky. Well, blue sky.

1961
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,040
Well, look, I will get every religious book that is existing

1962
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:17,320
and I will start blue skying for all the different religions.

1963
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,280
And get the ideas on hand. Yeah.

1964
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,200
Call. Yeah.

1965
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,560
I would advise you not to start making sketches from the Koran.

1966
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,720
They take representation of their.

1967
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,280
They take it a little more seriously than the Christians.

1968
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,480
OK, I hear what you're saying.

1969
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,680
Recreation. One IP is off limits.

1970
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,160
Got it. OK. Yeah.

1971
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:34,760
All right. But.

1972
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,560
Except although I say that, but there was a big kerfuffle

1973
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:42,200
because in AEW recently, there was someone wrapped some barbed wire around

1974
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,120
Adam Cole's head and put him through a table.

1975
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,520
And it did look like a crown.

1976
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,480
And it was good.

1977
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,640
And they were screaming, there's a barbed wire crown

1978
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,800
and put him through a table on Good Friday.

1979
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,640
But it's like, ah, guys, come on.

1980
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:54,760
Yeah.

1981
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:55,840
Huh?

1982
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
It was just because he was going to have first through a table.

1983
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,560
So it would hurt more. Come on.

1984
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,720
Sure. Sure. Yeah.

1985
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,480
Real quick thing is we're winding down the.

1986
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,400
So this property sat just rusting away.

1987
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,680
But they, you know, it is a viable.

1988
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,520
There's some theme park infrastructure.

1989
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,680
So some people have tried to bring it back, I think, a few times,

1990
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,760
even just Radisson as a regular hotel.

1991
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,840
Can we finish that thing? Didn't work out.

1992
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,320
But the biggest attempt was in the early 90s, a guy named Morris

1993
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:28,920
Cerullo, who is also a televangelist and a bigoted piece of shit.

1994
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,280
I mean, that's fraud. Sure.

1995
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:34,640
You can imagine all of that worked oddly with a guy named Bill Lund,

1996
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,680
who was the second husband of Sharon Disney.

1997
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,680
Wow. So Walt's post death

1998
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:46,440
son in law was involved in an early 90s effort to bring Heritage USA back.

1999
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,120
OK. Waypost Baker's involvement.

2000
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,400
And one of the first there's a big article.

2001
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,560
Just try to like drum up support for this.

2002
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,680
And there was the question, well, what about all those people

2003
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,680
who bought the lifetime memberships and paid a thousand dollars?

2004
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,440
Are you going to, you know, make good on that?

2005
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,240
And he said, well, we'll try to reestablish relationships.

2006
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,800
We'll let them know, hey, look, the past is the past you gave to help build this.

2007
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,720
So come back and enjoy it.

2008
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,040
And then they said, so no refunds then.

2009
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,160
And he said, there's nothing we can do except just love them

2010
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,160
and try to nurture them and let them know that they're welcome.

2011
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,880
Oh, boy. So each lifetime membership.

2012
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,280
Yeah. Olders, Morris Cerullo.

2013
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,320
I don't think we've said either the name Heritage USA was also

2014
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,800
a name for one of the attempts to bring back Dogpatch USA.

2015
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,200
Was it? Yeah, that was the David Hare crazy scam.

2016
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:44,200
He just as they stole the name of Main Street USA,

2017
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:48,960
David Hare stole the name of Heritage USA, kind of unreferred to for his

2018
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,760
even less built theme park.

2019
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,480
Yeah, less built.

2020
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:58,080
But I'm sure the thinking was also like, well, if we get people to associate it,

2021
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,400
you know, this thing was very popular for a short period of time.

2022
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,640
Oh, completely. Yeah. Yeah.

2023
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,000
They may you might be confused. Wait, is it that is that coming back?

2024
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,360
Also, because I told you I was looking up, hey, what's up with Holy Land Experience

2025
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,680
and what's up with our encounter now?

2026
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:17,320
I can't believe that there were no results when I Googled David Hare jail.

2027
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,280
I was sure that guy had taken it.

2028
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,600
So I don't know, maybe he escaped.

2029
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,880
Maybe those puppets that he made, maybe he like is hiding in one.

2030
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:32,920
He's like posing as an animatronic somewhere, maybe in the Precious Moments.

2031
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:38,680
I think all I think about is the video down in Dogpatch, which is his box.

2032
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,480
First of all, the song is good.

2033
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:45,000
Yeah. And the second I just picture him driving that car himself around America

2034
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,280
and he's having a great time.

2035
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,200
Trying to suss out people's interests. Yeah.

2036
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,320
Like, hey, do you need a theme park built? Yeah.

2037
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,120
Do you need a pack of original IP? Sure.

2038
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,320
Which as we've established, we would answer the call. David. Yes.

2039
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:05,800
Loppy call us to Burbank and we'll happily climb in

2040
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,040
and try to start Dogpatch.

2041
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:12,000
Well, let's see. Then we'll go straight to the Church of Scientology,

2042
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,600
get an immediate billion dollar grant, drive to Hemet and start building.

2043
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,880
The king and then they'll be like, we'll be like the kings of of religious theme

2044
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,160
parks will be unlike winning Theo Awards.

2045
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,680
Like the three of us will kind of be posed like back to back.

2046
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:31,480
Like we're the gurus that can bring your religion into the theme park world.

2047
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,840
And it'll be a whole new income source for us.

2048
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,280
I mean, I think that it seems like it's a it's a move that you can make

2049
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,880
if you've failed in other avenues. Yes.

2050
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:45,960
And I look, I don't want to call us failures, but I will.

2051
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,880
Universal. Yeah.

2052
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,160
Look, we just haven't gotten a lot of bites. No bites.

2053
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,800
So this is what we got to do.

2054
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,960
If this is no, I shouldn't phrase it like that.

2055
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:57,680
Like we what we need to do is transcend those.

2056
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,120
Yeah. Lawed companies. Right.

2057
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:05,000
And work for in pursuit of something greater. Exactly. Yes.

2058
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,720
So so so we're open for business.

2059
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:11,040
Yeah. And that's why we are officially now.

2060
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,680
All right. You you survived.

2061
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,520
Praise the ride. Right.

2062
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,840
I think there was no accident.

2063
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,280
We had that phrase at the beginning. No accident.

2064
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,840
We are now very religious.

2065
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,920
What religion? It doesn't matter.

2066
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,840
Whichever one you bring to us ever land on.

2067
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,600
Yeah, but we are very religious, a very religious show.

2068
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,720
Now it's just the storyboards.

2069
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,760
It's it's literally just we took screen

2070
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,880
grads from the by the world of Coke where everyone's holding hands.

2071
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,760
Like it's just a big shot like that.

2072
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,600
Isn't that enough?

2073
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,600
We're what that image? That's what we are.

2074
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,720
That's what we're pitching you to scam.

2075
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,760
I mean, to help you.

2076
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,080
That's a good like I feel like Michael Jackson, I think,

2077
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,000
talked about wanting to adopt a child from every nation in the world.

2078
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,040
That's what we should say, that there'll be a day, a year where a child

2079
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,400
from each nation in the world comes and they they come for free.

2080
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,880
But the only caveat they have to hold hands for three straight hours.

2081
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,040
It's it's obviously also he thought of that

2082
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,920
because he went on Small World too many times.

2083
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,040
That's definitely where he got the idea.

2084
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,800
I know be better because it'll be real. Right.

2085
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,600
Yes. I think that's I'm assuming at some point he expressed the desire

2086
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,200
to make all the Disney world and Disneyland rights real.

2087
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,040
I want to have a pirate from every

2088
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,200
pirates of all shapes.

2089
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:35,440
We'll invite the pirates here to Neverland and we'll make we'll make them good

2090
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,240
with the power of music. They'll become nice pirates.

2091
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,960
They'll make peace with the townsfolk. Yes.

2092
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:46,480
And hold hands all day, every day will be lowered and used solely for sweeping.

2093
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:53,200
OK, so for more about

2105

2106

That's right. We need a bigger paint pot.
