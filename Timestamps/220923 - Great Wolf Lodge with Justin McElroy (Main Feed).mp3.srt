1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Rise and shine, Wolf Pack!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today's activities include

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a vaguely threatening song from a robotic owl,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
a hike down the trail of dark money that funds oat milk,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and a refreshing swim with a fake child corpse.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Justin McElroy takes us to parent maddening waterpark

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and hotel chain Great Wolf Lodge on podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Music

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to podcast The Ride,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a podcast about theme parks hosted by three guys who love nature.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The roof, the slides, and especially the chlorine stench.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by fellow nature lover Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I prefer to consume my nature via skylight.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's nice, you get just a little bit,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but there's a little bit of barrier instead of that raw nature

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that might fuck you up, give you a heat stroke or something.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mike Carlson, hi.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hi, yes, I love nature.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Have I told a story on the podcast before

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
about getting chased out of Joshua Tree by goats?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I tried to go into nature, and 30 goats surrounded me,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and then my friend and I drove away from there

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to a different part of the park,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and then we went up a hill and it said,

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
watch out for the thirsty bees.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thirsty?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bees are so dehydrated that they will just go into your car

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
because they sense there's water in there.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So it was like, beware of the thirsty bees.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I was just getting, nature was just telling me,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
it doesn't want me, it does not want me out here today.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go back to your artificial nature,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and I have gone back to it ever since.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, well, a couple things.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not thirsty as in horny.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, the bees are not horny.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They weren't pumped by a bug,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they weren't so flower depraved.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, I don't think they were horny,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but I think they were of a normal level of hornyness for bees.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They were thirsty as in literally dehydrated,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
they had no water.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, yeah, you didn't have the chance to get attacked,

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in which case it might have been like,

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we're getting stung, no, wait, it's something else.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The bees weren't waiting for me

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
at the end of the bar or anything.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There was nothing like that,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
like in an old cartoon or something,

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
like Bugs Bunny's dress.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They all had eyelashes all the time.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How does bees have eyelashes?

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You could hear the sound of their eyelashes bat,

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
there was like a thousand of them,

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and they could all in unison were batting

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
their bee eyelashes at me at once.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That did not happen, that's not what happened.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, well lesson learned on your part.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Again, we're talking about real nature,

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and the kind of real nature that you can find

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
at a chain called Great Wolf Lodge.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is a chain of indoor water parks slash hotels,

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
slash there's arcades and restaurants.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There are many theme parks, or what they are,

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and this topic comes to us courtesy of somebody

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
who has been, because I don't think the three of us

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
have been, correct?

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've only walked around a lobby.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I think I would get hit with a sap immediately

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
if I walked in.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hit with a sap?

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like a sap or a nightstick or something,

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and it's like, oh that weirdo's here alone.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That weirdo's here with another adult weirdo and no one else.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's pretty specifically family oriented.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think our guest went with his family,

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but who knows, it might have been a solo expedition.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We will find out all the details,

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and he just so happens to be a prolific podcaster

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
from My Brother, My Brother and Me, Adventure Zone,

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and Saw Bones, it's Justin McElroy.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hello, welcome back.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hi, what a pleasure.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello, hello, hello, thanks for having me.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, absolutely.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was a pleasure to talk about Great Wolf Lodge.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you for bringing this to the table.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's one of those that I've sensed people are excited about.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think a lot of people on our social media are excited to talk about it.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They've been wanting us to talk about it, but what do we know?

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Again, I walked around a lobby for 20 minutes.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll bring some of that to the table, but you've put in the work.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You've really done it, and I'm already excited by just the observations that were DM'd.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So tell us more.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I spent a lot of human hours at the Great Wolf Lodge.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A lot of time at Great Wolf Lodge.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wow, wow, multiple trips or one?

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, multiple trips, yeah.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, a little context is probably helpful here.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The Great Wolf Lodge that we started going to was right next to Kings Island in Cincinnati.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, yes, it's almost right by the border in the parking lot, it seems like.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It is, I mean, you can walk.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not uncommon to have people walk over there from the park.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There's a walking path.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a hall.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But there is a walking path from Great Wolf Lodge to Kings Island.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So the two work in terrible synchronicity, right?

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So you can't take your kids to a hotel, even if it is a water park-themed hotel,

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and see coasters in the background and be like, don't look at that.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're not going there.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't look.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
At the same time, we go to Kings Island and look right next door.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the Great Wolf Lodge.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, certainly you got to stay at Great Wolf Lodge if you're going.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There used to be a hotel across the street from there called Coasters was the restaurant,

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it was the Kings Island Resort.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was seen in the Brady Bunch episode.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is the hotel in the Brady Bunch episode?

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is that where they stay?

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, they stay in the Kings Island hotel.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's all leveled now.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So your options are like stay at a chain nearby or go to Great Wolf Lodge next door to Kings Island,

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
part of the Cedar Fair family.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right, right.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We talked about that.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That park's great.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's a trip you've done a couple of times is the in tandem.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And you grew up with Kings Island, is that correct?

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
For sure, yeah.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like where I live in Huntington, West Virginia, we have...

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we do have a theme park.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's called Camden Park.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And that would be even more specific than Great Wolf Lodge is like no one's been to Camden Park.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if you look up videos some day, it's a real classic.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's a lot of...

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There's an extremely old roller coaster called the Big Dipper that there's a really, really unnerving log flume.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's a haunted house that is like something from another dimension.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The whole place is wild.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is it unnerving because of like anything spooky or unsettling along the way or is it just...

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The gum wall is a big part of the unnerving part.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's like some 60s gum.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There's like beach nut in there.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like I don't fool around with the gum wall at the haunted house.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But that place is a trip.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But if you want to go to an actual theme park that is more than like an hour of dodging hepatitis,

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
like you go to Kings Island, which is slightly less hepatitis infused than Camden Park is.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But yeah, we went to Kings Island.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like that was the...

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Like if you're in band or choir or whatever, like that was the trip that you took.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, sure, sure.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
At the end of the year.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So I spent a lot of time there.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Preferred it when it was owned by Paramount.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's a lot of theming.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The Murphmobile was there for a while from Wayne's World, which is a big deal for me.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, that's great.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I remember all the like...

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There was a Top Gun thing.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There was Days of Thunder.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There was Italian Job when I got to go and then they had to strip it all.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Drop Zone.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That beloved Paramount property, Drop Zone.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Was that...

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is that a movie?

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, it was Wesley Snipes about falling out of planes, I think.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But they rethemed all those and stripped out all the movie theming.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So like Top Gun becomes like Hang Pilot.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know the new names.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ever since they closed the vortex over there on Harbor.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Exciting plane.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thrilling.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Fast train.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thrilling undercarriage.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But Great Wolf Lodge is relatively newer in that area, right?

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So that wasn't there when I was a kid.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That was like...

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It predates my kids though.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think it's been there about 12 years.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That particular location.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The chain is from the mid to late 90s.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I think it started in the Wisconsin Dells, if you guys have ever been in that neck of the woods.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mike has, right?

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have, yeah.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A few times.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So there's 20 of them now.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
20 Great Wolf Lodges.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, so here's the pitch.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It is a massive, massive resort.

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And the, I mean, huge.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Really, really big.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And then connected to Evergreen Wolf Lodge, like in the center of Evergreen Wolf Lodge, is an indoor water park.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like Wave Pool, Lazy River, a bunch of different slides, raft rides.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You know, some other like obstacle courses and things like that.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You got that big, the bucket that slowly fills up and then pours down the roof.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That classic.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Bucket.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The classic, there's this giant bucket that just dumps at whenever it feels like it.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So if you want to try to get through the park to someplace else, you're not going to stay dry because it just dumps a huge bucket of water on you.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Just keep your eyes on the bucket.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's a restaurant.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's a restaurant in there called Buckets, which is a delight.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The restaurant is generous.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's a place where you can stand in a lot short list for 20 minutes and get some hummus or chicken tenders out of the deal.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now I want to, Buckets is correct, but I want to give credit to the full name, Buckets Incredible Cravables.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Make sure we get that jargon out.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, Buckets Incredible Cravables.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's good.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can conceptualize it.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have not been to one of these kinds of things, but I think it's like a sandals for kids.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know what I mean?

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Like an all-inclusive, like kids show up.

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You don't have to leave.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So that's like the main thing.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you're in the room, then if you're staying in a room there, you get a band for the water park.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You get to go to the water park, which is like Great Wolf Lodge was the place when COVID really got started, where it's like, we'll know COVID is over when Great Wolf Lodge opens.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because if you can imagine a worse environment for like spreading disease, then just like we maintain it to make it the most comfortable for all bacteria and viruses.

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And all of the like, the sense that I get of it and from my brief walk around and watching videos, they're like, they just feel like a bit of claustrophobia.

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the water park, which is a breeding ground.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But then all the hallways where you go on these adventures and stuff, which we'll talk about, but like those are all just hotel hallway.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is not some, it's not Grand Californian sized, like expansive lobbies.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And it kind of is just like a Radisson that has some like fake nature in it.

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's nature.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's a, there is a, gosh, it's what order to talk about these?

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So there's the water park.

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's the rooms.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They have, there's a arcade, huge arcade that is open 24 hours a day.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So if your kids wake up at 6 a.m., you can go down like, come on, let mom sleep.

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll go down and play the minions.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
VR, right.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Fine.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I've spent a lot of mornings like, there's a Duncan inside where you can get just, if you like your, if you like your hash brown soapy, there's no better option than Duncan.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Duncan, they're nuts.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's also like a big, they have a big buffet kind of thing.

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And then there's like the, they call it, which is why there's an upscale, upscale.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's an adult sit down dining place that they puzzlingly called the Lodge.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's like, well, it's just, it feels like the sequel to Great Wolf Lodge and it's your restaurant.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Very difficult to Google just that restaurant.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Great Wolf Lodge, the Lodge.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The Lodge.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The Lodge.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was like, the Lodge is like the high end, like the hip way.

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Like we're just going to the Lodge.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The Lodge.

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's like the high end, the high end version or whatever.

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They've got a lot of, there's crafts and all kinds of activities for kids.

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They got yoga, if you want yoga.

254
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The weirder stuff is like, they have this thing called Magic Quest, which started as like a comparable to like a laser tag or like Q-Zar where you would like go there to do Magic Quest.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And Magic Quest is you have a toy wand.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And of course they're like all very customizable with lots of flair you can, you can buy for them.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But you have these wands and they have IR receivers in the tip.

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And when you point them at things in this game, you can do like quests and collect gold and interact with things in the hotel.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's things in the hotel where if you flick your wand at them, like the bear will talk to you or the, you know, the knight in armor will like light up or something like that.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So there, but there's also like you go to these trees that have TV screens on them and you see a man who like, he's so old.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He's like playing a wizard giving you quests.

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And it's a video of this dude.

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it's like, he's so old and the stuff there is so old, like you're just faced with this certainty that this man is dead.

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like you look at it, you know, like without any doubt, like there's no way this man is still alive.

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's no way. And he's going to request from the on the grave to like go get the lightning rune or whatever.

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then you have to find other community theater actors pretending to be princesses or fairies that will give you other quests.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And like you collect the runes and you collect gold.

268
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There's a channel on the TV that tells you who's got the most gold and class.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Wow.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How exciting for the kids to make it to the TV.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, it's thrilling.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Except for there is a certain class of kid that you run into a Great Wolf Lodge that you're pretty sure isn't staying there, but is on his grind.

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like usually capes are involved.

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you see a kid with like every time I go, there's at least one kid with like a cape and a wand holster who you can tell is like mom dropped off at 10 a.m.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She's like, I'll be back at three.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You knew this kid, you do it too.

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And those are all.

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So that's weird because it goes through the whole hotel.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So if you're walking like from your room to the lobby, like you're walking through some kids like adventure playgrounds,

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
playgrounds, like these little dorks running around careening into you, no awareness of where you are because they've got like a red gym to get to before the time runs out or whatever.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So that's playing out around you.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which that like so that is mixing with like the family hauling in the suitcases and like, come on, let's go.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We got to get to the desk.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, don't stop there.

285
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And then some kid might like crash into you and poke your kid with a wand.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, I saw a video of like tips and tricks.

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
For magic, magic quest.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I also heard it called Magi Quest.

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I think it might be.

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, the spelling seems like but then there are Magi involved.

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Right. Yeah.

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Magi are a part of it.

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But but some of the tips and tricks are like, take the stairs.

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There's hidden stuff in the stairway, but there's also like fire escape warnings in the stairway.

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Like it's a regular stairway.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Not those stairway.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And like I saw they were recording this video and a guy is just walking behind them shirtless because he's just like, look, I'm just trying to get back to my room and get some stuff.

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But then the other detail was like you go through the whole resort.

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
However, it's it's by the elevators.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The stuff on all the floors is by the elevators.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you hit guest rooms, you have gone too far.

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Stop walking through guest rooms.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Right.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And there's they're on miserably cruelly.

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They're on different floors, the different things you have to do.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So you are like up and down stairs, like trying to get to the different quest objectives.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So that's a very wild.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The the weirder thing about it is all the magic quests or magic quest, if you like, that were outside of Great Wolf Lodge have been shuttered.

309
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So this these used to be standalone things.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They don't exist anymore.

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The company itself that ran magic quest was like subsumed into the Great Wolf Lodge Corporation.

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So this technology, no one seems to know how to fix it or maintain it is in no way maintain or fix.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I think that's like institutional knowledge that no one has anymore.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Like once the treasure chest stops opening, no one seems to know that guy's gone.

315
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That guy's long gone.

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know, he's working for another partner.

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We don't have to fix anything.

318
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There was one guy who knew how to do it.

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Right. The one guy built is like, well, as long as this keeps working forever, should be fine.

320
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He got fired.

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The magi in the sky have decided that the chest will never open again.

322
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Your work here is done.

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They there's an adult.

324
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There's like a more not adult, but there's like a more grown up version of magic quest called Compass Quest where you get imagine the thrill of casting spells with your wand.

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Now imagine instead of a wand, you have an incredible compass that you can put into divots if you want.

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Boy, the thrill, the sheer joy in your child's eye when they take a toy compass and put it into a compass shaped divot.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Boy, let me tell you, it is a wild and wooly experience.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I have a feeling Jason was into compass as a kid.

329
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I could be wrong.

330
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I liked fiddling with my boy scout compass and I never fiddling with my compass.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, never used it well and fiddled with his compass.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I just I like turning it and like trying to get it to find north.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But then when they're like, all right, we'll align the compass and now find your bear egg and now right.

334
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Figure out where in the sky.

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I'm like, no, this is no, we're not.

336
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not doing school to already have to go to school.

337
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's the weekend.

338
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's the weekend.

339
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's why friends who would go to Catechism would go to CCD.

340
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I was like, you have to go to school after school like school to you would have liked it better if you were putting it into things and magic like thing.

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Quests were unlocked.

342
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Anyway, sorry.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There's no please.

346
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There's a a show, an animatronic show that plays twice a night at the same time.

347
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So in the lobby, there's like this big it's like it looks like a tree and the tree has a face and then there's different forest animals and a kid in the log.

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And they just look at you with these like dead lifeless eyes for 22 hours and 30 minutes out of every day.

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And then for a brief 15 minute window, they are brought to life to to delight parents at literal like the loudest of ear splitting, ear splitting volumes.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What makes it what makes it worse is the show is maybe 10 feet from the check in desk where the employees are.

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Where the employees all are.

352
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So imagine twice a night.

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And you are you have to sit five feet from this ear splitting.

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Actually, I downloaded the set the song for you all.

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, yeah.

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The show out just so I could play a little snippet of it.

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think we aren't getting I can't hear it.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
One sec.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Sure.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think I have the video maybe too.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you if you haven't.

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think I might have it here.

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wait here.

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, you can tell us if it's the right thing.

367
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Jordan, can we pull up a video?

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I think we might have a video here.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Here, let's pause it.

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We might let's keep we might want to keep going.

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But just at this juncture, who's like you got to really squint to see that it is the owl.

372
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The motion is not like a ton.

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Right.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And context clues are telling you he sounds like an owl.

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think when he sings, he's got an owl vibe for sure.

376
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

377
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
How is singing voice?

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But this is the one you were talking about.

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
This is every night twice.

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like there's one at seven and one day and the kids just sit down outside and they watch this great show and the staff is just subjected to it over and over and over again.

381
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There's other weirder.

382
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There's a place called Scoops, which is like is I think Scoops is the.

383
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a kid's spa.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I had a picture from when I walked around.

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Thank you.

386
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's an ice cream store, too, which isn't called Scoops, which is not Scoops.

387
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why would it be Scoops?

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's Scoops is where you get like fake nail polish on.

389
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Right.

390
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If you're a little girl.

391
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's I found something that was like paint the nails of this raccoon character and then print them out.

392
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And you can get your nails painted and the hook is like everything's edible.

393
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So if your kid wants to just like drink the nail polish.

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, that's great.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They're going to be options there.

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
All they've eaten for days is like buckets and edible nail polish.

397
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I saw there were the brunch buffet had a big cupcake display at the end.

398
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So it's like, yeah, all my kid is eating is honeydew melon and blue cupcakes and edible nail polish and going in the water.

399
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There are there's also a huge candy shop.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Don't forget the massive candy store and your kids.

401
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
When you when you book your room, you get for your kids what's called a paw pass.

402
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And it's like a this really does bump it into like Sandals territory because then it's like you get the best paw pass.

403
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then you get like the cup full of bulk candy and you get ears and you get maybe like goggles, stuff like that.

404
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Or you can play a free game of laser tag or a free game of light up goofy golf.

405
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's there. I didn't mention that there's golf.

406
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There's bowling alley.

407
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But but that's all packed in right, which becomes a checklist where you as a parent now, even if you didn't want to do all these things.

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I mean, you've already paid for them.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So you are going to have to go, you know, play bowl and golf and all those other great activities, which are sort of like jammed into.

410
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I found a picture I took of the bowling alley.

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Ten paws, I believe.

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Ten paws. Yes.

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Bowling and it like that's small.

414
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's like in a corner.

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I mean, I couldn't believe how much was packed into was where does the Anaheim one or the Garden Grove one, if you will.

416
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I just remember thinking like, boy, everything is like it's all in corners and there seems to be this game and that's all in hallways.

417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it just all felt like there's five restaurants somehow in that.

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And yet the Garden Grove one, the biggest one in the in the entire chain.

419
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And yet it felt like claustrophobic to me.

420
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah, they're very, they're very packed.

421
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, that kind of goes to what I think is like so awesome about the Great Wolf Lodge experience.

422
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And I am using that somewhat sarcastically because as much as there is for kids to do, it is openly hostile to parents in a way, in a way where no concessions have been made for your existence.

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Like no concessions.

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
There used to be something called the wind down, W-I-N-E, wind down.

425
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And what you do is when you check in, you order a wind down.

426
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And that is literally at nine p.m. or whatever.

427
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You set the time.

428
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But after your kids are in bed, someone shows up and knocks very quietly on your door and says, here's an entire bottle and some truffles.

429
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There you go. Enjoy.

430
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We make you make you wait until after your kids have anything approximating pleasure.

431
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Enjoy the cupcake Chardonnay you could have picked up at Target next door.

432
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Less money.

433
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I was Googling prices at Total Wine.

434
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Drastically less than the wind down.

435
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But maybe you get your chocolate covered strawberries, which I'm sure are absolutely.

436
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, yeah.

437
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
There's at least four of them.

438
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And each one more delicious than the last.

439
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That service has been discontinued.

440
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Once you're in the room, you are in the room.

441
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There is nothing for you.

442
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like you what you're you are there once your kids are asleep.

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You are not leaving this room.

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You are stuck there.

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I've started to get into this regard not in Great Wolf Lot.

446
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Now I've done a couple of Disney trips with my now two year old.

447
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And we essentially invented the wind down program for ourselves without realizing this was established.

448
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But you bring the bottle.

449
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We've actually had a lot of fun in the realm of like, OK, let's check if the baby monitor works at the downstairs bar.

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No, it stops working as soon as we get down the elevator shaft.

451
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I guess we're in the room tonight.

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sharp tank it is.

453
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Next to the bed.

454
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, we tried.

455
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But we've had, you know, eight.

456
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Our independent wind downs have been actually very nice, I would say.

457
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But these what my question in reading the wind down section of the Web site, here's OK, one there's different packages and one is called rekindle the bonfire.

458
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And I'm a little uncomfortable with the oh, and then they call it a romantic package.

459
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I'm just going to take a stab here based on what we've talked about so far.

460
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's I can't imagine that Great Wolf Lodge is a great place for romance.

461
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, parental romance.

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You've come to the right man to ask about romance and great little flaw.

463
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Let me tell you, there is nothing you feel like less.

464
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There is nothing, especially if you spent the day at Kings Island.

465
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Right. You come back drenched, drenched in sweat.

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Your kids, your rotten children make you go to the water park.

467
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
After all that, you fill up on a bunch of cotton candy and and the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Unthinkable, unthinkable.

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This pizza, you cannot imagine how bad the pizza great lodges.

470
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It seems like a joke. It seems like they're they're they're running a scam on you.

471
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They can't even get like La Rosa's pizza, like a local Cincinnati pizza.

472
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
No, it's it's absolutely the worst.

473
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And there is the in terms of like if you want alcohol, the wind down is gone.

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Right. But they do know that you are basically trapped there.

475
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And so you can't buy cans of white cloth for seven dollars.

476
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's like Vegas.

477
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's it's it's just so antagonistic that like you can't order things.

478
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
There's not like adult movie, not adult movies, but you know, like, you know, RPG 13 movies.

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes. Right. Anything above that.

480
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It is there is like the restaurant, the lodge is wildly unpredictable.

481
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's the food quality is always like about a hard sea.

482
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's like a good solid sea.

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The one I went to one in Charlotte on our way back from a beach trip where we had to stop like halfway

484
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and as a treat to the kids and a punishment to ourselves for being so relaxed at the beach,

485
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we stopped a great with Lodge and Way Home and the rest of the lodge there is overlooking the the water park.

486
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So imagine the one thing that is ostensibly an adult experience at this place

487
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and your kids are watching other kids have fun through the glass.

488
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like how is your dinner going when your kids are like, Mom, let's go, let's go.

489
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Look, they're having fun. We're missing it.

490
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why are we sitting here?

491
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Just isn't anything.

492
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Son, listen, those are subpar at best.

493
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I love you.

494
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I just want to finish this bad burger with a fried egg on it.

495
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's the only thing I have had to look forward to all day.

496
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm just pretending I want to just pretend I'm somewhere else for a second.

497
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's like the what I weirdly kind of enjoy about it, though, aside from they have the arcade machines

498
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
where you run into these, where you are putting coins in the slot and you get trading cards out of them.

499
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And if you get a full set of the trading cards, then you can trade them in for like a bajillion tickets.

500
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Right. So there's a SpongeBob game, whereas you're pumping quarters in.

501
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It will make like these different character cards fall down the slot.

502
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And if you get all nine of them, the treatment for like five thousand tickets, which can't find a Gary.

503
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That's how they get you.

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Very it's like you're walking.

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah, you're walking.

506
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
McDonald's game.

507
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's like the McDonald game with the one that you can't find.

508
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Exactly. So every time you walk past the machine, it's like, let me just duck in and see if I got a Gary out real quick.

509
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No, you know, Gary. OK, moving on.

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Those are those are fun.

511
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But what I actually like about it is like I feel no.

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You know, when I'm at I I love Disney a lot.

513
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm wearing a Disney shirt as as we speak.

514
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm a huge fan, Disney. But when I'm at Disney, there's this sense of like, if I just do the right things and like plan enough

515
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and read enough and watch enough Disney videos and stuff, then I can really maximize this trip and really get something that the whole family is going to love.

516
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And with Great Wolf Lodge, you just got to get through it.

517
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And the lack of pressure there, I really love like, I don't know.

518
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't care what we do. I'm just alive for 24 hours.

519
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then I'll leave and it'll be over. It's not miserable.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's nothing for me here. This isn't for me.

521
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And they seem to like really cultivate that experience of like there's no FOMO here.

522
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There's nothing you'd like adults. Trust us.

523
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
If you're a Disney you're like, can I maneuver this to where I get a break from the kids and I get to go do Tower of Terror?

524
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And that's exciting. Or if we plan it right, there's actually a really good restaurant in our hotel and the wine is nice and the food is like, but if you take all that off the table,

525
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Disney is like, Disney Disney World, especially it's like a monster that you have to like slay.

526
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You have to plan for it. You have to kill it.

527
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And the Great Wolf Lodge is like monster. Do what you want to me.

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Just take me. Yeah, you win.

529
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I surrender myself to the Babadook.

530
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
To answer your romance question. Oh, yeah.

531
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You should actually take a look at some of the themed rooms because the suites at Great Wolf Lodge, you can put your kids in.

532
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You guys cuss on this show? Yeah.

533
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, I know that.

534
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You can put your kids in fucking Albuquerque.

535
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
There's like a bunk bed room where they are sequestered off in their own themed bunk beds.

536
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know if they lock from the outside, but I assume.

537
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I got to say, though, I watched a walkthrough of a two story fireplace suite and I was looking at it and yeah, the bunk bedroom had a door.

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But then there was a lot where like there was just a bed next to the living room and like a lofted bed area with no door.

539
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And I'm like, so if you're bringing like extended family, if you're bringing a group here, everyone better be on good terms.

540
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because there is not enough walls in this suite.

541
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
No, there's not. And also it adds this.

542
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It adds a real element of thrills when you're in a two story room with a three year old who could at any moment just just plummet right off the top.

543
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You have to track them all of a sudden.

544
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Now, thank you. Great Wolf Lodge.

545
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And I have to monitor my child every second that we are in this room so they do not plummet to their doom.

546
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But they yeah, the rooms are great.

547
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's like themed like bunk beds where it looks like a jungle or cave or what have you.

548
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But the rooms can get big enough so you can put your kids way away.

549
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The one blessing is you don't have to think about your kids while they're asleep.

550
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You can you can store them for your convenience.

551
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like it's like a Victorian orphan in a shelf.

552
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Like you just store and put away.

553
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Don't worry about it.

554
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There you can seems like there's some rooms where there are characters looking at you while you sleep.

555
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That because that's something we haven't talked about yet is the characters.

556
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The original characters who I think they do a good job making it seem like they're something even though they are just at this.

557
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I don't know if I'm comfortable enough to like want to sleep with them like staring and playing an acoustic guitar.

558
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
While I'm sleeping.

559
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But that's what I'm looking at.

560
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The family of the wolf the wolf pack as it's known at this great wolf lodge is it's weird because it's like it's also another thing that relieves the pressure.

561
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Right. If my kids see Cinderella at out in Disney World I know that I'm going to be stopping in a line for 45 minutes.

562
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
If my kids see Wiley the wolf sister Violet they're like please I have no fucking guilt whatsoever about being like absolutely not.

563
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
This I.B. is utterly contextual.

564
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You step out that door it means nothing.

565
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Like what kid is going to care that you got a picture with a hotel mascot.

566
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Like it's ridiculous.

567
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
These are stars in a bubble.

568
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The bubble bursts.

569
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
They are no longer stars.

570
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Not unlike being a podcast.

571
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We're all Wiley the wolf.

572
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The famous utterly utterly exclusive to the to the premises.

573
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The Great Wolf Lodge cinematic universe micro celebrities.

574
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I did.

575
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Nothing made me more feel more old than someone's.

576
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There was a YouTube video called the evolution of the Great Wolf Lodge characters and it started off with the the characters.

577
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And it started off with the guy who made it going like well Great Wolf Lodge part of all of our childhoods and I'm like what.

578
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
What.

579
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No.

580
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
No.

581
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh.

582
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This is mid two thousands.

583
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's that's that's crazy.

584
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
No one is a child from no one was a child then.

585
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I know I messed up your video trying to show you Wiley Wiley the wolf.

586
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
This is the original.

587
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You know what I'll do it.

588
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What I'll do is I'll drop a link to this in the chat.

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So somebody who can can pull this up in a tasteful way.

590
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh sure.

591
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yes.

592
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Jordan you see it privately.

593
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Jordan cats are the original.

594
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That is the original actual design of Wiley the club club when they were in the club club Wiley.

595
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
They've done it.

596
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah they've done like a Chuck E.

597
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Cheese on him though where he used to look cooler and now he's been like kid.

598
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

599
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah he used to be a lot more like a wolf.

600
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You know a cool.

601
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yeah he had a real cool mean.

602
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Cool mean dead eyed and weird.

603
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Is that your definition of cool Mike.

604
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah.

605
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In this instance it is.

606
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They have these there's a channel there where they just play this storybook about the founding of Great Wolf Lodge and it's about like Wiley and these two brothers tooth and nail that are like.

607
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Oh here we go.

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh my God.

609
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Wait what is this weird clip art.

610
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's the original Wiley the wolf from the Great Wolf Lodge website like the first time that people were exposed to this guy.

611
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is what they saw this nightmarish new ground.

612
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Her.

613
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is a.

614
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This is unsettling.

615
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He's waiting to be claimed by the right wing.

616
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But they're walking around and it's like I mean kids love them in the sense that like they the kids that love costume characters will be into it but it's not like.

617
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They're not characters outside of the of the resort and there's plenty of like merchandise and and everything celebrating these these great characters but.

618
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There are so many characters on this Wikipedia.

619
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah yeah there's Wiley's got a rich a rich anybody jumping out of your mind that no one cares about.

620
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Oh yeah.

621
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Princess Pumpkin.

622
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh yeah.

623
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
She was a lady in the leaves a lady in the leaves the air in cloud crest.

624
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What.

625
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah the lady in the leaves is a magic quest character right.

626
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That you interact with to get like your your.

627
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:55,000
They have a lot of Magi or magic quest characters in this Wikipedia like a Beraxas or Sherlock the red dragon.

628
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh Sherlock is fun that's an actual like there's a big screen TV with that's showing this dragon and you have to go in and fight him with your with your wand by casting.

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Increasingly I did learn I did learn that how to beat the red dragon.

630
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I did not watch the video to watch how to beat the silver dragon.

631
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Real quick.

632
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Let me show you this.

633
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You got to use the.

634
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I think Scott you're going to be very interested in this and I don't know how this is going to make you feel I don't know if you've seen this already.

635
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Hold on let me just make sure I pull this up so.

636
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It is a bear named Sprinkles.

637
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh I think I've got this yes.

638
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is a bear.

639
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A little familiar.

640
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah I think actually are someone in our Facebook group noted this because just in context I'm really into the bear who only lives in the Rocky Mountain chocolate factory chain of candy stores.

641
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:02,000
His name is truffles and he's very obese and sad and my wife and I always feel like comforting him and I yeah there's sort of a truffles esque sprinkle.

642
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You said yeah sprinkles.

643
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Sprinkles is he's too happy look problem is I don't want to cheer him up he's fine he doesn't need a hug.

644
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He got a huge PPP loan sprinkles is sad like sprinkles never stop working but he got a little cushion just in case you know.

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah so he but he is I wonder what came first I wonder if they ripped off.

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Oh I guarantee truffles came first that that chain's been part of our culture since maybe the 80s I don't know our heritage our heritage.

647
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

648
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Heritage.

649
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So yeah the the it's just the experience the way it really sets itself apart from from Disney and other like parks like this.

650
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
There's a lot of hotels that have water parks right in them.

651
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:12,000
They are the displeasure that they cause adults that the there is no way to spend your way out of it like the one thing you know about me is that.

652
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I do have some money because I got this room can I please get I an adult give you some money to make this pleasant anyway and they like they look down at you and they say we know you would give us money to make this better.

653
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We're not going to allow you it would sully whatever this bizarre social experience experiment that we're running is you cannot pay to improve this experience that you can't pay to like you if it was Disney you would be paying to.

654
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Exclusive genie parking spaces that you don't have to haul your bags through a half mile hallway to get to your room.

655
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They would you know they would charge you for like you know we'll put food and drinks in your know you can't do any of that you are making your there's is very regular to see families walk through the halls with coolers because they're just that unwilling to participate in the the Great Wolf Lodge.

656
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Justin because you mentioned hostile amenities I have to have to mention a thing I noticed in one of the video walk people have put up tours of the various lodges and in the one video I saw by like the parking lot by like a side door into the parking lot there are all these carts and I was like that cart looks very familiar what is that and I realized it's the cart that's in the great wolf lodge.

657
00:41:34,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So it's like the cart you pay five bucks for at the airport to throw your luggage on if you like have a full family's worth of luggage and you have to push it out to a rental car and I'm like at least at Disney they have standard bellhop carts and they have bag services people that will like take care of this for like you're like okay at least I don't have to do this is much more clearly set up of like all right take that.

658
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Cart to your car load up your luggage and yeah walk the half mile through hallways and side doors up to your room little little wizards.

659
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Little wizards.

660
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Quests getting in your way.

661
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Don't nail the little wizard with your away luggage sliding off the cart.

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The first thing you have to do is go have your wristband scanned what you use wristbands everywhere so oh did I mention you're spending the entire time with this plastic wristband that they like a fixed to your wrist that you cannot remove at all because it's what you use to get to the water parks so it has to say there's you sleep in it you have to like you cannot remove this thing.

663
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah because you can't you can't take it off because they don't want you handing your things so somebody else can go to the water park and your stead right when you get to the water park you have to scan your badge and they are your your band and they ask you how many towels you want and you tell them the number of towels you check out the towels for a period of time and if you don't return your wet sopping towels to them like before you leave they charge you for something else.

664
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And let me tell you guys luxury you got it yeah there we go the high thread count on these beautiful towels you're going to want to take some of so they had to curtail the theft of these these horrific glorified watch cloths but he has the best you can't take the towels out of the water park but you're really going to want to take some of these towels.

665
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So they had to curtail the theft of these these horrific glorified watch cloths but he has the best you can't take the towels out of the water park but your room is not in the water park so they have committed you to sloshing them always shirtless and embarrassed and so you're like your teeth chattering you can't even bring your towel back to your room with you and return it there.

666
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Well children run around with capes they have extra clothes they have more clothes than you usually have and you have less right.

667
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah I feel like everyone I feel like this is a humid vacation this is a clammy like as soon as you walk into the vacay the building your clammy you know.

668
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah it is a very sweaty environment.

669
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's sort of it seems like a big idea of this chain is this is a place where you can go have active water park fun even when the weather is very yes that's a lot of why they've put them in a lot of the places because what are some of the it's like there's the Poconos we're talking about.

670
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah.

671
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That gets stormy I would imagine.

672
00:44:34,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I was going to bring up the Poconos because my family used to go to a resort called the Mountain Laurel Resort and the Poconos and even in the early 90s they were ramping up their indoor pool like complex this was like a resort that was still doing pretty well at the time had a lot of activities had like more restaurants than this better restaurants than this where where mom and dad could go.

673
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The whole family could eat dinner and then one or two nights during your trip mom and dad would go alone and they would leave the kids with like daycare activities kind of things.

674
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But I looked up that resort a couple years ago and I was like wow it hasn't changed it hasn't changed anything since the 90.

675
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I looked it up this morning it seems to be doing well it seems to be getting more towards modern amenities but yeah I think this was a big thing catching on in the Poconos of year round indoor water parks for people who don't want to go skiing or like just just families who just want to get away and maybe you'll hike for 30 minutes one day and the rest of the time you'll be at the water park which is very humid and you have to you get your water to the water park.

676
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And you have to you get used to the chlorine smell or at least you better but you're for sure going to get a headache one day.

677
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They there's no daycare options at Great Wolf Lodge which seems weird until you remember that you might experience some pleasure if you left your children with somebody else for a little while.

678
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So they can't have that they can't have you enjoy not not attending to your children because that might bring you joy as a parent and they are very much in the business of not allowing that to happen at any point.

679
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh wait so this is a question for you Justin that you were because you were alluding to even though you would gladly throw money at them to give you something that you want there's no way to do that.

680
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah you know in terms of plussing it up something we talk about on the show what would you like if if you could hand over 50 hundred more dollars to make something happen there.

681
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What do you what do you want. What's the Great Wolf parent plus up that would make the thing better.

682
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It would have to be it would have to be a different.

683
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It would have to be a different adjacent resort.

684
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So contemptible is everything from the aesthetics to the offerings at Great Wolf Lodge to me the discerning adult.

685
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It would have to be like cigarette Joe's Island getaway and it's like next door.

686
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You have to pay a thousand dollars and you can leave your kids at the door.

687
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
There was a tunnel in your room to a different resort that the parents could go through a secret.

688
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
After the kids are asleep right you can slide down like the water slide like check you just slide down.

689
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
All the parents in a tunnel come with me. I know of a place I can provide you passage.

690
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah there's no atheist and foxholes but everyone's a smoker at the Great Wolf Lodge.

691
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You're just like I don't usually crave cigarettes but I would love to go outside alone and smoke a pack right now.

692
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm going to have the first cigarette of my life here outside Great Wolf Lodge.

693
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
There is a I will I will mention and I guess this is a concession to adults in some sense because the pool in the water park.

694
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:15,000
There is Grizzly Rob's Bar which is a it says the description of the website is feeling the need for some cool refreshment.

695
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Grizzly Rob's is the place to quench your thirst with soft drinks island inspired cocktails and an extensive beer list.

696
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Stop by for an invigorating break at noon after a day of 84 degree water park play or anytime the spirit moves you.

697
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Spirits being the operative. Yeah and you will never see parents more broken down than parents at 11 o'clock a.m.

698
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
like lined up for margaritas at Grizzly Rob's Bar like yeah yeah I know they're mostly iced.

699
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I just need to feel something. Please Grizzly Rob set me up.

700
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Have you had a drink at Grizzly Rob's?

701
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I don't have time for the lines at Grizzly Rob's.

702
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So what I will do is get a there is a buckets.

703
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You can get a frozen pina colada and that is the one offering they have there in terms of like alcohol.

704
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
There may be beer. I'm not I'm not a big beer guy.

705
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But it seems like you have to come in with a plan and the plan might help you or not do anything for you depending on where the Great Wolf Lodge is.

706
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Because like it seems like that Ohio one you maybe could go find a target or something like if you wanted to sneak your little bottles in or whatever.

707
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Or like the Anaheim one you know is close enough to like there's stores very close.

708
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But if it's a diss if it's a resort like truly in the middle of nowhere then you got nothing right.

709
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You really there's really you got to like plan for that and come in with your adult amenities.

710
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
If you plan ahead you can like there's a fridge in the room right.

711
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You can like bring your own stuff and plan ahead.

712
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
If you don't though the it's I'm going to sound like I'm overshading it but like the parking lot I don't know how they make it so far from your room.

713
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But the farthest distance that there is on earth is the distance from your room at Great Wolf Lodge back to your car.

714
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And also if you move your car pretty good chance you're going to have even worse.

715
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
When you come back punished as someone will slip in there no questions asked will slide right in.

716
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So yeah it is it is a real crap shoot to to leave to go anywhere.

717
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
There is like some convenience stores across the way.

718
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
The the dunk I mentioned right which doesn't sound that wild right.

719
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
There's Duncan's everywhere but it's the only coffee that you can get in the resort.

720
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Whoa. So imagine if you will eight thirty in the morning at the Dunkin in a Great Wolf Lodge I mean lines out the door.

721
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I mean like beyond because everyone wants coffee and this is the place where they will give you a cup of coffee.

722
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So everyone at the hotel every adult that drinks coffee has to wait in line for for their coffee and the line is unfathomable to a point where I have gone to my car driven to the adjacent Dunkin half mile away.

723
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:26,000
They go through the drive through and get my dishwater hash browns from from an outside vendor rather than wait in the lines there at the Great Wolf Lodge.

724
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Oh my God. Yikes yikes.

725
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
These are boy this is bizarre. This is all so fun to talk about.

726
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh yes Mike I have I have checked you cannot mobile order.

727
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
No you absolutely cannot mobile order the dog.

728
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That's convenient.

729
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No no no not great lodge. You wait in the line.

730
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You're waiting that you might enjoy skipping the line.

731
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Do you love your family or not.

732
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We're going to be together.

733
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Can I just read some copy that's that that just jumped out at me from the Great Wolf website.

734
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You know it.

735
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The big thing and this is this is recurring in a lot of their spots and stuff you know arrive as a family leave as a pack at Great Wolf Lodge.

736
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So that that's kind of on a lot of their stuff but that it's the next couple sentences that stuck with me.

737
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Experience a world of play all under one roof.

738
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Go with the flow in our water park resort or find adventurous dry play throughout the lodge.

739
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
How do we feel about dry dry adventurous adventurous dry dry play.

740
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
None of Jason's gold bond involved.

741
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
No there's no town.

742
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
First of all that would be dry play no town.

743
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That would be because it's powder because Jason was adventurous dry plays with if it's the talc but the lotions are for it.

744
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It feels like just a bunch of lorem to like fill in because like it doesn't we don't care if you want to come or not adult.

745
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We just put some garbage in here.

746
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Your kids are going to make you go.

747
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
How do you do.

748
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
How do you do fellow humans.

749
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Are you excited for leisure.

750
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Is mad adult like.

751
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yeah we're an adult like you here at Great Wolf Lodge.

752
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We have the Iron Horse Fitness Center.

753
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You can exercise your commitment to health and well-being in our fitness room.

754
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We offer a perfect selection of cardio and weight training equipment flat screen TVs and towel service so you can stay on top of your game or begin a new.

755
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Imagine you're going to start a new commitment to fitness.

756
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Great Wolf Lodge.

757
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This is my moment.

758
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'm going to start now.

759
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Well I want to get attractive enough to leave my terrible family.

760
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I will maybe come here if I can get in shape enough to have an affair.

761
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I might experience something.

762
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Fly away from this place.

763
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Then maybe what maybe Wiley's sister Viola will look at me.

764
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,000
The Iron Horse Fitness Center is next to the glow in the dark golf and I've never seen a single human being in it as long as I've lived.

765
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I've never seen one.

766
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well Justin there's a reason for that because the entirety of Great Wolf Lodge is a treadmill.

767
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You're running and running and you're not getting away.

768
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Dad take your one.

769
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Go up the stairs.

770
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
The next quest is on floor six.

771
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The next quest is back on the bottom floor.

772
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All right back up to eight.

773
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Well you raise you do raise a good point Justin.

774
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
This this might be a terrific place to have an affair because I don't think anyone's going to be looking for you.

775
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Private eye like they're not letting anyone in with a private eye like a long telephoto lens like oh no pal.

776
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No you're not coming in here.

777
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You're talking about an affair that's deep enough along that it would be on the old show cheaters.

778
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Where private investigators.

779
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah a sleazy James Elroy style private investigators tracking you.

780
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'll find your man I will.

781
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm sorry Miss Wilson I had real good tabs on him and then I lost him in a crowd of one thousand unhappy adults that look like just facing utter mortal panic.

782
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Every single one of them look exactly the same.

783
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
He seems to get into a dunk of wine.

784
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Slides a picture on the desk and the affair is actually like obscured by a thousand little wands that are on the top.

785
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
The kids holding the wands.

786
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like you can see they're making out here behind all these wands.

787
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I can't see that.

788
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
No I really.

789
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I think some children conspired to use magic against me to defeat my private eye skills.

790
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I did my best.

791
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Could I real quick.

792
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
My talk about the found the founders.

793
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh yeah.

794
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh yeah.

795
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm very excited.

796
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I am excited.

797
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I did not go to the Great Wolf Lodge when I the couple times I went to the Wisconsin Dulles as a youth but I definitely went to their other creation which is Noah's Ark water.

798
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Noah's Ark.

799
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Noah's Ark.

800
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah you've brought this up before.

801
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It feels familiar to me but I don't I don't recall much about it.

802
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah Noah's Ark is not I mean it's obviously somewhat religious like that's what it's called.

803
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
But that's like the top.

804
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That's like the the water park in Wisconsin that you go to.

805
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Then it's got the biggest slides and everything and I don't know if it's still in America right.

806
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's massive.

807
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I think so.

808
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah.

809
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It was definitely like all the that was like what you would do if you were a kid like if you didn't go there you were you may as well not have come back because it was the cool one.

810
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And my mom we I begged to go there because my mom was very afraid of me going to a water park.

811
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
This is the place where you were denied.

812
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You've told this one that you were you were shut down from like kids birthday parties.

813
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I was denied.

814
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
No I did go here but I was denied.

815
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
She wouldn't let us go with like just kids and other kids families that she didn't trust even they were friends of mine.

816
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So we would like lie and say why I didn't go.

817
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
She'd be like oh we have to go.

818
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You know it's I think here's one of my favorites.

819
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It would be like it's our anniversary and the kids and I are and Jeff are all doing something.

820
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So this would be the regular birth like because it would always be the same birthday water park and it would always be the same.

821
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Wait but then you would it wasn't your anniversary and you would not do anything.

822
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
We would never we would barely do anything.

823
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah we surely you couldn't have gone to Bennegan's another night.

824
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Maybe we went to Bennegan's it's possible we went to Chili's or something.

825
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There's you know I talk about these five timers these stories that we tell this one I think you need to tell at least once a year just to remind everyone where you're coming from.

826
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Important context.

827
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
These you know what to be here.

828
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Let me give let me give my mom some credit.

829
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This was the family that would invite us that also called her once and said also I want to let you know we have a gun in the house and the boys know where it is.

830
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So as much as my mother was a little overprotective I guess I have to give her.

831
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah well hold on a second hold on a second.

832
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Did you get to see it.

833
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I did not.

834
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Also I did not go over to that house for many years.

835
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That's fine.

836
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That's fair.

837
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Although I did see the one brother shoot the other brother at two feet close range with a BB gun.

838
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Whoa.

839
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Oh my god.

840
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
In the back.

841
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Because they were fighting.

842
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay well they wanted one of the sorry I'm so sorry.

843
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
One of the brothers was on the roof with the BB gun shooting at his brother when we like rolled up there.

844
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And then the other brother just as like as like a kind of a psych out was like fine come down here took his shirt off got down like this shoot me in the back and I'll show the scar to mine.

845
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And then he did it.

846
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It happened.

847
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We watched it happen in the back.

848
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Imagine that feeling for 24 hours.

849
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's great wolf lodges in the doll.

850
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's basically like getting shot in the back with a BB gun by your brother.

851
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And you that you asked for it.

852
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You paid for it.

853
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
You wait there.

854
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Your kids doesn't have a credit card.

855
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
They can't get there without you.

856
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
There's nothing to be scared of here.

857
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You said it so many times.

858
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I feel like there's a lot to be scared of here.

859
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah that's where the song starts and then it keeps getting said.

860
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Jack and Andrew Waterman are the two gentlemen.

861
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The famous water park founders the waterman.

862
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's so weird.

863
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And then they yeah they they know as arc was first and then they they created great will fludging like 97.

864
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So it's so recent.

865
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah.

866
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
For something that has so many locations really bizarre how quickly it's taken up but Noah's Ark has some some magic to it.

867
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Like you could see why another business would be appealing from from the waterman's.

868
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Oh I loved I love Noah's Ark.

869
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It was awesome.

870
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It was like I was scared of a lot.

871
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I was scared a lot of the slides believe it or not.

872
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But like it had enough thing enough things for a kid to get very excited.

873
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And it was just massive.

874
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
How much.

875
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
How much Noah.

876
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:16,000
See there's a there's not really much religious stuff and I got to dig back in and maybe there was in the old days.

877
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But it seems like they've it seems like they're it's a very secular telling of Noah's Ark if that's even part of it because it's not there's no like religious theme slides.

878
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And didn't realize Noah did hang loose so much.

879
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You know.

880
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah.

881
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
This might.

882
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah this is.

883
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah I would imagine that there was a little more religious tie a little more of a religious tie in early on.

884
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But how.

885
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
How is it water park wise just judging it as a water park Justin.

886
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I hate.

887
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I hate water.

888
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's really hard for me to judge because I I will say it's a little better being in an indoor environment where you don't have the sun beating down on you while you're standing in line for a ride.

889
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That that I appreciate.

890
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I mean I I I but like for example I've been to Disney I don't know how many times never been to like Blizzard Beach or any of those I have zero interest in water parks.

891
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Every time we go to Great Wolf Lodge I live in this tiny bit of hope that my kids would be like I don't really feel like doing the water park this time dad let's just do anything else for the entire day.

892
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I mean the rides are are my kids won't do any of the fun slides so it's pretty much just standing in the wave pool trying to keep them from drowning.

893
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That's the bulk of it.

894
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That seems stressful.

895
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah it is very stressful even the lazy river is just them trying to fall out of the inner tube get swept away by the current.

896
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
That's not much not much fun.

897
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Well it feels like you're just a lifeguard.

898
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Well look.

899
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah they've got.

900
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yeah they definitely have lifeguards and I know about the lifeguard system because and I can't believe this this might be the first topic we've ever done on the show that has been the topic of an episode of undercover boss.

901
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
There was a early on in the show.

902
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:25,000
The then CEO Kim Schaefer went undercover and worked at a lot of the restaurants worked at the front desk which really gave you like the tenor of who comes there.

903
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Like so people so upset at the front desk.

904
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I told you I wanted a high room.

905
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
OK we only have floor three.

906
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Is that OK.

907
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Well it's going to have to be.

908
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Oh you're on tell you're willingly on television acting like this.

909
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
But then but one of the things she does is she works with the lifeguards and a couple interesting things happen here.

910
01:02:44,000 --> 01:03:05,000
You get to see the training and you know that the lifeguards are trained and have to stay on their toes at all times because on just a regular day not even in the pre work training they might have to pass something called the Timmy test and the Timmy test is when unannounced a different

911
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
lifeguard throws a very realistic dummy with a big like gaping open mouth.

912
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Like it looks like an already deceased child.

913
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I mean a CPR dummy but like with a little more going on so that it has like limbs a Kimbo Timmy might get tossed into the wave pool and you have 15 seconds to notice Timmy and rescue Timmy and get him out of the water which is.

914
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And the test that I saw that was on the show was considered successful at 13 seconds which is pretty good.

915
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That guy's on it.

916
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But what a stressful thing for the lifeguards that Timmy might show up and for the guests.

917
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You might just have what you think is a like it looks like an almost dead E.T.

918
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The Timmy test is the watch a child drown simulator like I mean guys I mean I'll grant you that that's a wild practice but like I would like to keep the lifeguards with their head on a swivel for drowning kids.

919
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I mean I don't want to I definitely do want them to have an eye out.

920
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah.

921
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I mean I'm sorry that has to how often I mean they don't get false alarms right.

922
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
They're going to get dull every once in a while you got to give a little.

923
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Stay on.

924
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah.

925
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Not a job you can stop paying attention to it at any second.

926
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So that is that yes.

927
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Well bizarre.

928
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Probably a good thing that they do.

929
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I also learned a little bit of the lingo something that you get to see in this episode.

930
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:45,000
We recently were just because of mission space obviously mission space you end up with a lot of vomit and the euphemism we were discussing protein spills.

931
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
There is a different kind of thing that we were discussing in this episode.

932
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We were discussing protein spills.

933
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
There is a different euphemism at Great Wolf Lodge and that is AFR.

934
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We got an AFR and the AFR stands for accidental fecal release.

935
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Oh great.

936
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I don't know what happened.

937
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I just ate.

938
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I don't know what happened.

939
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I ate the world's worst pizza and milkshakes for 24 hours straight.

940
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I got diarrhea.

941
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Come on.

942
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You don't want me to poop in the pool.

943
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You got to serve a vegetable in here somewhere.

944
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yeah.

945
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
No telling if the if the AFR was from a child or from a man in his 40s.

946
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I got it.

947
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I'll tell you how was work today honey.

948
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Awful.

949
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
We had a Timmy test in the morning and then an AFR right after.

950
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think my boss is out to get me.

951
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And I was so scared by the Timmy test.

952
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I had an AFR.

953
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I should have led with that.

954
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

955
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:56,000
With our new fleet of ultra realistic Timmy's, Timmy can serve not just for the Timmy test,

956
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
but we can squirt AFRs out of him.

957
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
As your red string just falls around the way.

958
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You have to grab Timmy with one hand and grab the AFR with the other.

959
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That is the experience of being a pair of great old flogger.

960
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
They have replicated it almost exactly.

961
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
If you can get at least 85% of the AFR in your hand on the first grab, then you are up to par as far as lifeguards.

962
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
We got the chunks.

963
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
We can't expect him to get the liquid.

964
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
His lifeguard is only 17.

965
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
What's he going to do?

966
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
The end of this episode of Undercover Boss.

967
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
She's just holding a lightly singed Timmy doll and she's just covered in shit.

968
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Everyone's getting a $3 raise.

969
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Everyone's getting a $3 an hour raise immediately.

970
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm so sorry.

971
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm going to go try to get hired at Lockheed Martin.

972
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Literally anything.

973
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Please.

974
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Somehow less crimes against humanity at Lockheed Martin.

975
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There is no fun involved.

976
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Not any capacity for fun.

977
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Well, one more thing.

978
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We can stifle it down a little.

979
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
But the crimes against humanity, I think it's time to transition into the crimes against humanity section.

980
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Justin, do you know anything about where your money is going when you go to Great Wolf Lodge?

981
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, now guys, here's the truth of this.

982
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I was so afraid that you all would have to.

983
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

984
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We have to.

985
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I have worked.

986
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
No, no, no, because I don't know.

987
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And I've worked so you don't have to be in that place 30 seconds before you realize, like, I would not like where this is headed.

988
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Like, you might start climbing up this ladder.

989
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm not going to enjoy where it is.

990
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So, no, I have not looked into it.

991
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Maybe maybe I've had my last trip to Great Wolf Lodge.

992
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But I've remained.

993
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Well, here, let me let me build up before I get to the real source of it.

994
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I started looking up some stuff.

995
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
This is the section of my notes just titled Shadiness.

996
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
This isn't about the owner as much as I this the Garden Grove location, the only one that I've been to that I walked around a little.

997
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It didn't just feel so odd to me and so barren.

998
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And then it's like it's kind of in its where Harbor Boulevard, it's south of Disneyland.

999
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And it's where it starts to get a little barren and residential.

1000
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Like you're finally out of it that it's that every hotel chain has a location and there's a Fleming steakhouse and a Morton's and all that.

1001
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Like it's starting to get into just like regular kind of low income OC and a lot of weird stuff.

1002
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Garden Grove paid for the whole lot of the garden.

1003
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
The city of Garden Grove, trying to track people away from Anaheim, footed the bill for like 20 million dollars to have the site prepared.

1004
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
So they're throwing so much money at it.

1005
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
They had to the Great Wolf Lodge had to pay one point nine million to settle the cost of relocating 30 low income families living in a trailer park on the property.

1006
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So they evicted a trailer park in order to get Great Wolf Lodge built, not counting the legal fees for getting them out.

1007
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And then still, it's not like Garden Grove was super site like corporate Garden Grove was excited.

1008
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But the neighbors were like, I don't know if I want a six story water funnel in my backyard.

1009
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And you know who won this fight because Jordan, if we could pull up the photo I have, look at the view that you have.

1010
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
If you.

1011
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I mean, the streets fine.

1012
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You'd happily live on the streets, not like a sad street, but it's made much more bizarre by full waterslide, multiple mismatchy colors of water slides exploding out of this building at the end of your block.

1013
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It looks like Dr. Strange has used his fractal magic to draw together a regular neighborhood.

1014
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

1015
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's the weird thing about that location because a lot of these are sort of in nature in the mountains, but this Anaheim one, it's yeah, it's bizarre that it's just right next to that.

1016
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
There's just like a Walgreens right there.

1017
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:20,000
These poor, oh God, like you've survived getting Disney Firework Ash in your yard for decades, but at least you didn't have a water funnel out your kitchen window.

1018
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The ownership status of Great Wolf Lodge is its own adventure because at one point in time there was a, what I read described as a rare public bidding war where like companies were going back and forth where it's like I'll buy the company $4 a share, $4.55, $5.75.

1019
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Like they're literally doing like an auctioneer getting it.

1020
01:10:44,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And so they've had a couple owners and then a few years ago, 65% of operational control or controlling interest, I believe is the phrase I saw, is now 65% by the company Blackstone.

1021
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So the company that owns a lot of real estate in America, the company that probably owns some of those houses on that street also owns this.

1022
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Pricing out, yeah, they're the big company when you hear about fucking up the housing market and like let's buy all the houses and rent them out in full cash so that people can't buy starter houses anymore.

1023
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
They also fund rainforest deforestation in the Amazon.

1024
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The CEO donated like $15 million to Mitch McConnell's Super PAC.

1025
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:45,000
The CEO was the head of when Trump got elected and there was like he got like a consortium of CEOs that Bob Iger was briefly on and then left.

1026
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
But there was some like I don't even remember the name of the committee, but like Super Trumper.

1027
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's a it's an incredibly evil organization that OK, let me list some things that in addition to Great Wolf Lodge, if you partake in any of this, you're putting money into fucking up the housing market and the rainforest.

1028
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:12,000
All the bush parks, the SeaWorld, Bush Garden, Sesame Place, they own the Willis Tower, the former Sears Tower.

1029
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
They own Motel 6.

1030
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
They own the Cosmopolitan Aria and the Vidara in Vegas.

1031
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And then you get into the products.

1032
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oatly, they own the oat milk.

1033
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Ancestry is these people.

1034
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I'm doing an ancestry of them straight to evil.

1035
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
They own Bumble.

1036
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
They own Bumble.

1037
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Honey, do you remember the place where we met and then we fell in love, darling Jane?

1038
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh, you guys are Bumble.

1039
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah, we met on Bumble.

1040
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Yeah.

1041
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Guess what else they own?

1042
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It's you know, it's weird.

1043
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
What I can't figure out from all this is why you guys have me on this episode when I've never paid to go to Great Wolf Lodge my entire life.

1044
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Holy ignorant until this moment.

1045
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I've met, you know, I thought about going, but gosh, with that kind of corporate history, I mean, I never would have dreamed of it.

1046
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
They have their hands in so many pockets like you can't avoid.

1047
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:21,000
They fund both the politicians that complain about coastal liberal elites drinking their oat milk and then they're funding the oat milk.

1048
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And and the best one in the list, Spanx.

1049
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Blackstone, the evil equity firm owns Spanx.

1050
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There's no way around it.

1051
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
This is just how we have to live.

1052
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Somebody else that says, hey, podcast, the right has many guests on there.

1053
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
What's that vibe like?

1054
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And I have to tell me, just fucking do your research before you go in there.

1055
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
They're going to Edward, Edward Armuro you and the wait to do it.

1056
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Well, it's interesting.

1057
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I'm glad you've had such a good podcast equivalent.

1058
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
We dump animal blood on you.

1059
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You're complicit.

1060
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
We all any time that's what it's like to be a parent at Great Wolf Lodge, you're getting animal dumped on blood on you and you people are shouting you're complicit.

1061
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You're complicit and they're not an animal blood release.

1062
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Any time we try to do it like an inoffensive, just what seems like a bland topic.

1063
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Inevitably, you get to the second page of Google results and it's like, oh, no, what's this Isaac Chotner interview in the New Yorker?

1064
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh, no. Who's he got up against the wall related to like, you know, fun of moles or whatever.

1065
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Well, so I'm sorry if you've taken this as finger pointing.

1066
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
This was not the intent. Yeah.

1067
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
If anything, I hope that it makes you feel better about that.

1068
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Do you feel more justified in what has been frustrating about this place?

1069
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
In this there is a sense where like this does feel like on top of the final indignity.

1070
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
We're like, it doesn't.

1071
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
This pleasure is permanent.

1072
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It is not in when you leave the premises.

1073
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You're carrying it around with you for the entirety of your life.

1074
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I have to respect the hustle that they have towards making me feel bad.

1075
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Emotionally, there's a little bit of the Joker like, where do they get those wonderful toys?

1076
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Like, oh, you got me again, guys.

1077
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Got it.

1078
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That's good.

1079
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah. In their defense, the animated film about the Great Wolf Lodge characters seems kind of cute and nice.

1080
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Nothing about the trailer upset me.

1081
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
So they're trying to like make the characters where, you know, you maybe could experience them outside.

1082
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So there's the movie The Great Wolf Pack, a call to adventure.

1083
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And this seems fine.

1084
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Now, I'm not going to think about what how it was funded.

1085
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I just think that Wiley and Oliver Raccoon and especially Brinley Bear are looking their best.

1086
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And it looks like a fun adventure.

1087
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I wish the watermen's never sold, you know?

1088
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
That's right.

1089
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
They're. Yeah.

1090
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
If we can focus on the dream of the watermen's.

1091
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Yeah.

1092
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
They just wanted to make a family into a pack.

1093
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And right.

1094
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Do you feel like not a super not a super pack?

1095
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Not a super pack.

1096
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yeah, that's where we got lost.

1097
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
We went from packs to super packs.

1098
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That's right.

1099
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Make sure.

1100
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Is this a real movie?

1101
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Like, will this be out in theaters?

1102
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Like, so it's about 10 days ago as we record.

1103
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
This is so timely, guys.

1104
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm so impressed with you.

1105
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Strange.

1106
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I don't know.

1107
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I think, well, I'm not sure.

1108
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I think maybe you can like buy this stream this or something.

1109
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But what I love is that it becomes a movie that you can watch on Great Wolf Lodge TV.

1110
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Reminiscent of my favorite thing that there was this hour long Treasure Island movie where you get to see Steve Wynn act.

1111
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And it only played in Treasure Island.

1112
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's a nice throwback to that.

1113
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So the next time you go, the next time that you're sure to happily go with your pack, you can watch this movie.

1114
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Is there some sort of is there some sort of morality offset that I can do where I have to pay my credits to a good organization to justify my presence in Great Wolf Lodge?

1115
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
What's the opposite of I don't know.

1116
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Yeah, I guess like helping low income housing or this is you shouldn't have to do penance.

1117
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's tip 200 percent at the lodge.

1118
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
As if you're serving.

1119
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
No ethical consumption under capitalism.

1120
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So title of this episode, that's extra true.

1121
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah.

1122
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Any any closing thoughts?

1123
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Have we have we washed away all your bad or any good memories into I feel lighter lighter.

1124
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
This has been really this has been good to get off my chest.

1125
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
All right.

1126
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Well, well, perfect.

1127
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Boy, what a fun thing to talk about.

1128
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Crazier that I thought it would be.

1129
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Justin McIlroy survived.

1130
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Fuck has the ride.

1131
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1132
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1133
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We are going to be my family and I we do live shows for our podcasts.

1134
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We're going to be in San Jose doing the Adventure Zone, which is our role playing podcast on the twenty ninth.

1135
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We're going to be there doing my brother, my brother, me on the thirtieth at the San Jose Civic.

1136
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And then October 1st, we're in Denver at the Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre doing my brother, my brother, me.

1137
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So that'll be very soon, I bet.

1138
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
As you're listening to this.

1139
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So if you can get tickets at McIlroy, McELROY dot family.

1140
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Fantastic.

1141
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And you could probably pair it all up.

1142
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
You go to the Denver show and then you go to the Colorado Springs Great Wolf Lodge.

1143
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Perfect.

1144
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Perfect.

1145
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I always encourage people to stay at the Great Wolf Lodge.

1146
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Jason, it's the perfect experience for your childless podcast fan.

1147
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You're really going to love this.

1148
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
This is really going to be.

1149
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Well, that was an early discovery for me with this is that like looking up videos of it there, they have made no outreach to vlogger to like childless vloggers and stuff.

1150
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
They've made no marketing push.

1151
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Most theme parks of various sizes been like, oh, these people do free marketing for us.

1152
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Give them some tickets.

1153
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Not the case.

1154
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Not the case.

1155
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
We can get Jason.

1156
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Let's see if we can get you down and that sounds like we can get you on a calm room.

1157
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's impossible to say for sure, but I've never seen an adult there who did not obviously have like was not either obviously a parent or had a children, a child like present with them.

1158
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I've never seen like, let's just go to the lodge tonight and enjoy a nice dinner.

1159
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Hello, sweetheart.

1160
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This definitely this feels like maybe the first thing in podcast right history where I'm like, I am not welcome.

1161
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
They may as well have those nuclear site like this is not a place of honor signs.

1162
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Private eyes.

1163
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
They're going to be watching you.

1164
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Yeah, I'm just looking.

1165
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Listen, if you just look exasperated the entire time, no one will bat an eye.

1166
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1167
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I'll take a wand, please.

1168
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I'm going to email the PR at Blackstone and ask if we could send our cub reporter Jason share them to one of the great wolf lodges.

1169
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Blackstone dot com literal literal cub reporter in this case.

1170
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
He'll be by by staying there.

1171
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
He gives his name and his likeness over to a bear like creature named Jason the bear.

1172
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I'm I'm happy to chaperone Scott and his son because chaperone chaperone.

1173
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Yeah, I've never been chaperone.

1174
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm happy.

1175
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
As you said, you were on your own if you ever had to go to this.

1176
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1177
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I told Justin that I had the agreement with my wife already was if I were ever to take my son down here that it is just dad and son.

1178
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
And now I wonder if dad has to get removed from the equation.

1179
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So Uncle Jason.

1180
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Yeah, please let me know how that goes.

1181
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Please go.

1182
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't know any other adults have been to great with watch.

1183
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I would really love to hear your thoughts on it because it is a unique a unique still, you know, after all this pay to get in there.

1184
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You're going to sneak in.

1185
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Uncle Jason is invited and be shot.

1186
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So you just give Scott one every hour to keep him going.

1187
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Just a B12.

1188
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Help me, my friend.

1189
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I'm suffering.

1190
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Well, yeah, we'll see.

1191
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'll report on that.

1192
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000

1198
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You consider it that the money might flow through me eventually to Great Wolf Lodge and then to Blackstone.

1199
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
But that's a long ways away and not yet.

1200
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
So your money this month won't go to Blackstone.

1201
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I could promise that.

1202
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It's a temporary promise.

1203
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
All right.

1204
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
