1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,120
Welcome to podcast the Ride the Second Gate where after today's episode you will say flawless

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,840
victory.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,820
My name is Mike Carlson joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,500
That sounds right to me.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,680
Scott Garner here as well.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,500
But you'll always say that after every episode of course.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,860
That's true, yes.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,220
You're, you're, we're always, maybe like it's a hundred percent perfect of an episode.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,600
I can't think of an episode we did that wasn't perfect.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,260
No, no, it's the rare podcast that is never missed.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,200
So today will be no exception.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:53,860
Yeah.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,360
Yeah.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,000
We're in.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,840
Yeah, Jason.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,860
You'll be saying.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,280
Oh, we're missing.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,820
Oh, no, no, no.

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,860
This is the first time we've ever made a mistake on the show.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,500
Wait, hang on.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,360
Jason will save it.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,120
What was Jason going to say?

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,140
You'll be holding, you'll be holding your sides so much.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,140
You'll be in stitches.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,100
You'll be calling for a loved one to get over here so you can share it with them and then

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,020
they will say finish this please.

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,100
We have to go.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,020
Not finish him, finish this.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,300
Finish this.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,500
Finish this.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,140
Which is finishing a meal or you're finishing an argument either way.

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,360
That's a good way to say it.

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,520
We're talking Mortal Kombat today, but more importantly, the Mortal Kombat, what is it

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,180
officially called?

36
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,700
It's called Mortal Kombat Live Tour.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,900
Mortal Kombat Live Tour.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,620
It's catchy.

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,040
And it, it started, it was in 1995, debuted at the Radio City Music Hall, September 14th,

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,040
1995, the same year as the Mortal Kombat movie came out and Mortal Kombat 3, the video

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,880
game came out.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,260
Yes.

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,440
Big year for Mortal Kombat.

44
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,240
They were trying to do the turtles, the Ninja Turtles sort of model of let's take this very

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,400
popular thing and we'll tour it around the country to a bunch of kids who are going to

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,580
eat it up and their parents will have to go take them to see it.

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,640
But it did not go quite as well as the coming out of our shows tour.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,640
No.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,820
Nor do I believe it went as well as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Live, which was another

50
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,480
very big live show.

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,480
Which even though they're, they put up quite a challenge in the commercial, they're pretty

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,800
upfront.

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,600
They, they in several commercials and press kits seemingly include a kid saying it was

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,980
way better than Power Rangers Live.

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,060
Yes.

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,540
I just said that it was way specifically.

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,600
He says, I loved it.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,820
It was way much better than Power Rangers Live.

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,960
And it gave me a flat of like, is this, was that husky boy me?

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,980
Is that me?

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,120
Because there's a slightly taller kid next to him who looks disgusted.

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,180
And is it possible that was a young me and Michael who crossed paths at one point?

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,080
Were you and I not aware that we were together at the Mortal Kombat show that we've forgotten

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,420
about now entirely seeing?

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,580
Yes, it's possible.

66
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,300
Yeah, because I forget one of the because the the there's a commercial with that kid.

67
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,200
And then there is in the press kit, there's testimonials with him.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,940
Yeah, I'll play.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,500
He goes much further.

70
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,280
He keeps going like, it doesn't get much better than this, folks.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
Like he's really hamming it up.

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,960
I love him.

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,220
Just to get a little flavor.

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,860
I'll play the commercial for this.

75
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,220
I think this is the one you're talking about.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,760
Good call.

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,320
Yeah.

78
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,100
So let's see if it's you guys.

79
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,480
I loved it.

80
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,240
I thought it was way much better than Power Rangers Live.

81
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,180
Mortal Kombat, live on stage.

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,800
The best family show of the season.

83
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,780
USA today.

84
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,500
Rowan Oak, Civic Center Coliseum.

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,800
The show's great.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,020
It was great, man.

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,920
The New York Times calls it an action fantasy spectacle.

88
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,360
Prepare yourselves for Mortal Kombat, live on stage.

89
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,160
It's coming for one performance only.

90
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,840
February 22nd at Rowan Oak Civic Center Coliseum.

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
Tickets now.

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,220
Tickets now.

93
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,320
I mean, it's the monster truck rally voice, which is really great.

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,620
Doesn't that take you back the seeing the end screen with too much information, like

95
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,560
the phone number and all that.

96
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,920
It feels like a real sign of the times.

97
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,720
It was definitely a real sign of the times.

98
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,260
And in hindsight, it's really funny because we didn't have DVRs.

99
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Like there's no way, were you like screaming at your mom to get a piece of paper or did

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,140
you always have a piece of paper next to the TV?

101
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,020
Because like how would you ever jot all that down?

102
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh, yeah, right.

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,320
It's on again.

104
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,420
Get in there.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,500
Write fast.

106
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,200
There's two paragraphs of information that's going to be on the screen for two seconds.

107
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,780
We got to write fast, mom.

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,640
Get the camcorder or the film camera and we'll convert it.

109
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,480
We'll develop it and then call a number.

110
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,580
I did.

111
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,160
OK.

112
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,380
Well, I think I think the thinking is that if you load it up with information, someone

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,220
will remember one kernel of it.

114
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,880
And from there, you can somehow get a ticket master ticket.

115
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,360
But I did write down once like when Fox Kids would run Power Rangers contests, I would

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,240
keep paper and pencil by the TV to write down where I was supposed to send, you know, a

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,720
self-addressed stamped envelope, you know.

118
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,520
Did you ever get anything?

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,940
No, never.

120
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,020
Oh, man.

121
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,840
There was, I mean, there's a history of now that I'm thinking about it, this is tied to

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,700
a very problematic figure, but there would be there would be reasons I would have stuff

123
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,400
right by the TV.

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
There was a thing called picture pages, which, of course, was hosted by Bill Cosby.

125
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,780
But a status side, it was a booklet and like a thing like a pencil you would have by the

126
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,140
TV.

127
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,980
So there were reasons I guess I would have like things ready to go if I was watching

128
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,660
television.

129
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,020
Yeah.

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,720
Yeah.

131
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,860
I also remember I don't think I tried to enter it, but I an early contest I remember is another

132
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,840
problematic person like a hang out with Michael Jackson on the set of Remember the Time.

133
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
I remember how much I wanted that.

134
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,980
If I could be there and like, wait, but how did I know what it was already?

135
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,660
If I feel like I saw clips already with Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson and stuff or Magic

136
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,860
Johnson and stuff, but if they already shot it, I don't know.

137
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,800
The point is, it's probably it's really good that I didn't win that contest.

138
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,540
Yeah.

139
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,960
Yeah, that is true.

140
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,780
That is a good point.

141
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,140
Not winning the contest was a victory.

142
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,000
Was actually winning the ultimate win.

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,420
Yes.

144
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,820
Yeah.

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,820
So, yeah, I guess I guess, yeah, they would always dump all that information on screen,

146
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,620
no matter what it was, tickets, phone number.

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,220
And I guess you just scream at your parents and hopefully you would figure it out because

148
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,500
I mean, it's you really sound old when it's like you remember what it was like getting

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,840
tickets.

150
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,160
But it is crazy.

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Like I was waiting in like a jewel at 9 a.

152
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:08,780
m.

153
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,560
to get wrestling tickets on like a Saturday or Sunday in line with a bunch of like older

154
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,800
degenerates.

155
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,300
Like that's the that was the experience of getting tickets to anything

156
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,040
at that point.

157
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,360
But now you're you getting wrestling tickets is like the most high pressure diffusing a

158
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,460
bomb situation I've ever seen.

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,280
Well, that's no easier for you.

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,020
It is not.

161
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,240
Could you reload this website for me?

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Could you also check this browser?

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,640
I have enough browsers open, but it's so it's like it's turned into a different thing.

164
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,580
It's turned into like I'm, you know, Ving Rhames from Mission Impossible.

165
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,780
It's turned into a different kind of a thing, a different kind of high pressure situation,

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,380
I guess.

167
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,260
It's more of like a hacker thing in a van versus, I don't know, standing and

168
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,720
feeling like you're going to get into a fight with an older kid.

169
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Yeah, I mean, we would we would always go to either the department store, Boscov's, or

170
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,100
I think Sears or Penny's.

171
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,820
Someone had a big ticket master counter and you could pretty much find whatever you want

172
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,360
it there.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,060
But like Power Rangers Live and like Ninja Turtles Live, there's plenty of

174
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
seats like you didn't have to rush.

175
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,220
You could get to it on the weekend.

176
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,620
But I'm sure it was a little more relaxing than, yeah, having a million browser windows

177
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,780
open because at least afterwards you're like, well, I can go to the candy counter.

178
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,020
I can go to Orange Julius or something.

179
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,080
Well, right.

180
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,800
And that would have been a great treat after scoring some tickets.

181
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,180
Oh, for sure.

182
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,220
This kind of thing, by the way, the kids live tour, I feel like I didn't do as much of it

183
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,200
as when I was a kid as I wanted to.

184
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,100
I definitely did some.

185
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,880
I remember doing like ice capades or Disney on Ice kind of stuff.

186
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,440
I didn't see Ninja Turtles.

187
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
And it's going to be a while before this kind of thing is back.

188
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,620
But me having a kid now, like and it's like so much less like time commitment than going

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,560
to a theme park.

190
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,840
And who cares?

191
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,480
You could leave if he freaks out.

192
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,760
I could like the tickets aren't that expensive.

193
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I could just be gone in 15 minutes if it goes badly.

194
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,860
This I I just don't know when these are going to come back, but I want to do all of these

195
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,640
things so bad because I want to go to these things like Mike, you and I separately before

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,520
we knew each other went to Batman Live and you're just a creep at Batman Live.

197
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,180
Like, it's weird for you to be there.

198
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,100
But now that I've got a baby, I could go to anything always.

199
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,660
I can see Paw Patrol and Baby Shark and all this stuff that I probably don't even want

200
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
to sit through, really.

201
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,280
But I think it's going to be fun anyway.

202
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,180
I'm just like dying for these to come back.

203
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
I don't know when they will.

204
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,700
Right.

205
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,560
There's nothing when you have a baby, there's nothing that's going to set off a

206
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,060
red flag for you to go to these places that we all want to go to, but might feel a little

207
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,600
I mean, we still probably would have gone to them.

208
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,040
We would have just been like, oh, God, all these people with kids are like, what are

209
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,400
these older, older kids, older kids doing?

210
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,280
But, uh, yep, I've got unless somebody recognizes me and knows who I am and go, wait a minute.

211
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,240
He does have a baby, but also he gets some weird other satisfaction from this.

212
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,700
So it is smiling awfully big, far too big than just seeing the gleam in his child's

213
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,900
eye.

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,680
He keeps telling the baby, I know you're not enjoying this, but I am.

215
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,040
He keeps scolding the bad.

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,060
It's really odd.

217
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,380
You got to watch this.

218
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,600
This is 5,000 years of civilization.

219
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,720
These tickets actually cost quite a bit compared to the other thing we went to.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
This is for daddy, not for you.

221
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,660
Yeah.

222
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,300
Zip the lips.

223
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,100
You're going to explain to me what this Taruk show means later when we get home.

224
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,980
I want you to write a book report as soon as you can read and write.

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,140
Oh yeah.

226
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
Any and all Avatar.

227
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Well, some of these avatars are about Avatar babies, right?

228
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,800
So they'll love that.

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,880
There's got to be an Avatar baby life tour.

230
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,620
Babies love content about babies.

231
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,300
That's true.

232
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,880
I guess it's kids, not babies, but there's probably some Avatar babies in there who I'm

233
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,620
sure will be very cute.

234
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,800
Half the well, the Etsy models say otherwise, but we'll see.

235
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,300
Yeah, those are that is hideous stuff.

236
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,560
Yeah.

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,840
Should we talk real quick about Mortal Kombat itself?

238
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,840
The video game.

239
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Yeah.

240
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,720
Looming large in my arcade brains, because for me, it was a big deal.

241
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,720
That was a big deal because it was bloody and you could kill your opponent.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,020
And for whatever reason to, I mean, I guess I liked Ninja Turtles because of fighting,

243
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,840
but I was not an aggressive kid for whatever reason it was like.

244
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,760
I have to play this bloody game where I could rip another man's head off.

245
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,040
Yes.

246
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,940
Yeah.

247
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,060
Good boys played Street Fighter.

248
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,820
Bad boys played Mortal Kombat.

249
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,780
And as a friend of ours has said, sometimes it's good to be bad because I don't think

250
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,680
I was supposed to be playing Mortal Kombat.

251
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,140
But if you're at a friend's house or you're at the bowling alley for a birthday party,

252
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,900
I don't know.

253
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,480
I was just playing.

254
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,580
I just had quarters.

255
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,800
That was the only machine working.

256
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
That was the only machine that didn't have a live.

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,080
So I played it a little, but I think I was more aware of the it's funny.

258
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,640
We're doing this like right after the Noah's Ark episode because it's like these Hollywood

259
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,740
sickos clowned on Noah's Ark, but they love this violent video game.

260
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Why is this hedonism?

261
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:27,380
We portray accurate giant and dinosaur battles and yet you mock us.

262
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,120
But I well, this might align.

263
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,060
And during that episode, we discussed how much more religious my upbringing was than

264
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,240
you guys, which maybe aligns with that.

265
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't know anything about Mortal Kombat.

266
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,800
I have never seen one of these movies.

267
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,540
I have never I do have not played it.

268
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,360
I don't know the characters whatsoever.

269
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,700
I haven't seen the new ones.

270
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,360
I don't know who people are.

271
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,780
When I look at a poster, I know nothing.

272
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
Complete cultural black spot for me.

273
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,920
So you couldn't name you.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,360
I mean, through this research, like before this research, because you have named one

275
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,480
Mortal Kombat character.

276
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,600
No, no, I don't even like vaguely recognize.

277
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,320
I know this.

278
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,220
I know the music.

279
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
I know the yelling.

280
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
And that might be all that I know.

281
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,660
I don't think still it's Johnny Johnny Cage.

282
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,820
I was going to say Rage or Sage or Stage.

283
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,600
And it's not one of those.

284
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,500
Johnny Stage would be good because he's an actor as a performer.

285
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Johnny Stage would be a great rock star name.

286
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,260
game where it was like kind of monsters fighting like gorilla, like kind of like a

287
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,500
more Godzilla kind of fight.

288
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,800
But it was also bloody.

289
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,940
That was bloody.

290
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,040
I think got away with it.

291
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,600
There was less uproar because it's like King Kong versus an alligator.

292
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,180
Yeah, this was Mortal Kombat.

293
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,860
Yeah, was much more.

294
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, you would rip a man's skull out of his body and his spinal cord would be

295
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,300
hanging off the skull.

296
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,260
And that would be the end of the that would be the fatality, they would call it

297
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,160
where it which was the big deal was you would you know, the character would be

298
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,300
Uzi because you had beaten him and then you would put in a special code on your

299
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,420
controller and then you would have a unique murder to your character.

300
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,080
That's that was the idea of the game.

301
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,600
And they eventually changed it in future games.

302
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,000
They made like friendships where you would do something nice instead of killing

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,700
your opponent and they would also have some friendships.

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,020
Yes, they would have friendships.

305
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,560
And I'm by the way, I only know the first couple of games.

306
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,460
I got the new one, but I don't know it.

307
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,660
I don't know all the lore.

308
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,380
There's a lot more lore.

309
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,040
I don't know.

310
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,200
But yes, they added friendships to like you would open up one of the characters

311
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,460
would open up their hands and a rainbow would appear and it would say friendship.

312
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,280
So you wouldn't murder your opponent.

313
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,680
You would do something nice for them.

314
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,300
Yeah, you still got the victory, but it was it was a little more pleasant.

315
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,620
World Combat was they were pretty good at like teasing the, you know,

316
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,440
the the censors, the satanic panic crowd.

317
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,720
But it kind of single handedly led to the creation of video game rating systems

318
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,500
like a year before this all happened.

319
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,960
That big year for Mortal Kombat happened.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But that only made it more valuable.

321
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,100
Like it only made it like telling kids they couldn't play it made it

322
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,380
just made it more exciting.

323
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,180
It is crazy.

324
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Yeah.

325
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,500
The first game came out in October 1992.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,820
The most recent game was April 2019 and they were at Mortal Kombat 11, 11.

327
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,580
And they didn't.

328
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,620
I think they have subtitles sometimes, but I love that.

329
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,960
They just keep the numbers going.

330
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,760
I admire through multiple systems and everything.

331
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,680
There's never been a reboot of the numbers.

332
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,400
That's great.

333
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,260
Yeah, there's been like different like MK3, ultimate.

334
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,020
And there's been like additions of the game, but they still have kept

335
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,360
like the series going as far as I know.

336
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,760
The characters change.

337
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,960
I mean, I mean, I'm sure they add a lot and everything, but

338
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,240
is it still like a base?

339
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,940
Is Johnny Cage still

340
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,680
well, ignorant here?

341
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,280
Johnny Cages around there.

342
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
Died in storylines.

343
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh, yeah.

344
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,620
He can just die entirely, like besides in a match.

345
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,360
Also, he had a child with Sonya Blade and you could play as that character

346
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,240
because she's a teenager at this point.

347
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,480
And I think Sub-Zero has like an ex apprentice.

348
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,840
Like there there's legacy characters.

349
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,260
Right.

350
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,460
Sub-Zero is he, you know, the guys with the blue, Scott

351
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,780
yellow and blue masks.

352
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,840
Yes.

353
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,640
Yeah, that's what Sub-Zero is.

354
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,860
So, yeah, Sub-Zero is the blue one.

355
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,160
Scorpion is the yellow one.

356
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,500
And then Reptile is the green one.

357
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
And I know there are more, but I'm again, OG.

358
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm old and I haven't kept up on everything.

359
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,520
I know there's a bunch more characters.

360
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,980
So, yeah, I was obsessed with it.

361
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,540
Super Nintendo is what we had.

362
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,700
So the Super Nintendo version, number one, did not have blood.

363
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,620
Super Nintendo did not allow them to do blood.

364
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,100
So, again, that made me want to play it even more with the blood.

365
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,280
I don't know what's wrong, because I've talked about this before.

366
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,500
We're like movies that were rated R.

367
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
I thought these are not for me.

368
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
Too scary, too violent.

369
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,940
I can't handle it.

370
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,360
But for some dumb reason, as like this video game, I was like,

371
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
I must kill.

372
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,520
I must play this game.

373
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,160
You need a little juice every now and then.

374
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,660
You got to release the steam valve to let some of the hate out.

375
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,460
It's good.

376
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,480
It's good in little doses.

377
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,880
It's good in little doses.

378
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,820
That arc episode was so cathartic to just like,

379
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,420
wow, an episode where we can just roast the thing the whole time.

380
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,120
We'll get back to things we like.

381
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,700
Here's something.

382
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
I think this show would have been awesome.

383
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,700
I didn't see this.

384
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,060
I bet I would have had a great time.

385
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,020
Yeah, I mean, it's tough, though, because maybe this is a good.

386
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,740
I'll play a clip.

387
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,660
So the movie Mortal Kombat was one of the first.

388
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,820
It's PG-13 movie, but one of the most violent movies I ever saw in the theater.

389
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,720
And I went with a friend and I will say I was terrified the whole time.

390
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,060
It was 1995.

391
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,900
I was 11 years old and I had never seen a movie in the theaters

392
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,620
that was like this dark with the promise of this much violence.

393
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,040
And my friend recalls that I did not shut up the entire time.

394
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,740
I kept like asking him questions that would basically was just like nervous.

395
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,760
I was just nervous.

396
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,460
So I had to keep talking to feel OK.

397
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
And I don't know what I was.

398
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,160
Do you know an example of that?

399
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,060
What do you mean?

400
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
Well, like, do you think?

401
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,480
So do you think that things will settle down soon or is it going to keep being like this

402
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,420
for a while or I think I was probably like think like, oh, do you I think

403
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,720
you think Johnny Cage will beat Scorpion here?

404
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,720
Like, do you think?

405
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,220
Oh, yeah.

406
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,860
Oh, well, this is this is cool.

407
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,740
Like, and I because I was trying not to be scared.

408
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,100
You know, my recollection is I was just sort of like doing running commentary

409
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,520
and then like asking questions about like, oh, who's who's that?

410
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,480
Oh, what's this going to be?

411
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
What's this going to be all about?

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,040
Talking to get through it.

413
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, and my friend, yes, describes it as very annoying.

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,820
And he remembers that from when we were 11.

415
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,380
So the live show co-star, I mean, the live show was a lot of

416
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
dance fighting, like pole punches.

417
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,400
Oh, yeah.

418
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,400
The co-stars were lasers and fake fog.

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,100
Like the live show was much more gentle.

420
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes.

421
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,160
You know, for sure.

422
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,880
But I do say I did like the movie a lot.

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,140
And Scott, I think you would like the first movie a lot.

424
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,400
It is it is bad, but has enough fun stuff in it.

425
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,240
Enough is well done enough.

426
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
Like because like the fighting is not bad.

427
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,760
It'd be they'd be unwatchable if the fighting was bad.

428
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah, I'm taking a guess here.

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,560
Well, the fight, some of the fighting is funny and some of it is pretty good.

430
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,740
But it's like the whole thing is pretty absurd.

431
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,440
I like I'll have a clip here.

432
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,700
I do think it's funny because we'll get to the actual live show

433
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,320
and a big basis of the marketing or big like kind of talking point

434
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,480
is that the Mortal Kombat live show is not about violence.

435
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,320
No, it's not.

436
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,860
Which is the one of the funniest things I find.

437
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,360
You find it over and over again in all these different press kits

438
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,660
and interviews with people involved.

439
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
This show is not about violence.

440
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,560
Now, this couldn't be more bullshit

441
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,460
because Mortal Kombat is all violence.

442
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,040
That's the whole thing about it.

443
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,180
Why you've heard of it.

444
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,340
It's why you know about it.

445
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,760
And I use this clip to even just to illustrate.

446
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,120
And this is absurd violence.

447
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,340
But so this is Johnny Cage.

448
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,340
This is the movie Johnny Cage for Scorpion and a very cool, by the way, set.

449
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,160
And they're fighting violence, violence.

450
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,180
And let me skip to the front here.

451
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Oh, he's got a skull in the eyes are glowing.

452
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Conveniently placed shield.

453
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,640
Well, Gurpeen is shooting.

454
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,820
And then here we go.

455
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,100
And this remember, Mortal Kombat is not about violence.

456
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,580
Remember while you're watching this, Scott.

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,340
OK.

458
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,860
I mean, can you call this violence?

459
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,860
Oh, orange blood from a big ear.

460
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,920
The skull got split in half.

461
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
And then explosion.

462
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,200
Which he was surprised by another explosion, another one.

463
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,700
And a hand came off his bottom jaw.

464
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,260
And then an autograph photo of Johnny Cage.

465
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,300
Yes, Johnny Cage leaves behind an autograph photo in his fatality

466
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
because he's a movie star, of course.

467
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,600
So, oh, OK, OK, gotcha.

468
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah, I mean, that seems so fun.

469
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,620
Funny.

470
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah.

471
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,300
So you should watch that movie.

472
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
Christopher Lambare is in it.

473
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Highlander.

474
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,040
Highlander.

475
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,480
OK.

476
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,940
He just like with his whisper voice the whole time.

477
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,380
And it's great.

478
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,160
And he's got a obviously I'm a fan of Paul Anderson's other films,

479
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,820
Boogie Nights and Magnolia.

480
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,080
That's right.

481
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,020
Phantom Thread.

482
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,640
So if this I'd say he started in a very different place.

483
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,860
Yeah, but you can see the promise.

484
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
You can see the promise.

485
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,460
Yeah.

486
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,180
And and John Bryan score in Mortal Kombat is really good.

487
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:08,920
Oh, yeah.

488
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,100
Oh, did he do the dinner?

489
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,980
Yes.

490
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,300
Yes.

491
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,540
Yes.

492
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:11,860
Brian.

493
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,320
John Bryan, the Immortals, techno syndrome.

494
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,640
Syndrome is the name of the song.

495
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,140
Oh, John Bryan's one of the immortals.

496
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,540
Yeah.

497
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,300
Yeah.

498
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,080
Fiona Apple or the Immortals.

499
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,800
That's right.

500
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,980
Yeah, that's right.

501
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,660
And we are about 10 days away from a new

502
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,100
a new Mortal Kombat movie coming out, the Red Band trailer,

503
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,360
which I was like, oh, and this is one of the most violent trailers

504
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,620
I have ever seen.

505
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,800
And it does like that thing that every movie does now.

506
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,460
Like, oh, look, Sub-Zero froze Jax's arms.

507
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,240
And that's how Jax gets the cybernetic arms.

508
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm not ruining everything.

509
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,140
This is the first minute of the trailer.

510
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, there's a lot of like, oh, now we're going to go back

511
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,360
and see how a character got a cool eye patch.

512
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,100
We did that.

513
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,280
It's it's prequel.

514
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,640
It's learning stuff.

515
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,480
Kind of.

516
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,000
It does have what you I mean, it does have someone say Mortal Kombat

517
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
does have someone saying, get over here.

518
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,800
It has like the stuff you want seemingly.

519
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,000
But I think this was a very hard fought movie to get made.

520
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,620
I think they did some sort of web show a few years ago.

521
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,060
And like they kept trying to get another Mortal Kombat movie made.

522
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,180
Yeah, I mean, it's a very the game series is still insanely popular.

523
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,780
So yeah, it makes sense that they've been trying to do this forever.

524
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,800
I have seen Mortal Kombat Annihilation, which was the second movie,

525
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,080
but it is not as good.

526
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,940
It's it's it's kind of a little bit too bad.

527
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,320
It's like too bad.

528
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,420
Like the first Mortal Kombat is just the right amount of bad.

529
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,020
If that makes sense.

530
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,860
Right.

531
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,900
How does it compare contrast to Street Fighter, which to me is a masterpiece?

532
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,200
More aesthetically pleasing overall Street Fighter.

533
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,840
But I was a Street Fighter movie.

534
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,600
Yes.

535
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,560
No, no, the film.

536
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,960
Yeah.

537
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,480
Because I like Raul Julia, I think is one of the greatest performances

538
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,560
of the decade.

539
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,480
His last performance.

540
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,180
It really like cheers me up.

541
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,880
I think it is.

542
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,240
Yeah.

543
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Yeah.

544
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,080
Or one of the last.

545
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:13,900
Yeah.

546
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,680
That's a good question.

547
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,660
I haven't watched Street Fighter to appear.

548
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,040
That might be more.

549
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,160
Fun bad than Mortal Kombat.

550
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,700
Yeah.

551
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,080
Yeah.

552
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,620
I mean, like more more my speed potentially.

553
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,000
Right.

554
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,200
Right.

555
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,220
But there's enough.

556
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,960
Well, a double feature.

557
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,700
When movie theaters get up and running, hopefully this

558
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,880
Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat at the New Beverly.

559
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,580
One of my first destinations.

560
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,140
Original.

561
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,620
Yeah.

562
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,300
And Quentin and Paul stop in to see Paul's move.

563
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,340
One of Paul's movies.

564
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,920
Got to support their buddy.

565
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,500
Yeah.

566
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,200
Yeah.

567
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,480
So yeah, check those out.

568
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,960
And hopefully I'm just worried the new one is going to be too like.

569
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,340
Realistic because that was not realistic, but I like to less

570
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,440
gaudy, bad 90s fun, I guess.

571
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,420
I will guarantee you that Sonya Blade is definitely a girl boss.

572
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,960
I mean, she's always been a girl boss, but this one is going to tell you

573
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
that she is a girl.

574
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,460
She is going to slay is what you're saying.

575
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,660
Absolutely.

576
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,380
Yes.

577
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,260
That's true.

578
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,120
I do believe that you're right about that.

579
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,260
So, yeah, I didn't even I didn't as a kid know this existed.

580
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,100
I mean, it didn't last very long.

581
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,960
Mortal Kombat, the live tour.

582
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,560
I have to.

583
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,160
But yeah, it was not on my radar at all at this point.

584
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,460
And I'm sure I would have been excited to see it.

585
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,680
But yeah, there's no live,

586
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,120
especially because they were marketing to young children.

587
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,540
There's this didn't come close to what kids liked

588
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,780
about Mortal Kombat, which was insane,

589
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,440
over the top violence.

590
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,060
No, I think a candy booking, though, because like, again, this is

591
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,080
this is a year of all all all hands on deck for Mortal Kombat,

592
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,740
because the movie is out this year and Mortal Kombat three

593
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,800
and this live tour.

594
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,020
In addition to that, there's a directed video cartoon

595
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,040
and the producers in the press kit.

596
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,660
Make sure to emphasize.

597
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,100
And we've got a CD rom.

598
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,380
And I don't quite know what was on the CD rom.

599
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,260
I should have looked up the CD rom.

600
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,060
Yeah.

601
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,940
But whatever fixer they're got, they got they're like, all right,

602
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
ride the controversy and go hard.

603
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,660
Like, let's make some money.

604
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:34,020
There's in the promotional video, they are like in

605
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,940
maybe I would call it insecure about Mortal Kombat,

606
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
because they have to keep explaining how popular Mortal Kombat is.

607
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,820
And there's a funny you guys probably saw this.

608
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,540
There's a funny way they decide to put it here.

609
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,260
Erica's top selling home video game of all time.

610
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,180
Consumers in the United States have spent more of their dollars

611
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,100
playing Mortal Kombat than watching Jurassic Park.

612
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,680
What?

613
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,420
Why do they have?

614
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,600
Why are their dollars playing?

615
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,020
What like when once you add in like coins?

616
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,940
Yeah, right.

617
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,840
Doesn't cost me any coins to watch Jurassic Park.

618
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,500
Right.

619
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,320
And I don't know why.

620
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,440
I guess they were like, well, dress parks very popular.

621
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,480
Let's figure out a math equation to make it seem like Mortal Kombat's better

622
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
than Jurassic Park.

623
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,060
Well, no, that's a trick, isn't it?

624
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,460
Because a movie ticket back then would be five or six bucks.

625
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,280
But a video game has always been.

626
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,740
Oh, I guess 50 bucks.

627
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,920
I guess that's true.

628
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,440
You know, it's funny you say that because I just saw

629
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,360
and I have a lot of different hashtags I follow on Instagram,

630
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,320
and one of them is I believe toys are us.

631
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,620
So one of the pictures I just saw that somebody posted

632
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,600
was an old Toys R Us ad for video games and toy and turtles.

633
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,820
And like Ninja Turtles toys are four ninety nine or three ninety nine.

634
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,740
Video games are sixty dollars, which that's the same price they are now.

635
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,040
Yeah, but action figures are like those Marvel Legends are like 20, 30 bucks.

636
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes, everything else toy wise has gone up except for video games.

637
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,480
Yeah, which I think is interesting.

638
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,540
Anyway, that's a side.

639
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,220
I guess they've always been like higher tech than other things that are available.

640
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,500
They are the highest end tech that you can use in your house.

641
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,180
Right.

642
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,380
But yeah, I was like, oh, wow, that's the exact same.

643
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,540
But yeah, like a regular action figure now is 20 bucks.

644
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,080
Where is so on that on that hashtag, then do you also see like fan art of Jeffrey?

645
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,100
Do you see is there like are there like sexualized drawings of Jeffrey the giraffe?

646
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,040
Have I seen Jeffrey in like hot pants or something?

647
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,680
I don't know if they've been sexualized.

648
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,100
I definitely have seen Jeffrey.

649
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,620
There's definitely, you know, Jeffrey stuff for sure.

650
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,960
But we haven't I mean, if somebody wants to Google sexy Jeffrey the giraffe right now,

651
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,540
I'm willing to do that in the back.

652
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,400
OK, great.

653
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Yeah.

654
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,640
And then Jason and I both tune out completely.

655
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,000
Mike's like asking questions, right, guys?

656
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,560
Right.

657
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,740
No response.

658
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,560
There's a lot of chat.

659
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,840
Toys R Us chatter again.

660
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And this happens, I think every will happen every two years

661
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,480
because Toys R Us was sold to some other awful company, probably.

662
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,980
And there's there's more talk of like we're bringing it back.

663
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,940
It's going to come back.

664
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,540
But why do we need that back of all the things?

665
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,420
It's not going to Jeffrey's going to look different.

666
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,780
They're not going to it's not going to be the same type of floor and wall,

667
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,700
which is mainly what I'd be after.

668
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,140
Yeah, they probably won't do the same floor and wall.

669
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,260
But for a toy collector, it'd be nice to have another option.

670
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,280
That's all I'll say.

671
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,740
Oh, sure.

672
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,500
Because where do you get things?

674
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,140
Is it all online or just like you have to help that individual

675
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,920
comic stores have things you want?

676
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,240
I could do a whole 90 minutes on the difference.

677
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,300
It's all with all the above is correct.

678
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,920
There's exclusives to Target, to Walmart, some are online.

679
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,480
It's a it's a real nightmare, you know, to try to sort all that stuff out.

680
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,060
So right, right.

681
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,660
Toys R Us, it would be a little bit better, a little bit centralized.

682
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,760
That would be good.

683
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,460
But we'll see.

684
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,720
I don't think it's going to happen soon.

685
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,940
Yeah, yeah.

686
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,560
But Jason, any luck finding any good?

687
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm not finding any luck, Scott, if you want to take a crack.

688
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,980
Sure.

689
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,140
Rule forty three, is that the term?

690
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,960
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,720
Mm hmm.

692
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,080
I mean, it's for the best.

693
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,220
I don't think any of us want to see this cute giraffe in a compromising position.

694
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,520
No, that's not something I need in my life.

695
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,180
So, OK, yeah.

696
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,840
So this is this is this live tour promotional video.

697
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,360
I guess real quick, we can take another quick detour

698
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,020
just because it's in the video here, and I'm sure you guys found this.

699
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,260
One of the the main producer is a guy and you know what I'm talking about, right?

700
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,400
You know where we're going with this?

701
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,780
The guy who organized the live tour, who put on a lot of other live tours before this.

703
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,140
Yes, and I'll play a clip of him.

704
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,860
His name is David Fischoff.

705
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,840
And I was as I was saying earlier, here he is defending,

706
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,100
putting a very violent thing on the road that's going to be marketed to kids.

707
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,660
Here we go.

708
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,660
Interested in developing a Mortal Kombat live tour.

709
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,040
At first, he too questioned the violence, then looked into it and jumped on board.

710
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,460
This is martial arts.

711
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,300
There are more kung fu and more martial arts schools

712
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,500
opening up every day in every community.

713
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,340
Martial arts is discipline.

714
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,360
Forget the violence.

715
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,580
The violence is in the game.

716
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,100
We're not you know, we're not going to teach these kids violence.

717
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,140
Right.

718
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,680
There's a KTLA interview to one of the performers.

719
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,520
I mean, we'll get to that.

720
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,580
We'll get to that for sure.

721
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,040
Let me just do a little more about David here.

722
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,780
Oh, yeah.

723
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,400
Because it's do you know about this, Jason?

724
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,240
Do you know why?

725
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,900
But what's important about this guy?

726
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,660
I I actually don't.

727
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,600
I think I watched a different set of promotional video.

728
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,540
There is a lot of Jason Jason Jason artifacts for this.

729
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,420
But who's this?

730
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,280
Who's this creep?

731
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,220
I guess I don't know.

732
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,820
I don't know that he's fine.

733
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,980
I think he's fine.

734
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,300
All right.

735
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,400
David Fischoff.

736
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,940
The way you're winding up.

737
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,860
No, no, no.

738
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,140
He's I mean, honestly, he's more of a hero to me than anything.

739
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,620
If you go through that video and man, was this a nice surprise.

740
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,020
If you go to 620 in this video, all of a sudden, it changes from just your standard

741
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,660
like, hey, in Mortal Kombat Live, blah, blah, blah, isn't this great?

742
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,040
And it changes to a little bit about David.

743
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,940
David Fischoff Presents Incorporated is responsible for producing

744
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,220
some of the most original, successful and exciting live shows in entertainment history.

745
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,180
Over the past 10 years, over 20 million people have attended David Fischoff

746
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,300
productions like The Monkeys 25th Anniversary Tour,

747
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,920
Classic Superfest, The Dirty Dancing Concert Tour,

748
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,500
Dick Clark's American Bandstand Tour, Ringo Starr and his All-Star Band for three tours,

749
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,120
the American Gladiators Live Tour and many, many more.

750
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,740
David Fischoff Presents also represents well-known professional sports figures

751
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,220
such as Phil Simms, Lou Fenella, Randy Meyers and Mark Bavaro.

752
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,220
So my friends like Mark Bavaro.

753
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,680
David Fischoff is responsible for the All-Star Band for Ringo Starr's All-Star Band.

754
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,620
Yeah, he named it.

755
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:26,480
He had the idea before Ringo and had approached Ringo about something before,

756
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,680
and he couldn't get all of them.

757
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,520
He was too busy.

758
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,000
A couple of years down the road, he gets ahold of Ringo and says,

759
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,800
here's this idea.

760
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,740
What if you go out on the road,

761
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,200
the All-Star musicians call the All-Star Band and Ringo's like, that sounds fine.

762
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,620
I'm doing nothing.

763
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,820
I'm doing a lot of nothing.

764
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,640
He truly for years was just sitting around.

765
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,560
There's an article where David's being interviewed and he's like, yeah,

766
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,000
Ringo and Barbro were doing nothing.

767
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,280
They were right out of rehab and they were doing nothing.

768
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,560
They were up to nothing.

769
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,380
So I said, so many times.

770
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,640
Yeah, it's like really aggressive.

771
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,960
And you're like, oh, you don't have to.

772
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,260
They were going through a hard time, maybe, David.

773
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:00,860
I don't know.

774
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,680
Nothing.

775
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,000
I just sit for days at a time.

776
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,720
I'd blink and the whole day had passed.

777
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,600
So his concept was Ringo goes on the road with an All-Star lineup of musicians.

778
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,120
And he was, I think, a sports agent before this.

779
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,080
And this got him into concerts and live shows.

780
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,600
And he put it all together.

781
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,680
Because before that, he had done those other tours.

782
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,220
We're a predecessor, the Monkeys Tour and the Dirty Dancing Tour,

783
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,120
which is really bizarre that several years after the movie,

784
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,640
a bunch of dancers from the movie got together.

785
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,840
And I think artists from the soundtrack would pop up on the tour like Eric

786
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Carman, Eric Carman's around on the tour.

787
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,120
Seeing hungry eyes live on the Dirty Dancing Tour.

788
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,100
Mm hmm.

789
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,620
Mm hmm.

790
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,700
What a time.

791
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,720
The so yeah, this Ringo thing

792
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,420
came out of the Pepsi approached him and said, hey, you got any ideas for us?

793
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,380
After all, it is the 25th anniversary of the Pepsi generation.

794
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,600
How does that mean?

795
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,400
Of what?

796
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,060
Of you thinking of that term?

797
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,740
So therefore Ringo will.

798
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:15,600
And then, Mike, did you see that story about the the fight backstage?

799
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,640
I have the video queued up.

800
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,620
Oh, boy.

801
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,980
Well, then go for it.

802
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,660
You are already familiar with Mr.

803
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Fischoff coming in is what you're saying?

804
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,660
No, no, I do none of this.

805
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,860
No, no, no.

806
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,080
OK, I got Ringo had the genius idea for the All-Star Band on his own.

807
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
I had no idea there was like a mystery man.

808
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,460
Oh, yeah.

809
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,660
He parted ways with Ringo no longer in the Ringo Folds,

810
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,120
but he got the the amazing ship off the ground.

811
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,060
And yeah, this backstage thing birthed this whole other David Fisher.

812
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,660
I think we have to pursue everything David Fischoff worked on.

813
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,960
Any setting the stage here to do, Mike?

814
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Well, I guess so.

815
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,160
So the original lineup of the All-Star Band was Clarence Clemens

816
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,700
from East Street Band, Nils Lofgren, East Street Band and a solo artist.

817
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Joe Walsh, Leavon Helm from the band.

818
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:05,860
Who am I?

819
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,240
Dr.

820
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,600
John.

821
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:06,940
Dr.

822
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,280
John.

823
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,840
Thank you, Rick Danko.

824
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,220
Rick Danko.

825
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,720
So I have a video here where they decide to play a little prank on David Fischoff.

826
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,380
And this appears in almost every article I found about this.

827
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,360
So I guess it's really hard because so to set up,

828
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,780
it's going to be hard to hear what's going on.

829
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,920
So I basically will just set it up.

830
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,460
What happened?

831
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,620
So they basically faked a fight between Joe Walsh and Leavon Helm

832
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,240
to scare the shit out of David Fischoff.

833
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,100
And they had fake blood in a broken bottle.

834
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,680
And Joe Walsh was holding a knife, I believe.

835
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,820
Mm hmm.

836
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,400
And they recorded it because they were just some goofy rock stars

837
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,560
trying to have some fun.

838
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,980
Scott, anything else of my leaving out here?

839
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,620
I don't think so.

840
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,180
Does the clip?

841
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,200
I feel like the clip doesn't even then they reveal it was a prank.

842
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

843
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
And then they just like put their arm like Leavon and Joe

844
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
put their arms around each other and then stick their tongue out at David.

845
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,360
And that's it.

846
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,140
And he laughs and laughs.

847
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,620
But what this turns into is that he's thinking about how much fun

848
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,640
all these rock stars have backstage.

849
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,600
And what if I could reproduce that fun for everybody?

850
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,900
Right.

851
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,640
And that's when he had the idea for Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp.

852
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,520
This is the guy who thought of Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp in general.

853
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,300
This guy, yes, we need to do a lot more on the things he's created.

854
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,620
For sure.

855
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,500
Yeah.

856
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,860
And we all obviously need to go to Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp

857
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,440
when this is all over.

858
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,500
We got to hang out with

859
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,600
Billy Squire or whoever the hell

860
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,020
whoever you can get fantasy camp now.

861
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Mm hmm.

862
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,180
So I'll play this clip, but it's going to be hard to enjoy.

863
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,260
Joe and Levi are pretending to fight.

864
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,040
Here comes David.

865
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,360
You fucking guys.

866
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,600
Hey, man.

867
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,320
Jesus.

868
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,040
Come on.

869
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,320
Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.

870
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,600
Levi hits David.

871
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,980
Stick out their tongues to tease him.

872
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,120
And he's clowned on the suit.

873
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,460
Yeah.

874
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,740
Prank the suit.

875
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,540
Oh, then they trap him behind a door accident.

876
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Yeah.

877
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,640
Dr.

878
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,520
John is in the corner loving it.

879
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,180
There's Pepsi everywhere.

880
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,060
They're living the lifestyle.

881
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,820
Clarence, Clarence laughing it up.

882
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,560
This is the Pepsi generation.

883
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,160
This is the fun they would have.

884
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,660
Yeah.

885
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,460
And oh, how they laughed.

886
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,100
The Pepsi generation that defined their laughter to find that generation.

887
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,780
So that's the gist of it.

888
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,440
So David is a character I did not know.

889
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,860
And going forward, he body.

890
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,500
All right.

891
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,240
He's a hero to me.

892
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,740
For sure.

893
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,420
Rock and roll fantasy camp is is there's this thing

894
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,720
where people fall backwards into like a themed experience,

895
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,180
like making a themed experience like I I watch the.

896
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
Did I talk about this recently?

897
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,840
I don't know.

898
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,700
We might not have gotten to it, but there's an episode

899
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,300
of Modern Marvel's and the history channel YouTube from like

900
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,100
theme park era Vegas.

901
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,720
And everyone is talking about designing these themed hotels and experiences.

902
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,000
And they're using the language of themed experiences

903
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,320
and they reference Disneyland as a, you know, a point of reference

904
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,980
a couple of times.

905
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,760
But then they're so blunt of like, and by the way, these aren't monuments.

906
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,300
These are going to be ripped down in 20 years at best.

907
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,240
Like this stuff isn't going to stay.

908
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,660
So it's very funny when this sort of theme design comes up in odd spots.

909
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Right.

910
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,300
Right.

911
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,640
Yeah, the framework exists in odd places.

912
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,420
Yeah.

913
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,460
Where they fall backwards into it.

914
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,140
Right.

915
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,920
So, yeah, when COVID's over, we'll go to the rock and roll fantasy camp and,

916
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
you know,

917
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,240
whatever else David's up to, whatever else other live show

918
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,020
he's producing this this year or next year.

919
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,820
They're going to do they're going to wait and do Phil Spector's funeral,

920
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,300
I think, at rock and roll fantasy camp whenever they're allowed to.

921
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,900
They're just leaving the body around.

922
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,840
The COVID will be gone hopefully by then.

923
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,800
And they'll embalm it so it doesn't smell too bad.

924
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,500
So you we all us and,

925
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,760
you know, Melissa Etheridge can be the ball bearers for

926
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,420
Phil Spector's Vince Neal's going to put him in the ground.

927
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,900
The ultimate rock and roll experience.

928
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,240
I understand why rock is

929
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
going to be gone soon, having a rough time.

930
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,340
It'll be extinct.

931
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,940
I will say I will say that's the other.

932
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,140
There's another little rock and roll tie to it that I'll bring up

933
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,660
a little later as well.

934
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,640
More rock, more rock and roll to do.

935
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,260
Yeah, rock.

936
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,000
OK.

937
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,300
Well, what do we know about this show?

938
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,380
What there's not a lot of evidence of it.

939
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,340
We're sort of talking peripherally.

940
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,840
Yeah.

941
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,160
What do we know happened?

942
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, I know the story a little because in the press kit,

943
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,200
there are nine slides that explain a very cumbersome,

944
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,440
complicated battle taking place.

945
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,820
This is so long.

946
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,720
I saw these.

947
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,460
And imagine me not knowing the characters at all.

948
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,920
I don't know what the hell's going on.

949
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,300
Yeah, it's gibberish.

950
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,480
Wait, just read the last one or like the second to last one.

951
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,980
The encoded order of the amulets is revealed to our heroes

952
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,140
through clues that are dropped by Lord Raiden along their journey.

953
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,920
Raiden is a big character.

954
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,300
He's kind of the big like protector of Earth sort of character.

955
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,080
And his counterpart would be the villainous

956
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,320
Shao Kahn.

957
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,140
Yeah.

958
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,720
And there's a tournament.

959
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,260
There's a fighting tournament called Mortal Kombat.

960
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,460
That's kind of what you need to know.

961
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,160
Well, the producers insist that, like, you know, we started

962
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,700
looking into the story of Mortal Kombat and we found there's a lot of

963
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,220
there's a lot of story there was to tell.

964
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,180
There's a lot of story.

965
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,360
And they meant to say money.

966
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,540
There's a lot of money to make.

967
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,120
There's a lot of money to make.

968
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,700
And in fact, the fight choreographer did the turtles and enter the dragon

969
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,580
and karate kid.

970
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,160
And he's like, yes, this Mortal Kombat is going to be bigger

971
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,940
than all of them.

972
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,860
I forget what's the guy's name.

973
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,560
He was trained by Chuck Norris.

974
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,700
The guy Johnson.

975
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,440
Yeah.

976
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,120
Yeah.

977
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,000
So there's like a pair of these people that made this stuff are all like

978
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,840
like big time professionals in their field.

979
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,040
Right.

980
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,640
Which is funny that they made

981
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,820
a turd of a live show.

982
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,600
But was it the do we know that do we know that this was not all like?

983
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,560
OK, so there are clips of the show.

984
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,820
And I think that me from what I see, I've seen basically all I could find

985
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,100
were people talking about their memories of it, essentially.

986
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,420
Right.

987
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,980
So I think people were just saying, well, it's a lot of like,

988
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,220
you know, kind of like dance fighting.

989
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,160
As Jason was saying, there's like not much contact going on.

990
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,480
And there weren't like original songs or anything like the Ninja Turtles.

991
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,360
I mean, there was music, but there wasn't like, you know,

992
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,320
Raiden sings a sad song about living in the sky or something,

993
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,420
which would have been great.

994
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,060
We would have been doing this.

995
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,560
We would have done this episode way earlier if there was a Raiden

996
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,600
singing about the living in the clouds.

997
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah.

998
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,420
Johnny Cage singing about the the perils of being a movie star.

999
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:37,900
Yeah.

1000
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,640
I mean, this is money they left on the table.

1001
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,500
I mean, I guess there's still time if somebody wants to.

1002
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,740
Tie it into the new.

1003
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,940
If Fish-Off wants to come to us

1004
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,000
and we will write the songs for Mortal Kombat Live.

1005
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Yeah.

1006
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,060
Yeah.

1007
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,960
As long as he brings his rock and roll fantasy camp buddies in on the deal.

1008
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,400
Yeah.

1009
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,620
As long as Alice Cooper will work with us.

1010
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,500
Yeah.

1011
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,320
Maybe the other Hollywood vampires.

1012
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,160
Some of them.

1013
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,000
Some of them.

1014
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,640
They don't invite all of them.

1015
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,000
A couple.

1016
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,360
I read a review that was from the era that was not very satisfied,

1017
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,960
but this is a stodgy adult.

1018
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,940
Maybe a child would have a great time and disagree.

1019
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,000
But this is what Entertainment Weekly said about Mortal Kombat Live.

1020
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,340
The 90 minute show I attended was a spectacle of a neftly choreographed

1021
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,860
fights and incomprehensible plot developments

1022
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,760
enacted by a troupe of martial artists lip syncing pre-recorded dialogue.

1023
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,400
So there that's why now we know that.

1024
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,660
And I really like that.

1025
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,340
I love the lip syncing the dialogue.

1026
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,680
It doesn't happen enough.

1027
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,260
It's kind of a trope of theme park stunt shows, but we don't see

1028
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,740
too many people are allowed to do their own dialogue.

1029
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,920
It should never happen.

1030
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,980
I always lip sync.

1031
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,740
It's the best.

1032
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,080
All set to a techno industrial beat loud enough to induce sterility.

1033
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,400
Good guy.

1034
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,220
Liu Kang held up a magic amulet and accompanied by a Philip Glass style

1035
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,800
motif, asked kids in attendance to raise their own amulets

1036
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,660
and help defeat the forces of evil.

1037
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,780
And by the way, seven dollar amulets are on sale at the concession stands.

1038
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,740
D minus.

1039
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,880
I also so so yeah, so real quick,

1040
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,160
I found like a more of a truncated version of what the plot was.

1041
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,440
So Shao Kahn has come to Earth to use, I believe, his bride Sindel's resurrection.

1042
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,620
That's correct.

1043
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,820
OK, thank you, Jason.

1044
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,460
To steal to steal souls from the Earth realm, essentially.

1045
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,220
And they need to collect the amulets, put them together to close the gates.

1046
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,860
So Shao Kahn cannot steal souls.

1047
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,500
So the kids would have amulets.

1048
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,020
And then I guess in the show, the show itself, they would have amulets.

1049
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,600
But apparently in one or two of the performances, the souvenir

1050
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,740
amulets were not ready yet for the kids to buy.

1051
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,140
So the big part of the show where it's like, oh, the kids are how you're helping

1052
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,120
because you have an amulet.

1053
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,420
That was not an element that they got to enjoy.

1054
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,800
Oh, geez.

1055
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,800
You know, I got it from your kids.

1056
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,140
Don't worry that a similar thing happened to me as a young adult.

1057
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,920
I went to the Pixies reunion tour in 2004

1058
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,200
and they brag that we're recording every one of these shows

1059
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,700
and you're going to be able to go to a stand at the stadium, at the arena,

1060
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,940
pay for a CD of the show,

1061
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,740
which you will be able to pick up or get mailed to you at the end of the show.

1062
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,000
And at the show in Philadelphia,

1063
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,420
everyone thought I was insane.

1064
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,480
And then later on message boards, I found out that the CD company

1065
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,660
was dropped and a new one was eventually found.

1066
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,000
But there was like four shows where you could not buy a CD,

1067
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,520
even though that was part of the marketing blitz was like they're back.

1068
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,040
And you're going to be able to buy the show when you leave this show.

1069
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,820
Oh, geez.

1070
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,460
You fell into the black hole.

1071
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,600
CD burner logistics.

1072
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,540
That's right.

1073
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,620
That was a big thing with rock shows around that time,

1074
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,060
because I bought a few bare naked ladies shows that I saw, you know,

1075
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,180
and it was like, you could collect the whole tour if you want.

1076
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,620
And then in like a couple of years later, you're like, I don't need all this live.

1077
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,920
No, I bought one at a record fair, like a few years later.

1078
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,140
Yeah, it's not like I'm on the tape.

1079
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,240
It's like I'm not on the recording in any way.

1080
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,320
Unless you're very disruptive.

1081
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,240
Right.

1082
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,060
So if I was, yeah, front row heckling, maybe.

1083
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,320
So, yeah, there was problems with the amulets, but the amulets,

1084
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,340
that was sort of the device for, yeah, for the victory,

1085
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,180
I guess, for the characters to win.

1086
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,400
And I have a picture of the amulet.

1087
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,320
Did you come across this?

1088
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,460
No.

1089
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,760
I'm sure it's very cool.

1090
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,100
But let's see for sure how cool it is.

1091
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,940
Very cool.

1092
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,060
Oh, that's pretty good.

1093
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,560
Oh, and it's autographed by the characters.

1094
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,640
Yes.

1095
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,580
And it looks like how would you describe this?

1096
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,140
Like.

1097
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,340
It looks kind of aggro, craggy.

1098
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,540
It's like a belt buckle.

1099
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,320
Yeah, it looks like, yeah, kind of an odd, misshapen silver belt buckle

1100
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,980
with an Immortal Kombat live tour logo with signatures on it.

1101
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,080
Closed in the dark.

1102
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,580
And it closed in the dark.

1103
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:16,900
Ten bucks.

1104
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,220
Pretty good.

1105
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,840
Maybe I'll buy it.

1106
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,440
Yeah.

1107
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,380
So that was yeah, that was like

1108
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,680
I'm trying to think if there's a Turtles version,

1109
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,060
they threw pizzas into the styrofoam pizzas into the audience

1110
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,800
are coming out of her shells, but I don't think you could buy them.

1111
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,100
Well, a lot of glowing plastic swords at all these live shows.

1112
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,800
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1113
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,140
Yeah.

1114
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,080
Everyone would wave, sometimes would be prompted to wave, you know.

1115
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,700
So smart.

1116
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:45,880
Yeah.

1117
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,660
And basically, yeah.

1118
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,340
So so what we know is I was watching another YouTuber

1119
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,740
and he said, I went to this and he was like very excitedly talking about it.

1120
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,940
And then he goes, I don't remember a lot about the show.

1121
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,560
I don't remember much about it, but I was really excited to go.

1122
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,500
And yeah, so and I was like, OK, well,

1123
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,600
it seems like no one really remembers.

1124
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,640
It seems like the show itself was fairly unmemorable.

1125
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,800
I guess so.

1126
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,320
I don't.

1127
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:14,720
Yeah.

1128
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,680
Or just nobody bothered.

1129
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,960
I thought that I had a potential way to figure out some some stuff about it.

1130
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,800
And that is that I ended up on a listicle of the weirdest things

1131
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,960
that the franchise of Mortal Kombat ever did.

1132
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,220
And this was on the website Games Radar.

1133
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,100
And there was a reference made.

1134
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,740
So like the way they said the weirdest thing they ever did was this live tour

1135
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,340
and that somebody in the office actually got to go to it.

1136
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,320
And that was Henry Gilbert.

1137
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,480
And I was like, Henry, yep, yep, yep.

1138
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,560
Wow.

1139
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,200
I also we both had had the same move here.

1140
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,800
So got a PM Henry Gilbert.

1141
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,920
Oh, we got a we lit up.

1142
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,480
We saw a name that we knew.

1143
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,200
Henry Gilbert is from Talking Simpsons, a great podcast

1144
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,420
that we've been on in various configurations.

1145
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,720
He wrote for this site 10 years ago and he went to Mortal Kombat.

1146
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,420
Well, sounds great.

1147
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,280
Maybe he can give us some info about what this thing was like.

1148
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,860
Did you get the full story, Mike, as well?

1149
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,380
I did.

1150
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,580
He first said, ha ha ha.

1151
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,340
Scott messaged me an hour ago.

1152
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,020
I thought I was going to have an exclusive scoop here.

1153
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,660
But when you're dealing with such a little information,

1154
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,000
it's a premium on info here.

1155
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,920
So at least his version of it to me was that,

1156
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,580
you know, really excited to go.

1157
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,780
We lived in near Jacksonville, Florida.

1158
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,420
He'd seen Disney on ice.

1159
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,660
He'd seen Sesame Street live.

1160
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
So his mom was like, it's a new version of that.

1161
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,400
Sounds great.

1162
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,360
He's excited all week.

1163
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,080
Oh, my God.

1164
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,800
Here we go into Jacksonville.

1165
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,860
Time to see Mortal Kombat live, pulls up to the arena or whatever it was.

1166
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,820
And just the gates are closed.

1167
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,860
There is no ability to park in this place.

1168
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,520
And they quickly determine, wait a minute, this is canceled.

1169
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,980
And they didn't even bother to let us know

1170
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,020
there was no reaching out to the customers.

1171
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,340
Maybe never.

1172
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,620
Henry seems to think that his mom was not refunded in any way.

1173
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,740
So this is a wild west of a time where nobody could throw a stink on social

1174
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,080
media.

1175
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,160
They could just cancel shows willy nilly and not explain it to anyone.

1176
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,960
That is so funny and would be so heartbreaking as a kid.

1177
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,080
Like, I can't imagine I never had anything similar happen like that.

1178
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,620
But that's like the that's like vacation.

1179
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,980
That's like Wally World.

1180
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,200
Like a situation where you just I would be devastated.

1181
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,560
I would have been devastated.

1182
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,400
I I had something similar happen, but I was older,

1183
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,460
but I was similarly devastated.

1184
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,470
I was supposed to go see Kevin Smith speak at Villanova University.

1185
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,420
Oh, man.

1186
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,180
I'd be so mad if anything interrupted that.

1187
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,840
And it got canceled last.

1188
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,180
And I think there was I think someone passed.

1189
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,600
And so we had to cancel last minute.

1190
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,460
So it's very sad.

1191
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,020
And thankfully, Villanova wasn't that far away from where I grew up.

1192
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,680
But we did show up and they were there like, we're sorry.

1193
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,040
Your money will be refunded.

1194
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,180
Well, at least that's good.

1195
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,920
Henry Henry claims he doesn't even know if his mom got refunded.

1196
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,520
Oh, man.

1197
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,280
He doesn't even think that happened.

1198
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,580
But he did go get pizza in Jacksonville and play some arcade games.

1199
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,020
And you have to wonder if one of those was Mortal Kombat.

1200
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,880
And you have to wonder if that's the better choice of an evening anyway.

1201
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,500
Well, sounds pretty good.

1202
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,700
And I had a blast.

1203
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,480
Yeah, I just went and saw Ocean's 11 instead.

1204
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,160
Pretty good.

1205
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,160
Yes, but pretty good.

1206
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,320
But with the tweet, who needs to see Kevin Smith speak

1207
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,540
when the tweet pays dividends year after year?

1208
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,440
It's more exciting than any live speaking engagement could ever be.

1209
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,660
You know about his wife.

1210
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,840
You're right, Scott, you're right.

1211
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,440
But it was 2001.

1212
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,800
You know, it was different.

1213
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,800
We had a different time.

1214
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,480
It's probably T.

1215
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:10,880
We.

1216
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:11,780
Yeah.

1217
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,320
Wow.

1218
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,580
Why would anyone even want to see him speak before that?

1219
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,640
He hadn't done his finest work.

1220
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,220
He'd only made these movies.

1221
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,280
That's true.

1222
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,120
Well, you know, you need to build to the Sistine Chapel.

1223
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,220
You don't paint it right out the gate.

1224
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,580
The tweet needs to be its own movie.

1225
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,140
Why is he bothering to make all these bad sequels to the movies

1226
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,640
when he should obviously be doing sequels to the tweet?

1227
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,160
Yeah.

1228
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,580
Yes.

1229
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,020
Put the flicks on the shelf, Kev.

1230
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,120
NFT, the tweet.

1231
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,540
Oh, they seem like they're a menace and I don't really understand them.

1232
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,320
But it seems.

1233
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:45,860
Wow.

1234
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,080
Yeah.

1235
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,940
What a great idea.

1236
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,820
Oh, man, that would be insanely valuable.

1237
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,200
Like generation after generation of Smith would be set for life.

1238
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,880
Yeah.

1239
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,680
The most expensive NFT of all time.

1240
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,880
So what a mess.

1241
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,260
We can't like it's people who are so excited to go

1242
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,680
and then don't remember anything.

1243
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,000
And then Henry went and then didn't get to go.

1244
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,600
And there's press kits, but nobody

1245
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,100
it doesn't really show you what the show is like.

1246
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,360
I guess really what you're left with, the only way to really know

1247
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,860
and these the cleanest footage that you have is from KTLA

1248
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,740
one sunny morning in 1995.

1249
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,220
That seems like the best way that this thing lives on.

1250
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,440
Yeah, there's a video that says that's called Mortal Kombat

1251
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,660
live tour, 1995 stage show that has some clips from the show

1252
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,700
and then leads into that KTLA.

1253
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,860
So that's the best illustration of what it was.

1254
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,880
But yes, the KTLA footage, I think, will live the longest.

1255
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:48,840
Mm hmm.

1256
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,160
So the whole gang showed up on a morning show

1257
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,580
with a host who I remember because he was my local guy

1258
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,260
who is kind of like it's like if I had to do it.

1259
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,880
He doesn't know who anyone is.

1260
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,520
And he cares a little.

1261
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,460
He cares enough to get through it like me with this episode.

1262
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,280
He certainly cares a little more at the end when Sonya Blade steps up.

1263
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,000
I will say that.

1264
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,380
Oh, yes.

1265
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,300
Sonya beats his interest.

1266
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,280
Understandably.

1267
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,940
Yeah, let's let's let's check out a little of this KTLA classic.

1268
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:22,820
So, yeah.

1269
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,500
So if you haven't seen this, there's there's a little of like

1270
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,340
the kind of dance fighting going on in a KTLA studio.

1271
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,260
Everyone is dressed in what looks like slightly better Halloween costumes,

1272
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,460
maybe not even slightly.

1273
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:43,500
And then the actor playing Shao Kahn or no, excuse me, Shang Tsung steps forward.

1274
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,160
Copious face paint kind of on a lot of people.

1275
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,320
Pretty tough crowd you hang with.

1276
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,360
Yes, they are.

1277
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,820
That is just a preview of the show that you'll be able to catch.

1278
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,220
And it is coming into the Southland.

1279
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,200
It's called Mortal Kombat.

1280
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,520
Let me first of all start by having you introduce yourself

1281
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,680
and the cast of characters behind you here.

1282
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,760
My name is Shang Tsung.

1283
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,880
All right.

1284
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,100
And starting over here.

1285
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,140
So to my left, Kano.

1286
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,040
And Corpien, Sonya.

1287
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,380
I must stress, no, I'm sure these people are very talented martial artists.

1288
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:26,140
They all look like like me in a costume dressed as Kano.

1289
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,480
Like theme park face paint, theme park face paint, like just thin clothing,

1290
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,380
like thin costumes that look like, you know, you like cut up a T-shirt and.

1291
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,200
Costumes that are meant to be viewed from a stage far away,

1292
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,940
not from a television camera 10 feet away.

1293
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,260
Right.

1294
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,860
The Scorpion costume looks like he's wearing like a cutout body stocking.

1295
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:53,320
Like looks like, you know, a Jabberwocky body stocking or something.

1296
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:01,560
Uh, Raka and Kabal, tell us a little bit about the show and and what do you expect kids to get from this?

1297
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,380
I mean, the video has already come under a little bit of criticism for some of the violence.

1298
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,680
This is a pretty wild act.

1299
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,900
You lied about the video.

1300
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,780
The show is based on a martial art aspect of the video game, Mortal Kombat.

1301
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,580
And it's already been to movie.

1302
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,160
And now we're doing the live tour.

1303
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,060
It's been under the violence has always been around.

1304
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:24,520
But what martial arts show Scorpion is all positive messages.

1305
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,480
What sort of positive messages?

1306
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:34,500
What helps children be able to be concerned about violence and the difference between martial arts and violence.

1307
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,180
It helps them to be positive.

1308
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:43,020
It helps them to be able to to be able to overcome any obstacles,

1309
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,220
which is in their life and be able to attain goals.

1310
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,000
It helps them to commit to good things in their lives.

1311
00:57:49,940 --> 00:58:00,220
OK, so going to some people, good future in politics, dance, fight on stage for an hour and a half will make kids finish their goals, complete their goals.

1312
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,980
They'll make them concerned about violence and how to make them want to avoid it when they see it.

1313
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:15,260
The guy behind him and the guy in the background with a little sliver of face paint over his eyes looking down like, don't ask me anything.

1314
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,640
Don't ask me anything.

1315
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,780
Yes, this guy playing Shang Tsung seems miserable.

1316
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,720
He is trying to remember the talking point they've given the talking point that David Fishoff, like, drilled a new one before this.

1317
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,340
Like, it's positivity.

1318
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,060
Kids will get a lot of out of get a lot out of this and there's nothing to do with violence.

1319
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,100
Going to a show where people kick each other in the head is not about violence.

1320
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,080
Do not say that.

1321
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,100
I mean, this is the height of the suburban martial arts fascination.

1322
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,900
Where did you guys do karate lessons after school or any of.

1323
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,280
Jason, that is a very good question.

1324
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,600
The answer is yes, I did Taekwondo.

1325
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:03,300
OK, and I did it with my friend Luke and we got scared after a few classes and I quit and never did it again.

1326
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:13,280
I respect that because I did like a few sample classes or like if instructors came and taught a class to the like the church youth group.

1327
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,240
But I did not want to commit.

1328
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:21,620
I think I was already doing like Cub Scouts and Little League and then eventually the plays.

1329
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,980
So I was like, I don't want to take on another.

1330
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,140
This is too many things.

1331
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,100
But also.

1332
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:33,800
At the kids who really committed to martial arts classes, I feel like really committed to it hard,

1333
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:40,120
and I think it is good for like discipline and physical activity, but I just could not sign up.

1334
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,280
Yeah, well, I I remember the teacher.

1335
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,200
He was an older guy.

1336
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,440
He could have been 31 at the time and I didn't.

1337
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,840
I thought he was like 65.

1338
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,620
There's no telling when you're a kid, but I remember his name was Mr.

1339
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:57,300
McNulty and he was like a Chicago guy wearing the full like outfit, the white outfit.

1340
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:03,300
And he was like, I remember he wanted to be to like kick him in the shins and I was like,

1341
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,220
I'm going to I'm going to hurt you.

1342
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,400
Artie's like, you're not going to hurt me.

1343
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,480
And I'm like, but I can't.

1344
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,200
So like I lightly kicked him and he was like, no harder.

1345
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:12,640
Mr.

1346
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,080
McNulty, I can take it.

1347
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,120
I was like, but I don't.

1348
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,480
And then I was like, Mom, I don't want to do this anymore.

1349
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,920
And she was like, OK, good.

1350
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,040
And she probably like held me and was like, I won't we won't ever do anything like that again.

1351
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,480
I'm sure it was a situation like that was like, you'll never have to do anything

1352
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,400
mildly out of your comfort zone again.

1353
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,340
Don't worry.

1354
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,020
You're leaving now.

1355
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,040
That was only that was a minute and a half.

1356
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,480
You paid for two hours.

1357
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,140
The knock on my door.

1358
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,260
Hey, get out here.

1359
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,680
I know you're in there.

1360
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,860
Come back to me.

1361
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,240
Kick McNulty.

1362
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,060
Mr.

1363
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,740
McNulty.

1364
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,120
I'm coming.

1365
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,540
I'll fight you in your driveway.

1366
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,200
Come on.

1367
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,140
That's not going to hurt me.

1368
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,080
What do you see here?

1369
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,720
Unbruised shins.

1370
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,340
You got to fix that.

1371
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,180
I'll be at your door tomorrow.

1372
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,760
Pretty far removed, you know, the suburban martial arts.

1373
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,120
Just just as Mortal Kombat is removed from actual martial arts tournaments.

1374
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,480
You don't think Mr.

1375
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,980
McNulty classes are a little far removed.

1376
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,680
You don't think Mr.

1377
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,320
McNulty kicks some ass in his day?

1378
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,240
I'm sure he did, but probably at like an argument at the jewel

1379
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:26,160
as opposed to like at a ancient temple.

1380
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,740
I beat up another father at the jewel, Asko.

1381
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,300
There was one Power Ranger toy left and I was getting it.

1382
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,660
It was a dispute at the pharmacy.

1383
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,580
I pulled the farm at the pharmacist over the counter.

1384
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,400
Over the counter.

1385
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,700
That white coat is red.

1386
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,940
I kicked his ass.

1387
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,480
Then I did a big spin kick and knocked all the pill bottles off of the shelf.

1388
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,560
I cooled down at Portillo's.

1389
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,160
I went over and I ate seven hot dogs.

1390
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,140
I pulled the guy who was taking my order over the counter as well.

1391
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,360
Then I made the hot dogs with my feet.

1392
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,900
I karate'd that teenager right into the trashcan.

1393
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,720
And I drove through the drive-through,

1394
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,180
pulled the drive-through worker through the window over the counter.

1395
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,860
Well, that's the only way anything used to get done at Chicago, you know?

1396
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,460
Yeah.

1397
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,100
Maybe he did work for like Mayor Daley.

1398
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,000
Oh, yeah.

1399
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,840
Busted heads for Mayor Daley.

1400
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,060
And he didn't want to do it.

1401
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,380
Part of his karate squad.

1402
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,520
Mayor Daley's Karate Squad is a very famous tough guy faction.

1403
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,940
Yeah, they would come in there.

1404
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,220
Let's see this guy bother Sonya Blade.

1405
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,520
OK, so so so basically he here.

1406
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:44,940
Let me see.

1407
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,260
I should have done a better job.

1408
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:51,480
Also, they were either raising money or raising awareness for the MS foundation.

1409
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,500
Yes, they threw a lot of like charity stuff in too.

1410
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,540
So if you were like skeptical of the fact that this still sounds like it's going to be violent,

1411
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,220
they're like, no, no, no.

1412
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,160
Well, it's charity here.

1413
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,620
Charity, charity stuff.

1414
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,620
So you could go, well, it's for charity.

1415
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,920
So I guess we can go.

1416
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,940
Right now, the Mortal Kombat Live Tour, those are the places where it's going to be shown.

1417
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,120
Can you give me a little demonstration?

1418
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,120
Can I learn something here?

1419
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,560
Are you sure can I call Sonya Blade up?

1420
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,540
I'm glad you did.

1421
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,400
Maybe not.

1422
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:15,980
I don't know.

1423
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,760
OK, are you going to hold on to the microphone here?

1424
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,620
OK, now all I want you to do, I look at that.

1425
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,300
That is the ultimate six pack of a stomach.

1426
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,100
All right, man.

1427
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:25,440
Cool.

1428
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,820
OK, she is not happy with it.

1429
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,380
It's so easy to see.

1430
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,500
She just has such contempt for him immediately.

1431
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,320
So here we go.

1432
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,120
OK.

1433
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,100
And this is what happens when you try to go for her neck.

1434
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,540
OK, try to reach for her neck and grab with both hands.

1435
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,180
Oh, yeah.

1436
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:43,840
Yeah.

1437
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:44,740
Yeah.

1438
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:45,620
Well, let you live.

1439
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,080
OK.

1440
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:46,500
Thank you.

1441
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,660
I get to live this time.

1442
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,920
You might want to check it out.

1443
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,060
Like we said, it's coming to the pond.

1444
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:55,460
It's also coming to show it like coming to the Great Western Forum.

1445
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,160
There it is once again, Saturday, October 21st, the live tour at the Arrowhead Pond,

1446
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,900
Sunday, October 22nd, one to five p.

1447
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,240
m.

1448
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,880
Tickets available at Ticketmaster two one three four eight oh thirty two thirty two.

1449
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,900
You also in the show

1450
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,600
reveal some secrets for people who are playing Mortal Kombat.

1451
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,640
Basically, it says like you can get a cheat code for the video game.

1452
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,080
If you go to the show.

1453
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,040
That's a really good show.

1454
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,420
A real good show, which would have worked if I knew about the live tour.

1455
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:22,320
Special cheat code.

1456
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,580
How long have you been doing this?

1457
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,680
Because this is pre internet.

1458
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,660
You didn't have cheat codes.

1459
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Yeah.

1460
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,560
You love that they did the sound effects on TV.

1461
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,140
Or what form?

1462
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,420
He do you also think so?

1463
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,000
So we'll post this clip.

1464
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,380
The news anchor goes for Sonya Blay way too hard and fast.

1465
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,100
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

1466
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,360
I keep really like lunged at her, too.

1467
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,660
I don't know if it was just he was in heat

1468
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,400
and it was just an instinct or what.

1469
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,160
But you believe she could kick his ass and I kind of wish she had.

1470
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,060
But also like the directive of like go for her neck.

1471
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,040
And it's like, did you guys talk about this backstage?

1472
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,740
Like, did you her movie?

1473
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,160
Her movements are obviously slower because she's not going to kick him in the head.

1474
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,980
But he lunged at her neck.

1475
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,500
I don't know what he was thinking.

1476
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:04,560
Yeah.

1477
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,060
Well, he was told to.

1478
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,400
That was the plan.

1479
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:07,720
True.

1480
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,340
But like you would be like, OK, well, I get this is play fighting.

1481
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,380
I'm not going to, you know, but, you know, I guess you got into it.

1482
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,180
He was very excited.

1483
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,600
He was very excited by her abs.

1484
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,820
At least he didn't go for those.

1485
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,140
That's the well, that's true.

1486
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,520
The neck protected.

1487
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,640
I believe this woman also was the model for Sonya in the video games.

1488
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,580
Whoa.

1489
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,300
Oh, geez.

1490
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,380
You're seeing the real characters in a little bit.

1491
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:33,740
Right.

1492
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,020
Yeah, there was a lot of there was crossover in,

1493
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,860
I think, with the movie and live show, some some other martial artists

1494
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,520
and some of the fight choreographers.

1495
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:43,840
Yeah.

1496
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,420
So that is the most famous clip that exists and probably will ever exist

1497
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,920
unless there's something particularly good in the show that hasn't surfaced yet.

1498
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,440
I was trying to find a copy of it on eBay or something,

1499
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,800
and there's a few like booklets like, you know, souvenir booklets from it or.

1500
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,400
Yeah.

1501
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,820
But I found this.

1502
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,980
I found them.

1503
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,460
Uh, let me try and find it.

1504
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,440
A headband from the show

1505
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
that someone is selling for over four thousand dollars.

1506
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,160
I don't know why they think they're going to get that.

1507
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:22,740
Hmm.

1508
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,920
That's just like the the per inch cost is

1509
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,220
pretty enormous.

1510
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,640
Also, shipping says 80 dollars.

1511
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,360
So I don't know if this is is this code for drugs?

1512
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,500
Is that is someone just selling drugs?

1513
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,120
This is some arbitrary item.

1514
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,020
Yeah.

1515
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,620
This exists to.

1516
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,460
Jean jacket with lightning shooting out from the collar.

1517
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,340
Yeah, like kind of awesome.

1518
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,160
Yeah, that we could wear.

1519
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,660
We could do that.

1520
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,040
What was the the other jean jacket we wanted to buy?

1521
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,800
The one from the parade.

1522
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,560
White magic, light magic, light magic.

1523
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,600
So we could have a range of different jean jackets from

1524
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,960
theme themed in.

1525
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,780
That's well, when we get to do live shows again and yeah, we all have different

1526
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,840
themes, jean jackets.

1527
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,200
Yeah, I think that will be very cool.

1528
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,920
It'll remind people of what they've been missing for these many months.

1529
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,100
I found a photo here of

1530
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,820
Kevin Bacon with the cast.

1531
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:35,140
Well, so the the six degrees of separation game

1532
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,040
ain't too hard with this one.

1533
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Right.

1534
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,980
And if you want, if you want this getting image, it's five hundred dollars

1535
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,220
for a large.

1536
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,080
That's another thing as well as video game prices remain high.

1537
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,800
Getty images prices remain very high.

1538
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,720
I don't know why they're such hot commodities.

1539
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1540
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,380
It's a small cost.

1541
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:56,600
Yeah.

1542
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,140
One seventy five.

1543
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:58,680
Right.

1544
01:07:59,200 --> 01:07:59,640
Yeah.

1545
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,100
Ron Galila runs the stock photo market.

1546
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,920
The manifest.

1547
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,580
Scott, he's OK.

1548
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,120
Go ahead.

1549
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,340
Well, you said you said you didn't know much about the game.

1550
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,320
Do you know a trend with the newer games?

1551
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,760
You know about downloadable content.

1552
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,480
Sure.

1553
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,700
You can pay an extra fee to get stuff like for a free game

1554
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,760
or app and yeah, yeah, it keeps going if you buy more.

1555
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,580
Yeah.

1556
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,520
And so like for console games, this is like,

1557
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,980
especially for fighting games, you can pay extra to get other fighters.

1558
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:39,480
So you can pay extra and you can get like the T-800 Terminator

1559
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,940
from Terminator Dark Fate or Robocop

1560
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,500
or The Joker or Spawn

1561
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,800
or Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

1562
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,280
Yeah, they have a lot of they've expanded recently.

1563
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,660
So you can do a fatality with the Joker in Mortal Kombat.

1564
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,000
Some of they have now they have all twisted fantasy has come true.

1565
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,220
I know you love the Joker and now you can really experience

1566
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,640
a lot of different Joker dying or Joker killing.

1567
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,480
There's one.

1568
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:17,860
Yeah.

1569
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,170
Well, as an edgelord, this is what I

1570
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:21,670
that's where I wish to do.

1571
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:22,130
Yeah.

1572
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:26,690
There's one where he puts like a bomb or it's a it's a jack in the box

1573
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:30,030
inside the body and then it shoots the spring

1574
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:33,690
knocking the person's head off through.

1575
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:34,710
Yeah.

1576
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,430
So that's pretty good.

1577
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:37,790
That's pretty edgy.

1578
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,330
It's pretty.

1579
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,470
I like the sound of that.

1580
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,770
Yeah, it's creative.

1581
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:47,190
Well, this all star armada of fighters, this is like

1582
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:50,530
bringing together all this great pop culture into one place.

1583
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:53,490
This is like Space Jam, a new legacy.

1584
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,990
Finally, well, that's all my favorite.

1585
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,650
I brought it is conveniently owned in one place is not other not

1586
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,010
no Disney or Paramount.

1587
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:09,950
Finally, this specifically owned properties are together.

1588
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:10,450
Yeah.

1589
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,010
And Mike's right.

1590
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:12,210
This is a Warner Brothers movie.

1591
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:15,870
So the Mortal Kombat movie will be dumped on HBO Max.

1592
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:18,770
And this is a good place where I would like to pitch

1593
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:21,710
some downloadable characters to add to Mortal Kombat.

1594
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:22,450
If hell, yeah.

1595
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:23,250
Yeah.

1596
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:23,750
Please.

1597
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:24,130
Yes.

1598
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,050
Since you mentioned the Joker, you know, it's

1599
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,790
the Mortal Kombat Joker is kind of generic.

1600
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,990
We talked about generic Joker on the Batman episode.

1601
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:32,390
Right.

1602
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,350
I would like the Jared Leto Joker in there.

1603
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,770
I want the tattoos.

1604
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:41,010
I want him mailing people, whatever rats or condoms or whatever.

1605
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,850
I want to see the Noid.

1606
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,910
I want to get the Noid in Mortal Kombat.

1607
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:46,570
Oh, wow.

1608
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:47,130
That's great.

1609
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,050
Sure.

1610
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,990
Do we know what's his finishing move?

1611
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:56,570
I think he gives you a pizza and then he knocks your head off

1612
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,050
so he can steal your pizza.

1613
01:10:59,110 --> 01:10:59,230
Mm hmm.

1614
01:10:59,490 --> 01:10:59,730
Yeah.

1615
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,810
You've been on the wiser and also did.

1616
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:02,750
Yes.

1617
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,510
There's a lot of knocking heads off.

1618
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,910
You can do who else?

1619
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,170
Tony Soprano.

1620
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,550
I think Tony Soprano.

1621
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:10,830
You're the universe.

1622
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,230
Yeah.

1623
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:11,730
That's great.

1624
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,750
What's his fatality?

1625
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,170
Um, OK, this is complicated.

1626
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:20,390
OK, there's an episode where him and Big Pussy are at a diner and

1627
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,550
Mr.

1628
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,730
Bomb and Saro gets a steak with fries and Tony gets

1629
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,310
like cottage cheese and tomatoes or something.

1630
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,610
And then he goes like, no, give me what he's having.

1631
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:35,390
So I think Tony does like a scorpion move where he goes like, I want

1632
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:36,870
I want him.

1633
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:41,130
And then he he pulls you over and he begins to eat you.

1634
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,130
I you know, that makes me think maybe they can add a different type of it.

1635
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:48,210
And it's not a fatality or they have Scott, by the way, they have baby.

1636
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:49,290
They had baby realities.

1637
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,270
I don't know if they have that anymore.

1638
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,810
Will you turn your opponent into a baby?

1639
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,610
Oh, that exists.

1640
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:54,130
Friendships.

1641
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,970
Maybe there's like a serve him.

1642
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,850
And then you get to just give them a meal at the end of the fight.

1643
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,130
That's good.

1644
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,190
That's a good one for my next one.

1645
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:04,170
Captain Crunch.

1646
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,630
Oh, yeah.

1647
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,230
I would love to have it in there.

1648
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,130
Flo, the progressive lady, Stephanie Courtney.

1649
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:12,750
Sure.

1650
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,530
American maniac recently deceased G Gordon Liddy.

1651
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,770
Oh, you got to go out here.

1652
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:20,770
Imagine what's weird.

1653
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,590
G Gordon Liddy's finishing move.

1654
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:23,130
Yeah.

1655
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,930
Well, I can I can pitch on that.

1656
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:26,770
Yeah, yeah.

1657
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:26,990
Yeah.

1658
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:31,250
He obviously has to break in somewhere like he did at Watergate

1659
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,610
into your rib cage.

1660
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,410
He breaks into your rib cage and then he's unrepentant about it

1661
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,170
because it was all in service to Nixon.

1662
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,770
And he has like a disembodied, like kind of a ghostly Nixon

1663
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,030
laughs above the arena or whatever.

1664
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:47,550
Right.

1665
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,050
And then it also can be scattered.

1666
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,590
I don't know if you're aware of this, but G Gordon Liddy had a calendar

1667
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:55,030
he would put out where women in bathing suits would have guns.

1668
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:56,670
Really?

1669
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:57,610
Why?

1670
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:01,730
That's what he that was just a nice thing he did for the world.

1671
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:06,390
And I'm trying to think, I think it was like last year

1672
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,490
he was doing this.

1673
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,670
I don't know if he had stopped.

1674
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,270
I think he probably stopped recently.

1675
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,150
I had seen a tweet or a couple of tweets about this.

1676
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,730
I believe the calendars were called stacked and packed.

1677
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:17,390
Yes.

1678
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,270
They all had submachine guns.

1679
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,530
Yeah, that's a pretty good fatality.

1680
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,570
Like that is show up and open fire.

1681
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:24,370
Mm hmm.

1682
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,910
Stacked and packed.

1683
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:26,610
Right.

1684
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,630
You got liddyed.

1685
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:34,390
And then my last character is Major Biden, the dog.

1686
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:42,290
Well, they got to work out a licensing deal with Warner Brothers, I guess.

1687
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,790
But they're probably they're probably all ears, you know.

1688
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,990
Yeah.

1689
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,390
But can he do this well in office?

1690
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,290
I mean, Obama had to wait to make the Netflix deal till he was out.

1691
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:53,250
But maybe the dog can be in the game now.

1692
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:54,730
Yeah, yeah.

1693
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,650
The dogs for they had those rules apply to the president, not the dog.

1694
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,050
Yeah.

1695
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,010
Yeah.

1696
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,410
What do we know about Major?

1697
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:01,910
Is he a rescue?

1698
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,830
He's a rescue and they're often very nervous.

1699
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,250
Yeah.

1700
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,370
And Major has bitten two people at this point, I believe.

1701
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:09,970
Yes, they're working with him.

1702
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,010
They're working with him.

1703
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:14,690
They have Cesar Millan for a newspaper.

1704
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,630
He has Cesar Millan.

1705
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,670
Like, what do you do about it?

1706
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,610
Like, no, you just need to acclimate him to new places, you know?

1707
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,330
Mm hmm.

1708
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:21,070
Huh.

1709
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,950
So what?

1710
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,530
Well, then, I don't know.

1711
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,010
Is it can he just bite people?

1712
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:28,810
It's something that we don't want Major to be doing anymore.

1713
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,850
What's what?

1714
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,270
I don't know.

1715
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:33,710
What could Joe teach him?

1716
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,390
What would Joe's finishing move be?

1717
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,970
That's a good question.

1718
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,170
I certainly go ahead.

1719
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,950
Go ahead.

1720
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:44,310
I think Joe just starts telling you the corn pop story.

1721
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:48,390
And while you're distracted, Major comes up behind you and bites your butt,

1722
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,050
but your head off.

1723
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,930
Yeah.

1724
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:53,890
Like a yarn.

1725
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:55,550
Biden's like thing.

1726
01:14:55,550 --> 01:15:00,590
He's like, it's a yarn ality, like a spin spinning, an old yarn ality

1727
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,690
or something where he just gives you five minutes of a story.

1728
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,430
And your head falls off.

1729
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:11,690
Just from like your your your neck just gives up

1730
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,830
keeping your head sturdy.

1731
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:14,770
Yeah, you can't.

1732
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,370
Bails on the responsibility.

1733
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,150
You tilt back.

1734
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,310
Hey, man, how come you can't find Moxie soda anymore?

1735
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,870
And then you just explode.

1736
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,810
Your brain cannot follow all the threads.

1737
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:26,930
It's like it just quit.

1738
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:31,330
Your brain quits because there's so many directions that the story is gone.

1739
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,050
You don't know where he's he's trying to go with it.

1740
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:36,630
So that's it's just too much.

1741
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:39,690
And yeah, well, Major and Joe,

1742
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,190
that's a great fatality duo.

1743
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:47,970
Get them in there, get them in the new pack and send it out on the road again.

1744
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:52,510
And I guess, I mean, obviously, if they were to do this again,

1745
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,990
it would have to be bloody.

1746
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,430
But why even do it?

1747
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,970
I think kids now can handle it.

1748
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,510
This isn't a fire.

1749
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,050
This isn't a hot button controversy.

1750
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:06,650
Joe Lieberman isn't having a hearing about the violence in this anymore.

1751
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,130
So do whatever you want.

1752
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,990
We should have it should be like Gallagher, where you show up with tarps

1753
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:15,970
and you know there's going to be a lot of blood.

1754
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,270
Spray.

1755
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:19,190
I mean, there's yeah, I'm I'm that's that's a good idea.

1756
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:22,710
I do think just maybe have saw if you're not going to if you're not going to do

1757
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,850
that, just we need songs, we need all the characters to have songs.

1758
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,750
Yeah.

1759
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,670
And I think there's there's a character, Scott,

1760
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,770
I think you'll like this character from the movie and the character's name is Goro.

1761
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,150
Does that mean anything to you?

1762
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,390
I've come across it in a little bit of research.

1763
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:40,950
Yeah, but I don't know much about.

1764
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,390
And have you ever seen what he looks like in the movie?

1765
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,730
No, let's see Goro.

1766
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,990
OK, because I think you're going to really like Goro.

1767
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,330
Yeah, I think you're going to like Goro.

1768
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,830
These are some of the monster characters.

1769
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:51,050
Yeah.

1770
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,850
Is he going to be a scary clown or something?

1771
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:53,910
Am I being set up?

1772
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:55,550
No, no, he's not a clown.

1773
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:58,710
No, by the way, I just said it and it sounded like I'm setting you up for a clown.

1774
01:16:58,810 --> 01:16:59,530
No, no, I swear.

1775
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,410
But no, he's not a clown.

1776
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:01,410
He's like a robot.

1777
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,230
He's like a here.

1778
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:03,770
I'll show you.

1779
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:06,150
They he's like a monster with with multiple arms.

1780
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,070
He's like four arms.

1781
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,910
But the way they did him in the movie, he is like a animatronic

1782
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,690
and he is goofy as hell.

1783
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,550
Here, this is where Goro gets punched in the nuts.

1784
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,670
So that's I mean, first of all, that's the reason why you should watch the movie.

1785
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:39,150
But I think Goro at that point should sort of like, you know, the giant is now has a

1786
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:41,970
beautiful, like very high octave voice.

1787
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:46,290
And he sings about how this fighting, you know, is something that he was born into and

1788
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:50,630
how he doesn't need it anymore and how it's a positive message for kids and that they

1789
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:54,490
should just take the lesson that your goals are achievable.

1790
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:55,530
You know, you watch the movie and you're like, oh, I'm going to be a clown.

1791
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,430
You watch me get hit in the nuts and you watched a bunch of people dance fight and now anything is possible.

1792
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,350
What's the I'm trying to think of like the most plaintive song there is.

1793
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:11,190
And maybe it's I dream to dream from Les Miserables, but it's my my my nuts.

1794
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,870
Just my nuts got punched.

1795
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:20,190
My my nuts got punched just right now.

1796
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,050
Yeah, or something.

1797
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:23,190
Yeah, I think that's good.

1798
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:24,890
I think that's a good framework for the song.

1799
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:26,550
Yeah, yeah.

1800
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:30,410
And kids, your dreams, they are achievable.

1801
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:39,590
You'll go home and accomplish whatever you want and get good things in your life.

1802
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:44,190
That natural phrase that the man said on the TV show.

1803
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:50,110
Yes, I think I think a Tony would be one if it all culminates in this.

1804
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,830
So, yeah, bring it back.

1805
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:59,650
Goro nut punchings and just to bring it back to the beginning, if I could share the screen,

1806
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:04,750
a strand that we all forgot about and probably wish that we kept forgetting about.

1807
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:09,470
There is a ton of pornography of Jeffrey the giraffe.

1808
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:10,370
Oh, my God.

1809
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,010
He's our.

1810
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,750
Oh, it's awful.

1811
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:20,010
The one that jumps out at me is this one where apparently there's like a three way

1812
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:28,570
being headed for between Jeffrey the giraffe, Tony the tiger from Frosted Flakes and Scooby

1813
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,170
Dooby Doo.

1814
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:30,390
Oh, my God.

1815
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:32,870
Come on, it's going to be great.

1816
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,710
Scooby Dooby Doo.

1817
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:39,010
And everyone has big, colorful, hard boners.

1818
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,850
This is first of all, this is unethical because Scooby Doo is like a regular dog.

1819
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:47,970
And Tony and Jeffrey are like half man, half animal.

1820
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,150
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1821
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:56,930
Yeah, only if you're a hybrid, you can mix, I think, and it's less weird, but a pure animal.

1822
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,130
Wow, this is just awful.

1823
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,630
Yeah, then it then it happens.

1824
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,570
Oh, no.

1825
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:03,850
All right.

1826
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,050
I won't I won't I won't scan down.

1827
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:12,590
But yeah, disarming and alarming in every style of Jeffrey, like kind of the more clip

1828
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,710
already version of him.

1829
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:22,330
Yeah, yeah, some very imaginative notions about what his what his penis might look like.

1830
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:30,570
So obviously, get them all into in this expansion pack, get Jeffrey, get get Tony and get Scooby

1831
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:36,530
Do and their their fatality, I guess, is swinging their hard boners around.

1832
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:42,530
And you get to make sure to post that in my notes app or my my insta paper app.

1833
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,410
We're not going to post that publicly, but I'll take that.

1834
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,910
Yeah, yeah.

1835
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,050
So yeah, that's for the podcast, right?

1836
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:51,610
Only fans.

1837
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,710
But you're on the podcast, right?

1838
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:57,270
Patreon, which you survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

1839
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:03,530
Keep it tuned here where I promise we won't talk about Jeffrey the giraffe's penis again.

1840
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:07,610
That is if there's no better lure to get you to stay subscribed.

1841
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,410
I think that's a pretty good one.

1842
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:12,170
Look, I hated that, but I won't make that promise.

1843
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:14,210
It's true.

1844
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:18,170
Let me just say that we don't know where where conversations go.

1845
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:20,790
And should we need to talk about it?

1846
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,970
Yeah.

1847
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,290
Let's not take it off the table.

1848
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:22,510
Yeah.

1849
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,170
I just don't want to get in a court case or something.

1850
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:30,150
He says you made a vow on the show and then didn't abide by it.

1851
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:31,690
Yeah, yeah.

1852
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,610
OK, so yeah.

1853
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:33,890
All right.

1854
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,910
Well, then there you go.

1855
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,590
Jeff for the direct penis might come up again.

1856
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,290
And it's really the mystery that you're paying for.

1857
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:41,170
So keep it tuned right here.

1858
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,010
Three bonus episodes every month.

1859
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,410
And yeah,

1860
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,610
Mortal Kombat.

1861
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,270
Well, how do you finish an episode?

1862
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,370
What would be the way they would end the game?

1863
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,910
Well, if you end the game with a murder.

1864
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:57,930
Hmm.

1865
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,090
Well, it's we're still over friendship.

1866
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,290
We can do friendships.

1867
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,510
Oh, let's do friendship.

1868
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:06,610
We could do it because we'd each have our own special friendship.

1869
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:10,050
So we could figure out what our character in the Mortal Kombat

1870
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,070
would do as a friendship.

1871
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:15,250
You know, what would be the nice thing you would offer your opponent

1872
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,170
after you've beaten them?

1873
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,630
Sure, sure.

1874
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:23,090
Well, here's here's two very buttery Chardonnays for the both of you.

1875
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:27,170
I would I would I would bring gelatoni.

1876
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,810
I would pull gelatoni out my gelatoni plush, which is the cat.

1877
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:33,190
Italian painter cat from the Duffy verse.

1878
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:37,090
And I would have gelatoni, give them a big hug.

1879
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,170
And that would be my friendship.

1880
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:40,550
That's beautiful.

1881
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,310
And Jason,

1882
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:46,330
I would offer a freshly grilled hot dog and ask what you would like on.

1883
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,950
How do you want this prepared?

1884
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,870
What condiments would you like?

1885
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,550
Chili and cheese, you know.

1886
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:55,250
And if and if I had a fatality, I would pull someone across a counter.

1887
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:58,370
And kick them very hard in the head.

1888
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:00,090
That's how I would do it.

1889
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:02,030
Then I would knock their head off with the.

1890
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,830
Great.

1891
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:03,370
Beautiful.

1892
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,470
Everyone pursue your own friendships and fatalities,

1893
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,170
and we'll talk to you next time.

1894
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:09,750
Goodbye.
