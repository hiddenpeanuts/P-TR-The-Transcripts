1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,760
The following haunt cast contains the excitement of television show activations, toy buying

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,400
bots and a giant pumpkin mere feet away from slightly discounted shoes and pants.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Get in the car at a safe distance and enjoy drive through haunts on haunt cast the fright.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Welcome to haunt cast the fright, a haunt cast so scary that when you tell your non-theme

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,860
park people about how long our episodes are they scream in terror.

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,280
My name is usually Mike Carlson, but this month's it is Spike Narleson.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Jason.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,640
Do you change it?

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I changed it again.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,120
It's been a ballpark that yeah, I saw it.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,160
It's been some controversial ones this month, but that's I think non-controversial.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
That's just fun Halloween.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Joining me as always, usually Jason Sheridan this month.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,800
This month, Jack O'Lantern slime it in very consistent, very good Halloween name.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I yeah, I wrote it down so I would remember.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Thanks.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
I worked on it for a while.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,880
I was worried if I just went with Jack O'Lantern, Jason, that's like a fucking improv warm up

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
nonsense.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
I like that too though.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
I'll be honest.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
I like that too.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Or Jason Jack O'Lantern.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,280
I think it works either way.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Joining also us as always, usually Scott Gardner.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, I was thinking if we're all kind of experimenting, like what is the rule dictating

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,040
that we'd has to reflect our real name in some way?

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,400
Because I'm Scott all the time.

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,560
And if I was just something similar to Scott, what's preventing me from just being Rick

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Zombieberg?

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,760
I just want to change it up.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
There's nothing preventing it.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,240
I think that is sort of the fun.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
It sounds a little like it.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
So it's like a version of you.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,920
But if you want to do a whole new persona, I think that's good.

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Yeah, I think so.

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm just, I don't know, Rick is a cool name.

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,000
That's a name I'd like to have every, just for a little bit.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,840
And it's not a parody of anything.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,600
I don't know what the non-Halloween version of Rick Zombieberg is.

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,240
Maybe it's like Zellberg or something, but it doesn't matter.

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm Rick Zombieberg from now on because I'm sick of my own initials.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
That's fine.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,160
What if I just go by Ice Pick from now on?

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Okay.

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Hell yeah.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
That's so cool.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,400
My name is Ice Pick now.

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
That's what would call me that for the rest of the month.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
And maybe forever.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
We've got to break out of these rules.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,920
Like, what is this unspoken that it has to be a pun about your, like, let's go wild.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,400
Let's go hog wild.

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,200
That could be, I don't want to say what Jason's is, but if Jason's was hog wild.

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,520
Hog wild is pretty good.

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,020
I was going to pitch Mr. Murder.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,960
Is that better or worse than hog wild?

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Lateral?

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,120
I mean, they're both, they both have their good points, I think.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,560
There's both big reasons to like those.

65
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,760
It's still up to you to choose ultimately.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
That's what we're doing.

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,680
With me embracing being Rick Zombie Berg, it's all about grabbing the reins of a new

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
persona.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,840
How about Dr. Murderhog?

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I like that.

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Hell yeah.

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
That's kind of best of both worlds.

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
And I had a doctor in too.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,400
So you're like, you have like a lab coat that's covered in blood.

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
And respect.

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Yes.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,680
The most, the scariest thing you can have on your coat.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
That's right.

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Sorry.

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Dr. Murderhog.

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Dr. Murderhog.

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
That's good.

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Yeah, I think anything.

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, if we can remember selectively through the episode, you know, we're going to default

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,640
to what our regular names are, but it'd be nice to, you know, you know, we're talking

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,440
about like drive through haunts and, and, well, the former Jason, I went, went and tried

89
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
one.

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,640
But if I was like, no doctor, how was it, was there like a big backup?

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,560
Because it's, you know, like, was it, how many people were there?

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
I mean, I mean, did you have a good time, doctor?

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Yes, I did.

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
I did.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
I was a little concerned at first.

96
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,600
They certainly had the place markers for like, oh, if it's running long, they even add like

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
from this point, 50 minutes.

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Yeah, that feels good.

99
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
That feels right.

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Mm hmm.

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Ice pick.

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,040
Does that seem like something you could make your way through?

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah, it does sound like that.

104
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,120
Oh, wait a minute.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
Now I have a different voice.

106
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
The voice changed entirely.

107
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Wow.

108
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah, no, but that feels good.

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
Being called ice pick feels good and it makes me feel different.

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,200
Tossing it away so casually.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Yeah.

112
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Just like, yeah.

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Yeah.

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,760
And I've actually forgotten your name, so tell me what it is.

115
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Rick Zombieberg.

116
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
That's right, of course.

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,280
I'll write it down so I don't forget it.

118
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,400
OK, yeah, and Rick, you were just talking about it.

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
You're talking about your whole, this whole Zombieberg family and what you were doing.

120
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
How did that go?

121
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
How was that?

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Oh, yeah.

123
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,840
Well, there's so many of us by the time you get the Zombieberg cousins out and the, you

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,360
know, some people are only, you know, it's a hyphenate, you know, Zombieberg and Ghostlington.

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,800
So you get the Zombiebergs out and the Zombieberg Ghostlingtons.

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,000
So, you know, you're talking 50 people come into your Halloweens usually.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,840
But, you know, now it's all going to be on Zoom.

128
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,400
So it's all it's all fucked.

129
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Yeah, I hear that.

130
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah.

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Well, that's good.

132
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
That feels seamless.

133
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,200
I like I'm loving this new persona.

134
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,960
It's injecting some life into this Halloween season, which, as we've said, is, you know,

135
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,440
is hampered by the current state of affairs.

136
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,000
And what we're here to talk about is Halloween experiences that you can do and that we went

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,840
and did in the Los Angeles area.

138
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,680
But there's stuff all over the country you can do.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,480
I like that we're trying to break out and, you know, make something happen in a drive-through

140
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,840
fashion or a virtual fashion.

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,920
I applaud the creativity on the parts of everyone doing these kinds of things.

142
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,960
Yes, it's yeah, they're making the best of a bad situation.

143
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,680
And I think, you know, there's a variety of these things, which is nice, too.

144
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
I think a lot of people are doing a version of this.

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
I think so.

146
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,040
And I think we've all like we all did something pretty, pretty different.

147
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,560
As fun as some of what we've done here in 2020 is, I think it can't help but make you

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,120
nostalgic for Halloween's gone by more classic Halloween's like when you were a kid and when

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
you could actually do the trick or treating.

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:51,520
And I am more now than ever incredibly nostalgic for my favorite Halloween, which was in 1994

151
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,320
on which Halloween I got to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,640
This was a thread left open months ago.

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,800
This was discussed deep into our longest episode.

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,000
It was buried under minutes and minutes of content in our episode about The Tonight Show

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,120
Ride, which is available on the Patreon.

156
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,600
So if you didn't hear it there, I basically I had a family friend who worked in the music

157
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,040
department on the Carson and then the Leno Tonight Show.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,360
And there was a sketch going on and I was obsessed with the fact that I knew somebody

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,600
worked at that show was mind blowing to me.

160
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,840
And I could go like be in a bit.

161
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,160
I felt so much like Bart on the Krusty Show in the what birth I didn't do it situation.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Now, it didn't go that far because Bart had a line.

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,360
I was just one of many, many trick or treaters.

164
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,360
And I'm wearing a mask so you can't tell it's me.

165
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,120
I'm wearing a Richard Nixon mask, which I may have said in the other episode.

166
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,240
I thought, well, maybe Jay will appreciate that as he is a political setterist.

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,880
A very sophisticated one.

168
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,160
So we know if only we had him now to sort through the ins and outs of this complex situation

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,880
we're currently in.

171
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Anyway, all of this is just to say, you know, like I'm not going to play a clip of it because

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,640
it's just lengthy.

173
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:29,240
And, you know, you basically just see a Nixon in the mix as the sketch goes on, including

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,600
the mainly starring health guru, Susan Powder, who is famous, of course, for her catchphrase,

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
stop the insanity.

176
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,720
As I may have said in the other episode, none of this was explained to me, like what it

177
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,200
was going to be.

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
It was just like, okay, go out there.

179
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,240
Like there was never a rehearsal.

180
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,800
This was never run, nor did it need to be.

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,640
That was, you know, they did the right amount of preparation and not overthinking.

182
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,200
So all this to say, that clip will be available on our Twitter so you can watch it.

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,160
And I'll make sure to circle which one I am, just so you know, because there'd be no other

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,640
way to know.

185
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:14,360
But in finding the tape, I had an interesting discovery because I was like, well, what was

186
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,960
the rest of this episode?

187
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,720
Like, what was a, like, I don't think a lot of people have like a tape of a Leno episode

188
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,320
in general from that era from 94.

189
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,120
And this was a jam packed episode because there was a remote done by Bill Maher, who

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,720
was a correspondent who was reporting from Tiny Tim's wedding.

191
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Do we, I don't even, I'm not sure I even know how to explain who Tiny Tim was.

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,160
Yeah.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, like a musician fringe character type guy.

194
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,200
He had a novelty song guy.

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Yeah, he had an interesting voice.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
He was an eccentric.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,400
Yeah.

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know there.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,480
Is that it?

200
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
Is that about as good?

201
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,400
I think so.

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,320
He was famous for getting married on the Carson Tonight Show and then he was like, they

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,040
seemingly tried to do it again, but very half-assed just with these Bill Maher check-ins.

204
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,320
So that's going on.

205
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,920
I remember being in the hallway and passing by Richard Simmons at some point, wearing

206
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,800
just full exactly the Richard Simmons wardrobe that you'd want to see.

207
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,560
So I thought that was really cool.

208
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,200
But then I was trying to remember like, who was the musical guest?

209
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,640
Because I remember thinking like, oh, well, what if then the show keeps going and then

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
I basically get to see like a concert?

211
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,160
What if the musical guest is one of the people I really like?

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,000
What if it's like a cool band like Hammer or the Beach Boys, the two music acts that

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,040
I liked at the time?

214
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,400
And then I remember being disappointed like, oh, it's this sucks.

215
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,680
It's like a grown-up band.

216
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,920
It's a boring adult band.

217
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,640
And I never knew what it was until rewatching the tape.

218
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,440
The band in this episode was Big Star.

219
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,840
What?

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:57,980
Yes.

221
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,480
What?

222
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,460
Beloved Colts, like one of the most respected bands in history.

223
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,060
I mean, it was this like reformed version.

224
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,460
Right.

225
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,500
Big Star was Alex Chilton and a guy with Bell was the other guy.

226
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,260
I don't know why it's not coming to me.

227
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,700
It was it was Alex Chilton and then other people like hired guns.

228
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,060
I think Chris Bell was the guy who was in the band, but he died.

229
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,660
He died before 1994.

230
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,180
Oh, gotcha.

231
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,420
Okay.

232
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,980
Okay.

233
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,300
Wait, in that year where this was happening?

234
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,580
No, he died before 1994.

235
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:29,900
Sorry.

236
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,700
Oh, before 94.

237
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,020
Okay.

238
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,940
He died in I'm looking it up now, 78.

239
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,060
Oh, gee.

240
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,380
Okay.

241
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,860
Long ago.

242
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,140
Yeah.

243
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,460
Anyway, this just lingered in my head is like I wish that band wasn't so boring.

244
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,460
And now I've realized it's like one of the most revered, like, you know, quietly adored

245
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,940
bands in history and they were like so in this room at this time, like in the same room,

246
00:11:52,940 --> 00:12:00,140
Halloween 94, Jay Leno, Matthew Broderick was there, Jennifer Tilly and Richard Simmons,

247
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,180
Alex Chilton and a nine year old Scott Gardner and a Nixon mask.

248
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,820
Wow.

249
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,780
That's wild.

250
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,740
Could not believe what song did the big star play?

251
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,900
They did in the street.

252
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,780
Oh, yeah.

253
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,660
Not too long after became the theme to that 70s show as covered by cheap trick.

254
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,260
So yeah, iconic song.

255
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,420
Like they barely performed live ever.

256
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,420
This is going to be one of the only television appearances of big star.

257
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm not even.

258
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,140
Yeah.

259
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm not even that up on like where they went sort of after they stopped putting stuff out.

260
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,660
So I'm surprised.

261
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,260
I don't even know the timeline of like why they were on the tonight show in 1994.

262
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,860
What was going on at the time?

263
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,220
I think there was a there was a live album they were promoting or something.

264
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,060
That could have also just been like, oh, the albums are finally on CD because I was like,

265
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,620
wait, were the albums even at print 94?

266
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,100
That's true.

267
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,340
A lot of people, a lot of bands did perform in that context, like the reissue of such.

268
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,060
Right.

269
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,780
Interesting.

270
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,180
Wow.

271
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,620
So anyway.

272
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,540
I mean, it wasn't like you were supposed to know, like get excited about Alex Chilton at the time.

273
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,860
No, and I was I was insufferable enough as a 17 year old talking about Alex Chilton,

274
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,380
let alone if I was nine, I mean, I would have been the worst.

275
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,660
I as a nine year old who brought a Richard Nixon costume to a TV show.

276
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,220
And then like I have this other memory of like this is an exciting time for me.

277
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,380
This was I must have gotten the bug to be in in media because right around the same time,

278
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,940
it was right after this, like in the same week, I went to a recording studio

279
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,900
to record a Christmas album with my boy choir.

280
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:48,460
The St. Melchurch boy choir.

281
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,020
And we did, you know, mostly standards for, you know, kind of, you know,

282
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,380
like ring Christmas bells.

283
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,340
My really really.

284
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,700
And I remember that I wore a big old like didn't fit me tonight show hat

285
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,100
to the record.

286
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,460
So I'm feeling like so high on my own shit.

287
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,220
I've just been on the Leno tonight show.

288
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,140
Now I'm recording my album and I walked into it and I was not friends with anyone else in

289
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,860
the boy choir.

290
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,300
We did not get along.

291
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,380
And some kid is like, where'd you get that hat?

292
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,460
And I was like, I was on the show and he was like, no, you weren't.

293
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,380
And that was the end.

294
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,420
And I didn't argue back because I was too scared to.

295
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,100
Oh, wow.

296
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,180
You said no, you weren't.

297
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,780
You were like, yeah, you're right.

298
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,060
Yeah, he's probably right.

299
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,340
He's bigger than me.

300
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,840
Maybe.

301
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,580
Never mind.

302
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,420
Actually, he's more confident than me.

303
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,140
He's much shorter, but extremely confident.

304
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,580
So he's probably right.

305
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,260
I've apologized a million times for doing that.

306
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,980
It's just whenever we get in a tiff, I see that guy that boy choir.

307
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm looking at you in my zoom window like I bet Jason doesn't believe I was on a tonight show.

308
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,600
Prove it.

309
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,280
I will.

310
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,820
Show the hat.

311
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,260
Putting this tape on.

312
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,580
And you might think that I'm just going to circle an arbitrary kid in a Nixon mask, but it was me.

313
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,940
He'll turn and you'll see Scott Brown hair and you'll know.

314
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,100
Do you think if you had like, we're like, well, yeah, I walked by Alex Chilton.

315
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,900
He was like, whoa.

316
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,140
No kidding.

317
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,940
That's one of the guys.

318
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,420
Oh, man.

319
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,860
The guy saying the letter.

320
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,420
Boy, he's one of the guys who made me want to get into recording.

321
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,220
That's why I'm in this studio to cut Merry Christmas from the St. Mel's boy choir.

322
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,260
That would have fixed it, I think.

323
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,180
Would have shut everyone up if only I knew.

324
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,140
So I failed.

325
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,260
My lack of musical knowledge at nine failed me.

326
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,940
I'll try to post that whole album, too.

327
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,740
I'll try to do it in a lossless format like a flack, like an FLAC.

328
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,220
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,420
Highest quality.

330
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,340
You could play it on Neil Young's Pono.

331
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,660
That would be like the version.

332
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,900
Neil Young's short lived.

333
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,340
I'll try to get a hold of him.

334
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,580
If I can get Neil on the line just to oversee the fidelity of it.

335
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,740
I have a memory about recording that Christmas album also, which is that

336
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,940
when it began, we were promised $100 each and a CD of the album.

337
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,580
And it ended up being $25 in a tape.

338
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,260
That prepared you for a career in media better than anything else.

339
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,980
Yeah, really.

340
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,260
All was contained in those couple months, wasn't it?

341
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,620
And I got into it anyway.

342
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,900
And I had to because when I got hit by those lights and I got to share

343
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,500
the stage with Susan Powder herself, I had to keep going.

344
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,740
So anyway, that'll all be a video on the Twitter and the album,

345
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,780
we got to wait till Christmas.

346
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,380
We got Halloween to get through first.

347
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,580
Oh, man, you have the album.

348
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,220
Oh, sure.

349
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,140
The album's around.

350
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,620
Yeah, yeah.

351
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,580
I could scan the cover also and try to prove that one of the blurry

352
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,140
dots in the red robes is me.

353
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,140
Could you do a remix to of it maybe for Christmas, like an EDM style remix?

354
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,500
Maybe so.

355
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,420
That depends.

356
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,740
I can't promise how in tempo Bill the piano player was.

357
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,940
I don't know that you could set a metronome to it.

358
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,340
I see.

359
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,020
But I'll bring it into garage.

360
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,140
If I got to cut it up, I can do that.

361
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,460
All right.

362
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,340
Well, that's exciting.

363
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,140
That's a good tease.

364
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,260
Yeah.

365
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah.

366
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,900
Yeah.

367
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,700
I knew I was playing the long game.

368
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,340
The audience for these things wasn't there then, but I knew someday I'm going

369
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,180
to accrue a rabid podcast audience that is going to really want to hear my falsetto

370
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,540
on Christmas album.

371
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,140
Wow.

372
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,460
So did you look at that Big Star performance on YouTube at all?

373
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,660
It is.

374
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:55,900
Yeah.

375
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,220
Yeah.

376
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,900
So you can just watch that.

377
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm not going to post that for you, but you can watch Leno introduce.

378
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,660
Yeah.

379
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,700
And so, yeah, two of the greats in the same...

380
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,620
Alex Chilton rocking one of his classic songs and me rocking one of the best masks

381
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,820
ever worn by a child.

382
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,580
Man, if only you had wandered out on the stage as Nixon and gun backup vocals on in the street.

383
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:35,420
It would have been the soy bomb of its day.

384
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,060
This episode is going to need...

385
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,180
Boy, anyone who doesn't remember the 90s well is going to need a glossary to recall

386
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,140
the Big Star and soy bomb.

387
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,460
Yeah.

388
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,860
These references, we apologize to the younger listeners.

389
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,860
But go check out...

390
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,620
Check out Big Star and check out Chris Bell's I Am the Cosmos solo album too.

391
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,220
I've never really listened to it because I'm afraid it would make me too sad.

392
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,860
Oh my God.

393
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,420
It sounds very sad.

394
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,260
I Am the Cosmos is the saddest song you will ever hear.

395
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,900
It is truly like you put headphones on and it is the sound of a heart breaking.

396
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,660
And I don't know if there's any song that I think is sadder than that.

397
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,740
Yeah.

398
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,700
I mean, because I've...

399
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Some of those big stars like Kangaroo, it's very, very morose.

400
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,020
You're really being a state.

401
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,100
That seems like too hard of a drug.

402
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,740
Oh my God.

403
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,700
It's been this year.

404
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,940
Yeah.

405
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,140
Those albums are pretty good, but yeah, 13 might make you a little too introspective for quarantine time.

406
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,980
13 though is like a fun bop compared to I Am the Cosmos.

407
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,340
Yeah, that's a little...

408
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,740
It's a little uplifting.

409
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,460
Yeah.

410
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,020
Yeah.

411
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,900
It's sweet and nostalgic and makes it sad, but certainly like, oh my God, I Am the Cosmos.

412
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,100
It's great.

413
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,500
Anyway.

414
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,100
This episode every year is normally titled Mike loves haunts, but this year it is...

415
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,020
It just gets longer and longer of like the boys love appropriate,

416
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,500
safe Halloween experiences and also are losing their minds.

417
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,780
Have some things to say about Big Star and 24, 26.

418
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,660
Is that right?

419
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,540
Is that math right?

420
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,620
26 year old tonight show episodes?

421
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,620
Yeah, but only the ones I'm on.

422
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,420
I mean, I'll watch some old tonight shows definitely in other contexts.

423
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,140
I've spent a lot of...

424
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,220
I've spent the last couple of weeks watching a lot of 90s MTV movie awards also.

425
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,620
So yeah, I'm off the deep end.

426
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,300
Just audience, be glad that Scott didn't find an organic way for us to talk about the rumor

427
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:52,860
of McCartney releasing McCartney 3 in December, the long awaited follow up to McCartney 2 from 1980.

428
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah, because then we're in three hour territory.

429
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,100
Yeah.

430
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,620
We're never getting out of here.

431
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,820
But to viewers back here, let's get out of here.

432
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,540
Let's get out of here.

433
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,260
Let's get out of here.

434
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,900
Let's get out of here.

435
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,700
Let's get out of here.

436
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,660
Let's get out of here.

437
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,300
Let's get out of here.

438
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,940
Let's get out of here.

439
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,420
Back here.

440
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,900
Let's get out of Halloween 94 and we'll be back to Christmas 94 soon for the boy choir.

441
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,500
But Halloween 2020, we're stuck.

442
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
We got to stay distant.

443
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,060
We got to stay in our cars.

444
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,860
What did we do?

445
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,300
How did we overcome this?

446
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,860
What did we...

447
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,780
How did we all get into the Halloween spirit?

448
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,740
I genuinely don't...

449
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,020
I kind of know what Jason did.

450
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,900
Mike, I don't know.

451
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,740
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,580
Icepick, I don't know.

453
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,820
Doctor, I'm curious your thoughts about the drive through.

454
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,660
How do we get into it?

455
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,140
Well, I think I'll start with mine.

456
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,700
So there are a variety of things we were talking about that different places are doing.

457
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Varying levels of scares, varying levels of production.

458
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,540
I think everyone's doing it their own way.

459
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,220
I saw Downtown LA has...

460
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,380
And I forget the name of it, but they have a more specific family-focused thing where

461
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,940
they still hand out a bag of candy.

462
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,180
I'm not sure if they do it in the way that Taco Bell does the COVID theater of

463
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,540
having a rubbermaid.

464
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,860
They put the bag in and hand it to you through the window,

465
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,580
which is COVID theater in my estimation.

466
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,140
But they have something like that, I believe.

467
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,300
So everyone's being creative.

468
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,500
Everyone's doing their best.

469
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,060
And I was looking through stuff to do.

470
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,060
And I will say upfront, I should have done something scarier.

471
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,820
Because I...

472
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:40,140
Look, I'm the toughest one of the three of us when it comes to haunts, okay?

473
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,300
Not in everything else, but haunts, I'm the toughest guy.

474
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,620
And you have to acknowledge my toughness when it comes to going through haunts.

475
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,100
And my love of haunts.

476
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,380
Ice Pick loves haunts.

477
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,860
And the Haunted Hayride...

478
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,700
Now, maybe I was trying to look for an excuse, but the Haunted Hayride is supposedly scary.

479
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,740
They usually do it at Griffith Park and they're doing it in, I believe, San Dimas?

480
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,220
Yes.

481
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,740
Yeah, by the dusty raging waters.

482
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,940
By the shuttered, for now, raging waters unused this summer.

483
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,540
Oh, and Ted's hometown?

484
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,780
In hindsight, I think that probably should have been the thing I did.

485
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,300
But it was 90 minutes away.

486
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,500
And I will say the idea of getting scared of my car did scare me a little bit.

487
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,660
That seems a little more scary for some reason than having just a teen jump out at you from

488
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,460
behind a corner.

489
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,780
You think it's more scary?

490
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,060
Yes, I do think it's more scary.

491
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,620
I would rather be...

492
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,660
I think it's less.

493
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:37,980
Really?

494
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,380
Because I would rather be walking through, have an ability to move and react.

495
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,020
There's something about it if it's like, I think there's like five teens all crouched

496
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,500
around the car and there's loud music being played outside and they're just going to keep

497
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,060
popping up.

498
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,140
I guess at a certain point you get desensitized to it.

499
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,700
But there's something like that feeling like trap that I don't like.

500
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,220
Do you disagree?

501
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,100
You know what I'm saying?

502
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,340
There's a trapped feeling of like, I can't even control it all and I'm not going to put

503
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,100
my car in a drive and run them over.

504
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,020
I can run faster.

505
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,540
I can hide behind a Valencia teen at Six Flags, but I can't hide behind anything here.

506
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,620
Well, but I think, I mean, you can hide behind your steering wheel.

507
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,740
That seems comforting to me.

508
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,620
You're in the car.

509
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,180
You're hidden.

510
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,700
Yeah, you're in the car.

511
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,100
There's two types.

512
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,540
I guess I could crouch down and put my hands over my head to just not look.

513
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,820
You're right, I guess.

514
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,380
I hear them.

515
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,820
I hear them hitting the window.

516
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,180
Go away.

517
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,380
The scarier stuff from what I've because there's videos of a lot of these online at this point

518
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,660
and like the scenes happen either far away from you or they get close to your car and

519
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,780
you're in park.

520
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,100
Right.

521
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,420
Yes.

522
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,660
Right.

523
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,820
Right.

524
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,940
Because they can't have you.

525
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,660
You can't be driving and get scared and run off.

526
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,580
Take the wheel and just swerve off the road and run into a bunch of people dressed like

527
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,300
Frankenstein.

528
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,140
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

529
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,300
So anyway, all that to say up front, I did find something that was pretty highly rated

530
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,180
from the way from what I was reading, something called Knights of the Jack.

531
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,780
And this is in Calabasas.

532
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,620
And it was sold out up until November 1st.

533
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,100
And I had to do what I love to do, which is checking to get tickets.

534
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,980
You got to do it.

535
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,420
You haven't done it all year.

536
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,260
I haven't done it in regards to tickets.

537
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,780
I certainly have checked to get NECA Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, but I

538
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,340
haven't done.

539
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,900
Can you talk about the thing that you did today?

540
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,660
I don't remember if that worked out.

541
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,300
Which thing?

542
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,100
The bot.

543
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,860
So, well, this is a little Scott.

545
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,820
There's a long story.

546
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,620
No, try to make it very quick, low quick.

547
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,780
So basically what was happening is these Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that I love that

548
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,060
are made by this company NECA.

549
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,820
They go up for presale, or not presale, their main sale.

550
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,980
And it's like, you'd never know what time it goes up.

551
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,820
The target website is confusing.

552
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,500
And the first couple times they put them up, they put up Metalhead, I believe.

553
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,620
And they put up Casey Jones.

554
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,700
These are all the cartoon versions of Ninja Turtles.

555
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,020
They were bought instantly by bots.

556
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,220
And I was just like, I'm good at getting this stuff.

557
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,420
I'm good at checking.

558
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,180
And I was beaten by the machine.

559
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,060
I was beaten by these machines to get these toys.

560
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,860
And this is especially early on in COVID where it's like, I'm not trying not to go

561
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,460
into the stores as much or whatever.

562
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,620
So it happened again.

563
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,620
And I got so fed up, I looked into buying a bot.

564
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:36,380
I looked into buying a program that could out-bot these other bots.

565
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,260
You were going to create life.

566
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,100
I was going to create a being designed to buy this one toy and then wander the

567
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,140
digital earth for 10,000 years.

568
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,820
I was going to, you know, you had to have a real son, Scott.

569
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:59,420
I was going to have a digital son that could procure me sweet nostalgic toys.

570
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Your son buys you toys.

571
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,860
And that's all he does.

572
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,620
Inevitably, it would have been a Star Trek situation like Professor Moriarty on the

573
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,140
holodeck where he wants to get out of the computer somehow.

574
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,500
And I'm trying to make that happen for him and he's wreaking havoc.

575
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,820
But it wasn't going to get there yet.

576
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,940
So people, I think also people who deal with this stuff like this happens in sneaker sales

577
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,780
a lot where there are bots.

578
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,260
And I know people are very anti-bot.

579
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,540
So I apologize.

580
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,260
The only reason I was doing this was not to get the toys to flip.

581
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,740
It was just to procure the toys for myself.

582
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,140
I was becoming a bad boy just so I can get my toys.

583
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:46,060
So I had a guy in Sweden make me a bot.

584
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,980
This has not come up before.

585
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,540
I don't know.

586
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,100
There's a lot of weird stuff in my life that hasn't come up before.

587
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,740
Let's be honest.

588
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,940
I made a guy in Sweden to make me a bot that could get this stuff pretty quickly.

589
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,260
And or in the end, whenever they went on sale.

590
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:13,020
So the long and the short of it is he definitely worked on it a lot to get it to the point where

591
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,620
it could take me up till like the purchasing screen.

592
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,260
It was never, it never worked perfectly.

593
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,780
It would just auto refresh and then it would load and get me to the main screen.

594
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:31,980
And I only used it once because then as soon as that, almost as soon as the like next sale went

595
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,700
up, Target kind of fixed the issue.

596
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,300
They'd outsmarted your bot instantly.

597
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
Well, they didn't outsmart the bot.

598
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,100
It's just the Target system got better for purchasing these turtles.

599
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,100
So as soon as they were up, they would last for at least like five, 10 minutes,

600
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,260
basically rendering my bot useless.

601
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,460
I paid, I'll be, I didn't pay it.

602
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,060
I pay a hundred dollars for this bot.

603
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,780
So it wasn't like a top of the top of the line bot.

604
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,340
I've been told bots could cost you five grand if they're very sophisticated.

605
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,180
So what is, what do you, what do you, do you ever see anything like what?

606
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,580
Okay.

607
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:13,820
So if you, okay, if you want to know, there's a program called Python that is a program that

608
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,940
basically can take control of your Google Chrome.

609
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,780
So basically what this does is it's just automatically has certain prompts to put in.

610
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,580
So you get like a text document, you load in what the website will be for the item you want to

611
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,660
purchase. And then you put in like your credit card information, all that stuff,

612
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,620
sort of in a script in a text document. And then you still have to do this.

613
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,060
Yeah. Oh yeah.

614
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,740
Yeah. Coding language.

615
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,180
Like, yes, I had to learn.

616
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,900
I had to learn.

617
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,700
Discover.

618
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,980
I had to learn a little bit.

619
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,740
The Mike's newest discovery is not an obscure movie or band or anything.

620
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,900
It is like a decades old, very basic coding.

621
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,700
It is a coding.

622
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,380
Yeah. So, so essentially, you know, this, this, this nice man in Sweden made me

623
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,380
a document that I could place all that information in.

624
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,500
And then it would load auto load and essentially it would just like refresh the page until the

625
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,620
sale went live and then would load it into the card and go through all the screens.

626
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,420
And that's what it was doing. It wasn't, I look, I wanted it to be like, hello, Michael,

627
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,780
what are we purchasing today?

628
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,700
Another toy from your childhood. What's wrong with you?

629
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,660
He still gives you the business like Dr. Smith and where that robot was.

630
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,340
How about we try, how about instead of spending $25 on this, you try therapy.

631
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,180
I redirected you to a different website, better health.

632
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,940
Wait, better help. What did we read? Which one have we read?

633
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,580
Which one have we read?

634
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,580
They're not paying anymore.

635
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,820
We don't owe them. We don't owe them knowing what the name of it is.

636
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,100
Okay. Wait, so you can't then like reprogram this. You can't now take the bot and say new mission.

637
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:15,500
You are going to check fast passes within the Disney world app for the, for P for fans of my

638
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,300
show who are lucky enough to actually get to go to a theme park.

639
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,860
No, the bots, this is a thing I learned very quickly. The bot has to be

640
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:29,340
specifically made for the website that you're using it for just because it's the way every

641
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,340
website is a little different. So no, this is not some, I mean, maybe there's like, again,

642
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:39,180
there's a $5,000 super bot that can check almost anything, but yeah, this one has to be

643
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,100
specifically programmed for the target website, but I really, I have not used it.

644
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,180
So I wasted a hundred dollars essentially.

645
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,980
What's the bot doing now?

646
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,780
The bot is sitting here on my desktop. He's sleeping. The bot is sleeping.

647
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,820
Also, Scott, don't be ridiculous. There's no fast passes right now.

648
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,540
You got to get park passes. That's what you got to get.

649
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:14,300
As my family learned, we booked a trip to Orlando a year out. Like, well, let's be optimistic about

650
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,980
the end of 2021. And they assured us in a few days, you'll be able to pick which parks you

651
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,340
want to go to which day. And we're like, ah, we haven't given that enough thought.

652
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,260
When are these park passes in effect to? Oh, the answer to that early 2022.

653
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,100
That system is set up till now.

654
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,060
Oh my God. This thing that I hate about Disney World that other people seem to like where you

655
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,340
have to plan your trip. Now it's literally true. All right. So just think about what you might want

656
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,580
to do 14 months from now. This is, it's even crazier.

657
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,220
Yeah. So, yes, I think that's going to be the way for a little while now.

658
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,100
Probably. Yeah.

659
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,620
Whenever Disneyland opens. Yeah. I think that's probably going to be similar.

660
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,220
But anyway, well, set us up with your Swedish guy.

661
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,260
If the Swedish guy has time to help us and everyone listening to the show, that'd be great.

662
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,460
I will. I will do that. But yes, the bot right now, there's really no need for him.

663
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,780
And yes, look, I look, I was getting desperate. You know, I need these dumb turtle toys.

664
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,700
I just got the rocks. I just got the rock soldiers. They're just, they're

665
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,420
beautiful toys. Do you remember him from Ninja Turtles?

666
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,660
No, he was Crane's rock soldier from Dimension X. His name is General Trag.

667
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,500
I mean, I like him. Yeah, he's great.

668
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,260
What's not to like?

669
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,900
It's great. So I approve. It's wonderful. It's wonderful what you're doing.

670
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,860
Good, good, good.

671
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,340
If this bot lives kind of where you recorded the podcast, right? So he's listening to everything

672
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,540
you're saying and he's heard every episode you've recorded lately. So you could, if anything ever

673
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:03,660
happened to you, could the bot replace him or replace you? I think that's probably true. I mean,

674
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,820
it's probably like, I don't know who watched Star Trek Picard, but sort of, spoiler alert,

675
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,300
Data's consciousness has been sort of living while Data's been dead. So I think maybe I might,

676
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:23,580
like everything about me as a person is now stored on the computer in my bot. So there could be like

677
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:29,420
some sort of epic adventure sort of to go through the internet and retrieve my personality, my whole

678
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,260
programming, if something happens. We could put your personality into

679
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,540
General Trog and he could tell us about Jason. His name is General Trag. Trag Jason. God damn it.

680
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,900
Get it right. Humans make mistakes. Not like your bots. You have to cut out some slack.

681
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:53,260
Bots can pronounce all the characters names correctly. Granator, Leatherhead, Metalhead.

682
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:00,700
Trogdor the Berninator. All your faves. I will be known as General Trag from now on, not Ice Pick.

683
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:09,820
All right. Let's cross that out. Ice Pick General Trag. Okay. So General, let's get back to Knights

684
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:16,220
of the Jack. Okay. Knights of the Jack. All right. So I saw people talking about this and that they

685
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:22,060
really liked it. So we drove to Calabasas. I got a ticket. I was checking all day. I did this manually.

686
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:31,100
This was all brain power, no bot power. And we went, Lindsay and I went last night and we drove

687
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,020
to Calabasas. Nice getting out of the house sometimes. And the Calabasas is around like what's

688
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,540
called, I guess, the Santa Monica Mountains, which I've really never spent too much time around.

689
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,460
They're not particularly nice looking mountains, but it's mountainous and you know, it's got,

690
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:53,820
there's scenery. So we get there and this was the first round of the night for this experience. It

691
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,180
was 6.30. So I'm assuming like most of these, and you'll tell me if you guys did a similar thing,

692
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:08,540
you have to drive through this long winding, essentially a queue. And the queue for this

693
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,820
wasn't like full of cars, but it was so long and it was so bumpy. I was like,

694
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:23,340
are all four of my wheels going to burst? Well, let's put this in context because this is on a farm.

695
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,900
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's King Gillette Ranch is where this is located,

696
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,780
which it's normally a walkthrough. It's always a lot of jack-o-lanterns, but it's normally,

697
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,740
I think, a walking, cider, probably cider donuts sort of fall event, Halloween event.

698
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,300
Yes, that is correct. So we're driving through there and I went, is this whole thing

699
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,140
going to be on this terrain? Because I was like, I don't know if this is,

700
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,780
should we just turn off now if this is? And luckily it was not. Luckily, after we got through this

701
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,140
queuing part, it was not so bumpy, but I was pretty worried for a couple of minutes.

702
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,540
I was wondering, okay, are they going to, are they going to, they should have warned us about

703
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,500
this, that we should have brought a Jeep to this. Not the case, not the case. So just telling you

704
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,380
everything. So it's a long stretching thing and we're driving through and we're a little bit early

705
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:19,340
and we, there's a lot of fun, like kind of cardboard cutouts of monsters and it's very

706
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,780
friendly or whatever. And we see a sign that says tune your radio to 100.1 FM and we go, oh,

707
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,140
this makes a lot of sense. There's probably a soundtrack to go along with this and you play

708
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,820
it on your car. This makes a lot of sense. This is probably what's going to happen here.

709
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,420
So we start driving in and it's, I don't know, has anybody seen, let me, I'll show you,

710
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,420
I'll share the screen real quick just to give you a sort of an idea of what everything's like.

711
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:51,980
And I have some videos too, and I can post those. So it's like, you know, this is sort of the vibe

712
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,420
we're getting here and this is the website and it's just kind of like, it's very, things are

713
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:01,260
nicely decorated. There's fun little things there. So we're sort of driving and there's, you know,

714
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,820
displays that are similar to this. There's, you know, skeleton on a motorcycle or whatever and

715
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,540
different pumpkins and, and we're listening to this 100.1 radio station and it's like playing

716
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:20,300
like Grease Lightning. And we're like, this is really a Halloween song? And then I'm like,

717
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,940
and I'm like, wait a minute. I go, this isn't, this isn't in, this couldn't be in sync because

718
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,500
everyone's going at different intervals. So like, what are we doing listening to the station?

719
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,420
And then also like bad to the bone starts. And like, we're driving through like some like

720
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:43,180
atmospheric things and we're like, wait a minute, this station is just for the queue area, isn't it?

721
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,820
And Lindsay's like, did I just hear a train noise outside? And we rolled down the windows and it's

722
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:57,180
like, oh, the audio for the whole thing has been outside for many minutes that we've been driving.

723
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,660
Wait, were you listening to K-earth? Like the old East station?

724
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,020
Yeah, it was just sister golden hair every other song.

725
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,740
So it wasn't the whole time, but for a couple of minutes, because there's this fun, like aliens

726
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:20,780
have landed in like a pumpkin spaceship and it's like, we're like, well, this isn't the right song

727
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:29,820
for this. What? And we're like, maybe I go, maybe I should just turn it off and put my own thing on.

728
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,740
And it's like, then we finally, we heard it and we're like, oh, okay, got it. This is what it is.

729
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:43,660
So then we were finally a lot of hiccups, a lot of confusion. Now we were on a, a even enough road

730
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:50,300
and we were actually hearing like the music and stuff playing. And here, let me share a couple

731
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,860
videos. Just wait, I can say while you pull those up that I just was curious what the history of

732
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:05,020
this ranch was. And at one point, Bob Hope owned it and he gave it to the Catholic Church to some

733
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,260
specific order where they ran a seminary, but then it became a seminary for a different thing,

734
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:16,220
a new age church called the Church Universal and Triumphant, which is some new age, like most of

735
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,660
it's in Montana. It seems to be an outgrowth of Christian science and Mary Baker, Eddie,

736
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,580
like she coined that phrase and yeah, I don't have time to read the article, but you know, some,

737
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,220
certainly people have called it a cult. So it may be questionably something resembling a cult used

738
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,580
to happen here where a pumpkin spaceship has landed, which seems like maybe the like

739
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,500
potential ultimate event of a, what would probably be kind of a fun cult.

740
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,500
Yeah. Yeah. It seems like the land, now that you say that, cause I didn't read that before.

741
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,180
Now that you say that, that makes some sense. Cause there's a lot of interesting buildings

742
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,220
around this location and it's got an interesting vibe without the fun Halloween lights and music.

743
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:06,060
You go, what is that building? Okay. That looks like, is it, oh, that looks like a church of some

744
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:13,260
kind, but not really. There is like a weird vibe to the, to the architecture. But they didn't really,

745
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,620
I mean, there's, I guess they, they brought, they put up some like lights on the actual building

746
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:27,100
itself, but there wasn't any like recruitment or anything happening that I saw. So, so yeah,

747
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,900
here's the, here's the gist of some of it. Okay. So basically, yeah, there's just different little

748
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,380
vignettes. Now you can see the screen here, right? Yes. And some of the vignettes are confusing

749
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,300
because some of them, as I said, aliens, pumpkins, and then it'll just be like Hollywood.

750
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:56,140
And they're playing the Hollywood song and it's hard. I'll post, I'll post some of this.

751
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:03,100
And you can see there's a Marlon Brando pumpkin from the Godfather. And it's sort of hard. There's

752
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,700
James Bond or Sean Connery. Now it's hard to cause cause I was driving. So it was hard to like dictate

753
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,780
exactly what I needed to get a video of, but there was also a section of pumpkins for Hollywood

754
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,260
couples. So there was a pumpkin with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson on it. Cause Lindsey was like,

755
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,180
Oh, Rita Wilson. Lindsey was like, Oh, you have to be really good at pumpkin art to convey Rita

756
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,380
Wilson. It would convey it. I'll say it conveyed it. But Lindsey was like, Oh, are these, are these

757
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,540
like going to be like deceased celebrities? No, no, no. Some of Hollywood's hottest couples in fact.

758
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:45,180
So yeah. Not Alex Chilton and Chris Bell. Not that I saw, but again, I was driving, you know, I

759
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:53,020
couldn't, I couldn't focus on everything. So basically, unless I miss something, there are

760
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:59,980
just a lot of sort of random vignettes. And on the website, it was like, you know, you know, ours,

761
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:06,620
our drive through is not so scary, but there's some spooky stuff. Unless you're five, there's

762
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:12,540
nothing spooky. There's nothing. It's fun and atmospheric, but I think I was hoping there was

763
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,220
going to be a little of that. There is a good little section here that I'm going to share with

764
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:27,180
you now. That's an unlicensed night member for Christmas. And they pump snow and that's very fun.

765
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,180
And yeah, so they do some fun. Is Gosling weighed in on this yet? I haven't seen

766
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,340
Gosling if he weighed in yet. Maybe he's trying to get in all, he probably, you know, he probably

767
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,540
hasn't gotten tickets because he's not as good of a checker as I am. You go into King Gillette

768
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,740
Ranch, you want to, you don't want to see Christmas stuff. You want to see spooky stuff.

769
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,380
My favorite part of it. And I think that they, maybe if I was giving any notes, I would say more

770
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:05,820
of this, please. Is there a, is an area old west type and there's a spook easy. Yeah. Yeah. See,

771
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,180
like this is a little bit more, I want a little more of that, a little less Rita Wilson. That

772
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:20,300
would be my note in general. But there's some nice vignettes and I think this is good if you have like

773
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:28,620
young kids, I'll say that. I feel like a lot of these things are maybe geared to that, which is

774
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,340
good. And you know, a lot of the pricing on some of it was sort of high and you're like, well, if

775
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:39,340
that, if that, you know, whatever 60 to $90 isn't being spread, it's for people. Right. You're really

776
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,660
getting your value there. And like, I'm showing you something else. These are some really great art,

777
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:50,460
some really cool looking stuff. Yeah. Cause a lot of this stuff I was reading about it is hand

778
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,300
cart. Yes. So it's like, there's a lot of artistry to it. But just sort of, there's my face you can

779
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:02,300
see in the corner there with a mask on. They told us we had to wear the mask while the window was

780
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,860
down just to be safe. So in case you were going to make fun of me for wearing a mask.

781
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:14,540
I know we had a similar experience. Yeah. So, so basically I, I, it is a little bit pricey,

782
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:20,460
but look, it's a lot of work to put on. You're paying for the fact that you're not doing a bunch

783
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,420
of other Halloween stuff and chances are it would be good if you had a kid. And I just want to tell

784
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:33,740
everybody the bumpiness doesn't last and do turn off the radio once you start, because I was really

785
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:40,860
sure we were just going to be listening to like random seventies or eighties rock or going through

786
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:47,180
it. And I was happy to learn that was not the case. So, wow. Knights of the Jack. Just to go a little

787
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:55,020
further, the church universal and triumphant was a doomsday cult. It was this one woman, Elizabeth

788
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,940
Claire prophet. She said that the world was going to end in 1990 when Russia and the U S got into a

789
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,620
nuclear war and then that didn't happen. So the cult just kind of Petered out. I think it exists

790
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:12,380
maybe in some regard, but it got a lot quieter. Also the woman who founded it, everybody, all the

791
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:20,060
followers called her mother. Well, why isn't the maze about this? Yeah, that would be like,

792
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,260
it's haunted by Elizabeth Claire prophet. This would be awesome. And I'm sure some of these other

793
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,820
mazes have like sort of more narratives, cause I think that's what I would, I would have been like,

794
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,980
yeah, you can make like an interesting story, but yeah, that's that writes itself. You get the

795
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:41,420
ghost of Bob Hope involved. Selling her the deed. And then yeah, as soon as like the world is about

796
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:47,180
to end, that's when you exit like, like Mr. Toad. Are you just survived? Yeah. Yeah. Right here. It's

797
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:52,620
you, you're Reagan and Gorbachev yelling at each other. And that's a period piece. Yeah. You have

798
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:58,060
teens play Gorbachev and Reagan and they go on the sides of your car,

799
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,100
applying your Gorbachev birthmark paint every night, psyching yourself up to do it again.

800
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:13,820
I got this. I know this character. So yeah. So, well, there it is. Really fun. Well,

801
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:20,140
love it. So a doctor, Dr. Murhag thoughts about this year's.

802
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,340
Well, do you want to hear mine or do you want to hear some of the like other parks around the

803
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,660
country? Oh, let's, well, let's do that because we're talking about LA things, but you, it sounds

804
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,460
like you looked into some stuff that our, our friends around the country could maybe check out.

805
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:41,020
Yeah. I mean, the first, so back in July, I saw an article that I sent to you guys about like,

806
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:48,220
uh, when I give them credit, it's called the haunted road. It's in, um, Florida, Orlando area.

807
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,780
And they, there was an article in theme park insider. I think a lot of places picked it up

808
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:58,540
because they were seen to be one of the first ones to say, like, uh, we're going to do a haunt,

809
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:05,660
but it will, you will drive through it. And, um, uh, I watched some videos of this. Uh, it looks,

810
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:12,140
it looks very cool. Uh, you know, they, this one is scary, but the scenes are all pretty far away.

811
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,500
Uh, there were some spooky, some ghoulies who got pretty close to the camera person's car and

812
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:26,220
screamed at the car. Um, but everyone's got mass on, um, they're, oh, there were kids in like glowing,

813
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:32,780
like those purge mass, like that the characters in the purge where like kind of weird looking mass

814
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:40,060
like that. Um, uh, it doesn't seem like it, like I said, it's a lot of, maybe people pop up

815
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,100
10 feet away from your car and scenes play out, but I don't think they want to do jump scares

816
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:51,340
when you're behind the wheel of like a 3000 pound sedan. Um, there's another one in Kissimmee called

817
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:57,100
scream and stream the, what was interesting about these, uh, was that it's a little off the beaten

818
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,340
path. So it was like pitch black and dirt roads. So certainly adds to the ambience screaming stream

819
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:11,100
had a giant floating deer skull puppet. Um, and that looked pretty, uh, cool. That looked pretty

820
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:17,500
insane. Uh, what else sticking to Florida? Bush gardens, Tampa was doing a Halloween event,

821
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:25,100
just scare zones, no houses. Um, in Chicago, the old Carlson, uh, neck of the woods, uh,

822
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,220
there is a haunt. This is the craziest one I've come across. It's called alley of darkness.

823
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:37,660
It is a drive in haunt. So you drive in and park, and this is the copy they had on their event.

824
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,860
Our haunt is set in an alley in the shadows of the red line where a horrible incident occurred not

825
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:49,020
long ago. You'll settle in with a drive in movie experience that sets the narrative, the undead,

826
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:56,220
the undead, demons, zombies, and more jump out and rock your car accompanied by sound effects

827
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:03,580
and sprays of blood. That's right. Your car gets covered in blood. You may opt out. Uh,

828
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:11,500
yes, yes, I do. Our drive in haunted house where you are confined to your car for 30 minutes. So

829
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:19,020
you can't escape the horror until the end. Uh, and then it wraps up. We cannot remove every drop of

830
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,500
blood. It will be clean enough to drive on the road and you cannot for any reason short of heart

831
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:30,380
attack, leave your car or open doors or windows. What? This is a lot of terms. Wow. I need to get

832
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,700
some, one of my old friends to go do this or I get like, make my dad, I make my dad do it.

833
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,100
Uh, I have to thank, uh, for any com stock for sending me that they host of the girls like us

834
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,660
podcast, uh, sent me this and it is still the weirdest one I've come across. Wow. Um, no videos

835
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,060
yet of that online, but, uh, yeah, if you're in Chicago and you want a messed up experience,

836
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:00,460
go for that. That is, that sounds messed up. I don't want your parents to mess up one of their

837
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,660
cars. Okay. It's only going to be a pain for them. Yeah. What if you rent? Well, I'll tell them to

838
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:12,940
rent a car and then do it. Um, let's see what, and there, so there are some walkthrough,

839
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:18,060
well, there, there's more LA stuff. There is a walkthrough experience. I forget, um,

840
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,100
on the way to Palm Springs, they like built a house set, but it's all like tarps outside.

841
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:29,660
Seemingly there's a big strangers things drive through thing that's happening downtown. It's

842
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:37,100
not happening until like right before Halloween and, uh, it runs until January, but it's the first

843
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,860
like few weeks sold out really quickly, but probably the biggest haunt for our audience

844
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:49,660
might be interested in is universal Orlando just said, fuck it. We got two houses. And the thing

845
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:59,180
about universal Orlando is they, uh, up to very, like very recently were full steam ahead going to

846
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:05,740
do horror nights with some changes to the point where most of the houses were done enough that

847
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:11,100
eventually they canceled the whole event, but then they did open up the houses, uh, revenge of the

848
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:17,500
tooth fairy and bride of Frankenstein lives. And you can find videos of both of those online,

849
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,500
revenge of the tooth fairy, kind of a walkthrough, a messed up storybook narrative where a child does

850
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,740
not want to give up a tooth to the tooth fairy. And then everyone starts getting murdered by fairies

851
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,420
and bright up Frankenstein lives appears to be so dark. It will not show up on camera,

852
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:39,900
but the sounds were very good. Great sounds, great sounds, young quality.

853
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:46,460
Now that I said all that here is the best thing I have read about any haunt this year. And this

854
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,860
is coming from screamscape who I have to give credit to. We teased them in the past because

855
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,380
they have stuck with their old website, but during, you know, COVID times, their posts have mostly

856
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,300
stuck to just the facts, but there is one rumor that they report it that I have to read aloud

857
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:09,340
because it is so funny. Um, so one of the rumored houses for Halloween horror nights, uh, there was

858
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,180
a bunch that kind of leaked. The one was going to be haunting of Hill house. One was going to be

859
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:21,260
themed to the music and persona of the pop star, Billy Eilish. So that house did not go up this

860
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:26,300
year. And while most of the other houses that are completed, there's very good chance they could just

861
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:33,100
put on the shelf and put in warehouses and spaces backstage so they can do them in 2021.

862
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,340
I'm sorry, this is still universal, the Billy Eilish, uh, potential experience.

863
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:47,260
Correct. Yes. So, but screamscape reported that the Billy Eilish house will not end up being used,

864
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:55,100
should some of these houses get used in 2021. Uh, per screamscape, the reason it won't return in

865
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:01,340
2021 is that Billy Eilish is personal theme slash branding will be changing to something

866
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:08,700
not dark before Halloween horror nights 2021 rolls around. So if you're a fan, get ready for

867
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,300
that new personal brand and that's coming to the Eilish household. Wow. Interesting.

868
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:20,860
She's going to be a sweetheart. She's going to be like Jessica Simpson in 2001. Wow.

869
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,940
We'll just have to wait and see. We'll just have to wait and see. This is confusing.

870
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:33,500
We already went back and forth on Taylor. She was all about bats and, uh, you know, thrusting.

871
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:39,500
And then she became about butterflies and colors. I like how do, how are we supposed to keep track

872
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:45,260
of who's light and who's dark? The Hollywood vampires famously turned into the Hollywood nice

873
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:53,180
guys and then back to Hollywood vampires. It's so confusing. Well, the sun came up, so, you know,

874
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,860
what are you going to do during the day? Only concerts during the day for a little while.

875
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:06,300
Right. Yes. Um, that's so strange. Well, that seems like a real, that's a pretty big spoiler

876
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:14,220
for the forthcoming Billy Eilish output. Yeah, really? Yeah. She's going to try smiling for a

877
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,980
change. You know, it's wrestling. Sometimes feuds are telegraphed. Like they're like, well,

878
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,900
this seems like it's what wrestle the big match with WrestleMania will be this. They're setting

879
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:30,700
up 18 months out, 12 months out, you know? Sure. All right. Well, prepare for that everyone.

880
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:36,700
Prepare for that. The only thing we don't know is if we will still be in lockdown by the time

881
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:45,900
Billy Eilish's new phase is occurring. There's no way to know. Let's hope by the time there's the

882
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,260
smiles and sunshine tour that we could go see it in person and not just from our cars.

883
00:55:53,260 --> 00:56:00,860
Yes, we hope. So, onto my haunt or my age appropriate Halloween drive through experience.

884
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:08,220
So I went to, um, it was called Haunt-a-ween and it's still going for a little while longer.

885
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:16,700
It is in Woodland Hills, California. Uh, Mike, I have to say, uh, unlike you, uh, yes, we did

886
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,740
discover roll your windows down to hear the audio. There were a lot more signs

887
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:27,340
at mine. Uh, the roads were very smooth because this took place in an empty mall parking lot.

888
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:34,620
Yeah, that's one of my childhood malls. Uh, cause I grew up near that and the Topanga Plaza

889
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:40,620
and this is the one that died. This is the dead mall of the bunch. Um, but that's like the theater

890
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:46,860
where I saw, you know, so many classics, Independence Day and men in black and, uh, um,

891
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:51,580
you know, it was, it was nice and peach colored or really the color that aged really bad. And it's

892
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,900
one of those places where they've started doing weird, like there's like church services in the

893
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,180
AMC now, hopefully not now, but for the last couple of years, I remember there's like parts

894
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:06,140
of the parking lot that are not safe to go in anymore. Like, I dunno, a bunch of people live

895
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:12,220
in this garage now. Like it's this, this time has not been kind to the promenade. That is the,

896
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,700
is that the one that has the crown books in it? I always forget. Yes. Yes. Yeah. It's still a

897
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:21,820
crown books for a really long time. That is maybe one of the most shocking things we met my friend

898
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,060
and his wife there a few years ago at this point. And is there a Maggiano's in there?

899
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:32,780
That's right. That was still going strong. And the, um, the Maggiano's has the deal where if you buy

900
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,940
an entree, they give you a free one to take home. Oh, you know, my parents are at that Maggiano's

901
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,260
all the damn time. Yeah. They get her. You had a free dinner every time you eat dinner there.

902
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,220
And then we were walking around in this creepy dead mall and we turned a corner and there's a

903
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:54,620
crown books, a long dead, I thought book chain. So maybe that's the scariest thing in this episode

904
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,460
is that a book chain I thought was dead for years was still operating in this mall.

905
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:08,220
Beyond the grave. Uh, and it was, it kind of felt also like everything in there was from 20 years

906
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:14,060
ago. Cause it was a lot of used books, I believe. So yeah, kind of a get them out of here sort of

907
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,980
weird that mall. I'm so delighted. I'm glad they have never, there's been lots of rumors of ways to

908
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:26,300
re-theme, uh, lots of boring ways to turn this into, you know, boring apartment buildings or sites.

909
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,260
It's going to be boring, whatever it is, but right now it is open and available to do big, weird, like

910
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,220
pumpkin tunnels and stuff. So what would you think? How was it? Uh, it was good. I mean,

911
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,140
they're just utilizing the parking space, the parking, the parking lot. You don't go inside,

912
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:47,580
you don't drive through the crown books. I wish you drove through. And also there's a big shiny

913
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:53,420
outdoor mall across the street and like an Amazon grocery store, some sort of drive through dispensary.

914
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:58,700
I think that was already closed for the night, but we were very confused and interested what that was.

915
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,780
But well, that's the one where we did the weird, that's where we did the, not the void,

916
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:08,780
but the other one. Yes. The other virtual thing that I assume is doomed due to the current

917
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:16,140
situation. Yeah. And then we went to my childhood hot dog place, Flukies. Flukies kicks ass. Flukies

918
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,740
great. Flukies episode coming soon. Flukies, thank you. I'm so glad I hear it. Here is guys, so you can see the map of the

919
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:30,700
events and where the mall is situated versus the drive through experience. You know, I really, we

920
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:37,740
liked it. I have to say it was pretty well staffed. Like they had a lot of people working

921
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:43,020
with, you know, those wands, those glowing wands that you direct traffic with.

922
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:50,300
Everyone was kind of freestyling it with those traffic directing wands. Like one guy was really,

923
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,100
like, he really told us to roll the windows down. It's like, no, this means stop. This means stop.

924
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,900
And then we drove by someone else who was doing a similar motion. I went to stop and they just went,

925
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:05,260
happy Halloween. And they were just clearly like waving their wand around to celebrate the whimsy.

926
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:13,260
I ran into a few wand situations as well, right? When is that a come forward or is that a like

927
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:19,980
scratching your face? So happy people are working, but also like a little stressed out by the other

928
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:26,460
ones. I also, you know, it did not dawn on me. I mean, just to get here, I had to, I was like,

929
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:32,380
I haven't driven on the freeway at night in like six months. So that was a bit of a trip.

930
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,660
And then was that okay? Oh yeah, it was fine. It was just like, oh yeah, this is so weird.

931
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:43,020
You know, I haven't either now, not since I had to go have a baby. That was like,

932
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:48,780
that's the only time and many, many months. Didn't you go on knots to eat the chicken?

933
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,380
Not at night. I went at like, oh yeah, I guess. Yeah. All right. Wow.

934
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,260
I hadn't thought about how scary it's going to be.

935
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:03,100
The other thing is like, yeah, as Mike alluded to, like these are very narrow lanes and

936
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,980
especially in a mall parking lot where they've just set up like handrails, they have essentially

937
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:16,780
made like pen lanes. Like you were driving one to four miles an hour through like car switchbacks,

938
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,540
like, you know, going, snaking around to go through these little scene lets and stuff.

939
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:29,900
So it was a little stressful, honestly, at first to be like that confined and that going that slowly,

940
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:39,660
but eventually, don't hit the cones. Exactly. So yeah, I mean, there, it started off with like a big

941
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:45,420
like Jack-o-lantern tunnel. I'm going to share the screen again, because I have like a bunch of

942
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:55,500
pictures. So it started off with like a big Jack-o-lantern tunnel and a pumpkin patch.

943
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,420
And there was a, what we do in the shadows tunnel, which I was like, oh, did they record voices? Like,

944
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:07,340
will the characters talk to you? And I'll just show you, they just kind of bent one of the billboards

945
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:14,780
that are around LA into a tunnel shape. Yeah, wait a minute. This is just like, imagine driving

946
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:20,060
through a poster. This was going to be on like a hotel at Comic-Con and they repurposed it for this.

947
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:28,700
Yeah. So kind of cool to see like a 12 foot high Mark Proshk and a six foot high FX on Hulu logo.

948
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:35,820
And yeah, I first, so, so then you, you went through a pumpkin patch,

949
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:42,060
a couple different like pumpkin scenes. There was some, there was a pumpkin patch with like

950
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:49,580
funny jokes. And then there was this big LA sign with a Kobe Jersey, similar to Mike's Hollywood

951
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,940
sign. Everyone's got the city on the mind. That's kind of weird though. That is weird. Yes.

952
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:06,780
The Jersey of a deceased. Yeah. We, we, we, yeah, we started off, we started off, I should say,

953
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:15,500
with like a man and like kind of Joker makeup came up to us and he asked, do you want to play a game?

954
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:21,580
Are you ready to play? And then he shoved, he shoved a pole with a basket full of candy in

955
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:28,300
the window and dumped it on Jane's lap. And that became a reoccurring thing throughout the night.

956
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,860
A Joker approached you with a pole and a thing of candy at the end of it.

957
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:40,620
Oh, no, there were pirates. There were vampires. There were most importantly,

958
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:49,580
characters from the new HBO Max original, Roald Dahl's, the witches at the very end of this,

959
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:58,540
there was like, you drove through the town from the witches and they gave out candy, a very funny.

960
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,700
What was your, Jason, what was your hall on the, at this place? This seems like you got a lot of

961
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:10,140
candy. Yeah, that was the other thing. Cause this, this event was also similarly priced $70. And I

962
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:14,220
got to give them credit because we thought it was like over. And then it turned out we were only like

963
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:20,860
halfway through. And so by the end of it, this filled a reusable trader Joe's shopping bag.

964
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:27,740
So my God, a ton and a big variety. Yeah. Wow. A very big variety. We didn't get candy at all.

965
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,580
And I will say about ours, I thought it was half over and it was actually over.

966
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,340
Wow. But yeah, so this, I mean, there was a skeleton band. There was a scene where the

967
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:47,260
skeletons were having a party. There was a pumpkin headed man who was just kind of picking up loose.

968
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:57,020
Hey, I don't know what his deal was. And yeah, trying to remember what other seeds. Yeah. The

969
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:03,660
whimsical skeletons were very fun. A lot of whimsical music. There was a pirate who kept

970
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:10,140
like popping up. He would follow, like follow the cars from scene to scene. Very fun. There was a

971
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:16,860
very fun moment where like one of the guys was dressed as a vampire and Jane realized she knew

972
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:23,660
them and asked, are you so and so? And he went, yes. Like he kept doing the voice and he gave

973
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:33,580
us extra candy. We eat. So my God, here's here's a strange and the dog with the dog.

974
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,020
Yeah. The dog just slept on the ground next to the candy.

975
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:43,820
That was the other thing they didn't really, we should have thought ahead of like they're just

976
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:51,260
dumping the candy in both our laps. So they kind of had to pick up the floor candy and put it in a

977
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:58,620
bag to transport it. But it was good. I think all in all, by the time we got in and went through

978
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:07,740
it all, it was like 30, 40 minutes or so. And they may have had too many people working in the

979
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:12,060
pumpkin patch because someone almost gave us a second pumpkin. And we're like, no, no, we got

980
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:20,380
the pumpkin. But you got to pick which pumpkin you want it. Like that was cool. So yeah, I thought

981
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:26,140
this was really fun. Yeah. Windows down, mess on. And they had fun like Halloweeny music pumping

982
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:32,700
through everywhere. And it was a really nice time. It's all made so much more surreal. Like you're

983
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:40,700
describing jokers coming up to you in your car and then it's all like in the shadow of

984
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,980
the long dead Macy's where I would go get my school clothes.

985
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:55,100
It's just some of the strangest. It's eerie, but comforting. I'm just glad things are happening,

986
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:01,260
but they're all very surreal to look at. A giant Mark Proch. This is all so strange.

987
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:07,340
Oh, this is a, this was a skeleton beauty parlor where the skeletons are getting their nails done

988
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:14,220
and fripped. I like that. Here's the, here's the party. Of course you see they got the big guys,

989
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:21,660
the Home Depot big guys. Yeah. Thought about getting the Home Depot $300 like 12 foot skeleton.

990
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:26,540
If I had a front yard, I would absolutely get it. And money also that I didn't spend on a bot.

991
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,740
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Your, your skeleton money went to the bot. Right.

992
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:40,780
Well, I, that seems pretty strong. Um, yeah, I would recommend it. It was brought to you by like

993
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:45,180
sponsored by Butterfinger party city and FX. So you end up with a lot of candy.

994
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:52,700
FX. I, I don't quite know what material support they provide it, but the party city stuff,

995
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:57,340
you know, everything's the, the costumes aren't like our night's quality, but everyone was having

996
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:03,740
a lot of fun who worked there. And it was like spirits were high. Oh, it was spirits were high.

997
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:12,860
Spirits were high. That said it was 80 degrees at 8 30 PM the night I went. So it was a little weird.

998
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:19,260
The Woodland Hills is hot. That's true. Yeah. Are you guys comforted as Comic-Con fans?

999
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:25,180
Are you comforted seeing activations again? Have you missed like the answers? Yes. Big,

1000
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:31,980
big billboards masquerading as experiences. The answer is yes. Uh, missing Comic-Con.

1001
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,580
There's been a lot of things that I have. I've expressed outwardly that I've missed,

1002
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:42,060
but I have not expressed that I miss seeing like trains reskinned with a TV show or a movie that

1003
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:46,300
I'll never watch. And I'm not saying that's any of the things you're talking about. I'm just saying

1004
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,740
that nine times out of 10, when you see a billboard of Comic-Con, you're never going to see, you're

1005
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:55,900
never going to watch that thing. But I like some weird, it's like a show about like the young

1006
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:02,380
Chronicles of the guy who built Chuckie. It's like some. The maker, the toy maker.

1007
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:10,700
The toy maker. And he's like, why is he this like brooding 22 year old British guy? Why is he

1008
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:19,180
shirtless? Yeah. So hot. The guy who made Chuckie. They're going to go like kind of suggest Chuckie

1009
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:25,020
abstractly in the opening montage, but he won't actually get built until season six. That's right.

1010
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:32,460
It's on Epic TV. You know, you're never going to watch it. You don't even have the means to watch

1011
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:38,940
it. You wouldn't know where to find that available with a map. Of course on the Hilton Bay side,

1012
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:45,020
there's a big poster for Scott's new show Kincaid, the origin story of Ruben Kincaid from the Partridge

1013
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,500
family. Oh yeah. Well, thanks for reminding me. I know I got a lot to do. I got to work on Jaws 19.

1014
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,460
I got to get Kincaid ready. I'm glad Comic-Con got canceled because I was not ready for my panel.

1015
01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:03,420
Yeah. So next year there'll be a 15 story Kincaid poster. I'm really excited. He's hot too,

1016
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:09,820
by the way. I was going to say we found a really great actor to play the Partridge family's manager.

1017
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:16,140
He is 22. He is British playing American and he is oh so hot. Yeah. And you will not see the

1018
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:24,060
Partridge family until season nine. You might get a phone call and you think it's Danny, but you know,

1019
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,500
you're not sure it's ambiguous. He drives by a hospital and they suggest Danny was born. He was

1020
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:34,620
just born. You just hear a baby cry. Right. And he goes, oh, and then there's kind of like a little,

1021
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:42,060
he like picks it up and then he tells me I'll be seeing that baby someday. Well, that's all well

1022
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:47,340
and good for you, but due to executive shakeups, I've been brought in to fix Gail, the Dorothy Gail

1023
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,940
Wizard of Oz prequel. And I am not optimistic about the chances for this show. It doesn't help

1024
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:58,620
that the star Billie Eilish is changing her whole persona branding. That's totally got overshadow.

1025
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,300
Yeah, man. Yeah, she's going to be in persona change meetings from here to 2023. You're never

1026
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:10,300
going to get any time with her. Right. I'm getting no material support from cider, which of course is

1027
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:15,500
the brand new streaming service for Martinelli's apple juice. There are no help whatsoever.

1028
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,060
Cider spelled S Y D R.

1029
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:33,100
Sire. It's $14 a month. We've got a launch in the fall. Guys, why aren't you listening? The tie in

1030
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:37,420
the cider seasonal tie. I don't understand. I feel like I'm shouting at a wall.

1031
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:45,180
We're comfortable launching with only long form cider ads. We think we'll build the audience

1032
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:52,540
with that and then we'll give them some original IP. I will say, hey, H.R. Max deserves more credit

1033
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:58,140
because they had witches houses. There are people dressed like the characters. I think I'm not really

1034
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:03,020
that familiar with the book and previous movie, but from the trailers, it looked like the one

1035
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:08,140
character that talked to us in a spooky accent was dressed like an pathways character and they had big

1036
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:14,380
houses and stuff. And so that was fun. I've heard they have another. They have an in your car

1037
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:21,100
experience based on the vow, the Nixxiom documentary where you sit in your car in a big

1038
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:29,020
line for nine hours and nothing ever happens. Well, that you have been taking the producer

1039
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:35,260
role on the producing the documentary about that cult that Mike's Jack O'Lantern festival was used

1040
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:41,580
to. Hell yeah. Yeah, we're in and out after the vow. This documentary is 13 minutes long.

1041
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:48,620
It's going to be jam packed. We're going to plow through it. It'll be a real quick bite. You know,

1042
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:53,660
I've been saying ever since the vow, I have been saying that people want quicker entertainment.

1043
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,220
They want their content and quick, quick little bites. Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. Damn

1044
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:04,140
it. I've been on the record about loving quick bites many times. I know we remember famously. So

1045
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:14,780
um, OK, my experience. So there's with me doing any sort of Halloween haunts experience.

1046
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:23,580
There is a lot for me to triangulate to not only the ongoing pandemic, but also my baby's frequent

1047
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:31,820
nap and sleep schedules. And most importantly, me being afraid of haunts of things that occur

1048
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:36,780
in the dark. Even the the things that you guys just showed me seem perfectly pleasant,

1049
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:41,260
but I would always be afraid that around the corner, as Mike said, there were some teenagers

1050
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:47,100
shaking your car or putting blood on it without my permission or a joker with a candy basket.

1051
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:54,060
Get away, get away, get away from the car. You swerve into the mall.

1052
01:13:54,460 --> 01:14:03,100
I'm going to go hide in that Macy's, my favorite Macy's. I don't want any of this. I wanted a

1053
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:09,580
different vibe. So that is why considering all of this, I decided from my experience to take a

1054
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:14,860
10 a.m. visit to the Halloween experience at the Citadel Outlet Mall. Whoa.

1055
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:23,420
So this has come up on the show before, but again, for the non Los Angeles people,

1056
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:29,340
if you're if you're driving on the five to or from the five freeway to or from Disneyland,

1057
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:34,860
this is probably the most like notable site of your trip to Knott's Berry Farm or Disneyland,

1058
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:41,340
because suddenly after a bunch of really industrial boring stuff, there's suddenly this giant,

1059
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:47,020
what looks like an ornate Middle Eastern palace. Or I've also said it kind of looks like a Mario

1060
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:53,900
Fortress. Like it's like it's like a level eight. And first of all, neither here. I mean,

1061
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:59,660
we could do an entire we'll do the that was one of the keepers we met, I believe was the Citadel

1062
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:05,740
guy who sounded like a real drag. But this was apparently a former tire factory.

1063
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,380
If you were I don't know why I'm saying this. Now, why does it look like a Middle Eastern palace?

1064
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:16,540
Well, because it was a tire factory. You see, doesn't really answer it. And then I just remember

1065
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:22,140
Aaron and I went there a long time ago and we were like, whoa, so it's themed. So it all looks it's

1066
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:27,500
all this Assyrian vibe. That sounds crazy. And then we went back there and it's all just behind that

1067
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,460
big building. And it's like the most boring place you've ever been. It's like it's like there's a

1068
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:38,780
lot. There's a couple of them all that like inside look exactly the same that on the way to Palm

1069
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:44,620
Springs. Like they all feel like they're in the same. Yeah, yeah. Camarillo like that. That might

1070
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:50,060
just be what all they all of them are. They don't you're not paying for theming. It's as bare bones

1071
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:55,900
as it could be. I guess that's what an outlet mall's all about. So I have criticized this place for

1072
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:02,460
dullness for not delivering on the promise of the Assyrian palace that you see from the freeway.

1073
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:09,420
But for Halloween, let me tell you, it's a whole different story. I brought the whole family,

1074
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:16,220
I can say and thus making this probably the first themed experience that my son has been to. So

1075
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:23,820
that's a that's a big moment. Yeah, pretty exciting. So over by the food court, there is

1076
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:31,420
their main claim to the big thing that they are boasting about up on those those video billboards

1077
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,820
that we know from our Disneyland drives that we never get to do anymore. And they're advertising

1078
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:44,700
up on those big Jack, who is the largest pumpkin in Los Angeles. Wow. So they say I wonder if they're

1079
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:50,380
allowed to make that claim, partially because the big jack-o-lantern Mickey is not available for

1080
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:56,140
public consumption at Disneyland. So maybe in another year, they couldn't say it. Although,

1081
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,740
I saw big Jack, and he's pretty big. Jack might be bigger than the than the Mickey.

1082
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:09,100
Big Jack is 16 feet tall. He's 15 feet wide. Yeah, he weighs 1500 pounds, and he's surrounded by 40

1083
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:15,260
plus bales of hay. That doesn't feel as special. Now you guys showed me so much hay. I think you

1084
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:20,700
everybody saw a lot of hay. Anybody. Anybody going any of these haunts will see a lot of hay. So if

1085
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:28,220
you're a fan of hay, this is your year. Big Jack is also surrounded by a spooktacular garden of

1086
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:36,700
giant sunflowers and candy corn. And this is one of those. So, all right, this is this little cutesy

1087
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:42,620
experience. And in another year, I might have been more, where I'm going to the immersive theming

1088
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:50,700
of an actual theme park. And pre-having a child, I might have been like, oh yeah, so they got

1089
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,500
like sunflowers. Those probably look stupid, right? It's fun. They try something. I don't know.

1090
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:03,100
This was to me in my current state breathtaking. This was wonderful. It was great. It was wonderful

1091
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:12,300
to see big things, big cartoony cloth things. My boy like stood and like stared into the flower and

1092
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:19,020
and held it and was one of the most fascinated I've seen him be in something. Like he did register

1093
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:25,260
this is something different. So now I am like, bless you, spooktacular garden. Why would I ever

1094
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:35,180
have been snarky about this before? Thank you for entertaining my boy. We then proceeded to do the

1095
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:39,980
experience that, you know, they don't want people to go in and just be see Big Jack and leave.

1096
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:45,420
They want you to go explore the many offerings of the outlet mall, which is pretty much open.

1097
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:52,060
So that's why there's an activity called Let's Track Jack and his friends. And this I like

1098
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:58,060
because there we got some original IP involved. You go to like a visitor's center,

1099
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:05,340
past a bunch of brochures, and they give you like a map of the mall and then stickers of all of the

1100
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:11,580
characters that you might meet and their names and you have to go look for them. Now, if you

1101
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:16,060
plan on doing the Citadel tracking Jack and his friends, you might want to hit the skip button a

1102
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:25,100
couple of times because I'm going to spoil some locations for you. But Kitty Cat was at Michael

1103
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:30,460
Coors. So if you're looking for a hint though, also just go to Michael Coors. That's one of the

1104
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:40,300
12. You got to find 12 friends. Mums with a Z who is a mummy was outside of Ruby's, which is a

1105
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:47,100
chain that I am shocked has not gone bankrupt during the pandemic. Somehow they've made it.

1106
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:55,740
And then best of all, Skelly the Skeleton was outside of the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.

1107
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:03,660
Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, the home to Truffles, the large sad bear who we love so much.

1108
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:10,620
Aaron, we've talked about this and God bless our audience. Our audience has now posted a lot and

1109
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:17,180
sent us a lot of photos of them comforting Truffles, the sad bear who needs some emotional support.

1110
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:21,900
I've loved seeing all these. Please always keep them coming. But a lot of Truffles live indoors.

1111
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:26,620
So we haven't seen Truffles in a long time and we've been at home taking care of the boy.

1112
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:33,020
So rounding it, realizing, oh my God, that's a Rocky Mountain. Is he out? Is he out? Oh my God,

1113
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:40,620
Truffles is out. He was wearing a mask and a confusing, I'm sorry, a mask, not like a

1114
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:46,700
Halloween mask, but the, you know, that we all have to wear because of the disease. And also a

1115
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:53,020
confusing costume that was like a cape and a necktie once. I didn't really know what they were,

1116
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:57,500
but I, and it's, you know, hanging off of them weird and bad, but I would expect

1117
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:06,540
nothing less from my buddy. I might as well screen share. You can take in this wonderful site.

1118
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:13,180
We got to introduce my boy to our favorite bear who, by the way, for a long time, I've said this

1119
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:19,180
before, this will be his first Halloween costume of his life as being the sad bear. Aaron was so

1120
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:26,620
happy to see him. I was so happy to see him. This was truly heartwarming. He, as you can tell,

1121
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:33,420
he's very excited. He's very, he's as invested as us. Not certainly not just looking off somewhere

1122
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:40,620
else. You should see, you should see Big Jack too. Just tell me what you, do you think this?

1123
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:44,540
I was going to say, can you go back to the picture or the closeup picture of Truffles

1124
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:50,940
real quick? And I'm going to make a really disgusting comment. Yes. I might know where

1125
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:56,220
you're going. What's your observation about Truffles? The mask that's like clinging tightly to

1126
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:04,220
his snout. It definitely looks like the lower half of Borat's yellow swimsuit with his testicles

1127
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:12,220
being stared. His mankini. Yeah, there you go. That's sort of the, I just get a vibe from that.

1128
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:19,340
That's just me though. He probably needs to wear a bigger mask, probably to get the full coverage,

1129
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:26,940
but I'm glad he's trying. Truffles is always sad and in this trying year, I just hope he doesn't

1130
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:32,060
have it even worse. Though how could it get worse for him? He just seems so glum, no matter what.

1131
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,420
He's sadder than Eeyore. So we always like to stop by and make him feel a little better. I believe

1132
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:42,860
we may have done this. I think Aaron did this without touching him because germs and all,

1133
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:47,740
but you could still lend distance support. I thought you were going to, when you said

1134
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,540
disgusting, I thought you were going to comment on the multiple stains on his shirt. I mean,

1135
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:56,700
that's gross too. Yeah, it's not ill fit. Also the tie reads, trick or treat, be so sweet,

1136
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:04,860
give me something good to eat. Be so sweet. And then the tie is also stained. Well, with chocolate,

1137
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:10,460
he is a hungry boy. He's a grown boy. He's named after chocolate or treats at least.

1138
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:17,740
What do you think of Big Jack here? I mean, yeah, he's great. Yeah. I like him. Pretty huge. I

1139
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:24,220
think maybe bigger than that, Mickey, right? Yeah, maybe a little by a little bit. It's interesting.

1140
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:30,300
Obviously without comparison to where they're both located, it's kind of hard to tell.

1141
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:36,540
Yeah. Yeah. But you know, it satisfied me. I also liked that one, here's one of these big sunflowers.

1142
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:42,300
Really impressed my boy. And I liked that it was in front of a flip-flop shop. One of our flip-flop

1143
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:50,220
shops, plural. One of the, you know, an old fallen brother, which we just found out is no longer at

1144
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:59,740
City Walk. Does this count as a Citadel saga? I mean, if this knocked it out, I'd be thrilled.

1145
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:05,420
I can't remember who the keeper of that was, but perhaps we'll ask them. We can, yeah, yeah,

1146
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:15,580
somebody can text that particular keeper. Will you, for one Halloween, have your child be Richard

1147
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:23,180
Nixon? Well, I do have the mask. I may have thrown away the mask at some point. I don't know. You

1148
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:29,100
know, after my whole life's story of being really into presidents and, you know, and then how

1149
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:35,260
how insane and damaging the last four years have been. I think I'm going to keep my son away. I'm

1150
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,820
going to keep him away from the idea of presidents as long as possible. Like until he's confronted by

1151
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:44,380
photos of them in a classroom, I'm going to pretend they don't exist. I'm not going to say the word.

1152
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:48,780
That's fair. Seems like a planet. He's just looking at like a white pumpkin. This is,

1153
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:56,060
I can't tell you how much this warms my heart. My overall, my summation of all of this,

1154
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:05,980
this we we did this in less than an hour. It was definitely a little mundane. It took place at a

1155
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:12,300
place I just called specifically not very well themed. And it is without a doubt the best thing

1156
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:19,900
I've done in 2020. Our spirits soared. Even we miss driving to Disney. We miss that bad drive.

1157
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:25,740
Oh, yeah. What's the 710 and is the 10 crowded today? And like, we got to get over.

1158
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:31,260
The interchange is on the left this time. We miss all that. We haven't got to do it with the kid.

1159
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:36,220
So even like driving halfway to Disneyland, we were like a glow leaving this outlet mall.

1160
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:43,820
Oh, and I forgot the detail that if you track Jack and his friends successfully, that your prize,

1161
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:50,300
there's a number of them, but you can get a free soda at Charlie's subs. You can get a pretzel at

1162
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:59,980
Auntie Anne's. Pretty good prizes. Not so good for my little Jack Tracker who cannot have any of

1163
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:05,260
those items. The only prize they could have offered that would have made us go do the whole thing is

1164
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:13,820
just is three ounces of smelly formula. That would have like, oh, real well, his favorite,

1165
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:19,740
his favorite treat. But did your child turn to you at any point and go like,

1166
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:23,260
since we're halfway down the five, can we just go to downtown Disney?

1167
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,340
They've set up a limited time shopping experience in stage 17 and we can get our picture under a

1168
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:39,500
play it side. That's when I was coming into this realm, a spirit whispered to me a ghostly boy

1169
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:47,020
spirit. He was full of youthful enthusiasm, just like me, Papa. He said, please take your boy there

1170
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:54,860
so he can live. He can walk in my footsteps. The Disney outlets at the Citadel outlet

1171
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:59,980
reopened a few months ago and there was lines around the block to get that discounted park

1172
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:06,220
merchandise, that clearance, like grad night that never happened merchandise. Here's the thing about

1173
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:13,980
the outlet malls. They're not really outlet malls. It's all this big scam. This is how I feel. This is

1174
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,780
the end of the episode, I'm guessing. But like I've been in those Disney outlet stores and there's

1175
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:23,660
like a little clearance section, but everything else is regular price. Yeah, it's not cheaper

1176
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:29,340
there. It's not cheaper in most of these stores. There was a day. I think there's like two in

1177
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,980
Orlando that are like really, really dirt cheap clearance stuff. Well, that's a different thing.

1178
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,700
They closed the one in California. Yeah. But there is one in Orlando, I think maybe still,

1179
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:43,340
that actually has cheap discounted stuff. But yeah, these outlet stores by and large,

1180
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:49,420
not much different than a regular store. There was a day we were driving back from Disneyland,

1181
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,220
maybe. I don't know if we did an overnight or something. I think we had just ended up driving

1182
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:58,860
back like on Black Friday or the day before Thanksgiving or something. And the traffic was

1183
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:02,780
unreal. I mean, it's always really bad around there, although not currently because no one's

1184
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:07,580
going anywhere. But like it was so awful one day and we were like, wait a minute, is this like

1185
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:14,460
pre Black Friday at the outlet mall? And indeed it was. And once we passed it, it was so crowded.

1186
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:21,820
There were police everywhere directing. Like this was, you know, like a Coachella audience had

1187
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:29,660
descended on this outlet mall. And for what? For slightly cheaper flip flops? I guess. Yeah. I,

1188
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:35,580
I, you know, I feel like I went in an H&M, which has cheap clothing. It's the same. It's the same

1189
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:41,500
price. It's fooling. It's fooling us. Yeah. I've never been fond of this place. I have to say

1190
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:46,780
until now, until they gave us this wonderful, less than an hour until they showed us big Jack.

1191
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:53,260
I mean, I will always, I'll always have a different view of this place from now on. They

1192
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:58,860
made Halloween real special, maybe even in a way, if it's possible, more special than the one that

1193
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:06,300
I spent with Jay Leno and Alex Chilton. Wow. Well that's, I mean, you just said it all.

1194
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:11,580
I tied it all back to the beginning. I guess that's the point where you end the episode and say,

1195
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:19,740
you survived haunt cast the fright local haunts edition. Here's hoping that next year we can

1196
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:25,500
go back to the way it's supposed to be getting screamed at by teens. Yes. And that Mike can go

1197
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:30,300
have the Halloween that he wants and the Jason and I can have essentially the one we are currently

1198
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:35,100
having where we stay. I, I'm working on Jason though. What do you think, Jason, will you declare

1199
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,940
one that you'll go to at least one of these with me next year? Are you willing to? This was supposed

1200
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:43,260
to be the year. This was like, all right, I'll go to universe. I'll do the polished one. You know,

1201
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:50,940
I'll do, I'll, I'll, the polished one. No, they're like high budget, like, you know, it has the most

1202
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:55,260
liability insurance that that's the other thing I thought about all these drive-through haunts,

1203
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:02,380
especially the small ones. What, what must that liability insurance be? And here's a

1204
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:09,420
300 cars a night and a bunch of people directing traffic who just learned how to do this a week

1205
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:16,300
ago. Good luck. All right. So Jason will be at Horror Nights next year. I'll do it next year.

1206
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:25,100
Done deal. And, hey, as for us next week, hey, we know what's happening next week. There's only

1207
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:30,620
one topic it could be. It's the topic that we are parsing through as slowly as possible,

1208
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:37,020
as slowly as driving through a pumpkin tunnel bumper to bumper. We're heading back to the Haunted

1209
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:44,140
Mansion next week. I, I don't know. I guess we usually don't say it, but you know, we, we know

1210
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:47,900
what week it is. We know what we're doing. Get pumped up. I'm going to go back and listen to the

1211
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:53,420
previous episodes because my memory has been destroyed this year and I don't know where we

1212
01:30:53,420 --> 01:31:00,380
left off. So I figured it out. So I know how to kick it off and it's, I think, I think we'll be

1213
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:09,420
fine. How far will we get? Only time will tell. And I'll obviously go to the Cemetery Gate,

1214
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:14,860
the Patreon for the bonus content where we've had, I think two of them have come out and we got one

1215
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:20,780
more spooky episode for the month before we go back to the regular second gate. And that's,

1216
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:25,740
of course, at patreon.com slash podcast, the ride. Hey, and Merchant T public. Oh, we got,

1217
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:31,420
we got a Haunted Mansion, or a Haunt Cast the Fright design for shirts and other things. I

1218
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:39,020
use your imagination what it could be on. And yeah, that's that. It's been a fun month.

1219
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:48,140
So for myself, Rick Zombie Berg, Dr. Murder Hog and General Trag.

1220
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:57,820
What does General Trag say? Well, you have the last word. He says, we have to stop those neutrinos.

1221
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:05,500
All right. So stop the neutrinos in your life. Stop the metaphorical neutrinos

1222
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:13,420
by plundering this country by voting vote those neutrinos. I forget every

1223
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:19,020
The neutrinos were Scott. They were those three like space 50s, like kids that like

1224
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,780
were hanging out with the Ninja Turtles. I'm sure you would notice you would recognize them.

1225
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:27,660
Michelangelo. They're not wait. Are they not bad? No, they're good. Oh, shoot. Oh, never mind.

1226
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:33,500
Vote for the neutrinos. Oh, God, vote neutrinos. Get neutrinos in the White House this year. Yeah,

1227
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:40,780
for sure. All right. Thanks for straightening me out of General Trag. And we'll be back next week.

1228
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,420
Happy hunting.

1229
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:51,420
