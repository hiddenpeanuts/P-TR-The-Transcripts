00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Cemetery Gate. I'm Scott Grave Digner joined by Jason Skeleton.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,640
Hey, and Mike, I think. Yes?

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
I want to say this, and somebody's going to say I've already said this like three years ago, four years ago.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Have I tried to use the name Michael Madsen yet?

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Like the actor?

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I don't know who you're talking about, but Michael Madsen.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
That's what I'm thinking of as far as my Halloween name.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Michael Manson?

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
No, Manson.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
No, no, no. It's a play on that there is a Michael Madsen, the actor.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I guess Scott's right.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,640
But that Halloween name would be Madsen.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
So it is both a scary name and a reference to the guy.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Exactly.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
So have I used that before? I don't think so, but maybe I did.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I think I support it for clunkiness reasons, but I feel like it made Jason mad.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
No, not mad. I'm just confused.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Madden.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm just confused.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,640
It just to me seemed like why a bigger reach than one of the Crypt Keepers puppeteer arms reaching for a funny prop.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't think a reach at all. Carl Mad and the sun is there.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I don't think that's a reach.

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Some might say skeletons a bigger reach, quite frankly.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Yeah, that's fair. That is fair.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Some people are saying it.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,640
This is what a we bungle the Halloween names like crazy.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
That's true.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Every time we could just say a name, but instead it's a process.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
It's a whole deal.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Hopefully by the end we've solved it and settled it.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,640
It's funny that we're still fumbling through things of this nature because I was just putting some dots together.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I don't know if you guys know this, that the day after this comes out, the day after people are hearing this will be the fifth anniversary of podcast The Ride.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
The fifth anniversary of the day we released the first episode.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
That was October 20th.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Everyone say we all know it.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
It's like the back of the future day.

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
It was also an October 20 something famous date.

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Now, well, are you forgetting we released early on a proprietary app that I don't remember the name of anymore?

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Oh, that's true.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
We really got to make sure to say that part.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:37,640
I know oral history from from some I don't know company that's been cannibalized by another giant audio company at this point.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I think every company that we started this podcast with is on the up and up doing better than ever.

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Sure.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,640
It's a great non sorted history.

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
But hey, that's the thing.

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,640
It is as tomorrow if you're in this day comes at five years to the day since it started.

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Maybe we do we would do something bigger celebration of some kind if we weren't all so crazy currently.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
That's true.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,640
But something nice is happening for that fifth anniversary.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:14,640
And by that, I mean the person who's joining us today because our guest today, I think it's possible there would not be a podcast the ride without this person.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,640
He just got dropped off by a car.

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Let him out.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Come on up.

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
I show you.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
You want to respond to that or should I further intro you?

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Yeah, I can talk.

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I agree.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
I take credit for all of this.

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
My name is Andrew Grissom.

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,640
My scary name that I learned from Microsoft Word in the early 90s through autocorrect.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Andrew gruesome.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Oh, that's so clean.

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
But to make it clunky and in the spirit and boo gruesome.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
And then I have some little more.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I have some pitches for you all.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh, wow.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Yeah, we need them.

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I also can't remember if any of these have been used.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Jason scared in.

71
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
I think we've done it.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
I've been rot scared.

73
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I'm just trying to change it up.

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
It's got scared.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
And then Mike Skarrelson.

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Great.

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
OK.

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,640
But then also Mike Carl, son of Minotaur.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh, good reference.

80
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Nightmare history for the knife.

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
OK.

82
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Well, that's all.

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
We'll think about those.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Andrew, thank you.

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Came prepared.

86
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
You came with with suggestions and creative offerings.

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:34,640
My first my full introduction of you is going to be that you are a producer and an empowerer of projects that at least I and other people are very passionate about Saturday morning.

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,640
All star hits, complicated things that funny or die that no one else would help me with.

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Yeah, that's on my list of things to plug.

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Oh, great.

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,640
And an amount of time for keeping the word out still.

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Plus a producer of fine animated content for bento box entertainment.

93
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
But the way you've come up on the show many times is that you are you are a friend of the show, a true friend of the show.

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,640
And we meet probably nobody more so.

95
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
And we're so happy you're here.

96
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Andrew Grissom.

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Wow.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm thrilled to be here.

99
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
So happy to have you.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,640
The name I think we have said friend of the show.

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Andrew Grissom many times, perhaps even more times than the.

102
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Last week's Club 3 foam party story, which listeners informed us very quickly is a five timer.

103
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah, it was surprised by that, too.

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
I guess I've told that before.

105
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,640
I want to because I brought it up to Aaron and she was like, oh, yeah, he's told that story before, but she didn't think on the show.

106
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
So we have I did.

107
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
We've all heard it.

108
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
We heard it.

109
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Well, this is actually a good transition, even though I still I know for listeners, perhaps they want to know anything about me.

110
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,640
They know nothing yet, which is fine because I have almost no social media.

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Footprint.

112
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Nothing much about me.

113
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Good for you.

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Good.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,640
You're the man behind the curtain, but we should pay attention to this.

116
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
No more curtains.

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I want to be behind more curtains.

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Yes.

119
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Oh, OK.

120
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Forever tucked in those curtains.

121
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Yeah, that they can't pull apart and reveal.

122
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Yeah.

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Dorothy comes up.

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
It's a fake curtain.

125
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm somewhere else.

126
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
So this is related to the five timers club.

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Oh, my gosh.

128
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
There might be a zipper.

129
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
It's from a backpack.

130
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
It's not my pants.

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
It's not usually any hijinks.

132
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Theater of the mind.

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
You might think.

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
So I'll describe this as it's happening.

135
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I've got the spookiest thing in the world.

136
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Mm hmm.

137
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Crystal head vodka from Dan Aykroyd.

138
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Oh, that's great.

139
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
That's a boxed bottle of our favorite head.

140
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
My pitch was I have these skull shot glasses is if any of you break the five timers club,

141
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
you have to do a shot of crystal head.

142
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
But I also know that I don't want to be in the shot.

143
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

145
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

146
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

147
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I don't want to be in the shot.

149
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:49,160
I do have this orange juice with Donald Duck on it that you can have as a replacement or

150
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,240
as a mixer.

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
It's his juice.

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Uh huh.

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,640
So, so today on today's episode or going forward on the podcast?

154
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,840
Oh, that's an interesting only for today's episode.

155
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Okay.

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Because you're taking that on.

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Yes.

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
You should.

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I think that's a full carton of orange juice.

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
We're not going to that'd be weird if like.

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,640
Well, you all have more children than I do.

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,240
So maybe it would go to good use.

163
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,280
He's not drinking orange juice yet.

164
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,720
I like the idea that like, oh, I told the story before and then you just glug like a

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,920
third of that orange juice.

166
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,040
That's just like maybe we're just malnourished.

167
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
We're taking advantage of your little system.

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
So interesting.

169
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,680
So yeah, say I want to say, say tonight I was planning to get drunk, like just hammered

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
drunk hammered.

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,200
Is that a five timers?

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
If it's a store, I think it's just an affectation.

173
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't think it counts.

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm not just.

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
No, no, no.

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Five timers are the rules of five timers I think are a full story has been told.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,040
I think runners and references are different than five than a story being told in full.

178
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,280
And to be clear, I come into this just with the prompt.

179
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,240
I wanted you all to make the rules as you see fit.

180
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Thank you.

181
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
But also can be abandoned.

182
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Is this the game you were referring to?

183
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Or do you have a separate?

184
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Okay.

185
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Okay.

186
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Great.

187
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
I didn't know if you had some Halloween trivia game.

188
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
No, no, no.

189
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
I have a few too that aren't malicious, but I also have Melissa.

190
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I have some too.

191
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Okay.

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm interested.

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
So, so.

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
It's basically just yes or no.

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
A poor shot.

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I'll put it by your chair.

197
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
I wanted to tell a story about a famous plane today.

198
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Is that that's more of a runner than a story?

199
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,320
Because I know I've told it before.

200
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,120
How about this retroactively if online everyone disagrees, then you do have to do a shot in

201
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
the future.

202
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,760
I think it needs to be immediate.

203
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,000
Agreed.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I think.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,600
So what it is, is if somebody starts telling a story and the other people realize that

207
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
we've heard this.

208
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Yeah.

209
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
And a few times.

210
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,360
You're a person telling it is doing it in a way where they think this is a fresh story.

211
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Then that I guess qualifies.

212
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
That's it.

213
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
So yeah.

214
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,240
If I say, if I start to do, you know, a little plane story or whatever, that's a runner.

215
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm talking about seats.

216
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
That's a runner.

217
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,020
If I'm that's not this, this is a different thing.

218
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,760
If I start to tell the foam party story or Jason tells the story about the theater with

219
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,720
the shoes, that's five timers.

220
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,440
And then we'll have to take a shot.

221
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,520
Here's a sort of non-answer that I'll say that I do firmly believe.

222
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Yeah.

223
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Trust your heart on it.

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Yeah.

225
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,280
If you think that you failed in some way in the five timers club, then you take a shot.

226
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,560
But if you think it's a runner in your heart, that's fine.

227
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Oh, interesting.

228
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
Well, there'll be a count.

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,720
The other three should form the council, like a high council here and decide in that instance

230
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,680
where you go, okay, was that person doing it in a cheeky way or were they doing it sincerely?

231
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
I think that's fair.

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You get full consensus.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Absolutely.

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We all put our brains together.

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay.

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,040
But if you really don't feel like doing it and then you just like it's a runner in my

238
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
heart.

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
Also, this isn't a shot every time.

240
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
I just one shot only potentially.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, okay.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This isn't a brutal.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
It's not over and over again.

245
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
And if listeners want to play along to get your bottle of crystal head vodka you already

246
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
have in your home.

247
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Yes.

248
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
And make sure to get some crystal skull shot glasses to go with it to make it.

249
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, what are we looking at here?

250
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,360
What's interesting about are they little skulls?

251
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
They're little skulls.

252
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Wow.

253
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Geez.

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,280
And listeners, just so you know, it is 2 25 in the afternoon.

255
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,720
So if you really want to sink it now.

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Here.

257
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
And sit.

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Their glass.

259
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,840
That's the sound of them for the audio medium.

260
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,680
Let's just all take them just in tribute to the all the five timers.

261
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,360
I look something that we for sure have spoken of.

262
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,320
I don't know if this I don't know if this counts.

263
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,520
But when I say that maybe the podcast would not exist without you, you put together in

264
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,680
2014, you put together a Knott's Berry Farm hang.

265
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Yes.

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
Based on people that had brought or sorry if I took that away from you.

267
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,200
At work at Funny or Die various friends.

268
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,120
I just heard different talks of theme parks and I thought I want to go to Knott's Berry

269
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Farm.

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I've never been.

271
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Boy, that'd be fun.

272
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
Kind of don't want to do it alone.

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,920
Can't can I actually raise my hand here and correct the story a little bit, please?

274
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I here's what happened.

275
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
You Facebook messaged me and I think we briefly had talked at Funny or Die.

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,160
I was doing something I don't know if it was I Steve.

277
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
It was it all bleeds together.

278
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Every shoot.

279
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,720
And what it was is that you Facebook messaged me and I'm not sure.

280
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,240
Were we talking about theme parks at Funny or Die?

281
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,680
Could you mess when you said what would be a good theme park to go to with a group of

282
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,560
people that were like interested in this?

283
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,920
And I said, well, you know, I've heard.

284
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,120
I actually haven't been to Knott's, but I've heard Knott's is this and this.

285
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
There's things that are updated about it.

286
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,000
And I think I explained that to you.

287
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, that's cool.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Then like two days later, you go, hey, by the way, do you want to go to Knott's with

289
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
me?

290
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,080
Because everything had just been refurbished.

291
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
So it had.

292
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,280
I was excited about the mind train ride with it had like the most per capita robots.

293
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
That could be a false lie.

294
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Refreshed animatronics.

295
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Yes.

296
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
A ton of them all at once.

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,680
And I was just excited to see what that meant.

298
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Yeah.

299
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah.

300
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,080
Who are the people that would also enjoy this?

301
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Geez.

302
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,320
So Ryan Perez, Doug Jones, Scott Kierner, Mike Carlson, we had met briefly at Conan,

303
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
but never really hung out.

304
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,760
The three of us drove down and fast friends went great.

305
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
And we're that's what the first that I recall.

306
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Like we're essentially doing a podcast out loud.

307
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah.

308
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
About all of the stuff that we know.

309
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
We are exactly evenly matched.

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,160
And Jason was not that we're excluding you from the stories you weren't there.

311
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
It was fault.

312
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Sorry.

313
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I that's fine.

314
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,200
I don't know what I was doing at the time.

315
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I did.

316
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,040
If you went on a weekday, I had a day job at the time and likely good enough.

317
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,120
It would have been a disaster if you had asked him is what he's saying.

318
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
I bungled the whole thing.

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
There definitely would be no podcast.

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,720
Depression year 2014.

321
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
So you know, I had a lot going on.

322
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
You know, so better that you didn't cast that poll.

323
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Day.

324
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Yeah, we're all upset.

325
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,320
Bad vibes, you know.

326
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,320
But after that, I think then like all the groups are merging, hanging out with Mike

327
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,640
a ton and Mike brought Jason into the for you guys were pre standing obsessed

328
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,360
with each other.

329
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,240
Yeah.

330
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
I got to learn of the wonder of Jason.

331
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah.

332
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,800
So you connected dots, which is what you did.

333
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,320
It's why any of us know you put together dots of great creative projects from

334
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
front of your die.

335
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,560
Oh, yeah.

336
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,720
I like setting people up for success, either creatively or through friendship.

337
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
You really do.

338
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,920
And quite earnestly that you came with gifts and you came with with the.

339
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,160
Oh, yeah.

340
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,480
Do you all want gifts?

341
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
There's gifts, too.

342
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,040
On top.

343
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,880
Geez.

344
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Oh, man.

345
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,760
Yes.

346
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes.

347
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,160
I mean, the topic today alone was such a gift.

348
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,760
What have we got?

349
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Oh, my God.

350
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,280
He told me.

351
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,000
It's my man.

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,520
Orange.

353
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,200
Austin Orange.

354
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh, my God.

355
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
It goes on the shoulder.

356
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh, my God.

357
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,800
Oh, my God.

358
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,560
It just catches to your shoulder.

359
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah.

360
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
It's one of these magnet things.

361
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,960
Be careful.

362
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,520
Don't crack that skull.

363
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,840
Is this an affliction shirt?

364
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,880
You'll see.

365
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah.

366
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
If you can describe it as you open it.

367
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,800
I think.

368
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Oh, wow.

369
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
It's it's the thing I always tell my God.

370
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,680
It's long sleeves.

371
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a grumpy shirt from Disneyland.

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,360
And it says it's got a couple like kind of chalk drawn grumpies.

373
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
And it says crusty exterior.

374
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
And then it says bad attitude.

375
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,000
And then it says shaggy eyebrows with extra wrinkle.

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,160
And then there's something else.

377
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,360
It says a lot.

378
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,640
This is your longest descriptor.

379
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,920
I can't even read with it.

380
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,000
It's the busiest shirt I've ever seen with the most fonts I've ever seen in my life.

381
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Yeah.

382
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
It says you want an answer.

383
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
Ask me.

384
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,840
It has like hints of it.

385
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
Hardy, but not at heart.

386
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,040
Yeah, it's like don't ask me.

387
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,880
It's hard to tell.

388
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,680
And then the sleeves are a different material.

389
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,160
It's like almost like you're wearing like long underwear that's coming out of his T-shirt

390
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,960
and the long underwear is like long sleeves.

391
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,480
And it just has a bunch of a different bunch of different fonts.

392
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
It says grumpy everywhere over and over again.

393
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
This is the busiest.

394
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,640
One of sure.

395
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,440
I mean, I say this in the best possible way, one of the worst looking shirts I've ever seen.

396
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Yeah, it was the least pleasing shirt I could find.

397
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,120
Really funny.

398
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,520
Thank you.

399
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,000
Ed Hardy, by way of Disney, is so insane.

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,960
And imagine like wanting to relate to this attitude and to having a bad attitude and a

401
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,880
crusty exterior, but also like, and I want to express that with my favorite cartoon from

402
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
the 1930s.

403
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,440
And on the back, there's a little crest that could like, near the, near the,

404
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
Oh my God, you're right.

405
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,320
It'll rest on your seat.

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,160
So much.

407
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,520
It's got like a tramp stamp.

408
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,280
And it says 37 on the back.

409
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
What's 37?

410
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Couldn't tell you.

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,160
The year it came out?

412
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,520
Isn't it the year it came out?

413
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Is it?

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,080
Isn't it earlier than that?

415
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,920
That's what I thought.

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
Doesn't sound right.

417
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
But Scott, it's your turn to receive a thing.

418
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,560
Oh my God.

419
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:23,960
I see.

420
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,920
I recognize this right away.

421
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,480
I've seen this before online.

422
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,240
This is maybe the only piece of merchandise related to David Copperfield's creation,

423
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
Blue 32.

424
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,480
It's like a, it's a fanny pack or like a,

425
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,160
I still don't understand what it is.

426
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
It's a zipper that goes on forever.

427
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,840
You can keep unzipping Blue's head.

428
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,240
I don't know how to describe it.

429
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,760
Like a stress relief.

430
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,680
I don't know.

431
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,880
I don't know what it is.

432
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,960
Cause it doesn't have straps.

433
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,920
It is not a fanny pack because you couldn't wear it.

434
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,480
You would have to attach your own straps.

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,200
You can store things in there or just unzip and unravel him like a hellraiser pinhead.

436
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,320
This can be your like travel toiletries kit.

437
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,000
You can put it in there.

438
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,360
That's true.

439
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,840
And then when, if it goes through the X-ray, the,

440
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,360
the security guard, the TSA are in for a pleasant treat.

441
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Like, Oh, look at that little thing.

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Look at that creature.

443
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,520
Can I change the five timer rules?

444
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
And instead of me doing a shot,

445
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,200
this,

446
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,240
pouch of Blue does a shot of root beer.

447
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
Sure.

448
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,360
So we can fart.

449
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,840
Yeah.

450
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,440
Yeah.

451
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,280
37 Izzy or Snow White Kimma.

452
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,800
Okay, cool.

453
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
So.

454
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,880
Wow.

455
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,760
Mystery solved.

456
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,360
Incredible.

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,600
Good.

458
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,760
This is, this indicates like not just that, you know,

459
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,280
our, our leaning, our, but our individual leanings within.

460
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,640
Well, I will tell you an interesting thing is listening to the show.

461
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,600
You all are friends, but I also legitimately, I'm a fan of the show and like the show,

462
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,960
which I know I'm here for that, but it's, I look forward to it whenever it comes out and getting to hear it.

463
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,400
I appreciate it.

464
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,640
It's a great way to start any day.

465
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,080
Wow.

466
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,960
Wow.

467
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,040
There's some podcasts I listen to when they come out at night and go to sleep.

468
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,760
I intentionally wait to not drift off to it.

469
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,440
Oh, geez.

470
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,120
That's nice.

471
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,520
Thank you.

472
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,760
I wouldn't mind, you know, I would fall asleep to our own podcast because my podcast sleep rules are,

473
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't want to be interrupted by loud noises and like guitar intros to segments and stuff.

474
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,800
So as long as it's just people talking and not something that's going to spike and wake me up,

475
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
then I'll, I'll put it on.

476
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Right.

477
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Which we don't do.

478
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,560
We haven't done segments and we don't produce little sounds.

479
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,360
No.

480
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,240
No, it's so better.

481
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,720
It's not that we don't know where it came from, but not here on the second gate.

482
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,320
Right.

483
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't know if I said that before about my podcast, what I will fall asleep to.

484
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh, I don't know.

485
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,840
If it's a five timer, let me know.

486
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
It's not a five timer if it is.

487
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,400
If you don't all recognize it.

488
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,840
Do you all want me to pour these and put them by you or?

489
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
That's a process.

490
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,000
No.

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Let's see.

492
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,880
We'll do it.

493
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,760
And I don't want to make you do more work because you've given us amazing gifts.

494
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,720
You've given us great compliments.

495
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,440
One of our favorite people is as the listeners can tell, and we're so happy you're here finally

496
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,080
on the show.

497
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,440
And it happened because you had a great idea for a topic that was unknown to any of us.

498
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,040
But also, as our gifts are very related to all of our interests.

499
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,560
Oh, yeah.

500
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Like it's a laundry list.

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,520
It's a weird hidden gem that nobody knows about and that there are four, three and a

502
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,320
half hours of content for.

503
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes, a ton of treasure trove to send the listeners off to.

504
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,120
But we're going to talk about it here first.

505
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,680
And what you're talking about is the Horror Hall of Fame.

506
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,440
And if you don't know what this is, and we did not before, it's a little confusing because

507
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,520
we did a topic that was that thing was called the Creatures Choice Awards, which was a never

508
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,880
built Disney MGM Studios attraction.

509
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,240
And this is not that it's not a never built attraction.

510
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,160
This is a fully realized series of TV specials from the air from one a year from 1990 to

511
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
1992.

512
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Yes.

513
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,320
That honor the best in horror and weirdo cult filmmaking.

514
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Yes.

515
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,760
And I have a lot of questions about the logistics of what any of it means.

516
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Oh, well, yeah.

517
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,680
The scenes that we'll get into.

518
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,600
But one thing I will encourage potentially any listener to do if you have a Halloween

519
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
party.

520
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,520
These are very good background things to project.

521
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,960
If that's your vibe.

522
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Yes.

523
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
Also, if you want to do what I did, which is today, I had the coziest morning.

524
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's overcast.

525
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I opened the window.

526
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
My apartment got cold.

527
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I made a big cup of coffee.

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,760
I sat under a blanket.

529
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
I watched these.

530
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,960
The segments that interested me were great.

531
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I would get bored.

532
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
I'd go do dishes.

533
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
I'd hear that something boring was over.

534
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Not bad boring.

535
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Good boring.

536
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I think boring can be good.

537
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
This is like a show.

538
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Yeah.

539
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Yeah.

540
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
So relaxing segments.

541
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,560
And there's also because it's like 1990 to 1992 when it was you had to do so much more

542
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,560
work, I feel like to produce something disposable in the production values are still pretty

543
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
good like this.

544
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah, they're really good.

545
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
It's good.

546
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,600
And the guests are a little shocking.

547
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,160
Some of them like they got some big names here.

548
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah, absolutely.

549
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,640
People who provoke standing ovations from the audience.

550
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a huge lineup, which we'll get into.

551
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,120
And speaking of that and kind of why you brought this to us, because so many beloved characters

552
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,880
to us appear in this.

553
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,280
And I think maybe the most prominent way you've been mentioned on the show in the recent past

554
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:38,200
is that we've another running runner, not a five timer, is the notion of the PTR curse

555
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,060
because we've kept running into this that we reference somebody who maybe none of us

556
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,580
have talked about in conversation for a while.

557
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Yeah.

558
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,180
And then just by virtue of mentioning that person, especially if the episode comes out

559
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,900
a little later, then it ends up being like three days before the person dies.

560
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,540
And we've wondered what is it with are we cursed?

561
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,620
Are we legitimately spreading a curse to the world?

562
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,860
And you, I think talking to Mike or somebody, I forget where the Knott's Berry Farm parking

563
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
lot.

564
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,380
This was also a not so gay time than that.

565
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,100
And your theory about the PTR curse, if you want to say it yourself, go ahead or go ahead.

566
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,780
You all are only fans of old people who are more likely to die sooner.

567
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,780
So why?

568
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,900
It's weird to say only fans of old people, but exclusively.

569
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,420
We don't subscribe to any only fans.

570
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
I don't know.

571
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
I don't know.

572
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
You don't know.

573
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
We're not going to get into that today.

574
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
You can.

575
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Yes, you're right.

576
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
No shame in that.

577
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,860
But yes, we do love to talk about people who are.

578
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
I think you said like people that are over 80.

579
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,540
I think that's specifically, I don't know.

580
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
That's a good point.

581
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,900
That is maybe we are not like tapped into the dark spirits or something.

582
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,460
When we when we mentioned these old actors.

583
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,260
Well, Chris Angel, co-worker Franco Jurgoni was only 69.

584
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Passed away of heart attack.

585
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Oh, that's true.

586
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Yeah.

587
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Well, I think that's the curse.

588
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,180
I think that was the curse.

589
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,180
Under 80 is the curse.

590
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,940
Oh, maybe if it's just old age, then maybe it doesn't.

591
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
I like this.

592
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,260
I think the curse is real.

593
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,340
I just think you're reading too much into the curse.

594
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,460
If it's a bit like a Betty Whiter said, we can't take the Betty White was Betty White

595
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,540
was cursed by the like Life magazine presents.

596
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm Alive magazine presents 100 years of still being alive.

597
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,900
So you're saying we can talk about Roger Corman all day long today.

598
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Roger Corman, Ridley Scott north of 95 years old, six year old man.

599
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,340
I couldn't believe I was.

600
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,980
Well, I had this several times.

601
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,820
I was thinking about the P.T.

602
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,420
Rutgers and then going, this person surely is not alive anymore.

603
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,020
Oh, my God, they are. Oh, my God, they are.

604
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,060
And I'm worried about what a lot of people we should be worried about.

605
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,980
Yeah. Apologies to anyone, to any families.

606
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Yeah.

607
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,540
And one one thing I will bring up with this is the way I found and discovered

608
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,340
this was last year, I was remembering.

609
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,460
Oh, my gosh, I know that sometimes at the Oscars, Buzz or Shrek would present

610
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,700
something. I know I'm misconstruing.

611
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,100
Sometimes they're just sitting in an audience clapping, right?

612
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,980
Like looking at each other with their eyebrows raised.

613
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,420
Sometimes they're on the stage or Yoda's at the MTV twice awards.

614
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,100
In my mind, I just thought surely Chuckie the doll has presented at something.

615
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,220
Some awards somewhere. Is that's what led you to?

616
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,620
Yes. And so I typed in Chuckie presents at award show.

617
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,300
And then I was like, oh, there it is.

618
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,780
Ninety minutes, three of them.

619
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,460
Wow. Mother load.

620
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,660
It's great. What a great way to find it.

621
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,700
That's awesome. Yeah, because I am always amazed.

622
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,780
There's still stuff because we're all, I think, bottomless pits for weird

623
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,060
shellac stuff that no one remembers.

624
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,460
Obviously, we're not the only there's plenty of people on the Internet that do

625
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,020
this, too. But it is always impressive to me when a whole bunch of content is

626
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,260
available that I've never heard of.

627
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Hours of it.

629
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,260
You tap like, what is it like?

630
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,900
Like, let's reference an old thing.

631
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,340
The Beverly Hillbillies and Jed go shooting at some.

632
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,780
Yeah, we shooting at some food and then up through the ground comes a bubble and

633
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,300
bubble and crew and we're we're just shooting when we're searching on YouTube.

634
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
We're we're trying to shoot some food.

635
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,460
Yes. Then we end up hitting crude.

636
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,020
And how great does it feel when all the crude splashes?

637
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,620
Great to get hit by crude.

638
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,500
This also brought. Did you see when you YouTube there is a 1974 horror Hall of

639
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,780
Fame as well? Yes, which is unrelated entirely.

640
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Totally unrelated by Vincent Price and dreadfully boring.

641
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,060
So boring. It's like a talk.

642
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,380
It's kind of a talk show. It's not a Hall of Fame.

643
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,500
I watched it after.

644
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,460
Well, I watched seconds of it before I got bored of it after I watched the three

645
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,700
main this morning. Yeah.

646
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,620
And in my notes, I had written sort of a thesis of this is all three part one,

647
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,500
part two, part three.

648
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,620
All have elements that could have been a great show where it's the last one has

649
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
all these musical.

650
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,780
And you're sure that would have been nice to pepper in throughout.

651
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,860
Yes. Oh, yeah.

652
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,220
Not in the previous years. Yeah.

653
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:02,660
Some of them have more hosts like seeing Jason present the hockey mask killer,

654
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,700
not Jason Sheridan.

655
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,420
No, I would be nice to see more characters and Chuckie just all across the board.

656
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,180
Would have it would have been nice to see more interaction with that or if the

657
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,300
mummy has a speech.

658
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,340
And then I get to this Vincent Price one from 1974 and it's full of sketches and

659
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,940
skits and I don't like them and they're not good.

660
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,540
No, it's but it's like he's doing a whole bit where like he's doing his normal

661
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,100
thing and then it's like Frank Gorshin's here and he just does a sit down

662
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,060
interview with Frank Gorshin about what horror movies he liked.

663
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,100
And it's an opportunity for Frank Gorshin to do his impressions.

664
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,860
And you're like, what is this?

665
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,660
Like one of my talk show, I guess fit the name.

666
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,420
Yeah, I wasn't sure how you all wanted to discuss all three of these or just dance

667
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
around topics.

668
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,820
I just real quick.

669
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,980
I want to say two things about the Vincent Price.

670
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,460
We are sorry.

671
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
On to the nineties.

672
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,820
I'm sorry.

673
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,820
I just wanted to get it out so we can move on because it's my problem.

674
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,820
It's no one else problem.

675
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,380
I need to say it.

676
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,460
Both Riddlers are on the special Aston and Gorshin do sit down interviews, which

677
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,100
but they don't interact and there's no mention of the fact that they're both

678
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,180
Riddlers, not let not Ontario Elementary School student Jim Carrey.

679
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,820
Right.

680
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,620
And then there's pictures on the wall.

681
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,060
Did you catch?

682
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,740
Did you watch all this boring special?

683
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,460
No, no, no.

684
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,060
I was very clear that I watched second.

685
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,260
So that's fair.

686
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,580
You're right.

687
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,740
You're talking to I kind of I wrote this seemed like the safest bet.

688
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,780
I could ever make is like, I'm not going to watch the Vincent Price special

689
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,100
because I know Mike will.

690
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,980
But in return, the exchange was I watched all three other ones because

691
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,820
within 10 minutes of the first one, I was like, well, this is a pleasure.

692
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,100
This is not a chore.

693
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,180
He's pointing to like legends of horror on the wall and pictures and he points

694
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,300
at Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.

695
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,380
And I went to Star Wars, Grand Moff Tarkin and Count Dooku on the wall

696
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,740
there, but they don't appear.

697
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,180
So I was hoping they were going to be in as well.

698
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,660
Photos of them on the walls of them on the wall.

699
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,900
Did you say that to myself?

700
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,940
The baby, the baby, baby, baby.

701
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,460
I was up with early this morning.

702
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,260
Count Dooku, Dooku, Dooku.

703
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,260
30 years later, he would hammer her baby.

704
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,380
Can you say hammer horror films?

705
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,780
So anyway, let's go to the stuff we're actually talking about.

706
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,700
Well, OK, listeners, if you want to check these out before we talk about them or

707
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,380
after we talk or just flip through them, whatever you want, the YouTube user is

708
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,140
Doug Tilly. Thanks, Doug Tilly.

709
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
And we'll link to him somehow.

710
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,820
But other than that, I mean, we don't have to be hard fast.

711
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,580
We could generally go in order.

712
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,500
But like, you know, because I think the cold open is great to talk about, because

713
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
what a mysterious opening and ties right into stuff we've been talking about this

714
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,020
month because we covered Hitchcock and we covered the omnipresence of the psycho

715
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,540
house and universal lore and Robert Englund.

716
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,860
Have we said that yet?

717
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,660
The Robert Englund.

718
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,540
The host of all of them.

719
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,340
And he's I think just done either four or five Nightmare on Elm Street movies.

720
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,060
So he's at the top of the world.

721
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,260
Freddy Krueger himself.

722
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,420
And it is an interesting novelty that he would be himself and not for it.

723
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,780
So you get a lot of him.

724
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,580
If you want to see.

725
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,020
And I guess my before we get into the sketch, my takeaway is that Robert

726
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,780
Englund is a big dork.

727
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
That is absolutely my takeaway as well.

728
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,660
I said, well, this kind of demystifies the murderous Freddy Krueger, doesn't it?

729
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,060
But doesn't it make the performance of Freddy Krueger so much more impressive?

730
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,740
I guess so.

731
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,500
I think it does, because when you see clips, which they do, they keep finding

732
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,780
reason in all these to show Fred and have him talk about my alter ego.

733
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,980
And as a kid, Freddy was an idea.

734
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,540
I didn't see any of these movies as a kid, but the idea of Freddy was this maybe

735
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,820
a pinhead or Freddy were like the scariest ideas.

736
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,780
Like a pinhead.

737
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,860
Yeah, light tangent.

738
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,420
What's everyone's experiences in history with horror?

739
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,780
Personally, good question.

740
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,260
Is this a five timers trick?

741
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,100
Because I feel like I've said a lot.

742
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,660
No, this is a genuine question.

743
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,340
Scared. We're all we're all scared.

744
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,420
Scaredy cats. Yeah.

745
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,340
Yes, Scott, how about you?

746
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,900
What's your history with horror movies?

747
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,740
You know, obviously scaredy cat as well.

748
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,460
I don't think I tried to not make a huge deal of it.

749
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,660
Child's play just came out.

750
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,140
The mere notion, the idea of all of them, the covers scared me too much

751
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,220
to even go near anything.

752
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,460
And it's been interesting and delightful to start watching them lately.

753
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,660
And yes, watch like Nightmare on Elm Street.

754
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,900
I've seen a bunch of those now and go, wow, they're stupid.

755
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,220
They're so stupid.

756
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,180
Like, I guess maybe you have to be just like a raw scared of everything.

757
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
And they dialed our young teen brain.

758
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,860
They're gross and they feel like music videos and they're so much fun.

759
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,300
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

760
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,180
This is a five timers, but it's because of the questions.

761
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,380
I said it, I think on the ground when we talk about gremlins.

762
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,100
I thought these movies were snuff film.

763
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,300
I thought they were like you murdered people.

764
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,940
And I was like, why would you ever do that?

765
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,140
And some of these are the goofiest, campiest things I've ever seen.

766
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,060
Because growing up, I was also a scaredy scaredy.

767
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,300
And I was scared of Jumanji when he got sucked into the board.

768
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,740
And just every animal in Jumanji scared me.

769
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,700
The animals were so abrasive.

770
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,220
And I'm sure now you would watch and just go terrible CGI.

771
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,100
But at the time when you didn't know any better when it's oh, he's

772
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
he's turning into a monkey. He's trapped in quick.

773
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,300
So just movies that were for children.

774
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,620
And yeah, scared me.

775
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,100
So I was a little afraid.

776
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,020
My mom checked out arachnophobia and said

777
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,700
because it was in the family section.

778
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,980
She went, oh, this is like a dark comedy.

779
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,940
You like Beetlejuice.

780
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,460
And I was like, actually, Beetlejuice scared me when he turned into a snake.

781
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,740
And I stopped watching.

782
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,220
I eventually finished it.

783
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,740
But so then I put on arachnophobia mainly.

784
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,340
I love it. I love the movie.

785
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,860
It is more of a scary drama with two or three jokes throughout.

786
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,140
But it's really good. And I like it.

787
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,340
But the spider's scary.

788
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,180
So I was freaked out.

789
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,780
And then going to Blockbuster, like you, I was scared of movie

790
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,420
covers where I would just see it.

791
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,500
If I saw it with Tim Curry, I would like turn it around.

792
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,180
So if I had to go back down that aisle, I wouldn't see it again.

793
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,380
Whoa. Wow. Really?

794
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,540
Yes. Sounds like us.

795
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,340
Yeah, that's us.

796
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,500
Every single one of them.

797
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Scary monsters. Gross.

798
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,100
No, thank you, Chuckie.

799
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,300
No, I don't like it.

800
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,980
And then when I was about, I think seven or eight, maybe nine.

801
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,420
Who knows? Child.

802
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,340
I it was Saturday morning.

803
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,740
I had finished cartoons and then I left the room and just something was on after

804
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,140
the programming had ended.

805
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,860
And it was the the Freddy's Dead.

806
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,500
That nightmare on Elm Street.

807
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,220
So it had been the one they're promoting in one.

808
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,420
Yeah, it had been a franchise for a while, but I missed the opening credits.

809
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,900
So I didn't know what it was.

810
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,260
And then I saw this guy and he is in a house.

811
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,100
And then Freddy Krueger shows up, dresses the wicked witch.

812
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,620
And it's a parody of Wizard of Oz because the house is flying through the air.

813
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,260
And then he's like, I forget what he's something like, you're a dirty bitch.

814
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,820
Or it's probably something that's related.

815
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,260
And then he lands and then a

816
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,700
Freddy is driving a bus and hits him with a bus.

817
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,980
And then the guy goes flying through the air, cuts a hole in the air

818
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,060
of reality like Wile E.

819
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,180
Coyote. And so I just thought, oh, this is silly.

820
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,340
And a cartoon. Maybe I am OK with horror movies.

821
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,300
And then something gross happened.

822
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
I was like, oh, too scary.

823
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,260
But then when I was 11 or 12, I dove into it

824
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,940
and I had friends where we would just go through everything.

825
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,740
Because I love watching movies, always have power through them.

826
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,340
And I sort of was running out of movies and thought, oh, here's an entire genre.

827
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,660
I can power through this giant area that just goes and goes.

828
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,260
Yeah. Which now you're a big horror guy. Oh, yeah.

829
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,780
I love him. Yeah. You see everything.

830
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,660
And you want to see him in theaters with reactions and oh, yes.

831
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,500
Encourage people to. You're a movie buff, I would say.

832
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,300
I would say that. Yeah.

833
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,420
Well, I would also say you're the originator of saying like,

834
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm a little movie buff boy.

835
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,580
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,700
I say, world, I'm not buff with my body.

837
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm buff with my movie brain.

838
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
My famous quote. That's right.

839
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,900
You can quote him on that.

840
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,380
Um, throughout this, as movies come up, as inductees come up,

841
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,660
if there's if there's something you want to say, hey, this one you should check out.

842
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,620
This is kind of a good little special because I assume that

843
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,420
that I or we have not seen a lot of.

844
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,340
There's older movies that I've never heard of that I want to see from this.

845
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,740
I want to see Boris Karloff in the body snatcher.

846
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
I don't know what that is. That looks like so much fun.

847
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,220
Yes. I want to see the Vincent Price movie where he has a big Afro

848
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,420
that doesn't look scary at all, but I don't know what that movie is.

849
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,940
Well, I think every year they did hear some horror movies coming up soon.

850
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,900
And those were very interesting to see because some of them are like

851
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,860
psycho for Adam's family and then Jacob's ladder.

852
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,700
So you get it. But then the one year it was like three things

853
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,020
where I was like, I have never heard of like Pet Cemetery 2.

854
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,420
Yes. Alien 3.

855
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,660
One of them was to sleep with a vampire,

856
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,300
which where they chose kind of to sort of go to claw arms

857
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,660
reaching for each other and they're glowing as they read.

858
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,300
And then I was like, what the hell is this movie?

859
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,700
I looked it up. No Wikipedia page.

860
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,260
Not a wow. So nobody cared enough.

861
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,900
So those those are there's there'll be some that we won't recommend.

862
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,380
But other ones, if you want to shout out anything you especially like.

863
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,220
But to get into it, the cold open to the first, which I find the first one,

864
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,900
the strongest, I'd say in three.

865
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,740
But Robert Englund, he's approaching the famous psycho house,

866
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,100
walking up from the motel to the house.

867
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,580
Slowly opens the door.

868
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,540
He's in like a white tux, I believe.

869
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,020
So we're seeing Debonair Dasher.

870
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,460
This is no no hideous Freddy Krueger.

871
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,300
This is Robert and slow approach to the door opens it creaky.

872
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,780
And then it cuts to the other side where he has opened a door in the packed

873
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,900
Universal slash Gibson Amphitheater

874
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00,820
and where there is a gigantic audience who all scream for seeing him.

875
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,060
And he says, alive audience.

876
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,500
Now, this is going to be really scary,

877
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,500
which kind of gives you a sense of the tone of Robert Englund.

878
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,060
I don't understand why.

879
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,860
How do you open the door of the psycho house and that's what's inside?

880
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,020
I guess that's cool.

881
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
So a giant amphitheater in there.

882
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,740
I believe opening the front door of the psycho house is not an iconic cinema moment.

883
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,100
That's true of all the things.

884
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,460
Well, yeah, it must have happened in one of them.

885
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,220
Oh, well, the P.I. goes in doors and then

886
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,380
Janet Lee's character sister goes in and eventually finds mother.

887
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,740
But I felt like they were playing up,

888
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,460
touching the doorknob, being nervous of the doorknob.

889
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,420
Yeah, it wasn't like peering.

890
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,860
He was peering through a hole in the wall and he saw the audience like Norman.

891
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,700
Or like, yeah, and then started masturbating like in 1998.

892
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,260
Norman, the can I ask?

893
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,540
I just want to confirm something that the thumbnail for the first one of these

894
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,620
says Cineplex Odeon Theater.

895
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,060
Is that the city walk?

896
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,180
What is now the universal AMC?

897
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,340
You got it. OK, that's a weird thing.

898
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,220
City walk that I'm sure we talked about then that the theater predated. Right.

899
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,700
And there's shots of it because there's a promotional tie in with Cineplex

900
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,420
Odeon theaters and it was all there, like probably not the IMAX theater.

901
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,460
But like you see the staircase, the place where we saw Avatar not long ago,

902
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,540
your favorite movie theater to go to.

903
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,100
But it predated the rest of city walks.

904
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,940
So they like it was a freestanding movie theater up on the Universal Hill.

905
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,620
And then they connected it with our favorite place in the world.

906
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,300
And when when did that come up in that?

907
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,940
Because I was trying to scrub through after I watch it and find it,

908
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,940
because I think it's just a really quick shot.

909
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,220
It was a I agree.

910
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,380
They got me excited to watch it.

911
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,580
Like, oh, the Cineplex Odeon Theater.

912
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,900
Yeah, for the city. Well, before CityWalk.

913
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,500
It was like it was a tie in for like a contest or so.

914
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,100
Or they were saying how they chose the inductees for the Horror Hall of Fame.

915
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,700
Which, by the way, that's ostensibly the idea here is that six or seven

916
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:12,540
movies or shows or people or comics or magazines or entire studios.

917
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,380
Yes, it's very loosely defined.

918
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,100
Any entity that's contributed to horror over the years gets

919
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,220
and inducted with a bunch of other fun stuff in between.

920
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,660
And a mix of like very big names and like movies that entered the canon.

921
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,020
I feel like really quickly, like Alien is not that old at this point.

922
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,780
Yeah, yeah, true. But it was such a smash hit.

923
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,220
It immediately like put, you know,

924
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,100
Ridley Scott on the map and Sigourney Weaver, you know.

925
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,180
Yeah, yeah. When the third was coming out around then.

926
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,820
And it's like obscure people, too.

927
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,740
Oh, yeah. For like a mainstream.

928
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,660
Yeah, there'll be very big buildups and we'll go the daughter of the person.

929
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,940
That's yes, that's true.

930
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,020
There are a lot of people. Yes.

931
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,620
Kids and aunts and nieces are accepting awards and are being honored.

932
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,460
But like editors in chief.

933
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,900
Yeah, Forrest Ackerman.

934
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,740
It's a name I've probably caught. Yes.

935
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,940
Over the years. That's the he's the editor of

936
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,980
the Mott.

937
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,660
What is it? Monsters.

938
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,860
Famous monsters of film land.

939
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,300
Many of his nickname, Forry, Uncle Forry, the act monster, Dr.

940
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,340
Acula.

941
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,500
That's good.

942
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,780
This is real quick with this guy, because I this is a magazine

943
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm sure I would have liked if I was into monsters.

944
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,660
There's a really funny picture where land.

945
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,220
John Lannis is talking about this.

946
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,060
And they put his face on a magazine that says Monster.

947
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,180
I like this.

948
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,380
But I like this reminds me of any time they're doing a piece on like Dr.

949
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,020
Demento and Dr.

950
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,260
Mendo is very old at this point.

951
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,980
And it's just like an old man who's trying to do some shtick.

952
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,100
And he's like a little too tired to be doing it.

953
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,660
Then you see it's like basement and it's just full of crap.

954
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,780
It's just full of like all this like old monster crap.

955
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,020
And he's being honored here. I like this is what I'm saying.

956
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,220
I'm not trying to make fun of him, but they got a lot of weirdos

957
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,260
into a room.

958
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,780
Yeah, it's pretty if you just take who here's who was on it this year

959
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,180
that they were all in one place together.

960
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,740
And yes, yeah, for him.

961
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,580
Yeah, I love that that they're honoring like I want to know that backstage.

962
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,220
I want to know what the green room is like of all these people who decide.

963
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,740
Do we know who did did they say who decides?

964
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,780
I know there's like a council who the board is of Fangoria magazine.

965
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,540
And that was a show with an audience poll at Cineplex Odeon theaters.

966
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,900
That's why it came up. Yes.

967
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,740
I was curious more or less how real any of that is.

968
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,740
Yeah, is it just can we get I do visit the award itself?

969
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,140
I like the award. I like a spooky specter with a cloak.

970
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,820
Yeah, it's a great looks cool.

971
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,620
Yeah, actually is the award.

972
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,500
But like in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, we know on the committee,

973
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,740
deciding committee, little Stephen, Tom Morello, Dave Grohl.

974
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,220
I wanted like names.

975
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,420
Yes, we know we all we of course we all know that.

976
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,380
We all know that we not a day goes by.

977
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,820
We don't discuss Tom Morello's is on the board for the.

978
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,100
But then rage didn't get in, I don't think last time.

979
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm fair when isn't is what is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

980
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,740
If not the ultimate machine.

981
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,140
That's a good point.

982
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,740
Can I just this will spoil some of the people who appear.

983
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,020
But I think where you really had is when I was poking around this, is this a topic?

984
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,180
You see something like this and you go, well, absolutely.

985
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,300
I because we love our big lists of from our Disney specials and what have you.

986
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,860
Here's a here's a big list of everybody who's on.

987
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,420
And then first of all, it starts with we're zooming up and over

988
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,780
the Universal Studios fountain, the old neon fountain, beautiful glass bricks.

989
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,020
Oh, God preserved still there.

990
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,540
Yes.

991
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah, I'm never going away.

992
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,860
And the globe looks fair.

993
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,500
The globe in Florida, they update it as they were updating the park.

994
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,460
Like with climate change, they change the coastlines.

995
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,940
They received it.

996
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,540
They shaved little bits off.

997
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,420
Yeah, that's nice of them.

998
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,580
They made it look like the modern universal logo in on the globe in Florida

999
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,780
and the the universal globe in Hollywood.

1000
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,260
Still the classic just steel kind of thing.

1001
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,860
Yeah.

1002
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,940
When you when you go up and over that neon fountain, it's I mean,

1003
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,140
I couldn't produce all the things that have it, but I know a big one,

1004
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,940
which is American Gladiators.

1005
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,940
That's an it's just it adds excitement to me to a show like, oh, man,

1006
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,340
and there's that at the beginning.

1007
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,100
And it's happening right next to they're shooting this next to Fievel's Playland,

1008
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,580
wherever fake groucho is getting ready.

1009
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,700
And also just to break open that beginning, I should have written down the pun.

1010
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,460
I don't remember, but where it's like, oh, filmed in stereo, recorded in stereo.

1011
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,300
The icon is a skull and it might be like screamy or fear.

1012
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,100
Yeah, it's a pun and it's a scary skull with headphones on.

1013
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
So just these little details.

1014
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,500
I believe he says, does he say undead from Universal Studios?

1015
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,100
Sure does.

1016
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,060
Instead of live.

1017
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,020
Yeah, I unfortunately take it right after that.

1018
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,220
But here's this is too long.

1019
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,980
I'll stop it at some point.

1020
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,780
But this is here's here's the names who appear in Horror Hall of Fame one.

1021
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,940
It's the horror hall of fame and all star tribute to terror.

1022
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,580
Starring Robert England with special appearance

1023
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,580
by Boris J.

1024
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,100
Ackerman, Linda Blair, Big Bob, Veronica Cartwright,

1025
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,620
Roger Horman, Sarah Perlman, Chuckie, The Threat Keeper,

1026
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:37,700
Stillers, Joe Dante, William Creakett, Catherine Hicks, Pat Hitchcock, Jason.

1027
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,980
That's really what Jason.

1028
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,060
I love all the fictional characters mixed in with like Phyllis Diller, Pat Hitchcock.

1029
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,220
Oh, it's really funny.

1031
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,660
And then and that's narrated by Shadow Stevens,

1032
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,100
who was the fill in announcer when on Larry Sanders, when Hank takes over as the host.

1033
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,820
Wow. So I like hearing Shadow Stevens voice for that.

1034
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,100
He was the Craig Ferguson announcer.

1035
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,220
Oh, really?

1036
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,060
Yeah. I didn't know that.

1037
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,420
And then many other things.

1038
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,620
And Dave's World.

1039
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,140
Very interesting.

1040
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,100
So then but then you get after all those names, you get this.

1041
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,980
The team will take care of your breath.

1042
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,580
The rest is up to you.

1043
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,500
And by Halsey, a lot of great sponsors for these.

1044
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:34,540
Yeah. Lady Stetson, Lady Stetson, which was very strange.

1045
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,740
The other perfume they mentioned is all or cologne.

1046
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:43,620
I think it's iron, iron cologne and Lady Stetson iron.

1047
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,340
Haven't heard of that one.

1048
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,740
I don't really wear cologne.

1049
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,900
It's not a quality that.

1050
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,260
Oh, yeah, I wrote I wrote down preferred preferred stock is what I have.

1051
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,820
Yes. Preferred stock cologne, which that comes right before.

1052
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,140
Like there's that.

1053
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:03,740
And then an ad for like guests of the Hall of Fame stay at Universal Hilton and the towers.

1054
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,940
Like it's the advertising that hotel or Universal City Hotel and Towers,

1055
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,900
whose slightly different name.

1056
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,020
I want to be a guest of the Hall of Fame so bad.

1057
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,620
I want in this year to have been flown in.

1058
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,020
I arrive at the Universal City and they kept a sweet hotel and tower.

1059
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,100
And then I get a gift, a gift basket full of preferred stock cologne.

1060
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,180
Yeah. You get to meet Elvira and Roger Corman.

1061
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,660
That's the greatest. Wow.

1062
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,020
You get your per diem, you get your reimbursement check for your tux

1063
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:40,020
rental from Friar Tux, Southern California's finest chain of tuxedo rental shops.

1064
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,900
I didn't think about it at the time, but we really it's very clear now

1065
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,980
that we lost something when this Gibson amphitheater was bulldozed

1066
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,940
to make room for Harry Potter.

1067
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,180
That like not having things live from Universal Studios, Hollywood sucks.

1068
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,740
Yeah, like they should build if they're going to build stuff for the Olympics

1069
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:03,060
in 2028 or whatever, they should build a new amphitheater somewhere on the grounds.

1070
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,820
Sure. Just to be able for that phrase to be just to have that phrase.

1071
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,620
So people are staying. Yes.

1072
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,060
Pummel North shared. Yeah.

1073
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Exclusively. Sure. Sure.

1074
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,340
But I don't know where to go.

1075
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,620
An expensive taxpayer paid for Pummel Horse Stadium.

1076
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,660
Yeah, that's what we need.

1077
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,060
And yes, but there also still should be hidden bookcases

1078
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,980
that are doors and castle walls.

1079
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1080
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,300
Keep it with the endless smoke.

1081
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,860
Too much fog, fog that won't quit.

1082
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Yeah, that's the vibe of this thing.

1083
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,820
I mean, it's a great what an ornate, beautiful, massive state.

1084
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,420
Is this the whole thing is it has a vibe of early MTV Movie Awards,

1085
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,300
which I really like.

1086
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,220
I still I'll watch any of the 90s movie awards anytime because they're

1087
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,700
they're kooky like that, too.

1088
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,340
We give the award to Chewbacca or the current.

1089
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:53,580
He has a throne above everyone in some wide shots.

1090
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,380
You can see it's just like way in the distance so that they can get those crowd

1091
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,780
shots. Yeah, it was everything behind hand from the person who just got the award

1092
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,780
to the crypt keeper and like the logistics of that were that that puppets got to work

1093
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,060
because they don't want to make Pat Hitchcock come back like it could go back and forth.

1094
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,540
You need to do it again, Pat.

1095
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,300
Yeah, I was so excited when I saw I feel like

1096
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,420
I'm always happy when I see the crypt keeper.

1097
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,700
I don't think I've ever like, oh, the crypt keeper.

1098
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,940
But it's just like especially doing parades or award shows or little bits like this.

1099
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,020
Terrific. Canonically, I also understand why he hates commercials and makes jokes

1100
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,540
about them because he's from HBO where there are no commercials.

1101
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,300
That's right.

1102
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,620
So it's OK for him to make seven commercial jokes at every break per episode.

1103
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,540
The same way the star of Dream On would have felt

1104
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,180
or anyone who was on the show, Perversions of Science.

1105
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,020
Oh, yes. Starting. What was that again?

1106
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,540
That was that anthology series.

1107
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,980
Was that the one with like the horny intro?

1108
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,020
Yeah, very horny show. Yeah, there was the episode with Kevin Pollock.

1109
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,020
But is that the one where in the intro, it's like following following around

1110
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,380
a bunch of silver people, CGI, and it's like women being made?

1111
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,180
I believe so. OK. Yeah, it was a horny HBO sci fi anthology.

1112
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,820
It's not like Twilight Zone where it's just here's an eye, here's a door.

1113
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,300
It's what if the robot was in a sexy factory?

1114
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,780
But it's the future. But there's only robots.

1115
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,140
It's a confounding intro to an anthology.

1116
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,980
Or what HBO wanted. Yeah.

1117
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,260
Because you mentioned CGI, one of the clips they preview,

1118
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,100
one of these specials is The Lawnmower Man,

1119
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,100
which I just knew as a kid was a scary movie.

1120
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,660
It was not a thing for me.

1121
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,340
And all they show is just this very strange CGI

1122
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,940
sequence of Jobe.

1123
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,460
And I am like, well, now I feel like I have to see this.

1124
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,100
I love this aesthetic so much.

1125
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,180
Like, oh, highly recommend it.

1126
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,060
I highly, highly recommend it.

1127
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,700
It's got a lot of fun. Yes.

1128
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,420
It's it's it's like we're in upsetting and you'll be long parts of it.

1129
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,540
You're like, get me out of this movie.

1130
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,300
But the good the things that the strong parts of it.

1131
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,940
It's basically a scary version of Flowers for the Elginon.

1132
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,500
Yes. Yeah. Right.

1133
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,300
Yeah. Yeah. But that involves cyberpunk and hackery.

1134
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,180
Neon centrifuges, gyroscopes.

1135
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,060
I feel like early CGI and like 3D objects,

1136
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,100
whether it was in movies and TV or like just on Trapper Keeper covers,

1137
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,100
are of a piece in my mind of like influencing a young child.

1138
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,180
Like you mentioned VHS covers and I think like book covers.

1139
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,820
Choose your own adventure. Goosebumps or fear straight.

1140
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,700
Like I would just stare at these covers like in the way that people talk about

1141
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,020
staring at record covers like these just held such a big sway to me.

1142
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,660
And I probably like hyped up some real garbage far too much

1143
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,220
because I just brought into I think I just liked illustration and design work.

1144
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,780
You know, I think very lucky to be like it was interesting

1145
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,780
and neat to get a lot of early CGI that would like we were kind of

1146
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,860
we're the first generation of kids to get that.

1147
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,900
And where sometimes I think about how like commercials we were watching

1148
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,020
on Nickelodeon that we just thought, oh, I like this commercial is kind of fun.

1149
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,740
Might have been quietly like that's Pixar trying out.

1150
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,340
You know, that was one of their early gigs on the way to Toy Story.

1151
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,740
I don't know. I think we're lucky.

1152
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,940
There's a lot of cool stuff in that Light and Magic documentary on Disney Plus,

1153
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,060
where they talk about like early CGI using commercials and stuff.

1154
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,060
That's pretty fun.

1155
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,460
You know, what's the might do you watch the Minds Eye?

1156
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,660
Any of those videos?

1157
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,300
Those are they're like compilations of it's like there is a bunch of beyond

1158
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,340
the Minds Eye and you know what I'm talking about?

1159
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,100
Sounds familiar.

1160
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,860
But they just compiled like any all right, any bizarre CGI.

1161
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,660
Just put it on.

1162
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,580
It's just like the trippy, bizarre, extremely outdated.

1163
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,500
Yeah, a lot of it is preserved on YouTube.

1164
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,780
I mean, I think that's like some of the best stuff you can find on like Twitter

1165
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,460
or Tumblr stuff is just accounts that catalog

1166
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,700
all like old book covers and old CGI clips like.

1167
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,980
And this also has some good transitions.

1168
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,740
It's got the big skeleton hand that pulls things apart.

1169
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,660
Oh, yes, they've got good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1170
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,300
It's look, the whole thing is great.

1171
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,980
Great graphics package.

1172
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,740
You know, the great announcer, great host, great presenters,

1173
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,260
cutaways to the audience.

1174
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:21,060
And it's a bunch of actors and seat fillers, but then like a Frankenstein or a mummy.

1175
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,660
I mean, it's it's it's so fun.

1176
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,180
How much more fun did you all have watching these than any recent Academy Awards?

1177
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,980
Oh, yeah. 10,000 times more.

1178
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,340
Yes. Yeah, I don't think you're underestimating.

1179
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,980
I'm not overestimating that number.

1180
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,500
It was also still very like reverent, though it was not.

1181
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,260
Even though it's like a bunch of fun, it was still like we love this.

1182
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,940
And these people deserve to be honored.

1183
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,540
Like there was not and it was not as like flippant as maybe an MTV award or something.

1184
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,500
And you could see that people,

1185
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,700
a lot of these might not be people that get applause on a stage right from people,

1186
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,780
even if there is in all reality a sign going like clap now, clap now.

1187
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,260
Maybe not that because this is such a like package.

1188
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,780
Yeah. You know, they're going to edit it after the fact.

1189
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,260
But I do think one of the things I really genuinely like about it

1190
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,500
that did sort of emotionally touch me in a way was Vincent Price

1191
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,620
when it's the interview in the backyard and you're like, oh, OK,

1192
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,100
so they're just kind of copying this together real quick.

1193
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,620
And then he's very funny on it.

1194
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,740
Very witty.

1195
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,460
Seems touched for horror to be celebrated after his history.

1196
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,140
And then the second one, he gets brought up by Elvira's in a tux

1197
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,460
gets to like bask in applause.

1198
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,260
And it's very sweet. And I like it.

1199
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,580
Yeah. Seeing it because he died not long after these.

1200
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,020
And yeah, so seeing him get a lot of appreciation and sit with his good pal,

1201
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,380
Roddy McDowell, this whole thing is just full of names that we want to hear.

1202
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,340
It's everybody we want to see.

1203
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,420
And Scott, have you gotten to that Colombo yet?

1204
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,140
Which Colombo?

1205
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,940
Roddy? No, no.

1206
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,140
And for a treat. OK, OK.

1207
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,340
And for a treat. Yeah.

1208
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,180
Andrew sent me down the the Colombo line, which is great.

1209
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,180
I almost told you about one the other day, the Donald Pleasance winemaker one.

1210
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,540
Oh, no. Oh, you got a lot of entertainment.

1211
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,580
We get a very cumbersome solution.

1212
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,140
It is a journey, but it is so funny to see Donald Pleasance,

1213
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,660
who I feel like most people would know as the doctor from the Halloween,

1214
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,540
the original Halloween movies.

1215
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,300
And he is just playing like a wine snob in the 70s,

1216
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,420
where I feel like everyone was like, yeah,

1217
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,380
alcohol in America was really quite shitty until like the 80s.

1218
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,980
Like wine in America was pretty rough.

1219
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,660
And like a wine snob then is like what are you doing?

1220
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,020
Yeah. Hearing him talk about stuff.

1221
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,900
And I'm just like, I have never heard of that kind of wine.

1222
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,820
It's a it's a terrific episode.

1223
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,660
It's really like every single episode of Colombo. It's terrific.

1224
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,980
You're right on the money.

1225
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,860
So that also recommend this is an episode full of recommends to the audience.

1226
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,820
I don't know how I felt.

1227
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:56,060
We went to the final Colombo, the weird rave episode with Matthew Reese.

1228
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,580
Is it? It's unpleasant.

1229
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,900
That's a little weird seeing him.

1230
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,540
Yeah. Seeing Colombo have to deal with like glow sticks.

1231
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,180
And the the font is different.

1232
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,460
Everything is meaner.

1233
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,660
Yeah. The music is sort of CSI.

1234
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,100
But they keep hitting shit between the camera and the actors like, no,

1235
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,020
get that blurry foreground out of there.

1236
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,700
It's not what it's about.

1237
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,140
But the one more the one more thing at the end was very nice.

1238
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,180
I didn't like the episode.

1239
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,940
And then when he like explains how it works and how it cracked.

1240
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,020
I was like, well, you did it again, Colombo.

1241
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,140
You suckered me in.

1242
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,780
Yeah. Yeah. Even in the even in a bad one, even in a 2000s one about raves.

1243
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,340
Where can you stream Colombo?

1244
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,300
To be to be great, crisp quality commercials, not too bad to be maybe

1245
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,260
quietly in the running for best streaming service.

1246
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,340
Very obvious for to be is that the

1247
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,700
I believe the audio levels of commercials are the same as the programming.

1248
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,340
So you don't have to ride the remote.

1249
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,700
Yeah. It's a small thing.

1250
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,260
Revolutionary.

1251
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,740
But it's very nice to just put it on and be like,

1252
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,620
here's that one commercial that the algorithm thinks I like.

1253
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,540
I'll see this only and nothing else.

1254
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,780
Yeah, it is kind of everywhere.

1255
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,820
I feel like right now I think it's on Roku channel and Peacock.

1256
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,900
It should be more places.

1257
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,660
I just want everyone to have access to Colombo.

1258
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,060
Peacock for sure has the very young Colombo TV movie.

1259
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,580
I forget which one it is where Peter Falk just looks so young

1260
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,060
and his hair looks normal.

1261
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,180
Yeah.

1262
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,380
Oh, it's imagine flipping from that you end the 2003 rave one.

1263
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,020
And then that's the thumbnail right after.

1264
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,100
Oh, boy. I just jumped five decades. Yeah.

1265
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,420
So anyway, the other highlights of that, what's some stuff?

1266
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,300
We Diller, Phyllis Diller.

1267
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,020
I mean, they ties it all together.

1268
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:39,620
Why is Phyllis Diller just doing stand up at the Horror Hall of Fame?

1269
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,100
Because she's married to a monster fang.

1270
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,060
That's her deal.

1271
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:48,620
I assume, you know, that she made all our material was about her weird husband.

1272
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,780
Yeah, I don't I don't know as much Phyllis Diller lore as you might imagine.

1273
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,500
So, yeah, I don't know the D.

1274
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,780
I can't wax on about it.

1275
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,100
But her stand up did just make me laugh while I was sitting there.

1276
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,620
Everything else is just sort of pleasant watching.

1277
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,900
Oh, this is nice. Oh, that's good.

1278
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,260
But then there were jokes that are just, I'm sure, one of her 10,000 one liners.

1279
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,500
I was like, oh, yeah, just solid.

1280
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,820
Well, and then you get in cycling in different stand ups.

1281
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,900
You get Sam Kinnison, who appeared in two of them.

1282
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,020
And I guess the feeling was, well, he makes because he's like

1283
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,140
extreme and has looks like a metal guy.

1284
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,500
And he does this really bizarre segment that's where we're going to preview

1285
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,580
upcoming horror movies, but they all have to have Sam Kinnison

1286
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,220
yelling jokes through them.

1287
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,660
I this one joke I was trying to remember.

1288
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,180
I have a clip of one.

1289
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,820
I politely chose to do some dishes during his segment.

1290
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,020
Yeah, they've been soaking overnight.

1291
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,860
I knew it would be irresponsible for me to leave the dishes soaking in.

1292
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,700
You can probably hear it over the sink, too.

1293
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,460
So he does.

1294
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,340
I guess you want the water washed extra.

1295
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,420
He doesn't scream as much as he does in in some other things.

1296
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,380
I also am assuming he was not in the 1992 one because he was dead.

1297
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,100
Is that probably right?

1298
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,580
I looked up the timeline.

1299
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,940
I was like, but also there's an hour less.

1300
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,780
There was an hour less.

1301
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,140
Yeah, there's a downgrade.

1302
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,180
Well, here I go again.

1303
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,460
But here's the this is the one Sam Kinnison joke I want to play.

1304
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,140
Graveyard ship.

1305
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,660
Stephen King's newest film starts a fat, hairy, slimy monster

1306
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,020
that eats everything in sight.

1307
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,980
Only this one doesn't sing the national anthem.

1308
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,980
Mm hmm.

1309
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,980
It's a joke.

1310
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,980
I was a man.

1311
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,980
I remember I knew I remember knowing one was coming.

1312
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,980
I don't I don't know how I knew, but I knew this is something Kyle Mooney

1313
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,500
talked actually was like that.

1314
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,740
We all we had a lot of stuff growing up about Roseanne and Roseanne being gross.

1315
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,500
Right. Like like it's something animaniacs would do.

1316
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,940
I feel like we were all really trained to hate Roseanne and

1317
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,180
just not for the right reasons.

1318
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,380
It took a while to figure out what's wrong with the problem with Roseanne.

1319
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,380
Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,980
It was a lot of like, he's loud.

1321
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,980
But Kinnison was loud.

1322
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,980
Yeah, no, wait.

1323
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,580
And there's both like performative stand up personas.

1324
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,580
Yeah.

1325
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,580
And that also is like, yeah, yeah.

1326
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,580
Sam Kinnison is going to talk about, wow, out of shape.

1327
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,580
This loud comedian is.

1328
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,580
Yeah.

1329
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,580
I don't.

1330
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,580
Kinnison thing.

1331
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,580
I.

1332
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,980
Kinnison thing.

1333
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,980
I.

1334
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,980
Anyone who talks about.

1335
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
Oh, brilliant.

1336
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,980
Does anybody?

1337
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Does anybody ever watch any of it?

1338
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,580
I had not heard the name until this morning.

1339
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,580
Oh, really?

1340
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,180
Yeah, just truly blind spot for me.

1341
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,980
Much like back to school.

1342
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,980
No.

1343
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,580
OK, that's a recommend for you.

1344
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,580
I do like back to school, but I don't know if I really like his part.

1345
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,380
Yeah, Sam Kinnison doesn't translate.

1346
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,980
Maybe he is a person was great.

1347
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,980
Again, I don't know.

1348
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,980
I would say no.

1349
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,780
OK, he's a crazy person.

1350
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,980
I didn't want to say anything bad about someone I know nothing about.

1351
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,780
Yeah, but I guess he was a Pentecostal preacher.

1352
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,780
I saw.

1353
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:04,980
Oh, and then he got into standup and then put every drug imaginable in his body.

1354
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,980
Hey, I believe I believe that's what killed him.

1355
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,980
His body weakened by all drugs.

1356
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,580
All cause of death.

1357
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,580
Thirty.

1358
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,580
All.

1359
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,580
Or what does it?

1360
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,580
Was he in a car accident?

1361
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,580
Was he?

1362
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,580
He died in a car accident.

1363
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,580
Oh, I thought he was just like, I believe he died.

1364
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,780
But those things could.

1365
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
But I don't think.

1366
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,780
Yeah, I don't.

1367
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,780
I mean, I'm not disparaging a dead man.

1368
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,180
I just wanted to know if anybody could point me in the direction of like the Kinnison thing

1369
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
that I've never seen.

1370
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,180
Yeah, because the way like Marin mentions him every that's what I'm saying.

1371
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,980
All the guys are like, oh, man, you had to be there.

1372
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,380
And I've seen clips and it's like, yeah, yeah.

1373
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,780
And I'm like, OK, all right.

1374
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,580
Was it like it was just kind of an intense introduce it now?

1375
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,180
He might not be doing the best material for the horror hall of fame.

1376
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,580
But there's a thing about the maniac cop.

1377
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,380
There's no way to stop this cop on the loose.

1378
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
Anybody try it?

1379
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
Don't I?

1380
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,780
Yeah, I don't know.

1381
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,580
It could just be that had not been on TV before that hadn't existed because I saw those

1382
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,580
yesterday.

1383
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,380
You know, the song I put a spell on you.

1384
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,980
I saw a performance of it and I'd never seen it.

1385
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,980
And I didn't know the context of the time was he would go on stage with skulls and had

1386
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,180
a cloak and people were like this on TV skulls.

1387
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,380
Oh, really?

1388
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,380
Scary.

1389
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,380
It was an uproar.

1390
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,180
It was like dark magic car.

1391
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Yeah, car accident.

1392
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,180
Oh, all right.

1393
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:29,180
But he was like contemporary with like Bill Hicks, right?

1394
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,180
He was another guy who was always angry and yelling.

1395
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,180
But I hear influences.

1396
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,180
Yeah.

1397
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,780
The material was a little better.

1398
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
I think.

1399
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,580
Yeah, I never got into Bill Hicks.

1400
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,780
I was into him, I think, right when I was starting college and it kind of faded away.

1401
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,980
I've heard him yelling about Leno and the Doritos commercial.

1402
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,980
I've heard that bit.

1403
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:54,580
He's like yelling at Leno for selling out, which thank God, because these television

1404
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:01,180
personalities who you think have some like, you know, some integrity, see people just

1405
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,980
sell out and do a huge ads is just so annoying.

1406
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,980
Anyway, let's talk about the ads in this show.

1407
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,980
Man, the ads are a real treasure.

1408
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:14,980
The ads that I couldn't tell if they were real ads or part of the show.

1409
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,980
And then I realized, oh, it's not a commercial break.

1410
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,380
The show is still going on.

1411
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,780
Yeah, two top, top level.

1412
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,780
Yeah, yeah.

1413
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
So excited.

1414
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,780
I'll do it in order of when they pretty play.

1415
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,780
I have the Mug Root Beer commercial.

1416
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,780
Go for it.

1417
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,780
I'm just going to play the whole thing because what I really like comes at the very end.

1418
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,780
Yes, agreed.

1419
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,780
Yes.

1420
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,780
Oh, yeah.

1421
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,780
Yeah, that's part.

1422
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,780
Psycho with me, Elvira.

1423
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,780
You're at the Bates Motel.

1424
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,780
Look for me wherever they sell Mug Root Beer.

1425
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,780
Elvira's in the end.

1426
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Enter the Psycho with Elvira contest.

1427
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,180
You can be my guest at Universal Studios in Hollywood for a monstrous bash at the Bates Motel.

1428
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,180
Shower anyone?

1429
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,180
This Halloween goes Psycho with Elvira and win a party with Mug Root Beer and me.

1430
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,180
I love my mug.

1431
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,180
I love it.

1432
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,180
That guy, that guy in the end.

1433
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,180
I love my mug.

1434
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,180
I love my mug.

1435
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,180
I love my mug.

1436
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,580
I wish there was some documentation of like the party that she's talking about winning.

1437
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,580
Yes.

1438
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
I want to know.

1439
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,580
I want to know that with anything like this.

1440
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,580
Exactly.

1441
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,580
Then what happened?

1442
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,580
Or is this a McDonald's sweepstakes thing where there was nothing ever.

1443
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,580
That's what I mean.

1444
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,580
Was it a complete lie?

1445
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:33,580
The Nickelodeon contests where you would get to like going to KB Toys and throw a bunch

1446
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:37,580
of shit in your cart like it was supermarket sweep, they would show that.

1447
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,580
And I think they would show the Nickelodeon like make your own, like make your room.

1448
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,980
Remember that contest?

1449
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Yes, I remember that.

1450
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,980
You get like five grand to make your dream room.

1451
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
I entered.

1452
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,980
I multiple times drug my mom to the post office to buy a pre-stamped.

1453
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,980
They used to have, maybe they still do pre-stamped generic postcards.

1454
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:04,980
So I could enter the Fox Kids and like Kids WB Contest where you would win all of a line

1455
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,980
of Power Rangers toys.

1456
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,980
Like $500 of Power Rangers toys.

1457
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,980
But we never saw the results.

1458
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,380
We never saw the kid who won those toys.

1459
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,380
Nickelodeon would sometimes update, but you get no update on this.

1460
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,380
I don't know who got to party with Elvira at the Psycho House.

1461
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,380
What does that mean?

1462
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,380
What does it mean?

1463
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,380
Is it, hi, nice to meet you.

1464
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,380
I'm out of here.

1465
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,380
Because it seems so awkward.

1466
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,380
Anything like that, especially where it's like you and me, you're going to do.

1467
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,380
Right.

1468
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,380
There's no way.

1469
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,380
It had to be like a hello, nice to meet you.

1470
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,380
We're going to spend the day together drinking root beer.

1471
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,380
It's not a howl.

1472
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,380
You can't hang.

1473
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,380
I guess you can go in it, but it's not like they were going to throw a real party in there.

1474
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
No.

1475
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,780
What they're showing us is a giant set.

1476
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,780
The production value on these ads is unbelievable.

1477
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,280
It's so choreographed and she hits the edge of the staircase and a bunch of ghouls pop

1478
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,280
up around her and somebody's got a tray of the frostiest mug root beer you've ever seen.

1479
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,780
And the ghouls look good.

1480
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,780
Their skin falling off is great.

1481
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,780
It's not hokey.

1482
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,780
Exactly scary enough.

1483
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,780
There's a lot of budget for these ads.

1484
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,780
A lot of budget.

1485
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,980
This would have been earlier than I would have been aware of even the brand mug root

1486
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:12,380
beer, which I first would be aware of it because of its sponsorship of the Dana Carvey show.

1487
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,380
Yes, I was always fond.

1488
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,380
I think it worked on me because I loved the show when it aired and I think I did go.

1489
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,380
I drink mug now because I have to thank them for giving me the Dana Carvey show.

1490
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,380
My mom has always loved root beer.

1491
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,380
And so I knew all the brands because I knew Barks.

1492
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,380
We never bought Barks because Barks has caffeine in it.

1493
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,380
Yes, that's Barks has bite and that bite is caffeine.

1494
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,380
Yeah, I believe.

1495
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,780
But mug or A&W did not have caffeine.

1496
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,780
This was a big topic in our house as well.

1497
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,780
I didn't know about the caffeine until right now.

1498
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,780
I didn't know about the caffeine until right now.

1499
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,780
I thought all root beers had no caffeine.

1500
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,780
Not always.

1501
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,780
You gotta check.

1502
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:59,780
And I also feel like in the 90s, the root beer lines of the big soda companies had a lot bigger marketing budget.

1503
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:03,780
I feel like I don't see commercials for root beer anymore.

1504
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,780
The 90s was a very root beer heavy time.

1505
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,180
I drank a lot.

1506
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,180
I don't drink sodas anymore, but it was all root beer.

1507
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,180
That was the only one I drank.

1508
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,180
Genuinely, stuff like Dana Carvey show.

1509
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:20,180
Remember those ads with there was an ad with Love Train that was played all the time and very well done.

1510
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,180
I don't remember the gist of it.

1511
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:28,180
But yeah, boy, to be part of getting to ride the root beer wave of the late 90s.

1512
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:33,180
How did I become a chubby child eating two giant slices of pizza with my mug root beer

1513
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,580
and washing it down with a bowl of Vianetta?

1514
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:41,580
If you had barks, you would have had the energy to run around nonstop and wiggle it off.

1515
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,580
I liked root beer so much.

1516
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,580
I won't even say the word liked.

1517
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,580
I loved root beer so much.

1518
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,580
I brewed my own.

1519
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:52,580
There was a science kit from some toy store where you can make your own.

1520
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,580
Where it's anything that you brew where it's great.

1521
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,580
It's in the bottle.

1522
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,580
Seal it.

1523
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,580
Okay.

1524
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,580
Well, I'll see you in five days.

1525
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,580
Bottle with the new liquid inside.

1526
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,980
Wait, and then wait, would you drink it?

1527
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:04,980
Yeah.

1528
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,980
Okay.

1529
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,980
How did it turn out?

1530
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:07,980
Good.

1531
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,980
Really?

1532
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,980
All root beer is good.

1533
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Even one you made?

1534
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,980
Yes.

1535
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,980
As a child, a child can make good root beer.

1536
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,980
What's the science behind it?

1537
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Don't know.

1538
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
You just followed the steps.

1539
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Yeah.

1540
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Wow.

1541
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,980
25 years ago, who could tell?

1542
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,980
I was just excited for the root beer.

1543
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,480
I followed the steps, burned the instructions, wiped it from my brain and then went to the

1544
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,480
closet and got the root beer when it was ready.

1545
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,260
There was a minute when you were describing the process and you said you check in a few

1546
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,260
days later and then the new liquid is there.

1547
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,660
I thought maybe you meant that your mom was like, oh poor Andrew thinks he really made

1548
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,060
root beer and then put root beer in the bottle.

1549
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,660
Like the tooth fairy showed up.

1550
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,660
Perhaps.

1551
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,660
Perhaps that is what happened.

1552
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,660
Yeah.

1553
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,660
I mean, you might not know that.

1554
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,660
Still to this day.

1555
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,660
I don't know.

1556
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,660
I trust you.

1557
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,660
I think you could have done it.

1558
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,700
Anyway, yeah, boy, what a time, a great time for, I'm glad we all realized this together.

1559
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,700
We'll keep exploring this.

1560
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,700
The root beer night.

1561
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,260
Other great moments in root beer, the root beer of the 90s.

1562
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,500
But the other, how do you top that one?

1563
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Big production value.

1564
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
They did it.

1565
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,500
Oh my God.

1566
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,620
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1567
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,020
The greatest commercial.

1568
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:11,780
I think you're just because I don't know if I don't know if he says his name or not, but

1569
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:16,620
you enter a spooky, a model of a of a haunted house or like, you know what it is?

1570
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,980
It's like a haunted loft.

1571
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:23,620
Like you know, it looks like a place where like a, you know, a Lionel Richie video would

1572
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,780
have been shot.

1573
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:31,340
And then you go in and it is production value, a spooky party rivaling the everybody backstreet's

1574
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,340
back video.

1575
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,780
There are 150 people in the frame.

1576
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,740
It's lit impeccably.

1577
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,580
It's probably like the, it's probably the DP crew of Batman doing it.

1578
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,940
Genuinely really cool ghosts.

1579
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,940
Yes.

1580
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,940
Yes.

1581
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:49,540
The imposed ghost, like the like superimposed characters look good.

1582
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,420
When do you see that back then?

1583
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,500
This commercial looks better than Lawnmower Man.

1584
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,020
No question done in the same year.

1585
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,860
I thought I remembered the other one that I was like, these are scary movies and they

1586
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,460
should be in a vault and I can't get anywhere near them.

1587
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,260
We're Lawnmower Man and Candyman.

1588
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,780
Well, yeah, I don't know much about Candyman.

1589
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,780
I've never seen Candyman.

1590
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,780
It's good.

1591
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,780
It's more of a tragic tale.

1592
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,780
Remade.

1593
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,780
It's like a gothic undertones.

1594
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,780
Yeah.

1595
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,780
It's not too scary.

1596
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,780
Okay.

1597
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,780
It's spooky.

1598
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,780
That's a wreck.

1599
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,900
That's we should figure out a way to name Andrew Rex, but yeah, Candyman.

1600
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:21,900
That's a thumbs up.

1601
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,900
Okay.

1602
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,900
That's a skeleton.

1603
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,900
How do you spookify it?

1604
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,580
I want to give you a brand for recommendation.

1605
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,580
One detached thumb.

1606
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,580
One detached thumb up.

1607
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:35,820
It's a thumb, but it's got the bone poking out of the bottom and a little blood and torn

1608
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,820
skin.

1609
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,820
Yeah, it rolls off the tongue.

1610
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,420
It's a gruesome detached thumbs up.

1611
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,420
Concise.

1612
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,420
Oh, that's right.

1613
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,420
Oh, gruesome.

1614
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,420
You're Andrew Gruesome.

1615
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,420
Yes, that is true.

1616
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,420
Okay.

1617
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,420
Okay.

1618
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,980
So here's this ad and the big reveal when he turns around, there's a saxophone playing

1619
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:56,460
musically and then the title on screen tells you that it is Clarence Clemens, the big man

1620
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,780
from the East Street band.

1621
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,900
Bruce Springsteen's East Street band.

1622
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,900
And it's great.

1623
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,740
Yeah, this is one of the best ad verbs.

1624
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,740
I know.

1625
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,740
I completely agree.

1626
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,740
Guess what?

1627
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,740
You're invited to the Halloween party of the year.

1628
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,740
Spill it out.

1629
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,740
Big Halloween haunt.

1630
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,740
Right, big man.

1631
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,740
160 very lucky people will be flown to Universal Studios Hollywood.

1632
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,740
And there's like an upside down.

1633
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:23,940
Mummy, right, big man.

1634
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:27,140
Kind of skipping Trayvore guy.

1635
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,940
And then now he's pouring Miller Lite into the ghosts in front of him.

1636
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:51,940
And then he lets loose on that saxophone just like it's Born to Run, the bridge on

1637
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,340
Born to Run triumphantly.

1638
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,140
Big camera move, ghosts flying, people dancing, the most happening.

1639
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:03,900
So excited that when the camera soars along with that saxophone note, good looking ghosts

1640
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,900
fly in.

1641
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:09,500
He's every time he shows up anywhere, it's the greatest thing.

1642
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,580
He's in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1643
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,180
He's on like the council.

1644
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,540
He's not what is it called?

1645
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,540
It's the three most important people in the world.

1646
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,540
You know what I'm talking about?

1647
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,540
I haven't seen.

1648
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,540
I've watched.

1649
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,700
He's on like he's I think he's on Nash Bridges.

1650
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,980
Like he pops up everywhere.

1651
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:26,980
Original Ringo All-Star band.

1652
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,820
First lineup.

1653
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,620
Yes, he was on the All-Star band.

1654
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,940
He's been dead now for 10 years, which is so sad.

1655
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,100
Luckily, I got to see him and Bruce.

1656
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:39,980
But he and Bruce are the most or were the most like dynamic together on stage.

1657
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,500
They had the strongest connection more than Bruce with his wife.

1658
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
It was Clarence.

1659
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,180
Like that's the greatest love of his life, in my opinion.

1660
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,740
And they like they used to kiss on stage almost every night.

1661
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,740
They would do like a little dance.

1662
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,420
They would kiss on the mouth.

1663
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,220
It was like the really cute thing that they would do.

1664
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,260
That was his big musical.

1665
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,260
Little Stephen tried to fill that void.

1666
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,260
No, little Stevens off doing his own thing.

1667
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,460
OK, Nils is off doing his own thing.

1668
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:07,980
Patty's Clarence is missing, but his nephew is now on tour with them.

1669
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,980
Oh, that's who it is.

1670
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:09,980
OK, that's cool.

1671
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,260
And the last thing I'll say is that someone in the Clarence Clements family has made their

1672
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:20,380
own Clarence beer that I follow on Instagram called Big Man's Brew Root Root Beer.

1673
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,380
No, no, no beer.

1674
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,380
Oh, beer.

1675
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,380
Yeah.

1676
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,540
That's why I was on the Big Man's Brew Instagram yesterday, because there was some sort of

1677
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,500
events on the East Coast.

1678
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,780
You can get like a beer tap handle with a big saxophone on it.

1679
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,780
That's great.

1680
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,780
A hundred bucks or something.

1681
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:35,780
But you can't ship it.

1682
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:38,740
I was trying to figure out if I could ship some out here, but I can't.

1683
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,740
I don't think you can.

1684
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,220
I think somebody would have to buy it and send it.

1685
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,740
This is a good gift.

1686
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:48,700
Maybe you slide into those DMS and say, what if I pay you to ship it?

1687
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,700
It's a good question.

1688
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,300
Yeah, I could do that.

1689
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,980
If you offer people money, they'll do a task.

1690
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,980
That's a good point.

1691
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,460
So there's a way to do it.

1692
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,300
There's a way to get some Big Man's Brew here.

1693
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,980
But anyway, he was speaking of his film appearances.

1694
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,220
He's one of the Louisiana Gator boys in Blues Brothers 2000.

1695
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,220
Oh yeah.

1696
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,220
Yeah.

1697
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:11,900
And he plays sax on the edge of glory, Lady Gaga's edge of glory, I believe.

1698
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,540
That's well his last guest spots.

1699
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,540
But I have a question.

1700
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,060
Did you guys ever have an opportunity to meet Bruce Springsteen?

1701
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:24,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

1702
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,220
I can't remember.

1703
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:29,460
You want me to open the box of Crystal Head Vodka?

1704
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,460
Really?

1705
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,460
You didn't have to wake up very early or anything?

1706
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:32,460
Don't worry about it.

1707
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,460
Wow, a life lived without meeting Bruce.

1708
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,860
My tolerance is way too low.

1709
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,860
I have to drive a car and do things today.

1710
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,500
I cannot be repeating stories.

1711
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,780
I want to make this clear.

1712
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,620
Jason is so afraid of taking one of these shots.

1713
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:52,300
I had a martini last night at a bar and I was like, I need a second before I get up.

1714
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,300
What were you?

1715
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,300
Huh?

1716
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,300
Is there a word that starts with H?

1717
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,300
Huh?

1718
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,780
Did you describe your level of inebriation?

1719
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
Was it a word that starts with H?

1720
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:03,580
Crossfaded because we were on the patio and no one was there so I could hit the vape pen

1721
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,580
too.

1722
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,860
This also is, there's orange juice here that's not vodka.

1723
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,180
You're not forcing anyone to drink vodka.

1724
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,180
That is true.

1725
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,860
But what is the, you know, what do you need to do shots of orange juice?

1726
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,860
Where's the fun?

1727
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,900
I agree with that wholeheartedly.

1728
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Yeah.

1729
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,900
Okay.

1730
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,900
Anyway.

1731
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,900
All right.

1732
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,900
Well good.

1733
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,900
You passed the test.

1734
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,900
What else happens in the first week?

1735
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:23,900
We've got to make sure we cover all the grants.

1736
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:24,900
Zelda Rubenstein.

1737
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,900
Zelda Rubenstein appears?

1738
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Yeah.

1739
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
What does she do?

1740
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,900
Does she introduce?

1741
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:32,900
She introduces the alien tribute.

1742
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:36,540
And you get to see her introduce Tom Skerritt.

1743
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,540
She's so cool.

1744
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,540
So much charisma.

1745
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:43,220
In Austin, when I lived there at the Alma Drafthouse, there was a screening of a movie

1746
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:49,260
called Anguish, which I do recommend one severed thumb up.

1747
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,740
But I will also say don't go to IMDB.

1748
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,980
Don't read anything about it if you want to see this movie.

1749
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,460
Did you give me your DVD of that?

1750
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,460
Yes.

1751
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,500
It's kind of boring, but also is good.

1752
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,660
But she came out and spoke at it and was just full of life.

1753
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,460
The best interview ever.

1754
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,460
Loved her.

1755
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:11,460
So every time I see her in anything, acting or just being interviewed, I'm like, oh, there

1756
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,460
she is.

1757
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,700
A treasure.

1758
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,700
Yeah.

1759
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,100
I have a joke written down and I can't tell.

1760
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:24,620
I think it was Phyllis Diller said the phrase picture Tip O'Neill in a sundress.

1761
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:29,060
And that is just a joke that you couldn't I don't think would play now.

1762
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:34,360
Like the oldest person in the audience would laugh and no one else laughing at the reference

1763
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,660
to the speaker of the house.

1764
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:41,620
The only place you could ever hear anything about Tip O'Neill is if you were watching

1765
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,940
like Chris Matthews five years ago, who would talk about Tip O'Neill like three times a

1766
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,700
week because he worked for him.

1767
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,700
Oh, right.

1768
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,940
He would constantly be talking about Tip O'Neill when I used to work for Tip O'Neill.

1769
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:57,740
The big fact on Wikipedia is that Tip O'Neill broke with Lyndon Johnson and did not support

1770
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,640
the Vietnam War.

1771
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,060
So this this in the 90s was an old reference.

1772
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,060
Yes.

1773
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,060
Yeah.

1774
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:08,660
Or is that is this is the PTR curse weirdly going to befall Tip O'Neill or is he already

1775
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,660
Tip O'Neill's day?

1776
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,660
There is.

1777
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,700
Chris Matthews alive.

1778
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,700
This is great for you guys.

1779
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,500
We're mainly just talking about dead people today.

1780
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,500
Yeah, we've got you.

1781
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,300
Unless the curse brings them back.

1782
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,300
Oh, no.

1783
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,300
But I have another I.

1784
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,420
No, I don't want to mention now because of the curse.

1785
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:26,620
Well, Big Bob accepts an award kind of in a funny gag.

1786
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:30,980
The spider comes down from the ceiling because of arachnophobia.

1787
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,980
We have a full explanation.

1788
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:36,980
I know, but I don't want to be the one to say his name.

1789
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,420
And you said without content.

1790
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,420
And then Big Bob.

1791
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,140
So accepts the award for our movie of the year.

1792
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,140
You have to say it.

1793
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,140
All right.

1794
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,220
You're the one I for I I did take a second.

1795
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,100
They said arachnophobia.

1796
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,660
And I was like, wait, isn't the director of arachnophobia Jimmy Buffett's best friend,

1797
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,660
Frank Marshall?

1798
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:01,700
And sure enough, he comes on stage with a really wild haircut like a Jimmy like similar

1799
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,700
to Jimmy, maybe run similar to Jimmy.

1800
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,320
It's like a mullet in the back, but bald on top.

1801
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,680
It's the perfect transition of the 80s to the 90s.

1802
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,160
It is special from 1990.

1803
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:15,600
He picks this out without even maybe realizing there was the Frank Marshall connection.

1804
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
Yes.

1805
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,600
Frequently discussed man.

1806
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,600
Yes.

1807
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,960
Producer of all the Spielberg stuff in the 80s.

1808
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,400
But then I forgot that he directed movies.

1809
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
He directed arachnophobia.

1810
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,960
He directed Congo and something else.

1811
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,340
It's not a few.

1812
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,340
It's an odd.

1813
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,340
Yeah.

1814
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,340
What else do you remember?

1815
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:42,780
Speaking of directors, the the editor in chief of the movie magazine is given his award

1816
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:46,060
right by Joe Dante.

1817
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:49,820
And then William Friedkin and John Landis.

1818
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,820
Is that right?

1819
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,540
Like three massive directors.

1820
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,060
And they barely say anything.

1821
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,860
They just give it to the guy.

1822
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,860
They just give it to the guy.

1823
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:01,100
We were we've seen Frank Marshall in person.

1824
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,900
Of course, this I don't think this is five timers.

1825
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,180
I think we've all mentioned this twice, maybe that we of course, when we went to the Jurassic

1826
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,260
World ride opening, Frank spoke there.

1827
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,780
I have zero memory of that.

1828
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,580
You really strongest.

1829
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:17,380
You remember that I actually did not remember that.

1830
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:22,700
I just remembered I just remembered like us going to get in line for the ride again.

1831
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,140
And we're like, oh my God, is Trevorrow getting on the ride again?

1832
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,460
We tried very hard to ride the ride with Trevorrow.

1833
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,660
He was leaving and then the ride operators were like, sorry, we've already shut down

1834
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,660
for the night.

1835
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:41,500
Yeah, we got we got one ride on it that night because we were just too excited about everything

1836
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
else.

1837
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,260
But Frank, you don't remember Frank Marshall speaking and talking about the ride.

1838
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:50,740
Somehow, whatever Frank Marshall said did not stay in my heart enough to remember.

1839
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,980
Do you remember the fireworks?

1840
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:52,980
Yes.

1841
01:16:52,980 --> 01:17:00,100
OK, I do remember the fireworks and the Raptor more than I remember the words off a card

1842
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,460
from Frank Marshall.

1843
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:06,180
I count as five timers if maybe I've said it five times, but they don't remember.

1844
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,180
I don't know.

1845
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,180
Mike, I'll say again.

1846
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,180
Trust your heart.

1847
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,180
OK, I don't think it man.

1848
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,180
I think it doesn't.

1849
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,180
Then it sounds like it does.

1850
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:13,180
It doesn't come.

1851
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,260
We remember the phone party.

1852
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,740
That's the again, I will say I didn't want to make it sound like I didn't like arachnophobia.

1853
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,940
It was just a crucial fear for my life as a child.

1854
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,380
I now like arachnophobia.

1855
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,820
OK, like the Jimmy Buffett song.

1856
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,820
Don't bug me.

1857
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,820
Soundtrack.

1858
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,820
How does that go?

1859
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,540
Don't bug me.

1860
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,540
Don't something.

1861
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,540
Yeah, I bet I like that.

1862
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,020
I think it's in the credits.

1863
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,020
OK.

1864
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,660
Yeah, it's very gentle, very gentle song.

1865
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,220
Somehow that's not a five timer.

1866
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,220
There's still so many.

1867
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,220
That's a new reference.

1868
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:46,140
I mean, it's just like this, this whole the hours and hours of this award show.

1869
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:50,660
And we're like excavating like recent history.

1870
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:55,380
Like there's so much, you know, when people first started wearing masks and then complaining

1871
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:01,380
Everyone was like, oh, this happened 100 years ago during the flu pandemic.

1872
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,380
Yes.

1873
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:07,340
Wait, you're saying I'm saying that like it's it's makes sense.

1874
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,060
We forget something from 100 years ago in like our cultural memory.

1875
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,820
But then forget something from like 30 years ago or less.

1876
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,540
Like with huge names like the Jimmy Buffett.

1877
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,540
Don't bug me.

1878
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:23,300
Yeah, I just mean this award show in general.

1879
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,660
We wore masks in the pandemic.

1880
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:30,260
We need to have Frank Marshall speak live in person, mere feet away from your body.

1881
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:35,620
I I remember seeing a member of the Hearst family and hiding behind a pillar.

1882
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,300
Correct. But they didn't speak there like any sane person.

1883
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,660
Oh, that works in entertainment.

1884
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,500
Like, oh, shit, it's the people who sue everyone.

1885
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,180
Hide.

1886
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:50,740
I bet somebody who is there like a vlogger, somebody filmed this Frank Marshall speech.

1887
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,660
I want to I feel like I need to look it up and post it now to see whatever.

1888
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:59,140
What was this electric performance that Frank Marshall gave that that you will never forget

1889
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,940
for the rest of your life?

1890
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,020
I'll look at I'll find it.

1891
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,220
It's it'd be really funny if he wasn't there.

1892
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:06,740
I don't remember.

1893
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:09,140
He was for sure there. OK, no doubt he wasn't.

1894
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,660
He was there. You've Mandela effect to yourself.

1895
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,020
I mean, look, I'm getting older.

1896
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,420
Who knows? Who knows what I thought I saw?

1897
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,420
Spielberg was not there.

1898
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,300
There was reference to Spielberg not being there.

1899
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,140
I remember. Do you remember that?

1900
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,340
Yeah, I do. He was.

1901
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:25,060
He made all the sense in the world that Spielberg would be not there.

1902
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,460
He was at West Side. He was filming West Side Story at the time.

1903
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:28,980
So that's why he was.

1904
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,620
He would have. What a shame that Spielberg missed an opportunity

1905
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:35,260
to associate himself closely with the Jurassic World franchise.

1906
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,660
It's a good point.

1907
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:42,100
Who else? We should talk about these other years.

1908
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,060
Yeah, there's one thing I just will bring up.

1909
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,060
We don't have to discuss it.

1910
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,940
I do think it's interesting, but these are also good dishwashing moments

1911
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:52,460
where it just goes, now, what is the history of this actor?

1912
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,420
And you're like, OK, this is OK. We get a little hit.

1913
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,300
So there is interesting interviews. I like that it all exists.

1914
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,660
It's all they throw to a lot of packages

1915
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:02,340
that are between the live things that they will make.

1916
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,180
Yeah, they're all totally interesting.

1917
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,660
They're a little good sleepy nap time, but they're also interesting.

1918
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,020
If it's stuff you've never heard, if you're a dork like me,

1919
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,980
you kind of go, well, I kind of know all this.

1920
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,820
But it's yes, it is neat to just see all these people be interviewed,

1921
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,980
especially I forget.

1922
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,620
It's a lot of people where I just associate them with being very old

1923
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,740
and saying, oh, in the 90s, they're kind of middle aged and thriving

1924
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,820
and excited to talk about the past.

1925
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:26,980
Maybe not a bad form.

1926
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:31,220
It's something like the Oscars could adopt where they like

1927
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,020
because now they just kind of like, we got to rush through everything,

1928
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,780
rush through everything.

1929
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:38,060
We will show giant montages of all the movies you see every year.

1930
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,380
Always we have to do that. We can't not do that.

1931
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,980
And then you never feel like you get a chance to know the movies

1932
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,140
and the filmmakers and what they are.

1933
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,460
And they just throw all these titles at you that no one's watching.

1934
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,580
Koda, it's Koda.

1935
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,940
But what is like, give me a sense of what it is.

1936
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:54,660
And I actually think the format of this is pretty cool.

1937
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,980
It's good. It's actually like, let's tribute the movies

1938
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:59,380
and take a little time with them.

1939
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:02,340
Also, if you're a person watching this special,

1940
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:06,300
you are probably the person who is interested in these behind the scenes

1941
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,380
things. Yes.

1942
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,780
The Oscars are even though the Oscars are a little like snooty

1943
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,860
for maybe the average moviegoer.

1944
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,900
It does feel like if it feels like there's an overlap between big

1945
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,260
horror fans and people that might be interested in behind the scenes.

1946
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,180
Yeah, yeah, that's true. That is true.

1947
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:23,140
One other thing I want to bring up that I like is the Cryptkeeper

1948
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,620
having costume changes throughout.

1949
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,500
Oh, does he? Yeah, at the very end, the first one he's dressed as Freddy Krueger.

1950
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,180
He's got a different sweater on.

1951
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,420
Oh, wow.

1952
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,660
It's just a nice little touch.

1953
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,260
They dress him up like that.

1954
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,140
There's also low key advertising.

1955
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:42,980
Everything is tagged like available on Paramount home video,

1956
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,180
available on Universal.

1957
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,620
It's a lot of VHS courtesy of such a studio.

1958
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:51,140
That was another thing I liked that it wasn't just here's a Disney package

1959
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,540
of only Disney properties.

1960
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,300
It's hey, it's another studio. I know we're at Universal.

1961
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,500
That's fine. Yeah, we'll talk about this thing.

1962
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,620
It's exciting. It's a horror movie. Yeah, that is weird.

1963
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,060
You would not see that as much.

1964
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,380
Like everybody, all the studios are going in on it.

1965
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,740
Let's just all have a little bit.

1966
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:08,580
I mean, there was no clip of Vincent Price being bitten by vampire Kermit.

1967
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,460
Which we've all seen, but I'm sure they couldn't license that, but that's fine.

1968
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:15,500
But in general, it was nice to just.

1969
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:20,700
Talk about the industry and the history of movies in this way,

1970
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,220
not that it's this pure thing, it's still promoting all of it.

1971
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:25,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1972
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,980
I don't know, I felt a little more wholesome in some ways.

1973
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,300
A little special. Yeah, they all are.

1974
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,900
The rip of this first one, too, shows a preview of what's coming up

1975
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,500
on the evening news and they tease.

1976
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,900
It could microwave popcorn be bad for you.

1977
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,420
And I'm like, are we still we're still doing that?

1978
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,420
We're still having this conversation.

1979
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:47,300
Well, is there another is there's another one that has the ending

1980
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,500
where they're like, the news is on strike.

1981
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,380
Did you see that upload?

1982
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,500
Oh, I think I missed that.

1983
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,340
There's one news that the news isn't the credits.

1984
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,260
I don't know what the story is.

1985
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,460
There's like news on strike.

1986
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,740
Will you get your newspaper cuts off?

1987
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,700
Oh, yeah, sure.

1988
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,900
Oh, that's a that's an enigma.

1989
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,140
Anyway, so first year is super fun.

1990
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,780
You know, big tributes to great movies and people.

1991
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,140
Arachnophobia gets an award.

1992
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,740
Big Bob the spider.

1993
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,260
Big Bob comes out. You see every.

1994
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,460
Oh, and wait, just a random.

1995
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,340
I always love all the pairings, too, that like from Who's the Boss?

1996
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,900
Danny Pintaro and Jason.

1997
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,820
Great pairings.

1998
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,380
Jason kind of lingers in the background,

1999
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:31,900
I believe, as the producers of Night of the Living Dead accept their award.

2000
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,940
Jason just stands there haunting you.

2001
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,580
And it's a really good Jason costume, not like the sort of bad, cheap

2002
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,900
Hannibal Lecter in one of the other.

2003
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,380
Yeah, that's that's off.

2004
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,620
It's a good Jason with all of his weird skull and the leather straps.

2005
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,940
And he's dirty. He looks like he came out of a swamp.

2006
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:55,180
Yeah. Can I that I will give a severed thumb up.

2007
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:00,460
The first Friday, the 13th movie is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen,

2008
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:06,260
because everyone is speaking in a way where no one has spoken before.

2009
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:10,580
It's just like the strangest delivery and the strangest dialogue.

2010
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,100
And it's like the really shoe strength budget.

2011
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,900
It's a lot of seemingly handheld camera.

2012
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,420
I think I watched it during the Halloween during 2020.

2013
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,500
And I was just like, this is so odd.

2014
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,700
And I very charming.

2015
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,660
It is very charming.

2016
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,180
I made a movie. Yeah.

2017
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,740
It's good. I'll take that separate thumbs up.

2018
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:39,340
Second year, we end up there's there's like a birds cold opening.

2019
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:44,340
He says Robert Englund says this hosting job is for the birds.

2020
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:47,060
I think that same joke happens later.

2021
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:50,980
Well, isn't that also a bunch of birds fly to the fog?

2022
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2023
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,780
This time he opens a door and it sees the amphitheater again.

2024
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,500
And I don't like the set as much. The sets are different, right?

2025
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,820
I think so. It's in the university theater again.

2026
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:04,020
But I like volume one set more.

2027
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,300
Volume one is stronger, I think, than two in general.

2028
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,100
I have less stuff about two, but I took less notes on two.

2029
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,460
I did too. Yes. Yeah.

2030
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,500
You get to I like that in the opening, it's like with appearances by Lurch.

2031
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:21,260
Yeah. And that guy had just come off of season two of Twin Peaks.

2032
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:25,780
He's he's that tall man and Lurch had men in black, too.

2033
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,380
I just saw him in that. I forgot he was in Doctor Sleep.

2034
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,700
A movie I love that few people saw because it was long,

2035
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,100
but I think it's good and earned it.

2036
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,020
And I really love that movie, but he's great in it.

2037
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:36,980
I read them up. This one is sillier.

2038
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:39,260
I feel like a little a little bit. Yeah.

2039
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,180
It's a little more. Yeah.

2040
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,980
I have to say, so Gilbert Gottfried is in this.

2041
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:49,380
I had forgotten that he like annoyed the Emmy voter like the

2042
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,260
he had done a bit at the Emmy Awards.

2043
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,380
I have no context for that.

2044
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:55,140
I have no context for this.

2045
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:00,580
I think he probably was a little Ryeballed, a little.

2046
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,260
It was weird hearing you about to say the word.

2047
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:06,220
Oh, you were making a bee and then you switched it to Ryeball.

2048
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,660
Yeah, I got I got myself.

2049
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,860
But he would that have been a five timers.

2050
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:15,180
I know. But nobody's just a major part of the body.

2051
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:17,740
Body. Body. Body. Body.

2052
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:23,020
Why is like a alternate name for our show, a twist worthy of Alfred Hitchcock

2053
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:29,620
presents. But the Gilbert Gottfried bit, I swore I've seen this before.

2054
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,220
Someone with a shock collar.

2055
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,380
Yeah, who is not allowed to because of something that he did previously.

2056
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,260
He keeps getting shocked.

2057
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,060
Yeah, it feels familiar to me.

2058
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,660
Yeah, I just had no idea.

2059
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,780
Like, boy, you had to really just seen whatever he did at the end.

2060
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,740
Is that one of those things where the Emmys was viewed by 50 million people?

2061
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,580
So that was a very present joke just back in the day.

2062
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,060
Oh, 100 percent.

2063
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,820
Maybe. But did you care about the I don't know.

2064
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,340
I guess I was. Yeah, maybe I was three.

2065
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,540
So I really have no context for this.

2066
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:03,020
The EC Comics segment, I think is really good.

2067
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:08,940
I feel like people don't know a lot about that, that like comics were put on trial

2068
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:11,260
essentially in front of the Senate.

2069
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,020
Oh, yeah. The one asshole wrote a book.

2070
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:17,740
This guy, Frederick Wortham, wrote this book, Seduction of the Innocent,

2071
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:21,300
about like comics are responsible for juvenile delinquency.

2072
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,820
Yeah, Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency.

2073
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,340
Yeah. Which and this and EC Comics is who made Tales from the Crypt.

2074
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:31,500
The Tales from the Crypt, Mad Magazine.

2075
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,740
Oh, Mad Magazine.

2076
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,260
I thought I recognized the name William Gaines.

2077
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,900
OK. Yeah. Yeah. Really great to just see all those guys being interviewed

2078
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,100
and talk about it and the history of it.

2079
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,380
That's where the comic code came from.

2080
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,460
Yes. Which stuck around for decades.

2081
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,620
So like 10 years ago, maybe something like that.

2082
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:49,820
A little like imprint that was on all the comics for decades

2083
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,260
that said like approved by the comic code,

2084
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,260
like a standards and practices for like content.

2085
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,700
They had a parental advisory equivalent.

2086
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,540
Yes. Yeah.

2087
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,500
Done in the 60s or the 50s.

2088
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,860
And it was there for decades.

2089
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,580
And then finally, like a year, a couple of years ago, it feels like somebody was like,

2090
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:08,660
why the fuck is this still on here?

2091
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,740
Yeah, we don't have to do that.

2092
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,700
That's funny. They finally just shut it off.

2093
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:15,020
I have an update about Jurassic World opening ceremony.

2094
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,220
Yes. Yeah.

2095
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,740
Here's the thing. I cannot.

2096
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,980
It doesn't.

2097
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,740
There's a man with.

2098
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,180
What's that? Is this an update?

2099
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,660
It would absolutely. Yes.

2100
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,660
So Frank Marshall, I sent you a photo, is up there with them.

2101
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,620
He is on stage with everyone.

2102
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,500
There is a man with white hair that apparently spoke that's not him.

2103
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,620
I don't know that he actually said anything on Mike.

2104
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,860
I'm trying to find a better recording.

2105
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,180
I think there's another guy that looks like him

2106
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:41,700
that might have been the one that spoke.

2107
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,940
I may be misremembering a different older man.

2108
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,780
Maybe was no speech by Frank.

2109
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,780
Might not have been a Frank Marshall speech.

2110
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,900
I remember him there.

2111
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,140
Obviously, he was there because I would be excited about it.

2112
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,860
But there was a different older man around the same age that he is.

2113
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,500
Do you remember?

2114
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,380
My mind, that is my memory of Frank Marshall speaking.

2115
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:03,460
Do you remember liking the speech being emotionally touched by the.

2116
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,300
No, I remember the biggest feeling is, oh, my God, Frank Marshall's on stage.

2117
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,580
I you know what I remember is five to ten minutes ago being scolded

2118
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,300
for not remembering the touching.

2119
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,260
I apologize by Frank Marshall.

2120
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,260
I apologize. All of a sudden, I apologize for that.

2121
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,460
I'm I'm wrong.

2122
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,580
You do. You neither of you remembered him being there, though, right?

2123
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,860
I thought it was OK. OK.

2124
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,180
Even though I'm sure I'm sure you all night really.

2125
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:29,220
I think it's Frank Marshall over there.

2126
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,740
Trevorrow spoke for sure.

2127
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:34,060
I don't even know the Pratt spoke.

2128
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,140
Doesn't even look like he spoke, but he was there.

2129
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,060
Brice, they're all like that, basically.

2130
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,460
Yeah, they did a skit with blue.

2131
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,940
Yeah. So I don't Frank Marshall.

2132
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:44,500
I don't think Frank Marshall's I'm going to dig deeper,

2133
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,860
but I apologize for saying he spoke.

2134
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,100
I don't want to get I don't want to get all the letters

2135
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,700
that I usually get when I say something wrong.

2136
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,500
I got the chronology of Bobby Boris Pickett in a different

2137
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,580
Halloween band wrong a few years ago.

2138
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,060
Oh, OK. Who came after you?

2139
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,620
One person, I think.

2140
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:07,740
Bobby Boris Pickett apologized seven times in the email about it, probably.

2141
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,380
Really? I don't mean to bother you.

2142
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,340
I'm really sorry. I do not want to.

2143
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,860
Not the picket widow.

2144
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,140
I don't think I'm still alive.

2145
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,580
Bobby, we're speaking. No. OK.

2146
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:21,660
No, no. There's a couple of segments in this that are a little strange.

2147
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:25,620
Like when they go to Universal Studios Hollywood, which I was trying to figure out,

2148
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:29,980
is that Universal Studios Hollywood for like some really quick like bumpers?

2149
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:31,020
Oh, they go to Florida.

2150
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,100
They go to Florida. Oh, excuse me. Yeah, they go to Florida.

2151
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:37,860
But I'm like, wait, he's just standing in front of a psycho house and a fountain.

2152
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,100
Are they lying?

2153
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,780
I don't think so.

2154
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,860
No, no, no, because they're they actually they are on the set.

2155
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:48,860
The indoor psycho house set of the Alfred Hitchcock

2156
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,260
Magic of Making Movies that we talked about a while ago.

2157
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,140
Yeah, it was a little hard to tell on the clip.

2158
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:56,620
The other thing that I trust Robert's I don't trust Freddie, but I trust Robert.

2159
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,300
I just thought it was so funny to fly Robert Englund to shoot a couple

2160
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:04,220
really rushed promos. He's jimmin through.

2161
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,660
Yeah. Maybe they gave him a free day at the park.

2162
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:09,700
Now, like film these and then do you have your fun?

2163
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:13,580
A thing that is not rush that goes on really long

2164
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:18,380
is the Ron Howard testimony about Roger Corman.

2165
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,700
And I feel like he he says a lot of nice things about Roger Corman,

2166
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,660
but it felt like they were going to chop it up and use some of it.

2167
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,460
And then they're like, well, let's just use all of it.

2168
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,380
Ron Howard. That's just yeah.

2169
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,540
Yeah, that segment was very, very long.

2170
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,700
I don't have enough Roger Corman.

2171
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:38,500
Yeah, special effects segments, the special effects segments.

2172
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,740
I wanted to like more because I love seeing special effects.

2173
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,700
Grew up with that.

2174
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,060
Oh, yeah. There's all these little interstitials with like a horror makeup guy

2175
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,860
trying stuff on his assistant and things go awry.

2176
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,220
I don't really nice enough people didn't really care for it.

2177
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,300
Yeah. Yeah. Cure was off.

2178
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:57,260
Can I ask, are you the Corman stuff?

2179
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,500
Corman made, you know, what, a thousand movies.

2180
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,500
Yeah. Hearing the Vincent Price one where they went and then he had the deal

2181
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,660
for a decade where he would make every single thing

2182
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,660
that Edgar Allan Poe wrote.

2183
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,660
Wow. I mean, not that exactly, but yeah. Right.

2184
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:16,020
But are you like is the Corman like what's the most famous one?

2185
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:19,540
Rock and roll high school that he made the man with the X-ray eyes

2186
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,340
is one I really like, which I talk about.

2187
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,420
But I was going to say, are you a court?

2188
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,620
Do you know Corman stuff?

2189
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,500
Because I didn't really grow up with it.

2190
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,780
And then whenever I put it on, I appreciate it.

2191
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:28,660
It's a little sleepy.

2192
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:32,540
I appreciate like the business of him making a movie quickly that is of quality

2193
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,420
coming in under budget, selling it.

2194
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,740
I like all that. And everyone seems to be having fun.

2195
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,820
I don't quite connect with those movies as well.

2196
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,980
But man with the X-ray eyes is really good.

2197
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,100
I put it on recently.

2198
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,580
It was just a title I'd always heard.

2199
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:47,620
And it's like a very good sort of cosmic horror movie. Yeah.

2200
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:51,420
I just feel like the lore around the studio and all the people that went through

2201
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:55,180
there seems oftentimes more compelling than anything I flip through.

2202
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:58,500
When he just will go, hey, you want a shot at making a movie? Yeah. Yeah.

2203
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,220
OK, you got to do these things.

2204
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,420
OK, and I can make a movie. Yeah.

2205
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,180
And I'm not going to pay you much, but I get to make a movie. Yes. Yeah.

2206
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,420
And then they go.

2207
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,500
Everyone grows from it.

2208
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,620
I like that that is the funnier die of its time.

2209
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,860
It's going to say or the asylum.

2210
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:15,820
I know people who've gone on to make movies who started at the asylum.

2211
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,260
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2212
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:19,740
Anyways, what else?

2213
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,460
What does it? Oh, well, I like that you get a big and here to accept the award.

2214
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,620
Jeff Legosi.

2215
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:28,140
There are so many go sees so many legacies.

2216
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:32,660
Grant's famous last names, famous last name, but then a name.

2217
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,420
But Tippi Hendren, they got to be Hendren.

2218
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,740
Hadron, right?

2219
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,260
Is it? Yeah. Yeah, it's.

2220
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,260
Oh, I've said it wrong for years.

2221
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,260
Correcting your left. Oh, that's all right.

2222
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,660
But it's important we leave the corrections and we can't edit them.

2223
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,260
No, they have to be in.

2224
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,340
But yes, there's so many like me again.

2225
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,060
I said nieces of somebody like this.

2226
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,220
The who's the who's the funniest one?

2227
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,540
Pat Hitchcock was his daughter.

2228
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,780
That one was very funny.

2229
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,380
It was like my best friend known forever.

2230
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,740
Pat Hitchcock. Right, right.

2231
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:06,500
But it's it's so like Bella.

2232
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,940
I guess it's I'm trying to think the famous ones.

2233
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,180
Bela, go see Peter Laurie.

2234
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:15,380
They mention there's there's a Karloff daughter or something.

2235
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,540
I did. Yeah.

2236
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,340
Linda Karloff.

2237
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:23,260
Yeah. Richard Mall got so much applause that he had to like pause his speech.

2238
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:25,340
Mm hmm.

2239
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:29,260
Yes. If you want to see obscure relatives, Sarah, Sarah Karloff, cotton.

2240
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:30,900
Yes. Yes.

2241
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,980
Shatner. Oh, yeah.

2242
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:35,740
Shatner Shatner from rescue 911.

2243
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,140
It is fascinating to me to see Shatner when you go like,

2244
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,940
oh, this is like Prime Shatner and he's 65 years old.

2245
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,740
It's pretty wild.

2246
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:45,100
Like he's just around for so long.

2247
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:48,700
He's like in WWE segments from 1995.

2248
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,580
And I go based on that.

2249
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:53,060
He's 60 years old here, like fighting with Jerry Lawler.

2250
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,580
We'll get Tom Cruise for another 32 years or so.

2251
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,900
Oh, he's going to be the first one like to never die.

2252
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,820
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

2253
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,500
It's either forever or he's gone.

2254
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,020
The first immortal man.

2255
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,540
Well, that's true.

2256
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,060
If he gets sucked into space when he's shooting that space movie.

2257
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:11,460
I don't have much to say about this, but I thought this line was clunky

2258
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,180
when they're describing the movie Predator 2, he says,

2259
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:17,340
and this movie, Spaced Invaders find themselves in L.A.

2260
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,740
with a few days to kill.

2261
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:24,180
And then the reveals Predator 2, so it's not really a joke,

2262
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,940
not really fun, not informative of the movie.

2263
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,620
It's not a joke or dry information.

2264
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,540
I just don't like it.

2265
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,380
There's a there's a Shatner.

2266
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:33,220
Didn't we talk about this?

2267
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:37,780
There's a Shatner like Tales from the Crypt from the late 90s

2268
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,060
where he shot all the interstitials like at a bar.

2269
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,140
And it's the laziest shit you've ever seen.

2270
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,780
And it's like it's that's on 2B, I think.

2271
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,700
I forget the name of it.

2272
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,620
But it's like there's like 25 episodes of this.

2273
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,940
You've never heard of cranked it all out in a day.

2274
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:55,500
Yeah, I'm sure a runner for these that I do like how they end is Robert

2275
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,460
England saying next year I'll be back.

2276
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,740
And it sounds like he's going to go in a new Freddie movie.

2277
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:01,540
But then there'll be some joke about what it is.

2278
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:04,500
And I like that he carved the number three into his chest.

2279
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,700
Yes. Back in Horror Hall of Fame three.

2280
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,780
Yeah. Rips his shirt open and he clawed his own.

2281
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,660
You know, one thing we forgot to mention, I mean, we mentioned him

2282
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,940
in the first horror hall of fame when Chucky presents.

2283
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,660
We didn't really talk about that. Yeah.

2284
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,580
He's wearing a little white jinner jacket.

2285
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,620
So many puppets in this.

2286
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,020
It's very sharp.

2287
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:28,740
It looks sharp.

2288
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:33,140
But the thing he's introducing is clips from horror movies around the world.

2289
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:38,100
And then he comes back and he's like, but when you go to the multiplex

2290
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,420
this fall by American.

2291
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,580
And I was like, that is so odd.

2292
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,340
And then he says, see Child's Play 2.

2293
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,380
And I was like, OK, it kind of makes sense.

2294
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,540
But that's such an aggressive way to put it.

2295
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,260
Were you listening to all the jokes he was saying? Yeah.

2296
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,300
OK, yeah. Yeah.

2297
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:55,540
So in a way, by American is a good punchline

2298
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,180
for the sort of xenophobic jokes. Yeah.

2299
01:36:58,780 --> 01:36:59,740
I didn't really like them.

2300
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:01,220
The jokes that much.

2301
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,060
I do want to see the movies. I do.

2302
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,380
Yeah, the movies looked cool.

2303
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:04,900
Crazy looking.

2304
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:08,700
But it was just kind of like a little odd that they're like, oh, the farm movies.

2305
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,420
Let the doll do that.

2306
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,900
Give that to Chucky.

2307
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,540
Scott, there's something I've sent you and I'm a big Chucky fan.

2308
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,340
Love them.

2309
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,500
We won't go down this rabbit hole too far.

2310
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,180
I found there's this era of promotional movies

2311
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:24,340
that were just for blockbusters and mom and pop shops of, hey,

2312
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:26,580
you should buy a thousand copies of this to rent.

2313
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:27,860
Look how popular the movie is.

2314
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:31,140
Oh, yeah. Videos made for the video store chains.

2315
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:31,980
Yes. To like that.

2316
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,500
This is going to up your sales.

2317
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,620
You're seen by no one but that.

2318
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,540
But now they're all on YouTube and you can watch it.

2319
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:40,660
And there's one with Chucky and it's Chucky talking to Cameron.

2320
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,740
He's in sunglasses smoking a cigar.

2321
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:44,220
But the puppet is bad.

2322
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:45,420
The mouth isn't really moving.

2323
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:48,260
Brad Dorff sounds like he doesn't want to be there promoting it.

2324
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:51,260
But he's like, Chucky made big baffo bucks, you see.

2325
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,180
And that's why all the kiddies want to see it.

2326
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,620
The adults. It's a real scream.

2327
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,780
And he's in some sort of Hollywood studio.

2328
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:02,020
And then there's a Freddy Krueger one I found later where it has everyone

2329
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:06,220
that I believe is real employees of, I assume, not actors,

2330
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:11,060
doing a sketch for one of them is scared of going to sleep or else.

2331
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:14,020
Freddy Krueger will come and talk about the potential residuals.

2332
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,860
But so this was another sort of sleepy Brad Dorff.

2333
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,660
And not a knock on it.

2334
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,860
I could see him wanting to be a little sleepy and not there.

2335
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,820
He's also exorcist three is coming out that year.

2336
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,300
So maybe he doesn't want to cross promote.

2337
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:30,140
But it's so exciting to see Chucky in anything walking around talking.

2338
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:30,740
I love it.

2339
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:33,260
And being like a celebrity.

2340
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,900
Being a celebrity, he also exits camera.

2341
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,900
He like kind of waddles off and he talks to Robert England.

2342
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:42,660
Yeah. I would love they would be the best.

2343
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,940
They would be the best of friends.

2344
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,660
Yeah. If you're nerdy for crossovers.

2345
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:47,220
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff like that.

2346
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:51,900
Do you remember when he did a commentary on Weekend Update with Colin Quinn?

2347
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:58,100
Yes, I do remember that Chucky and then pans over and the sink was way.

2348
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,700
It was they clearly like programmed a robot to do this bit.

2349
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:04,620
And they who as soon as it started, it was wrong.

2350
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,620
I still love it. It's great to see him.

2351
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,460
Stuff like that.

2352
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,060
I think we all like what you were saying.

2353
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,820
Buzz Lightyear presenting on the Oscars day.

2354
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:16,020
But some things BB eight rolls onto stage, anything like that.

2355
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:16,660
Always great.

2356
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,820
Dana and David should have Chucky on the pod on the fly on the wall podcast.

2357
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,780
Oh, Carvey and Spain.

2358
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,420
That's what I mean.

2359
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,540
Yeah, he was on SNL.

2360
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,620
Yes, this is what it is.

2361
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:26,340
Nothing like it.

2362
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:30,020
You know, the thrill of the would Chucky enjoy being on Club Randall?

2363
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,940
I think I think he would.

2364
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:33,220
Yes.

2365
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,220
Now, here's a guy I can relate to.

2366
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,740
Now, this guy I get is not the SJW.

2367
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,340
I don't have a lot more to say about this one.

2368
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:44,580
And I, you know, we've been going a while.

2369
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,220
I feel like we got to talk about three.

2370
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,940
But we throw testing anything else you want to that too?

2371
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,020
No, nothing else.

2372
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:55,180
The third one, when I pulled it up, I saw 36 minutes or 33, whatever it was.

2373
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:58,780
And I thought, ah, fuck, this is an incomplete upload.

2374
01:39:58,780 --> 01:39:59,380
Yeah.

2375
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,380
And I started watching it.

2376
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,220
And then every it's both shorter and feels longer.

2377
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:07,220
All the segments are really stretching for time.

2378
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,820
But it chopped it in half.

2379
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,180
Only an hour now.

2380
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,380
Is this the first?

2381
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:16,940
Is this the only bill that the amazing Jonathan and Bobby Bors picket ever shared?

2382
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:20,220
I hope not, but it might be.

2383
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,980
But possibly that.

2384
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:24,340
So, yeah, kind of a downgrade this year.

2385
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:28,100
The first two years, it's this huge event in the Universal Amphitheater.

2386
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,220
It's massive.

2387
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:32,540
And now it gets it's still Universal Studios, but it is

2388
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:37,180
downsized to I want to say it's the Castle Theater,

2389
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,820
which is where the Conan the Barbarian show

2390
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:43,980
and Beetlejuice Graveyard Review and not a fun set to look at compared to the others

2391
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,140
where you can tell the others were made for this event.

2392
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:49,220
I mean, I'm sure it's piecemeal from something, but this one is.

2393
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,980
We're going to have this set.

2394
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:53,260
Yeah. And we have the mechanism to make these.

2395
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,220
They let's make what they'll give us the budget, but less.

2396
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,740
So let's just do this.

2397
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:00,620
The Castle Theater, which, by the way,

2398
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:03,420
Universal Studios venue since 1979.

2399
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,140
And the rumors are very strong now that it's going to be torn down.

2400
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:08,940
We haven't talked about this show that it will be torn down

2401
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,180
to make room for the loading zone for a Fast and Furious

2402
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:14,420
to the rumor and leaked.

2403
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:17,100
There were leaked art to which I mean, there's always art.

2404
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,780
So that doesn't necessarily mean it's a done deal.

2405
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,500
But are the vehicles going to be cars or Vin Diesel?

2406
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,940
Do you get to like ride on his back in his big head or something?

2407
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,900
I believe cars.

2408
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,260
I think there are cars.

2409
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:28,980
I think there's a drifting side of it.

2410
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:32,540
Yeah, I think that I think that roller coaster, but there's a drifting mechanism

2411
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,940
to make you feel like you're drifting also.

2412
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:36,940
Well, the designs can be changed.

2413
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,820
That's true. Yeah, there's still time.

2414
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:42,460
I just want a moment when you're like in the car about to launch or so

2415
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,660
and you get to look over and not at him.

2416
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,700
Oh, wow. What a good idea.

2417
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,660
Honestly, I remember it's a very good idea.

2418
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:51,500
Anyway, excited for that.

2419
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,860
But anyway, the mad know that there is history to this venue

2420
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:58,380
that is being torn down, and that is the horror Hall of Fame three

2421
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:06,340
in which Bride of Frankenstein was honored and Amazing Jonathan performed.

2422
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,900
I like some of the amazing.

2423
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:08,940
I always love it.

2424
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,340
It's kind of an odd thing in the middle of this.

2425
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:13,180
Yeah, he just feels like, yeah, why?

2426
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,860
Why is this full thing in this?

2427
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:16,820
I think he had just done a lot of TV

2428
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:20,780
specials or sets at this point, and they're like, oh, he's kind of macabre.

2429
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,820
Sure. But we have 30 minutes.

2430
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:25,740
It's funny because they put the longest, like almost unrelated bit.

2431
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:26,740
Oh, yeah. Horror.

2432
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,900
But still, it's yeah.

2433
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,940
You can get as many kind of legends this one because no Vincent Price.

2434
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:33,260
You got no Roger Tormann.

2435
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,860
You're well, you know, but they but they didn't get as many.

2436
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,700
Maybe it was like we got to just stack it up with performances.

2437
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,860
I think in a way, I know that there's varied history with everything

2438
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,340
and just there's so much information out there.

2439
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,900
I think they kind of maybe went through all the heavy hitters

2440
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,460
that just someone on the street would know.

2441
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,380
Like, oh, yeah, that's true.

2442
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,460
Yeah, yeah. They would have already honored.

2443
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,180
It's the big it's it's Frankenstein and Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi

2444
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,460
and Alien and Sounds of the Lambs and stuff.

2445
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,060
And so like, yeah, we couldn't do it for John Carpenter because he's like,

2446
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,260
I don't want to be celebrated.

2447
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,420
I assume he'd be like, no, thank you.

2448
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,500
Oh, that's a good point. Yeah, yeah.

2449
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,980
They did Psycho and the Birds.

2450
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,580
I'm working on Mouth of Madness, a movie.

2451
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,260
Andrew will grow up to love.

2452
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,540
That is a good movie.

2453
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,420
It's like the same thing happens.

2454
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:20,340
Bike TV's Guy Awards or whatever they were called.

2455
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,420
You know, they ran out of guys to celebrate.

2456
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:25,860
When we first started talking about this topic, I was like, oh, God,

2457
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:29,020
is this a contemporary of the guys choice awards

2458
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:32,860
and the Comedy Central roast of whoever roasted by

2459
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:36,940
one of their friends and all Comedy Central ringers?

2460
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:38,540
You know? Yeah, yeah, yes.

2461
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:41,300
It all depends with those roasts, because sometimes it was all ringers.

2462
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,220
And then sometimes it was people with friends.

2463
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:47,220
But this had been a roast with like Freddie and some sort of

2464
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:50,660
like letter face and the leprechaun.

2465
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,140
The leprechaun was missing.

2466
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,300
Oh, yeah, no leprechaun.

2467
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,300
Did they just not cut a deal with the studio or something?

2468
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,540
Probably. How is there no leprechaun?

2469
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:01,060
I think there had only been one at the time, right?

2470
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:01,940
Yeah, maybe. Oh, yeah.

2471
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,420
Maybe it didn't loom as large.

2472
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:06,660
Yeah, maybe because he wasn't like in full like comedy.

2473
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:07,660
Yeah.

2474
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:10,860
Julie Louise Dreyfus didn't come to talk about Troll 1.

2475
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,140
Yeah. Troll, really?

2476
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:14,460
Were there any? When was Tremors?

2477
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,740
When was the first Tremors?

2478
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:16,580
It was talked about in this.

2479
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,340
Yes, talking about.

2480
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,780
Yeah. So they didn't didn't have time to build the history.

2481
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,060
Right. All the nine Tremors that we have now.

2482
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:24,100
A lot of Tremors.

2483
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:28,860
You also this one ends up giving the prime award of horror movie of the year,

2484
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:29,940
which were the previous ones.

2485
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,420
It was Arachnophobia the first year, Sansa Lambs the second.

2486
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:37,300
And then this one goes to the Adams family, which like, I don't know if that's a horror movie.

2487
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,940
You kind of wanted him to say in my Freddie movie that's nominated.

2488
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,940
You want him to win it?

2489
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,060
Yeah, you do.

2490
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:47,220
All the work he's put in three years running being the host of this.

2491
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,380
Yeah, that would be nice to go back to the 74 Horror Hall of Fame.

2492
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,260
Been some price. Pretty pleased.

2493
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,740
More than anything, I want to hear more about the 74.

2494
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:57,180
The thing we all called boring.

2495
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:00,540
You're going to be very excited for this little point where John

2496
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:04,100
asked the Anvins and price agree that Adams family was not really horror.

2497
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,700
Sorry, we all have to recover from that.

2498
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:11,180
They both say I don't really feel it.

2499
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,620
And they feel that it's just about a good family, a nice family.

2500
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,380
That is good information.

2501
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,900
Everyone's let that sink in.

2502
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,660
Yeah, no, we are. No, we're all taking it.

2503
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:20,780
We're all taking a second.

2504
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,020
The information.

2505
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:27,220
And then at the end, he promised he chops off a finger, holds up a hand.

2506
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,580
Robert England does. Yes.

2507
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:32,820
He says, and we'll return for a horror hall of fame for as a bloody hand

2508
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,180
with only four fingers.

2509
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:36,260
No four ever happened.

2510
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:39,460
And there was no horror hall of fame for it to not happen.

2511
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:42,780
So it's kind of a sad it's a promise of a sequel that didn't occur.

2512
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,820
Yeah, which is too bad.

2513
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:47,300
Is this I this is a I encourage people to watch these videos.

2514
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,580
They're fun. Bring it back.

2515
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:52,820
Promote the movie Megan coming out in January with the robot girl

2516
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,740
that have like the nun presented.

2517
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,340
I want them all. I want them all.

2518
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:57,860
Some of them are still going.

2519
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:58,980
Blue, the Rapture.

2520
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:01,380
I'm not a big horror guy.

2521
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,980
Have dipped my toe in.

2522
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:05,140
I loved the Megan trailer.

2523
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,020
I was like, well, I got to see Megan.

2524
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,420
I'm going to slide in another wreck.

2525
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:10,180
The director made this movie Housebound.

2526
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:13,740
That's a New Zealand horror movie from 2014 that not enough people have seen.

2527
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:14,940
It's one of my favorite movies.

2528
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:17,380
Everyone who sees it goes, I can't believe I've never seen this.

2529
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,780
Wow. Watch Housebound.

2530
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:22,820
Sure. And now this is the follow up movie and it's a horror comedy.

2531
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,780
I assume this will be a little funny.

2532
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:26,580
I like. Yeah, I agree. It's a great trailer.

2533
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,660
Yeah. The creepy doll doing TikTok dances.

2534
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:32,300
But bring back the horror Hall of Fame.

2535
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:36,660
Yeah. With that with we have almost we have 30 years of new horror.

2536
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,860
Now it's replenished. Now there is plenty.

2537
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:40,380
There's the genre is so huge.

2538
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,980
It's not as culty as it was.

2539
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:44,740
There's a ton that you can pan from Pam's labyrinth.

2540
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,500
Oh, sure. Yeah.

2541
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,620
Oh, you cut to the audience and pan.

2542
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:53,380
Yeah, he can't touch the microphone or the other guy with the with the eyes on his hand.

2543
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:55,140
Oh, yeah. What's that? What's that character's name?

2544
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:58,220
He's supposed to present the award and then he can't figure out how to grab it.

2545
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:00,860
Man, the fawn is the main.

2546
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,620
Oh, yeah. Fawn's the main guy. Fawn's the main guy.

2547
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,140
Yeah. Pam.

2548
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:08,500
Look, let Jason Blum and Jordan Peele like produce it.

2549
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:11,340
They would make it funny and also at the horror stuff.

2550
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,500
You know, this chore.

2551
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,100
They would love it.

2552
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,220
They would love it.

2553
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,380
And look, get Robert Englund to host it.

2554
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,900
Yeah, he's around.

2555
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:20,980
He's around.

2556
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:23,180
Again, Elvira, she's around.

2557
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,980
She was just in New York Comic Con.

2558
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,980
All of them. Horror's not going anywhere.

2559
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:27,980
Right.

2560
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:33,060
But we just as the closer, the one with somebody who isn't around

2561
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,860
and who cannot do the big feature performance.

2562
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:41,260
And this might be the most fun thing in any of them is that you get a big stage

2563
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:44,700
performance of the Immortal Monster Mash.

2564
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,100
By Bobby Boris Pickett.

2565
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,380
Really, that's where I told you when I said, you know what?

2566
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,460
I think we want to do that episode.

2567
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:53,500
You had us at Bobby Boris Pickett because you get a performance

2568
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,620
not just of him doing the Monster Mash, but partway through.

2569
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:01,380
He is joined by the monsters from Beetlejuice's Graveyard Review.

2570
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,820
Yeah. So listeners, if you do nothing else and you are a fan of that kind

2571
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:09,020
of old Universal Studios stuff, there is that you get to see the ultimate

2572
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:13,020
mashup, the legitimization of the Graveyard Review gang.

2573
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:15,420
Yeah. By having the ultimate monster singer.

2574
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,100
And he's given it his all.

2575
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,580
He's given his all. He's wearing his legs.

2576
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:23,700
Wearing a tuxedo backed up by Beetlejuice and the gang.

2577
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:25,740
He's doing his face tricks.

2578
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:28,380
Well, yeah, the band that was this was a track, right?

2579
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:29,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2580
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:30,900
Yeah. There's no band.

2581
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:31,940
There's no band.

2582
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:35,260
The monsters are all creeping around behind, you know, the monsters like

2583
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:38,580
the Wolfman, Frankenstein and Beetlejuice.

2584
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:40,580
He just doesn't.

2585
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:43,020
He's a little bit of a different him.

2586
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,340
Is just a backup monster is funny.

2587
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,500
Yes. Yeah.

2588
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,620
He does all the facial expressions.

2589
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:52,140
Bobby Borgspickett's thing is that he like would like grimace

2590
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,180
like he was a monster and he does it here for the listeners.

2591
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,580
Mike was doing the faces.

2592
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:01,380
He's doing them now to mimic a great facial impression of Bobby Borgspickett.

2593
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,420
He's doing a great job.

2594
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:03,500
I wish you all could see.

2595
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,580
I just now like I felt eyestrain when I did it.

2596
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:09,740
That's why you need to leave it to the professionals like Bobby Borgspickett.

2597
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,820
Did you do your stretches this morning?

2598
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,180
Of eye popping out.

2599
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,180
I did. Yeah.

2600
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,580
It's great. It's a great performance.

2601
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:20,340
And it's you know, there's probably an episode to be done about

2602
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:23,700
Mashes in general, maybe or the body of work of Bobby Borgspickett.

2603
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,980
Yeah, because there was the monster swim and the monster rap.

2604
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:30,620
It was like a chubby checker situation where it was like,

2605
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,780
I don't know what else to do.

2606
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,820
Let's just go back to the well and see if it works.

2607
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:35,660
But I like the monster swim. It's great.

2608
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,060
The my yeah, I mean, there's something to it.

2609
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:39,140
There's something to introduce my dick holiday.

2610
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,860
The monster swims introduced by Dick Clark.

2611
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:43,180
And there's a very weird sketch.

2612
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,500
It's early television.

2613
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:47,220
But like I think a snake or something spooks him on his shoulder.

2614
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:47,780
And he's in the audience.

2615
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:49,660
It's like, oh, well, I mean, that was scary.

2616
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:50,820
Well, this is also scary.

2617
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:52,100
And then it's the monster swim.

2618
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,220
And it's about like, what if you swam?

2619
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,820
And I they what if you swam like a monster

2620
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:00,020
to the same tune as the monster?

2621
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:03,260
There's a there's a full I mean, there's a full episode,

2622
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:06,380
I think, on just all the horror hosts albums.

2623
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,980
Like Elvira has an album I've been listening to lately.

2624
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:12,020
So many Freddie, like the Freddie game was.

2625
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:13,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2626
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,860
A four player game.

2627
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:18,420
There was a guy named Zachary who has an album I really like.

2628
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:19,940
I think I've mentioned that four years ago.

2629
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:22,500
Is that a five? I think it's three timers, maybe.

2630
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,020
I don't think it's five.

2631
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:26,340
I think it's three or four at the most.

2632
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:29,340
Uh huh. Zachary awareness means you don't have to take a shot.

2633
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:30,780
Zachary for president.

2634
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,700
And he's like, let's put a good in the White House.

2635
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:35,460
And that's like the premise of a song.

2636
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,820
You must be so upset that there is not there's no

2637
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:41,540
that there are a genre of music that is not popular on the radio right now is

2638
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:42,660
Mashes.

2639
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,500
I am 100 percent. Yes, I am.

2640
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,060
I am. They're not the at least three artists a year who I'm a big fan.

2641
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,780
I one year I really went through a lot of like just on Apple Music.

2642
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:56,180
And it's just believe it or not, a lot of shit, a lot of terrible.

2643
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,900
Was that your depression year?

2644
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,460
There was 22 was Covid 20.

2645
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,860
Oh, OK. Oh, that's how you spend Covid.

2646
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,340
Time to find every mash.

2647
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:09,740
Yeah. But if you have a depression year, you get it all out of your system

2648
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:11,260
and you never get depressed again.

2649
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,180
Exactly. So that's good.

2650
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:13,940
Yeah. Good. You got it out of the way so early.

2651
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,620
That's right. It's one and done. It's not Covid.

2652
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:18,820
It's not. There's no variant to it.

2653
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,820
So it's it's great.

2654
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,380
All these are a lot of fun.

2655
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,260
And I, you know, I there wasn't anything that interesting in

2656
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:28,500
like behind the scenes. Couldn't find anything.

2657
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,180
People. Yeah, not a lot.

2658
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:32,260
I mean, I think one of the people writing and producing it

2659
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,620
went on to be the president of WeTV.

2660
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,220
So I think everybody had thriving TV careers after this.

2661
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,620
The one that I like the most is the director of at least the first year,

2662
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:44,980
Ron Demore, just directed a ton of he directed like some of the Disney parades

2663
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:47,300
that we like and SAG Awards and whatever.

2664
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,900
But he also directed a very important special called Come Together,

2665
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,980
a night for John Lennon's words and music.

2666
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:57,740
So he took his experience doing live direction of monsters

2667
01:51:57,740 --> 01:52:01,460
performing songs and applied it to Kevin Spacey's immortal

2668
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:04,180
performance of my games.

2669
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:06,300
That's my favorite of the lineup.

2670
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:08,980
I will never I like mash.

2671
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:12,100
I I just need to go back to those.

2672
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,860
Yeah, I can't go that long without a hit of mind games.

2673
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:19,180
It's the height of comedy for you.

2674
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,620
You should just say when he jumps, he does this.

2675
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,660
He's so sad about 9-11.

2676
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,020
He has to do a jump.

2677
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:29,380
There's no can you think of a written sketch or a written piece of comedy

2678
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:32,100
like more than watching Kevin Spacey do mine?

2679
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,380
No, I don't think so.

2680
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,980
No, it's so funny to me.

2681
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:37,060
I don't think that's what I would do.

2682
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:40,100
Yeah. I mean, well, that it's but it's also tied with the one

2683
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:44,500
where he misses the basket at the British Sports Award where Tony Hawk glares at him.

2684
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:48,460
Oh, boy. But here I am getting we look we did a whole episode about that.

2685
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,780
And I don't want to I don't know if I'm ready for a shot yet.

2686
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:55,500
Anything else we want to call out or just general appreciation for this special?

2687
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:00,100
Yeah, I just I mean, again, I'm trying to become a little horror boy.

2688
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,060
I'll help you if you need to.

2689
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:06,180
I have taught the easy way and how we find that so much of this is so similar

2690
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:10,860
to all the stuff we like this kids, the nerdy comic stuff and the lore

2691
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:12,340
and so much garbage.

2692
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:15,580
But it's yeah, finding out that it's silly and fun and cheeky,

2693
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:18,580
I think is a good end instead of just a brutal assault.

2694
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,900
Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's I wish I'd been informed that a little like

2695
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:24,300
the Final Destination movies are so fun

2696
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:26,580
and the silliest movies.

2697
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:29,340
Right. Yes. They're clearly just gleefully having fun.

2698
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:31,780
If you had to give just one a gruesome

2699
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:35,860
the severed thumb up, it is what's what's the top final destination?

2700
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:37,900
Do that first one first one.

2701
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,100
Yeah. OK. Love them all.

2702
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,420
But yeah, the first one is it's a solid movie. Great.

2703
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,660
That's cool.

2704
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:48,180
Can I say real quick, I would like to induct Andrew Grissom

2705
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:51,380
for bringing us together to do this podcast. Wow.

2706
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:54,420
Into the PTR Horror Hall of Fame.

2707
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,940
Not the legend.

2708
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,260
Not the legend yet.

2709
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:57,940
But I do.

2710
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:59,220
The haunt cast, the Fright.

2711
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:02,260
He's in the haunt cast, the Fright Hall.

2712
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:03,980
The fresh, the new.

2713
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:06,980
Yes, this is you're the first inductor inductee into this.

2714
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:07,780
Andrew Grissom.

2715
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:10,140
Wow. So you're the wait, who was the first?

2716
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:11,940
You are the equivalent of the exorcist.

2717
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:12,820
Oh, boy.

2718
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:15,380
That's as crucial as you are to the formation of the show.

2719
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:17,060
And I have a statue for you.

2720
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,700
Oh, boy.

2721
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:21,340
And I want to say courtesy of Brian Marriottie.

2722
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:24,020
The COO of Funko.

2723
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:25,100
Our newest guy.

2724
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,180
Oh, my gosh.

2725
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:28,060
Did I call her Electra?

2726
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:29,940
Elvira Funko pop.

2727
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,740
Wow.

2728
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:33,060
In her sparkly dress.

2729
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:34,220
Oh.

2730
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:37,260
And Andrew can even speak to the fact that I've I've toy

2731
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,500
pilled him in the last couple of years.

2732
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,060
Successfully got me to like toys a little bit.

2733
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:44,940
He got obsessed.

2734
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,060
But I did.

2735
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:48,740
There was, I think, two months ago, I was at Target

2736
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:51,020
just getting, I think, batteries.

2737
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:54,220
Then I went down the toilet aisle and was like, I do want that toy.

2738
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:55,940
I guess I'll buy it right now.

2739
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:56,740
And then I texted Mike.

2740
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:57,820
I was like, you did it.

2741
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:59,140
You got into my head.

2742
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:03,460
I got him a NECA Kong and a NECA Godzilla a couple of years ago.

2743
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:06,460
Oh, and you're like, these are my friends now.

2744
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:09,100
Yeah. You got me in.

2745
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:10,100
Yeah, that's great.

2746
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,060
Well, that's very exciting.

2747
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,900
You won the the haunt cast the Fright Ruby Elvira.

2748
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,340
That's the official.

2749
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:20,100
We're now committed to having to give that to anyone who also gets this.

2750
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,980
Gosh, I got to buy a couple more.

2751
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,940
This is great. She's got a little heart.

2752
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:28,260
And you didn't even have to be the grandson of a long dead.

2753
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,740
Of no one in particular.

2754
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:32,060
Yeah. You're someone's grandson.

2755
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,220
Probably.

2756
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,340
Probably four people.

2757
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:36,060
Yeah.

2758
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,500
People. Yes.

2759
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,420
And it's good you're the first one because you get the nice Elvira one.

2760
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,700
Michael be like scrounging for like a fourth tier.

2761
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:47,380
His dark materials, Funko, for the next inductee.

2762
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:48,220
True.

2763
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,860
I know I'll talk to Brian about it and please.

2764
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:52,460
Brian Marriott.

2765
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:53,420
Marriott. Yeah.

2766
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,980
Let him know. I appreciate it.

2767
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:55,780
OK.

2768
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,820
This was just an unrelated thing.

2769
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:59,140
I know we're wrapping up.

2770
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:00,780
It's related to the podcast.

2771
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:04,540
There were just two things from past episodes to connect on.

2772
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:05,780
Perfect. OK.

2773
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:08,100
I think a while ago, you all did a

2774
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:12,140
scary rides and movies and you ranked them.

2775
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:14,020
Or does that sound familiar?

2776
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,140
Clifford one.

2777
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:16,980
Oh, just fake theme.

2778
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:18,020
Fake theme park.

2779
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:18,900
Yeah, competition for 50.

2780
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,940
There's a fake theme park in 1999.

2781
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,420
It's House on Hotted Hill with Jeffrey Rush.

2782
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:30,300
Great plays and an eccentric amusement park owner named Stephen Price.

2783
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,780
And it's all filmed in Universal Florida.

2784
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,700
Yeah. Oh, yes.

2785
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,060
A little bit, but it wasn't mentioned.

2786
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:41,300
I don't really like the movie that much, but I think the idea of the stuff there.

2787
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:44,380
So in case you ever do a part two, I think there's more theme parks to mind from.

2788
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:47,700
But that one is truly insane because his whole mindset is

2789
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,660
I want to make a scary theme park.

2790
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,940
It's only scary. Nothing is not scary.

2791
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:56,020
OK. You think it would have been weird beaten the Clifford dinosaur park?

2792
01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:00,460
I don't think so, but I just think it would be it would be a contender for you all to.

2793
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:03,020
OK, I can tell you what happens, but I also think if you watch

2794
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:07,740
the opening scene of the movie and then turn it off after they never go back to a theme park.

2795
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:09,860
OK, that's OK.

2796
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:13,500
And then one other thing I wanted to ask is in the Alfred Hitchcock episode,

2797
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,420
did you all talk about Steven Spielberg?

2798
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:19,300
Taking over the the office, their interaction?

2799
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,420
No, no. OK, so this is the thing I want to read.

2800
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:24,060
And I have my notes.

2801
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:25,140
You can listen to that.

2802
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,420
That's it. We didn't add those in.

2803
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:29,260
So Steven Spielberg

2804
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:34,580
snuck onto the set of Family Plot, his final film.

2805
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:37,020
Uh huh. I think no frenzy.

2806
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,260
No, finally, plot was less.

2807
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:42,100
OK. Yeah. Anyway, seems Spielberg snuck onto the set

2808
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:47,300
and Hitchcock, quote, was upset by an uninvited young man

2809
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:50,020
hovering around the set and wanted him gone.

2810
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:53,740
And Spielberg, all he wanted to do was meet Alfred Hitchcock.

2811
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:58,300
And then there's this Bruce Dern biography from a couple of years ago

2812
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,780
where he talks about being on Family Plot.

2813
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:05,180
And he said he remembered that moment and saying, like,

2814
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:07,060
I know Steven Spielberg, he's this young kid.

2815
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:09,020
All he just wants to meet you so badly.

2816
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:14,460
Why don't you let him meet you?

2817
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,500
And then Alfred Hitchcock says, and I won't do the voice,

2818
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,860
but just this quote from Bruce Dern is the best.

2819
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,420
Isn't that the boy who made the fish movie?

2820
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:24,780
I could never sit down and talk to him because I look at him

2821
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:28,020
and feel like such a whore.

2822
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:32,620
Because I'm the voice of the ride at Universal Studios theme park.

2823
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:36,180
They paid me a million dollars and I took it and I did it.

2824
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:37,340
I'm such a whore.

2825
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:40,060
I can't sit down and talk to the boy who did the fish movie.

2826
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:42,540
I couldn't even touch his hand.

2827
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:45,420
So he wasn't if the story is to be believed, he wasn't

2828
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,540
snubbing him out of like lack of respect.

2829
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:52,260
It was you just reinvented cinema blockbusters

2830
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:56,100
and I just like cashed out and feel like a whore.

2831
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:58,340
And how could you even look up to me?

2832
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:01,180
I'm like I'm nothing but a goof now.

2833
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:04,140
The clip that we showed where he's flying around, he's this in this

2834
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:06,620
on the I'm the six million dollar man.

2835
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:10,300
That's what's in is I'm nothing but the six million dollar whore

2836
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:13,900
to Mr. Fish isn't that the boy who made the fish movie?

2837
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:17,220
I could never sit down and talk to him because I look at him

2838
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:18,740
and feel like such a whore.

2839
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,060
Have we talked about this before?

2840
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,700
I've heard this story.

2841
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,300
Yeah, we said this or somebody might have alerted us to it.

2842
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:30,220
It's been circulating, but I was I don't remember it being spoken.

2843
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,740
Anyway, I don't think so.

2844
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:33,460
Should we all do a shot of that?

2845
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,620
Just in case is that well, I want to do it.

2846
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:37,140
At least it doesn't have to be a shot.

2847
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:39,580
I just wanted us to taste Crystal Head Vodka together.

2848
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,580
Oh, that's nice.

2849
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:43,540
I believe none of us give Jason a little orange juice and Crystal Head

2850
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:45,300
so he doesn't feel like he's going to go loopy.

2851
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:46,140
Oh, that's a great.

2852
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:49,540
Well, here we shouldn't make you do part or us.

2853
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:53,340
Yeah, don't bartend because you've been a great guest for a few hours.

2854
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,180
You brought you made our show.

2855
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:58,940
You brought Mike and I together and then it helped the show to happen.

2856
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:02,140
And you you have your Ruby Elvira to thank you for it.

2857
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:05,900
And then so let's not let's not bartend.

2858
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,980
Let us in fact say,

2859
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:11,260
Andrew Grissom, you survived to haunt cast the fright and came out of it

2860
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:13,620
in the Hall of Fame.

2861
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:17,260
Let's exit through the there's no scary gift shop, is there?

2862
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:22,780
Let's exit through the I don't know, the fucking scary gift shop.

2863
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:23,580
I don't fucking know.

2864
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:26,660
Yeah, the Halloween tribute store.

2865
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,140
Let's exit through the Halloween tribute store.

2866
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:30,580
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2867
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:32,420
I don't know the answer to that.

2868
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:34,740
No, I'm just kind of living my life, doing my thing.

2869
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:40,220
I'll promote past things like Moonbeam City, which is on Paramount Plus.

2870
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,420
The writer's assistant of movie city.

2871
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,540
And you were so much a part of that show.

2872
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:46,220
Watch a lot of lawnmower man.

2873
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:49,180
Watch the whole is a big lawnmower man tribute episodes.

2874
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:52,900
So yeah, well, that and like it's a lot of disclosure to

2875
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:55,300
all my parents stuff.

2876
02:00:55,300 --> 02:01:00,540
Yeah, no, I've I'm very lucky to have worked with you on multiple projects.

2877
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:05,100
Scott and where I feel like I'm cheating the system by making a living off of them

2878
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,620
by having so much fun.

2879
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:08,340
Oh, man. I feel the same way.

2880
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:13,260
I know. I when it's lined up that way and then like in Andrew's at work.

2881
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:14,220
This is insane.

2882
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,540
Saturday morning, all star hits on Netflix.

2883
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:17,580
Yes, please check it out.

2884
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,140
Our watch for the first time.

2885
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:19,900
Watch it again.

2886
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:22,540
The most fun I've ever had working on something.

2887
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:25,140
This terrific time.

2888
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:28,140
The funnier, die short film Zero Gravity Gulch.

2889
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:29,940
Oh, hey, I'm the coaster chief.

2890
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:31,460
Comes up once in a while.

2891
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:35,140
But the thing that I made, if you're a newer listener that I or you never saw it,

2892
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:38,420
it's on my YouTube channel now, I think the or maybe it's on Friday.

2893
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:42,260
I made a pre ride video with Patrick Warburton, who's really in Soren.

2894
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:44,460
And I put you to I made you take your shirt off.

2895
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:47,140
Yeah. If you want to see me shirtless from a decade ago,

2896
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:49,180
that was a lot of it.

2897
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,940
We should say you're in a video with Jay Leno.

2898
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:51,980
That might be five times.

2899
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,140
Oh, yes.

2900
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,420
Oh, that's probably why you've yeah, you may have come up

2901
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,380
for that reason before that you're in the denim car video.

2902
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:03,020
You shared screen time with Jay Leno, which we're you know, we should all

2903
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:07,060
we're all just touching your boot to you did that one day.

2904
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,100
And then I'm not affiliated with these.

2905
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:11,300
Can I just promote podcasts that I like?

2906
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:13,580
Absolutely. Sure. Wow.

2907
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:15,100
I really like Gorley and Rust.

2908
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:16,260
I've been listening to that all this year.

2909
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:18,140
That's sort of what got me into Chucky and to rewatch.

2910
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,740
Oh, yes. Oh, sure. Hey, great.

2911
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:21,460
So they're both awesome on our show.

2912
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:24,380
So, yeah, both guys check. Yeah, of course.

2913
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:28,020
Yeah, sloppy boys makes me laugh a comfortable show.

2914
02:02:28,860 --> 02:02:32,020
Funny guys that are just having a blast. Yes.

2915
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:34,860
They were what would they think of your this little

2916
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:39,860
how they rate the warm crystal

2917
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:45,180
head vodka with maybe a splash of Donald of warm Donald Donald Duck juice.

2918
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,940
I think they'd rank it as oh, we kind of liked it.

2919
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:50,780
The name of this drink held me out here.

2920
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,980
It's got to be we know what the word for done with Donald that we said,

2921
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,820
but then you got to combine acroid with it.

2922
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:57,620
Is it like the cheap brother?

2923
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,940
I was going to say scream driver instead of screwdriver.

2924
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,620
Oh, seat driver seat driver.

2925
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:04,220
But how do you represent?

2926
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,660
Well, he isn't driving this. That's true.

2927
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:10,980
But what's the you know, the the the the seat buster?

2928
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:12,620
It's the seat buster. Buster is good.

2929
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:15,820
Yeah. Yes. Disturbing because it sounds like you're going to shut it out.

2930
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:16,860
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2931
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:17,940
Your seat's going to bust.

2932
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:20,780
But I'm pretty sure if you talk to that, it's like that's one of the distilled

2933
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,660
spirits where you won't have any hangover.

2934
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:24,140
There's no after defects.

2935
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:26,540
I mean, you can drink it straight. It's very smooth.

2936
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:30,260
Don't mix it with Donald juice, I promise.

2937
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:34,060
He'd probably be horrified at like the corn syrup orange juice.

2938
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:36,380
I mean, sir, doesn't a mixer.

2939
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:39,100
I have a lot of respect for Donald Duck and his filmography,

2940
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:41,460
but I don't want him anywhere near my crystal head.

2941
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,020
But pure spirit.

2942
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,620
Anything else to shout out?

2943
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:49,420
But it's been an episode full of gruesome thumbs ups and.

2944
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:53,580
Yeah, I guess just if you go back or listen to the episode all over again,

2945
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:55,900
listen to my recommends, watch these movies.

2946
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,740
It's the season.

2947
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:59,660
Hope everyone has a nice Halloween time.

2948
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:01,380
Oh, boy. Spooky times.

2949
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:05,340
You're being as kind as you are as a friend.

2950
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:08,380
And truly, that's the things you listed and other things you might not even know

2951
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:12,100
about if you've enjoyed any of the filmed materials with the name

2952
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:15,460
Scott Gardner on them, probably Andrew Grissom's either been part of it or

2953
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:18,180
some of it helped encourage helping out.

2954
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,180
Yeah. Yeah.

2955
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:21,300
Or I talked shit to you about ones you weren't part of.

2956
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:23,300
Oh, yeah.

2957
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:24,820
And complicated. Oh, it's complicated.

2958
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:26,220
Oh, yeah. You really made it.

2959
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:28,180
Yeah. If you're a Craig Healy fan, this is the guy.

2960
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,900
You're going to happen without you.

02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:32,380

ourselves first Friday the 13th because they speak weird.

2967
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:52,300
Donald Pleasance, Colombo, where he's a 70s.

2968
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:54,100
You know, there's a lot of homework.

2969
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,660
He's a weird 70s wine guy.

2970
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:59,700
The little scene, New Zealand movie Housebound from the director of Megan.

2971
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:03,140
And mostly big man's brew, big man's brew.

2972
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:07,300
If you live in a place where you can get big man's brew, get big man's brew.

Frank Marshall's presence, which may or may not have had a speech

2976
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,500
attached, probably did not have a speech attached.

2977
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,460
Look up a photo, a photo of Frank Marshall.

2978
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:24,460
That's all you need at the Jurassic World ride.

2979
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:25,380
His presence premiere.

2980
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,420
That'll do it.

2981
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:28,940
Well, cool.

2982
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:30,780
Nothing else to say. Let's drink some skull juice.
