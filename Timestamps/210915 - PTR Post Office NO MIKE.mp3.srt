1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hi, yep, it's me, I'm here.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And that'll do it.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's it, that's what we got.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is what we got today.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the first ever Podcast The Ride without Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He's the only one of us who's never missed one.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know, we try to do this if somebody's going out of town for a little bit,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
like, or has something going on, give little breaks here and there,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
even though he's done some while in Schomburg.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But, you know, we thought still give him one off.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, we don't want him to, like, you know, have to get off the plane

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and start, like, talking into a Zoom recorder at LAX, you know.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like TMZ is greeting him.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We're waiting for it, we make him do one in the car.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're back, buddy, get back to it.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're doing it on the encounter.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're doing it on the restaurant in the middle of LAX that's never open anymore.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're breaking in.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's zipline to the, let's throw a line up to that top of that thing,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
record and what's left.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, we're giving him one off.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So that leaves Jason and I here in this particularly odd setting,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which is like for whatever reason not in my yard,

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but in this, like, narrow dog run kind of setting on the side of my house.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Next to, like, the power grid.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When I was driving over, I was like, oh, we can stay at the top,

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
like, lock the gates, we're in the garage, like, Marin.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then we shifted from the garage.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now we're not even yet due to work that you might hear happening in another yard.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe you'll hear it less here.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if, like, if there was kind of a punk ethos to Marin in the garage,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then, like, doesn't it, oh, like, isn't this one more than that,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
where even we're next to the garage?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, we're in a dusty alleyway.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We're in a space, like, between a bunch of garages.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think that makes us extra punk because there's extra garages around.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this is real grimy, I think.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But we're going to try to get something out of it.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And this is what I thought should be addressed a little bit.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just being, well, first of all, that it's just you and I.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How does this feel in general?

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is this like, do we, is there like a, is there a nakedness to a lack of Mike?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do we feel like, is there a phantom presence that we can't turn to?

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I mean, Mike is certainly the one that, like, I knew Mike,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I've known Mike since, like, 2009.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I briefly lived with Mike.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I won't forget this, that you lived together.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then you met him a few years later,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and then I met you around that same time, like around parties or, you know, group hangouts.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We were probably at the same events a little bit,

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and then things got sort of narrowed down.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sure we talked or whatever, but I think I maybe hadn't connected that you were a big theme park guy specifically,

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
or like more so than anybody else in Mike's fold.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And then we started connecting, and then the podcast happened.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is one thing I wanted to say in terms of, like, you and I meeting or getting to know each other.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like, I'm sure we had a couple times by this point.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But while Mike's not here, I would like to embarrass him by saying that what my takeaway before we really spent a lot of time together,

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
started doing the podcast together, is that Mike is and was obsessed with you.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There was so many, there was like, I just remember, like, a pretty constant flow of like,

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
yeah, this guy Jason, you got to, he did this and he did this, and one time there was this, and you got to see,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you're going to have to spend some time with him because of this, this, that.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like, there was so much buildup, I feel like.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know how much you're aware of that.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I mean, I love that. I love hearing that.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, like, nights where you aren't there, or maybe where you had like, I feel like you maybe met us at the Tamm O'Shanter.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We're on brand. We go to this like Disney-ish restaurant where Walt Disney used to go.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think you might have met us there and then left, and then the entire rest of the outing was stories about you.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So there was a, like, there was a high level of interest and obsession.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I mean, I'm loving this. This is making me sound so much more interesting that I actually am,

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and I love building that mythology for our wonderful listeners.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I, yeah, he, I mean, he has said on the show before that he's never forgotten anything that you have done.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He remembers everything about, everything he's witnessed you do, and I can, like, I think I guess that was sort of,

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was aware of that even before the podcast began.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wow. Well, I mean, my memory of meeting you, well, I actually felt very embarrassed one of the first times I met you,

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because you had put out a video on Funny or Die, a very funny video about steam rollers.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I came up to you, we were in a, like, you know, a group of mutual friends, like, chit-chatting at a birthday boys' party,

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and I said, oh, I really like that video you put out, and I think I said forklifts, and then I, as I was walking away,

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was like, oh my God, I got the whole big specific of the video wrong, and I felt very foolish.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And well, here's where I can tell you I remember it perfectly, I'm furious, and finally we can hash it out here in this side yard,

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and I throw you against the fence. No, I don't recall that one bit.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't mind the switch out to forklifts makes all the sense.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Kind of a lateral move, yeah, big pieces of construction, and I, yeah.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, totally. I'm still learning what all of them are, having a baby son now.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now, there's a lot of books that are teaching me what the specific big trucks and mechanisms are.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So there's, yeah, it's all close, I don't blame you.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's interesting, I don't remember that one.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, I like that stuff where, like, this weird little, you know, before you spent a bunch of time together,

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
there was some odd little strand of something.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I like that we had this thing where we all took a tour of Imagineering pre-podcast.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That is kind of an interesting, that was maybe, was that like an early time that we hung out, I feel like?

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think so. That was also like, very, for me, it was very stressful because I was doing it like on my lunch break.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like, I told them I would probably take a long lunch that hour, and I was just going from, like, you know,

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Burbank, like, by this big shopping center, the Empire Center, formerly the Lockheed Martin aircraft plant.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Now one of the worst themed malls. Yeah.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it one of the most unpleasant shopping centers that exists?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was dashing from there to Imagineering, but that kind of, the area around Imagineering is a little confusing,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the surface streets and stuff. Like, there's still a lot of...

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sparsely populated.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sparsely populated, but then you'll just stumble upon a tiny residential street, and so, like, the clock was ticking,

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and we wanted to be, you know, polite to our guide and stuff.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I remember, well, I remember that you, yeah, that you were running late, I think we heard that you were running late,

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and then we watched you park from very far away, but then walk up to Imagineering with no particular pace or speed on it.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, I also saw a person walking to the same, who ended up being our guide, that I thought, I think that's...

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Walking on the other side of the street at the same pace, and I kind of made the connection, because I think I had met her briefly once.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So you're like matching.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So I was kind of like, I think we're going, yeah, to the same place.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They're not sprinting, and I needn't sprint. Yeah, and then we got this great tour of Imagineering,

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and nerded out about every poster on the wall, and every little thing we saw.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There were, like, audible gasps, and she seemed embarrassed by us at various times.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She, this is her day to day, and she's just like, you guys, Jesus, you guys really are...

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You guys need to start a podcast or something.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And almost a year later, I think, like almost a year later, we started work, because we were like sketching it out for a few months before we got down to it.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah, yeah. But yeah, relatively within that window of time, we'd love to come back to Imagineering again, if anybody has it in to let us.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Anyone, we met a handful of other people who worked there, but I'm after COVID and all the layoffs and stuff.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to bother anyone, because I don't know, students still have the job.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is anyone there? That's right, I mean, moved.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Huh. Well, we'll see. We might be, those soaps might be shot.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But here, well, here's the other thing about you and I doing an episode.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think Mike threw that out and like, yeah, we probably should. We've never done that.

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But this in the past has been a, when somebody's not here, we sort of used it as a conduit to do an episode about something that only the two left are interested in.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There's, you know, there was this Marvel episode, there was an episode all about rock and roll, because Mike and I, of course, love rock and roll.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then, and the, and then the Casamigos incident, of course, as well.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:06,000
With this, with us, I'm like, what is the, is there something that Mike is not, I can't, but I couldn't immediately think of something that's like, that's Jason Scott thing and not a Mike thing.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think, I thought of it, but only like last night.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I think it would be too labor intensive and too visual, which is like, and other people do it much better.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But like entertainment retail design, like you, you, a while back, we're talking about all the coffee table books of like malls.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh yeah, I bought all these shops that are called like storefronts, volume 47.

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Entertainment restaurants, volume 102.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And, and we've talked before about, there's like a group of Twitter accounts.

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This guy, Evan Collins and Y2K Aesthetic Institute.

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it's kind of like 90s, 2000s design history of like public spaces, usually centered around entertainment and retail.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But they've done all the work.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, yeah, we're just like, we're just repeating material, I guess, and describing photos.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
One of the worst things you can do for a long stretch of time, just, just describe photos.

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What, you retweeted one last night, I want to say, that looked so crazy.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What was that?

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That was, it was like an entertainment center in Florida, like a family fun center kind of place that didn't last very long, but it was very, like, very designed.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It was very like a lot of googie, it seems like, design.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And then it became the Pac-Man Cafe.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then it became a Maggiano's.

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right, that's right.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But it did exist as like, it got finished.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was this like crazy kooky shopping center that looks like a sort of like Fantasia dream.

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't, I don't really recall.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I believe it's in, like by Hollywood, Florida.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think I saw the, the town Davies, Florida.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And it is, yeah, it was just very, very cool looking.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And, you know, it's a thing that I wish I could have gone there, you know.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And it became, the Pac-Man Cafe was part of it, like the one we went to in Schaumburg.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Or is that, is that what that's called?

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That might be some other Pac-Man brand.

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It might have been.

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a sloppy brand.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's all over the map.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But like, wouldn't, I don't know, maybe we have like a special interest in this sort of area, but I feel like it wouldn't be out of bounds for Mike.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I think, I mean, it's not that some of the things that we've talked about separately, I mean, Casamigo certainly, that had to be done in a corner.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You had to go do that in your box.

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh wait, which I thought of something last night, and this is the second gate, and without shattering Mike's dreams, because I think you're fascinated by the story.

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think Mike is especially fascinated with the guy, with George Clooney's tequila partner, Randy Gerber.

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I think, and this is going to be done so in code, and I'm going to have to tell you off Mike my specifics, because I can't reveal sources.

179
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But Mike's going to hear this, and he might shiver, he might cry when he hears this later.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have talked to someone who has talked to someone who has interacted with Randy Gerber.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wow.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And they were very quick, with no particular prodding or judgment, when asked, what can you tell me about Randy Gerber?

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Randy Gerber, this person said in no uncertain terms that Randy Gerber is a huge piece of shit.

184
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh no!

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Randy Gerber sucks.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I can say no more specifics, and the listeners might think that I'm making this up, or just throwing Randy Gerber shade, because I'm fired up by Mike's absence.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:53,000
However, and I can't say more why, but you know, we've devoted a lot of time at this point to somebody who is evidently a huge piece of shit.

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I just want to vaguely get that out there.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, it wouldn't be the first, and it's not going to be the last.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I guess by virtue of a podcast that crosses over with real estate and development, and where billions of dollars are needed to do things, you are going to bump into huge pieces of shit.

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We sometimes glorify huge pieces of shit.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sometimes.

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, yeah, it'll happen again.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But anyway, you know, we should just, I think we should be on the lookout for other things, for things that exclude Mike, in case this happens again.

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I think that maybe the listener, that's why we threw it out as a mailbag, I think was maybe you can help us figure out what is, maybe we can have a moment here that spurs the Jason and Scott interest that Mike is shut out from.

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Maybe we'll do an episode while he's in town even and not invite him.

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, well, we're really starting to war internal broadcast.

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right, Mike, you are.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This is a president has been set.

200
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You assume you can come to every episode, but you know, we'll see if there might be secret.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There might just be stuff showing up in the feed little surprises for you.

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I mean, of course, the biggest surprise is that he is still editing this episode.

203
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, there's still spending in the story, everything that we're saying.

204
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So we should probably be nicer.

205
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah. Thanks for doing it.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Still look great.

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We miss you.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We miss you.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's probably busy back already.

210
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Even I think he's back within a couple days.

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But we said we were going to do this.

212
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't think he's OK.

214
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not right now, but in in his spirit, I have something I have something I wanted to honor him with.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We want to get to your questions, but I just I real quick, you know, just wanted to because because people had mentioned this to us and it's you know,

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
well, we love the Florida parks and we get down there.

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's unlikely we would engage in this.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But Walt Disney World recently put their annual passes back on sale.

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, yeah.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
OK.

222
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, right.

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, the other fucking thing.

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's right.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
New confusing thing.

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So now I'm trapped.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm trapped in my own little little dog run here.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, you know, just in the spirit of all three of us being here, I'm putting this up to you.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And this is just a real quick bit.

231
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But I have the four annual passes here.

232
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
OK.

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And I'm going to tell you their names.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And I want you to rank them in the order from cheapest to most expensive.

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's another one of these.

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Enchant believe there's no inherent order.

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's no like they did not use words that have growth and a pattern.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm going to say these are worse.

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
My God.

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So I truly haven't looked at them.

241
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The other ones I feel like I vaguely knew.

242
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But this will be totally new to me.

243
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
OK.

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Pirate pass.

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sorcerer pass.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In credit pass and pixie dust pass.

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The only thing that I can think here, this is very stupid, by the way, as they all are.

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I and also and also very gendered, don't you think?

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Isn't that weird?

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Like that they're like it's sort of specific.

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like I mean, I guess there's female pirates and the other dread.

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I guess males can use pixie dust.

254
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I guess I'm wrong.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The only thing that I can think is that is like amounts of power because like a pirate has no other worldly power.

256
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Right.

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So they pirate would be at the bottom because a pirate doesn't have the power of a sorcerer or a superhero.

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let me just try before.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
OK.

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So pirate is lowest.

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'd say pixie dust.

262
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It was the pixie dust pass.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'd put that second because it's magical.

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But you have to have it.

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You need like a hook up like drugs and you might not have inherent magic unless you have the dust with you.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And then I'd say in credit pass, superheroes are more powerful than just having pixie dust.

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And then sorcerer is the most on top of that.

268
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sorcerer is the most powerful.

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's nowhere close.

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you know?

271
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Here I am looking for logic in it and there is no I think more logic than them.

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
OK.

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Pixie dust pass is the cheapest at three ninety nine.

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
OK.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Pirate pass is six ninety nine sorcerer passes eight ninety nine.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In credit pass is one thousand two hundred ninety nine dollars only.

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And so I'm not going to go into all the specifics, but only in credit pass can be bought by anyone outside of Florida.

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
OK.

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I oh I'm sorry.

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Sorcerer pass can be bought by Florida residents or DVC members.

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And I think I saw but it's if you bought DVC membership on the resale market after a certain point, you cannot buy that level like they Disney.

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Disney Disney because of timeshare law, they have to let people resale sell their timeshares on a third party market.

284
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But they they apparently figured out they can restrict the perks.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is Mike has never been more jealous than I am to jump into this conversation as soon as he heard timeshare law.

286
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He like jumped in his chair wherever he's listening.

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Get me in there.

288
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I know.

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I got to get back in the game.

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I know.

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I will.

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What the disorder makes no sense.

293
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's like even I don't know, even believe and chant.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Maybe I like just found an inherent system that made sense.

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But this I don't I mean, I guess in credit pass being like incredible, but Pixie is lowest.

298
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I very strange.

299
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it combined the way it combines mythologies and types of magic.

301
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's so so unfocused.

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I might even say like, isn't there something to like Mickey pass and many pass and Donald and goofy?

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

304
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You see, you don't want to rank them.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They're all.

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, they're all.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No, they're all on the, you know, the Mount Rushmore.

308
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

309
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't know.

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know that I have better ideas other than like, I think.

312
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hey, look, I was just talking a lot of shit about Six Flags, but I do understand that when they say that there's a diamond platinum pass.

313
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Well, that's a lot of words and that implies that that's the best pass you can get.

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But why is in credit pass different than source source a pass?

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No sense to me.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They all do come with parking, though.

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Every one of them.

318
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's not like ours.

319
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Not like ours.

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, that's that's going to be the trick for me.

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I think news, newsflash.

322
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Get ready for this breaking scoop audience.

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I believe I have gone with the lowest pass for now, which I already forget the name of the lowest Disney Magic Key.

324
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Which one is I got to learn so that I don't buy the wrong one.

325
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I know I have the Enchant Pass because I've seen it or the I have an Enchant Magic Key, which just rolls off the tongue.

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

327
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know, it's just one Enchant Magic Key, please.

328
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah.

329
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm having trouble with my Enchant Magic Key.

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Could you help me?

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, that's a different window.

332
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm so sorry.

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's you at a mental institution.

334
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He does need help.

335
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Is believe low?

336
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No, but I believe high.

337
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I need to learn what I'm going to get the lowest one and see if I can get away with it and upgrade if I need to.

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But we're all going to pay a real bounty in parking fees because they aren't included for either of us.

340
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's true.

341
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

342
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, and you you have a day ticket you have not used that you are going to convert.

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Roll over.

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We're going to.

345
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And so we'll get to see if that works.

346
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Or if like, yes, we're in the park together because we're going to go to the park together soon.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And then we'll if you lose me for an hour and a half and some boring line has happened to me down in Florida, the nightmare of people are having fun and I'm here in this endless guest service line.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or can I just do it easily in the app?

349
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And it's as magic as the get as the scattering of pixie dust.

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, that's pretty low on the rankings.

351
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, yeah, it's not very magic.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So, you know, all right.

353
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I hope it's a lot more magical than that.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, boy.

355
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, all right.

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We've been through it now.

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Now we know Disney World's you've found a way to make it separately annoying.

358
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It is it is, you know, as a Beach Boys fan, I'm sure you find yourself sometimes saying, I guess I just wasn't made for these times.

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
All right.

360
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Absolutely.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes.

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
All the pathos of that song.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's how I feel the burden of so so out of step.

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I wish I was.

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I, you know, I wish I was a Mike who reveled in these terms and things and a fine print.

366
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, as if you have to go to a service counter to flip that pass correctly, you know, he and I'll be like perched on your shoulder, like trying to look like let me let me get a look at that Dell.

367
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let me get a look at your screen.

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What to see what's going on over there.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How did it go?

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
There's this is an episode right here.

371
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So then he couldn't remember if it was a believer and enchant.

372
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
All right.

373
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, is that the thing?

374
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Do we crack open the well the post office is open for business.

375
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I the the only other thing I had was I just I just wanted to confirm the properties and I was racking my brain if I had I think I mentioned this very quickly on an episode that Genting Sky Worlds in Malaysia is happening.

376
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is you have to go back to January of 2019 when we discussed this the kind of disaster prone park in Malaysia.

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The one that never opened was going to have like Ice Age and Fox stuff.

378
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes.

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's been sitting vacant and has like a cars esc ride and a and a Skyliner type right.

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's all just been sitting there.

381
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

382
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And and the Genting Company just opened Genting Resorts World in Las Vegas.

383
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's massive hotel casino property, but they are back on track.

384
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They've got the 20th century properties.

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They're getting attractions based on Ice Age Rio Robots Night at the Museum Independence Day Planet of the Apes and most importantly for our concern epic.

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh yeah.

387
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Nimgaloo.

388
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Which means Nimgaloo.

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The description from Blue Loop.

390
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The theme park industry website.

391
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Epic is a whimsical world featuring the epic voyage to Moonhaven boat ride and the epic hummingbird flyers where where guests will help to defend Queen Marigold from the Bogans.

392
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Uh huh.

393
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
From the Bogans.

394
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
From the Bogans or Pogans.

395
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think there's one clip on YouTube where a guy goes Pogans like very quietly and I'm like I think he said Pogans and I'm sure as everyone's screaming at their pod catching device now.

396
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Come on.

397
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Bogans are a race of frog ish insect like goblin beings who want to destroy the entire forest and are enemies of the leaf men.

398
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Obviously, of course.

399
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And if you if you don't think that everyone in Malaysia is completely familiar with the mythology of the Bogans, then it's you who were out of step.

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But anyway, if you are a listener in Malaysia, when this opens, if we could request if you could go to the blog.

401
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If we could request if you could just double check for us and see if Nimgaloo shows up in one of these two epic based attractions.

402
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There's a walk around if he's like, yeah, just painted on something in a merry-go-round fashion.

403
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm of course disappointed that there isn't a full Nimgaloo attraction.

404
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like it's I'm trying to think of a type of like a like the like the Nimgaloo swingamadoo and it's spelled with two U's.

406
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, that's good.

407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And then right. And you're about it's like you're it's giving it's like a swing ride and he's giving you the gift of flight.

408
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Like you get to fly like him.

409
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Maybe I don't know if he flies.

410
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But right before it lifts, then you hear Steven Tyler's voice say your dreams about to come true.

411
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then up you lift and then you hear the Steven Tyler like scatty song that he famously does in the movie.

412
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Everyone in Malaysia knows the song.

413
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you're a listener in Malaysia, I'm sure you know it.

414
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm sure you say that. Yeah.

415
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's in your head already.

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Listen, my knowledge of epic and Nimgaloo is entirely from one like 50 second video.

417
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I don't think I want to go deeper.

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't think I want to know more.

419
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I made the mistake of engaging more when I got a plush Nimgaloo on eBay and then it had like bugs in it.

420
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I had to put it outside and throw it away.

421
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah.

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I mean, that's a shit.

423
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The bugs.

424
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, that's really a shame.

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean, I'm sure the Leafmen.

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, I don't you know, I got to sit down and watch this.

427
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They didn't dump it on Disney Plus.

428
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Like some Fox stuff just shows up on Disney Plus without much fanfare.

429
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, they don't do a big press release.

431
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Epic is here.

432
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

433
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Maybe central to Malaysia, though, they did because they know it's epic mania in Malaysia has been for a decade.

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Twenty years.

435
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
When did epic come out?

436
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There's no way of knowing.

437
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, yeah, it came out some point in the 2010s because I used to work a job where we had to dump like high end versions of Fox titles in like a dozen languages on encrypted hard drives and then ship them across town to the Fox lot.

438
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's unclear what this workflow was, but it was high priority.

439
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And so I have seen about 50 seconds of epic in a number of languages.

440
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, wow.

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
OK, OK.

442
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Boy, I just hope the other nation's voices of Nimgaloo sparkled with the same magic as Steven Tyler.

443
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We can only hope.

444
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I mean, it's he's pretty one of a kind.

446
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So look here, Mike's not even here and we're still talking about Steven Tyler.

447
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He's just like, you know, he's haunting the podcast, I guess.

448
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He's broken both of our brains to where the bad boys of Boston are still a presence.

449
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.

450
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But, you know, now it's we got to have some fun without it.

451
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We have to see what the listeners think are things that can and should be discussed without him.

452
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know what this is.

453
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm curious what anybody thinks here.

454
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What we should do, what they think.

455
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Jason and Scott only episode.

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I wanted to like pose it kind of aggressively.

457
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Jason and Scott only.

458
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And you figure it out.

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I want to see if they figured it out.

460
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I want to find some questions here.

461
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, I I see one right off the bat that we kind of answered Mitchell Williamson on Twitter.

462
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
These are all coming from Twitter.

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I asked, what's your annual passes?

464
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Scratch that magic keys.

465
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Did you each get I got the Enchant key?

466
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And Scott is going to get the lowest level.

467
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Tell me what I write this on the back of my hand.

468
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I have the graphic within search.

469
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You're getting the imagine key.

470
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You're getting the imagine key.

471
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
All right. Great.

472
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So just remember that it's John Lennon.

473
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's my that's that's my key.

474
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What pass would John Lennon get?

475
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The imagine key.

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's what I'm going to get.

477
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OK, so now I'm just going to gravitate to ones with any of our names on it, such as from Matthew Tidster, Matthew T Matt Tidster.

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The two of you were able to put Mike into any attraction as an animatronic of himself.

479
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What attraction do you put him on?

480
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hmm.

481
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We add a mic to.

482
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I mean, is it so do we put him somewhere here?

483
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Do we put him somewhere he doesn't want to be or somewhere he does want to be?

484
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Well, I think for visual fun, maybe we put Mike like as like to a scale.

485
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Mike animatronic into it's a small world just because there's all these two foot dolls.

486
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then suddenly there's like a six foot tall man.

487
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Sure. Yes.

488
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Who's telling you about?

489
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know. A new kombucha brand or some some points method, some points.

490
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No dolls. If I could interrupt the song for a minute.

491
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I how how buying action figures will make him money.

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I know it might make you happier than World Harmony learning about Ethereum.

493
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And it's not too late to get in.

494
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I yeah, we're somewhere he doesn't want to be.

495
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, it's what's a Mike spot.

496
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I mean, anywhere anywhere with bodyness, I suppose.

497
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What's a body spot that he would not enjoy?

498
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I guess being well, it's not there anymore.

499
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I was going to say being right down the barrel of King Kong's banana breath, which he described as body.

500
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
One of those moments that I've been obsessed with ever since I get stuck on there, there's there's things I get stuck on.

501
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And that is one of them that that is that he considered.

502
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And I invite him to we'll pick this up when he's around again.

503
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But the idea that that King Kong burping that it's I didn't even think of it as a burp, you know, like I think he always thought of it as like a big gross out moment, almost like akin to a fart.

504
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I just never the describing of King Kong's banana breath is body always so bizarre to me.

505
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I definitely have moments that I have latched onto is like, well, I'm never going to forget that.

506
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But then there's other times where I'm like, I have forgotten more than I've ever remembered from the pod, because every now and then someone will tweet a specific.

507
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And if we recorded it a few weeks ago, I'm just like, that was gone by the time I got back to my house.

508
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Like that was well, which puts us in the situation sometimes of like telling a story that you have told before.

509
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And that boy is that if you are in the middle of doing it and you realize it, there's no more horrible feeling.

510
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I or you don't realize it or they're very well may be stories that I've told seven times and I'm not aware.

511
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There's a story that Mike might not even might not even realize that he's told a number of times on the podcast, which is this thing about isn't there some story about the plane at the Margaritaville that it was that it was shot at by the Jamaican guy?

512
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I feel like he's told this more than once on the podcast.

513
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I mean, I know Jimmy Buffett's a pilot. He's like certified.

514
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Sometimes he flies planes. Oh, so that's what might get you there.

515
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But am I making up this story? It just seems like it seems familiar to me and that it inspired some song.

516
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I like Aruba Big screw screw like he got screwed in Aruba.

517
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I mean, I wouldn't put it past Mr. Buffett to make a song called Aruba Big Screw.

518
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But yes, see, this is why we this is why we need Mike.

519
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I guess piggybacking off that last question, Gravitron Gals tweeted Jason and Scott, please each plus up a ride by increasing body.

520
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, oh, no, no kidding. Gravitron guys, are they like a rival or like a equivalent of the bumper car boys?

521
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Does this say do we need to look out for Gravitron Gals?

522
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It does say your favorite bad girls of theme park podcasting, but there is no link and there's not a picture.

523
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So Gravitron Gals, you know, plus up that social media account, you know, if you're getting in the mix, you know.

524
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Interesting. OK. Wait, wait. So we're wait.

525
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's the question. We're increasing body. Yeah.

526
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Adding some body and this. Hmm.

527
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Well, again, all right. So we know that burps is defined as body.

528
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What else falls into the body camp for him?

529
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What is he? Hmm.

530
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Is it swear words or like mild sexuality is like a passing glance or a gentle touch?

531
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Even I was going to say like you tender smile.

532
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:35,000
If you just add a little more hotel stuff to the Hollywood Tower Hotel to the Tower of Terror, a little more like, oh, someone, someone went to get ice with their shirt to unbuttoned.

533
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Like a man has like a couple top buttons unbuttoned. Oh, that's good. Yeah.

534
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or if there is a scene when you're kind of like setting the scene in the lobby in the video, like, you know, it was a night in 1940, whatever.

535
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And like there's a you just throw in a moment apropos of nothing where somebody's a couple's being checked in and like, will that be two queens or one king?

536
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The one king will be fine. And then Mike just like kind of like starts to sweat a little bit.

537
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
He's fanning himself down like, I know, kids are seeing that. I mean, they've got to get that out.

538
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It has nothing to do with the story. Why is it even in there?

539
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
At the very least, you need a quick cutaway to their left hands to see if there's rings on those fingers.

540
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
If they're willing to go full frame on that marriage license, then I will not object to this scene.

541
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But, yeah, that's good. Let's get let's get that in there.

542
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And Michael, he'll be more freaked out about that than the drops on the ride. Yes.

543
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
OK, here's one thing that's more difficult when it's only two people is like somebody finding the questions.

544
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, here's here's one that's just kind of a practical travel question.

545
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you had one day to go to either Disneyland, California Adventure, not or Universal Hollywood, which would you do?

546
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's a good question. It's from Robert Miller.

547
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know why would who would ever say Universal or not? That's insanity.

548
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, I think I would need the context of like how often have you been to these places before?

549
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Because it's like if you hit them, if you haven't hit like knots, I would say like, oh, don't overlook knots.

550
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But if you are just in the context of like I'm coming to town for one day,

551
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I think I would go with like original Disneyland for like the most well rounded experience.

552
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Probably. And yeah, if you haven't done Galaxy's Edge anywhere else.

553
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But if you're a constant Florida person, maybe I say California Adventure because it's got stuff that the others don't have as much.

554
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So if you're looking for like high end experiences unique to Los Angeles,

555
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:03,000
then that but also but if you want to go to a sock market or a regular fossil, then, you know, don't sleep on Universal.

556
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's true. OK, here's one.

557
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And I haven't vetted this. So if this is bad, then we're screwed.

558
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We'll cut it. Mike will cut it. Thanks for editing.

559
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Gruff McChainsaw has one for both of us. For Jason, which obscure comic strip character should have a dedicated land or attraction in a major theme park?

560
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hmm. Oh, God, that's a tough question.

561
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm trying to think like what obscure character?

562
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I mean, well, Dogpatch, we already had Dogpatch.

563
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Little you know what is is you kind of would really blue sky like you kind of do anything with it is the old the very old broad sheet comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland.

564
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, yeah. The kid who dreams and can go anywhere.

565
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's a pretty good video game of that. I think off of the movie, the weird sort of quietly received movie.

566
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh, I forgot. How old is that move from like an early 90s?

567
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
OK. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that could be very cool.

568
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I also like crazy, crazy cat and Ignat's mouse, like it's which is very simple.

569
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, comic strip about a mouse throwing a brick at a cat and then being chased by a cop dog.

570
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And that but the it gets very bizarre and weird like this is the middle early middle 20th century, but it's very beautifully drawn.

571
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And so I think you can see them in Toon Lagoon. I'm not 100 percent, but I think there's I mean, a lot of comic strips throwing a brick throwing a brick.

572
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's always what it is. It's there's usually a brick being thrown.

573
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
There is there's a comic book award called the Ignat's Awards and everyone gets a brick on a plaque or like a brick with a plaque on it.

574
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, there's a thing named after this. So then if it's a themed attraction, is that the equivalent of mouse ears?

575
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Like you get a brick hat. Yeah. Yeah. A brick brick hat would be good.

576
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, you know what else? You know, I think what's more obscure in that these both have very passionate followings that are very pretty, pretty acclaimed.

577
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But in the 2000s, there was a big, you know, boom of web comics.

578
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And there's a couple, one called Octopus Pie, one called Museum of Mistakes.

579
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I think Julie Wurtz, the cartoonist of the second one, actually follows one of our maybe us on Instagram.

580
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But they're both about like being young people and like your shitty apartments in like Brooklyn in the early 2000s, mid 2000s.

581
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I think re experiencing the boom of like Williamsburg, Brooklyn in a theme park environment from like, you know, 2007 to like 2015 or whatever.

582
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's a unique experience. Fake Williamsburg. Interesting. Yeah. Sure. Sure.

583
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
OK, those are pretty good. I think I have an equivalent question posed to me.

584
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And thanks for tracking our interests so well, Gruff. For Scott, which late night host, dead, alive or other, should have a dedicated land or attraction in a major theme park?

585
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And the temptation is to go down the Leno path. But when I think about late night hosts that I'm obsessed with, I mean, there's one who really didn't get a full chance to make his mark

586
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and who I think should have gone on for far more years than he got to. And that is Magic Johnson and his show, The Magic Hour.

587
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Did you ever see The Magic Hour when I where I grew up, the Magic Hour used to come on after like Simpson's syndication.

588
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Like, I think did The Magic Hour come on at like eleven thirty? I think Simpson's.

589
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That was the talk show time. Makes sense to me.

590
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
OK, yeah, here's what it was. It was it was on the Fox affiliate. So Fox affiliates, a lot of them do the local news at 10 p.m.

591
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then Simpson's would air at 11. And so I would inevitably watch the first chunk, if not all of The Magic Hour, just because I had the TV on in the summer from watching The Simpsons.

592
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Wow. So you'd catch the monologue, you get Magic's take on the news.

593
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah, I think I was even like at theater camp one summer and a bunch of us were like, have you guys seen The Magic Hour?

594
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And we're like, yeah, he kind of dances out.

595
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think they're probably like as much magic, as much dancing as you want to do.

596
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That's great because it fills the time. We know you're not super comfortable with the jokes.

597
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So just like I mean, if you want to dance into the next act, if you want a full act to be dancing, if a guest leaves

598
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and doesn't or doesn't show up for the day, we'll just fill it with dancing. All good. Don't worry. No pressure, Magic.

599
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If you don't know about this, Magic Johnson had a talk show around like 1998 that was just it was a big party.

600
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You know, Sheila E's there, you know, banging on Timbales or whatever.

601
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's like they just let her jam as long as she wanted. Stretch pad.

602
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It kind of the only interesting thing that ever happened was that Howard Stern made fun of the show a lot and then he had him on

603
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and they had a very awkward time together where Howard is very blunt about how the show was bad.

604
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And so that's kind of the only thing it really produced.

605
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But that's why I do wish that there was a themed attraction on it.

606
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I mean, I think that the format of Race Through New York with Jimmy Fallon works so well.

607
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
A madcap adventure backstage at a talk show.

608
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And being that Magic is involved and his name is Magic, what if there's some magic in the air in the attraction?

609
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Like there's something or there's a magician on the show that night. I don't know.

610
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Or Magic is Magic. Like the thing I've never told anybody till now, till I invited all you guests into my dressing room.

611
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You're in Magic's dressing room. That's the pre show. And then I actually am Magic.

612
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And then he kind of like blows some magic dust at you or gives you a magic key.

613
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
If they could have used that term at the time. Oh, yeah. I mean, you can really go anywhere with him going like Magic isn't just my name.

614
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's who I am. There's a reason. And so he maybe the magic shrinks you and then you're running around like, oh, my God, imagine being like lost.

615
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Like, like, I lost our guests and they're loose on the set of the Magic Hour.

616
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then you get almost get hit by Sheila E's drumsticks or he's got a basketball and a bound.

617
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Maybe you get stuck to the basketball and then it like I assume there was a hoop on the set.

618
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You know, you end up you end up going through a hoop. I mean, that'd be crazy to find out what that's like.

619
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You get lost in one of Magic's big purple suits.

620
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You have to let you're sliding through. It's a simulator. You're like trying to find your way out the pants.

621
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I mean, I think that's it. Right itself. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's pretty. Now, I don't remember what any of Magic's characters were.

623
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If there were any. But I, you know, you'd like to get you in there and like any good madcap backstage at a talk show attraction.

624
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Of course, you got to go to the moon. Maybe Magic throws a basketball to the moon and you kind of whip around it.

625
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know how Magic was with free throws.

626
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But I mean, there's that joke in the Terminator pre show where like Shaq puts in the robot contacts.

627
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Right. Love that. And then he can make the three fro. Yeah.

628
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, he was bad. I think Magic was better. OK. I believe.

629
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Well, then he calls it like Babe Ruth. He goes like you're going to the moon.

630
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He doesn't free throw. He had the sky hook, I believe, is his move.

631
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I forget. Maybe Kareem did the sky hook and he did the baby sky hook.

632
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I remember like five facts about basketball for being a child. Sure.

633
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So he gives you a sky hook into the sky. Great attraction.

634
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's still. And if that was still there, talk shows off the air, but that's still there.

635
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I think that's the best case scenario. Oh, those are always the best.

636
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Like you feel it more that like this is still here.

637
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like when it's a TV show, you feel it more. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

638
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Attention, everyone. We have we're putting a live episode of Harry and the Hendersons.

639
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Still, I love that so much. So thanks for that question.

640
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm going to keep scanning for our names here. Yeah, I've got one.

641
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh, this came in through email. Tyler Harper from Alberta writes,

642
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm going to be making a trip to Disney World for the first time in 13 years.

643
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I need an updated opinion from you. Should I stay at Pop Century or off property?

644
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Note the Skyliner will not be working for half our trip.

645
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Also, how many spare pairs of socks should I pack per day?

646
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Now, that's a second half is really more of a bike question.

647
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So my rule is like to do a day because it rains so much in Florida

648
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
even before you factor in the water rides. But he's the sock expert.

649
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So he's the sock expert. Yeah.

650
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, he's always talking about taking his socks on and off. Oh, yeah.

651
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, that's the way you want as many as possible to be able to do the slipping on and off. Sure.

652
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah. You love your vacation planning questions. I do.

653
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
This is what you gravitate towards.

654
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Well, I think that's really like I would say the Skyliner being closed for half the trip is kind of a big, you know,

655
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
not a deal breaker, but it's like, oh, that kind of sucks.

656
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Like I wouldn't I'm not married to Pop Century.

657
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I only stayed there because it was convenient location, you know, adjacent to a Skyliner station when we went down.

658
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah, that's the main attraction. So I don't know.

659
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I think it's not necessarily like a great hotel either.

660
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So if you got a cheaper deal off site. No, I think the like Disney partner hotels around Disney Springs have been very competitive

661
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
with like pricing and you can get like a it depends on how much if you're going to be blitzing through the parks,

662
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
like sun up to sun down and you just want the convenience of the on site buses and Skyliner for half the trip.

663
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I would say maybe stay on site.

664
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But if you like just want to know if you're going to be at the hotel a lot like you could your money will probably go further.

665
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It seems like staying off site. Are you like is your dream of the podcast?

666
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Is there more room to answer vacation planning questions and hotel specifics?

667
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Like, is there a part of it's like if we could sort of eliminate the bits here and there, so just clear a path to know.

668
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
No, I think I think I think a little bit goes a long way.

669
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I do. It's only because it's a mailbag question.

670
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And like he he was going down for 13 first time in 13 years.

671
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I mean, that's that's the big thing. I guess it's it's what you want your first time in 13 years.

672
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be like, well, that's what I'm just asking, you know, because it's your first time in four years without Mike.

673
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it's you have more half of the agency in the episode. That's true.

674
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think I like the vacation planning most?

675
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Because I think Mike is better at some of that.

676
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Mm hmm. Well, that's what I want. If like left unabated, is there just like I mean, we know that like like Mike could just spin out a solo episode entirely about bookings and points and money saves and like putting many weeks into ultimately saving eighty dollars.

677
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think he could spin out this episode as a monologue quite handily.

678
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yes. Well, we've talked about what like solo little mini episodes with monologue kind of episodes would look like.

679
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, I think that's what it is. Right.

680
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I mean, I do. Yeah, we've also talked about at some point doing like here's a one day itinerary for this part.

681
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Like here's you're not going to hit everything, but here's how you do like we have.

682
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I've never been talked about.

683
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That's come up. I.

684
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's that's the one at some point.

685
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Like because we get these. I only bring it up because we've gotten so many emails and messages about like this sort of thing.

686
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And and I like talking about like my experiences of doing it.

687
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I also like I do it one way with it's just me or if it's me and like Jane or me and you guys and then me and my family.

688
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Like my family only has a certain tolerance for this level of shit.

689
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We're all getting older. They're like they're like, well, I'm not taking a bus to a boat.

690
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What are you talking about? And it's like, yeah, that's fair.

691
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:39,000
When I was with this bachelor party group and we left Disney and we realized we needed to get to the Ticket and Transportation Center and our only options were a massive bus line,

692
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
a massive monorail line and a massive boat line.

693
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It was like hell. Everybody truly was like fury.

694
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Everybody was fuming and like what are you talking about?

695
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
This place has been open for how many decades and they've left us in this situation.

696
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We're the only way. Well, someone told us after the fact and I did this in reverse when we were down there.

697
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What you really should have done is go over to the contemporary.

698
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You walk to the contemporary. You can walk to the contemporary and walk to the contemporary and call a lift from there.

699
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
OK, you can even walk to the Grand Floridian now. OK, most of the day.

700
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Sometimes they get later in the night.

701
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They cut the bridge on the contemporary.

702
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
There's just a crosswalk because I got dropped off at the contemporary one time when I was meeting you guys there in a lift.

703
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
OK, so that's maybe your little secret spots to not be stuck in these horrendous.

704
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It was like hellish. It was I think I think all told.

705
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's like an hour and a half from the gate back to where we were staying.

706
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It was like truly the most stressful.

707
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like I guess that's a lesson for the future.

708
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Like maybe try to slip out of Disney World like an hour before closing so you don't end up in this.

709
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, my other the other like this is a little longer.

710
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But if it's just like yet might look a little conspicuous if 15 people were suddenly walking to the contemporary to call a lift.

711
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But it's just like, oh, just get on whatever hotel bus shows up first and call a lift from that hotel.

712
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah, that's sort of what we were trying to do.

713
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But a lot of people have that plan to. Yes.

714
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
This is madness. However, they force people into creating mythologies like now, why are we all staying there together?

715
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
How do we all know each other? Is this a high school reunion?

716
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
OK, so what else we got here?

717
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, this one got a lot of likes and I know why.

718
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Ayl Shacker. I'm sorry, I don't know how to say your name.

719
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Wrote on Twitter, what do you dislike about Mike Carlson?

720
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
This is not I did see that one before.

721
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's that's this is evil. That's that's pure evil.

722
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
What a thing to what a thing to ask and propose.

723
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'll say that I'll say that, you know, Mike, you know, sometimes it's a little too selfless.

724
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Honestly, got to watch out for himself. He's got to watch out for Mike.

725
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Got to watch out for a number one sometimes worries about everyone else.

726
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You know, that's the most like my like my biggest issue is that I work too hard.

727
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But I'm saying it about him. I'm saying it about someone else.

728
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I think that's a compliment when you say it about someone else.

729
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
If you say it about yourself, it's insane.

730
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's a weird humble brag, but that's interesting. Yeah.

731
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Well, you know what? Yes.

732
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
He's a great friend and a loyal friend to many people in his life.

733
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I will turn this around and say nice things about him.

734
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That all maybe is the setup for what you're saying.

735
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I yeah, I was I was pondering this one.

736
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think like it's not a dislike.

737
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's it's it's an outside observer suggestion that I've made.

738
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
This has happened off the air has happened in episodes many times.

739
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I do feel like Mike cranks up the stress levels so much higher than they need to be cranked.

740
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And when scenarios have arisen like the throwing the mini monster drink away,

741
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I think I get hung up on them.

742
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This is where he was in City Walk and like how do I dispose of this milkshake that I don't want?

743
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And he invented a scenario in which everyone is staring at him

744
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and there is no option that is a good option for throwing the drink away.

745
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm I'm eyeing at that. I'm like this is this is 80 percent in your brain.

746
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
There's got to be a way that you can process stress better,

747
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
not have phantom stress that's in you that's only in your brain.

748
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Because as soon as you say it, at least to me, I believe that the stress is fictional.

749
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I well, yeah, I mean, you know, how much how much of that is is him

750
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and how much is for like painting a good picture for the show?

751
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I don't know. You know, I magnification.

752
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
My therapy is thought magnification and raising thoughts are a hell of a combination for worry,

753
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
worry, and stress levels. Sure, sure.

754
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But yeah, yeah, I would have I think I would have just yeah, dumped it and then taken it.

755
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
The souvenir cup back to the car.

756
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I think it would have been throwing it away anywhere at all.

757
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I think that's the stories that I'm obsessed with.

758
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They've come up over and over and here they are again.

759
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But where he wouldn't throw away the drink and he and he had to clear his plate at the Liberty Square restaurant.

760
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And these are not dislikes. This is not I can't go that that far about it.

761
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I think I get hung up on them because like what is it?

762
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's it's it's a lot of dislike. It's an obsession.

763
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What is the issue of cleaning his plate and wasting food?

764
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
What happened here?

765
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Well, mommy would be upset if you don't clean your plate.

766
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's what I wonder.

767
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's what I'm trying to drive at is like what?

768
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, there were there was some incident where I'm sure are both of our our mommies taught us this to some extent.

769
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But whatever was up with it was so much more extreme that it's like maintained into his theme park going adulthood in a way that I don't think it needs to.

770
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, unless it goes back to theme parks, unless he just went to the 50s primetime cafe at Hollywood Studios as a very young child where like the waitresses sass you.

771
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Oh, yeah.

772
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And they like talk about the waitress is like your mom is the idea of that restaurant and like no elbows on the table.

773
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Finish your meatloaf.

774
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
This is a place I have never been to because why?

775
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
That sounds awful.

776
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I have been to.

777
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Well, Scott, it is what you ought to do this next time you're in Florida.

778
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The bar you could just walk into dad's study, dad's lounge, the bar.

779
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What? And you can get like I mean, you're not going to get the peanut butter and jelly milkshake.

780
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Let's be real. But you can.

781
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah, you can go in the bar and it looks like a fun den.

782
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And they just dad.

783
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah, you are a dad.

784
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And I had no idea there was dad.

785
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh, yeah.

786
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Whoa.

787
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm so glad to know God.

788
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Now I'm dying to go to dad's study and I don't have to like I don't have to sit with the family.

789
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I your dad's allowed to.

790
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Is it an all dad bar?

791
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I I've definitely seen plenty of dads in there.

792
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I I don't know what its current up everywhere is operational state still a little fucked up.

793
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So this is very like hetero normative, though.

794
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,000
The idea that like moms wouldn't want to abandon their families and go drink in a study.

795
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's a very fifties thing for sure.

796
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Mom's maybe more than any backwards.

797
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Love to go drink in that study.

798
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
All right.

799
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I mean, mom and dad will go drink in the study.

800
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Well, and if you know what door to knock on, there's a speakeasy just for pills called mommy's little helper in the alleyway.

801
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It just looks like a little industrial vent.

802
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But yeah, you do the right amount of knocks a handle just come through with pills.

803
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure the bar at the Brown Herbie is a little less of a visually stimulate.

804
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm sure it's a little quieter and more relaxed than that seems nice.

805
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I didn't go there, but I thought about it when I was there.

806
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So low.

807
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Boy, dad's study was just waiting for me and I had no idea.

808
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Well, I've learned something and something good came out of the mean question.

809
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
What do you dislike about Mike Carlson?

810
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't.

811
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's a good answer, right?

812
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It's just it's a concern I have and that's why I err it on the.

813
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But if that's if he if look not wasting your food is a good quality to have.

814
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's hard to dislike.

815
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Yes.

816
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I just think he runs himself through the stress wringer.

817
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Waste not want not.

818
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You know, here's our names.

819
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Dave Oogie says for Scott, are you going to name your next child Botanicus?

820
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I remember thinking like, isn't there some like theme parky way to name your child and then going like, what am I?

821
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
This your your children are not bits.

822
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
This is insane.

823
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
This is be insane to.

824
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But you know what?

825
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You know, child number one is a pretty normal name.

826
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Why not go crazy or number two?

827
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Sure.

828
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Botanicus is the next kid for Jason.

829
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
When you when you become mayor of Disneyland or hot dogs going to become free.

830
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I I would hope so.

831
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah. I mean, I feel like Disney kind of the hot dog situation was a little dire a few years ago.

832
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I think it's gotten better as they've like started serving them with better bread, maybe like dumping a bunch of crazy stuff on top.

833
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I think hot dogs are one of the things like we were there's in Burbank.

834
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
There's a place called Dog House.

835
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's a pretty fun chain and they there's kind of like an elevated hot dog experience like good Frank's and crazy toppings and they use Hawaiian sweet rolls as the bread.

836
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So, yes, I think hot dogs should be free at Disneyland.

837
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It's the least they can do.

838
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Great little.

839
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I mean, who doesn't love that future more?

840
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Why not put you in a position to make that happen?

841
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Similarly, Sean Clark, Jason, what's the ham situation at your place currently?

842
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
No ham right now.

843
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Got some hot dogs in the freezer.

844
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah, I don't I don't think I have any deli meat right now.

845
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Wow. No ham in the house.

846
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
No, I were not our characters, folks.

847
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I I I haven't really gotten back into the like deli, you know, slicing fresh sliced deli meat since Kovac, like since, you know, we've been going out more in the last however many number of months and all.

848
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So and I find a lot of the prepackaged like deli stuff kind of gross at some places like this already in a box.

849
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

850
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You can't go to a counter.

851
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That's what I've been nothing but like sliced turkey sandwiches the entire time.

852
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I completely shifted to that during cope.

853
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's a good like in for like working at home and doing dad stuff at home.

854
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's like a little like pack yourself a sandwich.

855
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Oh, yeah.

856
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You know what I mean?

857
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:04,000
A lot of is cheese quesadillas just because that's an easy, easy thing like cheese quesadillas and black beans or baked because it's just like so just throw a bean layer in there.

858
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
We throw together.

859
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

860
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah.

861
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Elevates it a little.

862
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
This is mean poo jackal from poo jackal.

863
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
What's your favorite toy?

864
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh, man.

865
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Getting at what your favorites toy.

866
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Well, now I'm going to switch it and I'm going to talk about Mike and it's a toy that I is still in the package.

867
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I haven't read it.

868
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yes. What's your favorites toy?

869
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So you think Mike is your favorite and then what's his toy?

870
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
No, no.

871
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
My well, he knows he's my favorite, but he got me for my birthday one year.

872
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I think he founded it at like a collectible shop or a toy shop in Burbank.

873
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's it's a McFarland toys action figure of Todd McFarland of Todd, the artist wearing like a leather jacket and fingerless gloves.

874
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And it's it's just such an interest.

875
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Todd McFarland is such an interesting guy, such a character.

876
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So to have his toy brand make a toy of him.

877
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Oh, that was only available in the collectors club like that.

878
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You would mail away for this with like, you know, barcodes and stuff.

879
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It is it is truly a sight to behold.

880
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

881
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Hey, Mike, also, he's gotten me the a bunch now of those really good back to the future toys.

882
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
What's the what's the brand? The really good action figure is that NECA?

883
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The NECA toys, not to mention a stuffed Doc Brown and stuffed DeLorean for my son.

884
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Very sweet. Great gestures.

885
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So look, more nice that Mike, you do great things for us.

886
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We appreciate thank you.

887
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Thank you to you, our favorite for our toys.

888
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
What have we?

889
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
What else we got here?

890
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Well, here's a quick one.

891
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Justin Dumbledore Mamu, I think that's a pretty good pun,

892
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
says, which on property hotel resort has the best lobby?

893
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Wait for him. And that's Disney World.

894
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I think just any I'm going to go ahead and say Disney World or Disneyland.

895
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
He doesn't specify.

896
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's the best lobby.

897
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Grand Californians, pretty great.

898
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Grand Floridians, pretty great.

899
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Maybe that's those grands. Maybe it's it's a duel between the grands.

900
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah. I mean, I really like the grand.

901
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
The boardwalk in as a good lobby.

902
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'll tell you this, the old Polynesian lobby with the big waterfall that they've they've cut it out and simplified it a little.

903
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
But the original Polynesian lobby, like my family was always really wild for it.

904
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If you want more of a lobby talk, then lobby for it.

905
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
When we treat these questions, I let's see.

906
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We did bodyness.

907
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Question, what have you done with Mike?

908
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The jigs up. We banished him back to he was too polite.

909
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
He was like, look, buddy, you got to chatty Cathy's for co-hosts.

910
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
OK, you're a polite Midwestern boy. You go back to the Midwest.

911
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
We banished him back to Schomburg.

912
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Go finish all the plates that you never when we talked to him the other day, he said he had a Lou Malnati pizza order coming to his family's house.

913
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah. And I was texting with him one day and he said they were heading to the racetrack.

914
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So I think it's a local racetrack that was closing down.

915
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So they wanted to stop by before closing.

916
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
But I was like, I don't I don't think it's dog racing.

917
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I don't know what kind of racing it is, but I think it was more like, hey, that local spot is closing.

918
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
We should swing by. So it was just such a funny specific.

919
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh, no, we're through the looking glass here. Now, the Carlson's are scumbags.

920
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
They're they're they're characters on the short lived TV show.

921
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Look, they're all about they they put on this facade about about manners in their day to day life.

922
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Make sure you spread these stories on the podcast.

923
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
They don't know that we're a bunch of deviant cock racers.

924
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
They all they make roosters race. That's right.

925
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
They're all about the roosters and the ponies.

926
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We figured it out. Stay stay in Schomburg.

927
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Stay with your roosters. Do your evil deeds.

928
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't think anything else to go out on.

929
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
We've done a lot here. Anything.

930
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I mean, I'm veering to one specific about us.

931
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But what Jersey boardwalks versus SoCal boardwalks, which wins?

932
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh, I mean, I'm of course going to say Jersey.

933
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I mean, I think it's not really boardwalks per se.

934
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
There's a couple of peers that have one restaurant.

935
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
But and like, I mean, that you can.

936
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I think there's a lot more variety in Jersey.

937
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
There's like tiny boardwalks or promenades.

938
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And then there's like island, nearly island long boardwalks.

939
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That's like, oh, most of the businesses in this town are on the boardwalk.

940
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So it's kind of a different beast.

941
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
OK, here, Gruff McChainsaw says, if you could swap one attraction out from Disneyland

942
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
with its equivalent in any other park in the world, which one would you choose?

943
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Wait, wait, say that one more time.

944
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If you could swap one attraction out from Disneyland with its equivalent from any other park in the world,

945
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
which would you choose?

946
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I mean, I think the long time answer up to a few years ago would have been swap.

947
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Put the Florida Tower Tower. Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Which now, yeah, I don't know if you'd say that with Guardians,

949
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
because Guardians is cool in its own thing.

950
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It'd be nice to have like the room travel.

951
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What's better?

952
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I mean, if only there was more space.

953
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It feels silly to change Big Thunder,

954
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
but I do think the Big Thunder's in Disney World and Paris are better

955
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
because they have more space to explore.

956
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But I kind of like that little cozy Disneyland Big Thunder too.

957
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
What did they get better?

958
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Gosh, that's a tough one.

959
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Space Mountain.

960
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Well, it'd be nice to like have some with that other.

961
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Now I want to go on Paris Space Mountain because I didn't do it because I was afraid of cat when I was there.

962
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So if it was a more intense, but I'd miss our current Space Mountain.

963
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Oh, you know what?

964
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I would trade in the empty track that is crumbling throughout Tomorrowland for a working people move.

965
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh, man.

966
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well, that said, the people move in Florida.

967
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Apparently they've reopened it finally, but it's been breaking down a lot.

968
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So I don't know what the story with that is.

969
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Oh, no.

970
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So if you're asking what we did with Mike and then there.

971
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
But there's also the question I've gotten the question.

972
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
What have you done about living with the land?

973
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It seems like living with the land is was closed mysteriously for a while, sort of without explanation.

974
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I heard it was flooded, but I think it's real now.

975
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
OK, OK.

976
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And they don't know who caused the flood.

977
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They don't know.

978
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:36,000
There's no video of somebody like running in one sec, like really like wearing all black,

979
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
only their eyes are visible, kind of stealthily sneaking in, like opening up a pipe and letting it go

980
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and then getting out of there and going to hide in dad's study.

981
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Well, that boy, that's really specific, but I don't I hope not.

982
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So that doesn't seem that doesn't ring the bell as like a familiar tale.

983
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Not the normal like, you know, rumor mongers I've encountered anything like that.

984
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Why do you ask?

985
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh, no, no reason.

986
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I was kind of like inventing something just just for fun, like a fun little.

987
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Oh, like a little flight of fancy.

988
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

989
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But no like no prints, no security camera footage.

990
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:18,000
This isn't like something people are mad about, like stealing buzzy's clothes from it's not because it's not going viral or anything.

991
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
This thing that doesn't exist.

992
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm making that up.

993
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah, I think I. Yeah, I think you're you're you're one of those Mike stress situations now that you seem like you've made up whole cloth.

994
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh, geez. I'm just I'm like I'm becoming him.

995
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yeah. Huh. God. Why do I have the sudden desire to go clear a plate?

996
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I well, it is it is an early lunchtime.

997
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So maybe get to it. Yeah.

998
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
OK. Few. OK. I need to relax a little bit.

999
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It seems like I got away with it or I mean, I got somebody got nobody got away with anything.

1000
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Anything else we want to hit before we.

1001
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I mean, I think if you have anything last questions, I think we've had a lot of them.

1002
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I mean, here's a weird.

1003
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Well, here's one thing.

1004
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Somebody just tweeted with a Simpsons gift.

1005
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Where's Mike? When Mike isn't there, all the other guys should be asking, where's Mike?

1006
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
This is a reference to the poochie scene.

1007
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And it did sort of happen as he did loom throughout it.

1008
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Hey, what if the thing that we both like separately as a unit, the you and I, our most common interest is Mike.

1009
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Isn't that wonderful? Yeah.

1010
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Wow. Gee, I mean, I hope people have got to be tearing up about that.

1011
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:43,000
What they just heard. Like I know everybody's all cried out from Steve from Blue's Clues and saying you never forgot.

1012
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I knew I didn't want to start crying on the podcast because I talked about Stephen Blue's Clues.

1013
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But when he when he said that he never forgot us, that just, you know, that really hit me.

1014
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That hit me right here. And now this moment that we've had about Mike, I just hope Mike comes back and tells us that while he was gone in Schomburg for two weeks that he never forgot us.

1015
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And then and then we can all, you know, hold hands and listen to the Steve from Blue's Clues song.

1016
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
That's the theme song to Young Sheldon, right? What?

1017
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Well, of course, as you probably remember, Steve put out a solo album produced by a guy from the Flaming Lips.

1018
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah, one of the songs from that is the theme song to Young Sheldon.

1019
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
The theme song of Young Sheldon? That's right.

1020
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Really? Yeah. Wow.

1021
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So so what you're saying is that via songwriting residuals and Nickelodeon residuals, Steve has all the money in the unit.

1022
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Steve is rich as fuck.

1023
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Probably more the songwriting residuals as we've learned about some of our Nickelodeon research.

1024
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
The residuals did not exactly come fast and furious.

1025
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Oh, that's right. Oh, yes. We've spoken to Nickelodeon people who yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I mean, it was a little bit of a trick.

1027
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Well, God, I mean, if Steve is rich and he doesn't and he never forgot us, I mean, being rich is a great excuse to never forget people.

1028
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's true. And hopefully it helped him pay off those student loans, which I saw a lot of people hooting that he mentioned, like, been through a lot, having our own families, houses, student loans.

1029
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yeah, you talked about student loans in the video.

1030
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, I saw enough people talking about that. I was like, wait, I haven't seen this video yet.

1031
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Does he just talk about student loans? And I was like, oh, no, he says it really fast in a list.

1032
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
We do get to hear a lot about Steve's college experience.

1033
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah, he makes it's kind of all about Steve, honestly.

1034
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And then we us are an afterthought. Everybody's crying about it.

1035
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
But then he's kind of like, and you you're doing good, too.

1036
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And like, you look good. And anyway, but of course, it got me.

1037
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I mean, I have been you can probably tell my eyes are puffy from having cried all week about the Steve video.

1038
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Sure. And I'm just going to be right back at it again when Mike comes back and just hey, Mike, if you're listening in all these weeks where we talked to you several days ago, we never forgot you.

1039
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Jason, you didn't forget Mike now, did you? I didn't forget Mike. I didn't forget Mike or student loans.

1040
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We're so sorry about the student loans, but we never forgot them and we never forgot you.

1041
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
So, yeah, I did go get ice once at a hotel with just my socks on.

1042
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And I'm sorry about that level of body. That's a little body.

1043
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But I mean, clothes, also all other clothes still on, but no shoes.

1044
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And I know you think that's disgusting.

1045
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It does imply that you would partially stripped.

1046
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So you you were you stripped and then walked through a hotel lobby. Yeah.

1047
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It all hotel hallway. That's the thing he never talks about is that when he switches, takes his socks off real quick at on the water rides, he hisses because he's so disgusted by what he's doing.

1048
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
He like hisses like a snake threatening warning you.

1049
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And mutters dirty boy to himself.

1050
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Dirty boy left a full plate for mommy to clean. No, no, no, no.

1051
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Mommy said, don't be a dirty, damp boy.

1052
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Would Optimus Prime be proud of a dirty, damp boy?

1053
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
No, he would forget about us. He would forget.

1054
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
But we would never. Mike, we never forgot you.

1055
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
We hope that you never forgot us.

1056
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Audience, thanks for never forgetting to respond to our mailbag questions.

1057
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You survived podcast The Ride the Second Gate and we survived one just you and I.

1058
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And, you know, yeah, we'll be happy to have Mike back.

1059
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
But if push came to shove, like if we pushed or shoved Mike off of a cliff.

1060
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Into whatever tool has been going on and off in the distance.

1061
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
While we've been doing. Yeah.

1062
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A lot of them.

1063
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Invite him to my house and then push or shove him into the buzz saw that a neighbor is working on so that our cuts of the Patreon money are bigger.

1064
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Well, then we just now we I'm saying that now we know we can carry it just the two of us, not saying we want to do that, not saying that anybody was sneaking around living with the land and caused a big flood there.

1065
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's the we're not we're not we're not saying anything.

1066
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I did say that Randy Gerber is a piece of shit.

1067
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'll make sure Mike never forget that.

1068
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But we never forgot you and just nobody ever forget anything.

1069
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
That's right. That's the message we want to deliver here.

1070
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So thanks for listening.

1071
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Never forget to keep listening and keep subscribing.

1072
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Bye bye.
