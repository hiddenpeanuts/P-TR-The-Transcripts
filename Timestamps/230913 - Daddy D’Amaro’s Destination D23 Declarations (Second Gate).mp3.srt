1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,300
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,300
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, where the topic of today's episode is maybe

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,440
possibly being considered to be the recent announcements of the Destination D event in

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,660
Florida.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined by Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,700
Yeah, we're always dreaming up possibilities that could change the course of Podcast The

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,320
Ride forever.

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,600
Anyway, bye.

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,300
Bye.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,780
There's nothing more to say about that.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,160
The new PTR fiscal year starts October 1st, and we cannot make any official proclamations

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,880
until that.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,760
Michael Carlson.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm here, yeah, and I just want to not go on the record with everything I'm saying today.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,840
Everything I'm saying today is speculation and a possibility, but it's not something

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
I necessarily believe.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,280
Morsels, morsels to be dreamt on, banteed about.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,960
Can I just get to the cut to the chase here?

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,300
This is like trying to feed someone dinner and it's just like one potato chip, one French

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,980
fry, it's one pretzel bite and going, isn't this nice?

21
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,600
This is a big meal for you, huh?

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,460
This is nice, huh?

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,880
A bone from a chicken.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,320
Yeah.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,460
Like now this came from the kind of rotisserie chicken that could be possible at a future

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,840
dinner.

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,100
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,300
The one bean, the one bean with a fork and you're cutting the slices of the bean.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,820
Right.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,400
Except that most people are like, okay, beans here, let's talk bean.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,300
So, Disney's dropped the new bean and we're here to talk about every quarter of it.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,900
Let's go.

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,340
Well, there's a lot of content creators, including us, that need to stretch this out and need

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,440
to have some excitement because of the excitement.

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,760
Luckily, we've built in not having to be excited.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,940
Yeah, we don't need to get invited to anything.

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,620
Sometimes I lament that because we would be rich.

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,820
We would be rich as pirates if we were, but no, it's good.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,560
Pirates like the kind in the lounge, in the lounge bar that's coming to Magic Kingdom.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,880
be like, not rich, but maybe wealthier.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,720
I don't know.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,480
Maybe that's wrong.

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,700
That's the same thing, isn't it?

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,840
Maybe not a little wealthier.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,520
More rich and wealthy.

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,460
Wealthier could be we make five more dollars a month.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:45,920
Sure.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,540
Okay, okay.

49
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,500
If you're setting the bar there.

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,280
But then with a wear and tear on our souls that we have to do the YouTube thumbnails

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,000
with the bug out faces and that why is the new thing, Mr.

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,560
Beast has led the way that

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,020
now it's not enough to just have an irritating photo of yourself.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,940
It's got to be like an illustration.

55
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,660
It's got to be a fake piece of art.

56
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,160
It's a render.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,520
Why did that get decided?

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,340
That's new, the new, and then you cut to Dar Man.

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,340
I don't know if anybody listens to or everybody watches the great inspirational Dar Man content.

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,080
He's made the choice that he's the one, he does all of these like morality plays like

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,500
father, shame's daughter in wheelchair lives to regret it.

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,300
And then it'll be a thumbnail where like they have fake eyes.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,060
They have like Muppet eyes.

64
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,980
He's gone one step further than the bizarre like, and you're staring at it like, why did

65
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,580
you?

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,560
So it's a regular eyes aren't enough.

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,060
They have to be so like perfectly piece of paper white that you can't have real eyes

68
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,860
anymore.

69
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Dar Man recommended.

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,120
This is the most like AI content not generated by AI you've ever seen.

71
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,100
Mr.

72
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,140
Beast may have had a small come to God moment because I feel like he posted about

73
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,640
like we uploaded some new videos and we found that the thumbnails where it's a picture of

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,540
me and I close my mouth, we get more views than the ones where I'm like doing a giant

75
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,920
open mouth smile.

76
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,960
That's okay.

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,760
Well, that's a good realization.

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,880
It's probably made them a little less irritating, but I still wonder why it's paintings.

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,500
What was that calculation?

80
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,720
And then also like you imagine having to be this, like, you know, when people go off on

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,840
old man Scorsese who doesn't understand, but he didn't have to make his movie posters like,

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,020
yeah, like, okay, so we found out less people will see casino if the we need them all the

83
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,420
mouths to be closed.

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,360
We've run the numbers on like this is a hell.

85
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,220
This is a hell.

86
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah, it's all no matter how much money they have.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,820
Yeah, somebody should do like run the algorithm on just like things we say and then be like,

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,960
you know, you can't you have to say whatever like a magic.

89
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,180
About 15 more times and you have to say wishes 25 more times.

90
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,040
And this is this stimulates the brain enough to make somebody want to listen to more.

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,980
It sounds hellish, but it is where content is headed.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,820
So yeah, yeah.

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,700
Computers.

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,280
People are already doing the work computers do.

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,760
So the AI is what you're saying.

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,780
The AI is here.

97
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,260
Well, you're describing a theory.

98
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,800
You're describing a theory called human bots where people decide to bot themselves.

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,660
This is a very come up with by a friend of the show.

100
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,400
Buzz Buzz.

101
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,520
I think it's one of you.

102
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,360
See, you walked right into it.

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,020
He's been saying this for years.

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,720
I and you look, we agree.

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
He's a controversial figure, but you got to agree with a lot of his teachings.

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,200
I well, he and I agree on a lot of that type of thing.

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah, yes.

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,660
We've talked about many things.

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Yes.

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,720
Aging.

111
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,220
We've we're going to he thinks we're going to not we're going to be the last generation not to

112
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,400
live forever, which I believe that was at least a couple of years ago.

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,840
Maybe he's different or he's changed his ideas now.

114
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,420
But yes, that makes a lot of sense.

115
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,120
And Mr.

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,500
Beast has bought it himself and he's reaping the rewards.

117
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,580
So you say so.

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,020
But you're you agree with Bug, but you're also a pro botting yourself.

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,540
I don't know what I am.

120
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,620
I can't decide.

121
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,720
I can't decide.

122
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
I have bought myself a check in, though.

123
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,100
I have bought it myself as much as I can when it comes to checking and getting alerts.

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,640
You're competing with bots because you're trying to get alerts as fast as and get those

125
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,340
toy sales as fast as bots are.

126
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,660
Right.

127
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
You have to be partially a human bot.

128
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,980
Absolutely.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,420
I do.

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,400
And you could probably automate some of that if you taught yourself a little bit of.

131
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,040
Well, I tried.

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,760
I got a Swedish.

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,480
I got a guy in Sweden to make me a bot.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,000
I just never ended up needing it.

135
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,260
Right.

136
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,200
Well, that's the problem.

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,540
It's too many little men.

138
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,740
You need to be the bot.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,860
I need to be the bot.

140
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,940
Be your own bot.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Speaking of being my own bot, because I have all these alerts, I got a free 10 pack of

142
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,840
about two or three weeks ago.

143
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,080
Oh, free chocolate bars.

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
That might be the key to botting yourself.

145
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,140
If you the contents biggest human bot, if you eat enough of his bars, that's the secret.

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,640
If you have like three a day, you'll be a bot within a month.

147
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah.

148
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,660
Well, I didn't eat enough, I don't think.

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,860
But I if there are more free ones somewhere, I just got an alert said you want 10 free

150
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,120
Mr.

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,620
Beast bars.

152
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,440
I said, all right.

153
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,980
I clicked it and they showed up.

154
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,920
How are they?

155
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,960
They're pretty good.

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,180
You get them in Target.

157
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,020
OK.

158
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,460
Yeah.

159
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,160
It's just milk chocolate, like four ingredients.

160
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,780
Oh, wait, I've seen these in Target.

161
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,220
OK.

162
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,500
Yeah.

163
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,880
It's nothing that weird, I don't think.

164
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,720
Oh, so they aren't like healthy bars.

165
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,900
These are no candy bars.

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,800
Those are chocolate.

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
I mean, it's better than probably just nerds.

168
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,160
But a lot of things are better than nerds.

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,200
Not taste wise, but health wise.

170
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,340
You know, this guy knows what I'm talking about.

171
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,140
I know what you're talking about.

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,220
Your intestines are all nerd lined.

173
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,620
Well, that's your little chocolate boy, you know.

174
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,680
So I'm interested.

175
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,740
If you got a colonoscopy on the way, like, what is that?

176
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,580
Doctors are seeing something they've never seen.

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,560
And then it's all like it's all nerds and they're all alive and singing.

178
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,020
My lower intestine looks like a nerd's rope, the gummy rope with the nerds stuck into it.

179
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,420
That's what happens when you eat a lot of nerds.

180
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,820
Sure.

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not weird.

182
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,840
It's not bad.

183
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
That's what happens.

184
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,040
OK.

185
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,840
So this is OK.

186
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,520
Just if you're if you're the kind of listener who pays very close attention to the things that we say,

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,340
we I think teased a second gate that is not what you're listening to.

188
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Yeah.

189
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,840
What I call Disney's first screen ride.

190
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,060
And that that is recorded.

191
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,880
That is coming.

192
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,740
But we shoved it down in the order because of the thrilling announcements

193
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,840
brought to us by Daddy Tomorrow at Destination D23,

194
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,880
an event that was definitely on my radar, on my calendar.

195
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,000
I blocked off the weekend for all of the exciting new

196
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,080
Disney parks announcements and dreams and wishes.

197
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,820
And we're going to break them down for you here.

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Yeah.

199
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,920
Now, I have to say about this, but I am going to pay them a compliment.

200
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,720
I think these I knew that I knew this was coming at some point,

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,780
because these are the off year events that they do in between the like big Anaheim

202
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,040
conventions and this.

203
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,340
Yeah.

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,340
So explain the difference.

205
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
This is a way in the difference.

206
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,060
OK.

207
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,320
OK.

208
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,760
So this is held at the Contemporary.

209
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,260
So this is in Orlando.

210
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,460
Is it always an Orlando event?

211
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
They do them in, I think, Japan, too.

212
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,800
They have.

213
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,940
Yeah, I can't remember what is it.

214
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,140
Do they call Destination D in Japan?

215
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,400
I don't know the answer to this.

216
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,140
Yeah, no, I they do events in Japan as well.

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,620
They do.

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,080
Yeah.

219
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,880
And so this is like

220
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,620
it is it's essentially a smaller convention,

221
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,020
but I think it does seem more pleasant because

222
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,900
it's a lot fewer guests.

223
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,740
OK, you get to hang out at the convention,

224
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,740
the Contemporary for a few days, which is nice.

225
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
And all the programming is like sequential.

226
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,440
So you're guaranteed getting into everything.

227
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,040
Oh, you're not hustling.

228
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
And that's OK.

229
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:09,860
OK.

230
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,300
So now it is.

231
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,560
And I was surprised.

232
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,140
So it's like a three hundred dollar ticket for like three days of programming.

233
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,520
OK, that sounds not reasonable.

234
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,720
OK, keep going.

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,700
It's on par with like you had to see the plush pile when you came in.

236
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,840
Oh, that's what this is for.

237
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,260
Yeah.

238
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,900
That'll be referenced next week.

239
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,420
Oh, yes.

240
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,340
They do offer discounted Contemporary in Grand Floridian.

241
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,420
Oh, so it's only eight hundred dollars a night.

242
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,080
Exactly.

243
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:37,980
No, I know.

244
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,120
Hampton in size.

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,760
Sure.

246
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,280
But the to buy a ticket, you have to pay.

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,380
You have to be a D23 gold member.

248
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,140
Oh, and what is that?

249
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,860
$99 a year.

250
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
God, God.

251
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,700
Yeah.

252
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,220
I can't be so mean.

253
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm sure there are people listening to this who who do some of this

254
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,180
and attended this, and I hope that you get joy out of it.

255
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,540
It's fun to be had.

256
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,300
It's just maybe.

257
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Yeah.

258
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
You don't see the dollars.

259
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,000
Money's piling up.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,660
You got a con guy also.

261
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,500
No, we're a con guy.

262
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,320
And, you know, they they do always do a very good job of like

263
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,040
very specific merch, like they had all them

264
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,320
a bunch of Muppet Labs merch this time.

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,820
At one of the previous rounds, they had like a full suite of Pizza Rizzo

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,020
merch.

267
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh, and that and and again, it's not it seems less like D23

268
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,940
or Comic-Con where you're like, you know, fighting to get it before it's gone.

269
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
Is any of the merch free?

270
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,560
Uh, I can't speak to that.

271
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,260
I have a guess.

272
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,460
I think you maybe got an early chance to get your picture with large figment.

273
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,140
Wow.

274
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,040
Who kind of?

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,780
I don't know.

276
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,700
He scares me a little.

277
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,220
Yes.

278
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm large.

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,120
He's large, but his head is very small.

280
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,500
Yeah.

281
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,340
What happened?

282
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,620
Why are people accepting this?

283
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,200
All you have to do is make a suit.

284
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,700
You didn't redo the ride.

285
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,940
You're teasing and one of your god favorites might come back.

286
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,560
And then all it it's not the new ride.

287
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,640
It's a new suit.

288
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,560
So you didn't have to redo a whole ride that's bad.

289
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,240
All you had to make was a suit.

290
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,640
And what caused the head to need to be tinier?

291
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,180
Yes.

292
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
There was a walk around.

293
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,100
Did you like the old one?

294
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,040
I don't I don't know if I ever saw it in person, but I've seen side by sides

295
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,040
recently.

296
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,420
Just make the old one.

297
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,920
Why is the head so small?

298
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,380
I don't know why that's scary.

299
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,600
I have a whole nother take.

300
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,720
I don't like him big.

301
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,620
I know he's walked around a lot.

302
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,600
I don't like him big.

303
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,180
Sure.

304
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,840
Give me the baby Groot version of it.

305
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,720
I was going to say they've been working on the small guys.

306
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Small.

307
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,060
Small.

308
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,300
Why are people swallowing this and enjoying it?

309
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,180
Well, this line.

310
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,620
OK, if all right, if I'm really even better than that.

311
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,600
It's a nerd's rope.

312
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,040
Imagination you can make him however big or small as you want.

313
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,460
Yeah.

314
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,200
In which case, make him real small.

315
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,800
Make him like fit my shirt.

316
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,100
So you're saying everybody who goes up for the photo op should decide

317
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
how big they want him.

318
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh, boy, that would be good.

319
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,900
Bring in mid-sized, please.

320
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,940
You hand them a sheet that has his specifications, his size specifications.

321
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,260
You can say how big you want his head.

322
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,640
You can say how big you want his body.

323
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,980
Just fill out a form.

324
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Yeah.

325
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,520
I don't know.

326
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,540
This whole thing.

327
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,520
Someone pointed out that, like, boy, that portal sure looks exactly like

328
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,420
the one Ralph would walk through when this was a wreck at Ralph.

329
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,880
Yes.

330
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Yes.

331
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,960
Well, and it also many people pointed out, it looks like the tunnel from A.

332
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,240
W.

333
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,920
Dynamite.

334
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,240
It looks like the pro wrestler's entrance.

335
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Oh, is he coming out the good guy tunnel?

336
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,820
No, the heel tunnel, the bad tunnel.

337
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,280
There are two tunnels, one's good guy, one's bad guy.

338
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
He's a troublemaker.

339
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:40,980
Yeah.

340
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,760
Makes mischief.

341
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Yeah.

342
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:42,940
Yeah.

343
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,420
There.

344
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:43,880
Yeah.

345
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,580
There have been.

346
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,780
This has only been going for a couple of days as we record this.

347
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,000
Recording this Monday morning for context to the two days before it comes out.

348
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,640
And I know that yesterday I saw just like

349
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
shrieks, beetle shrieks for this costume.

350
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,960
And I'm like, have fun, guys.

351
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,180
But I think you're performing this a little hard.

352
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,160
Yeah.

353
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,370
And for five hour lines for this

354
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,020
figment size that makes no sense.

355
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,740
And no.

356
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah.

357
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,520
And then right before I came over, I don't know if you guys saw this.

358
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,680
Something happened.

359
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,200
I saw it.

360
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,480
Yeah.

361
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,920
This is he fell.

362
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,060
We were OK.

363
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,900
Boy, that sums up all the announcements.

364
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,640
He just provided a visual metaphor for everything.

365
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,140
The Disney company, the current company, Bob Iger himself.

366
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,380
Yeah.

367
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,960
I think we retroactively should take all the anger towards Chipick

368
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
and throw it on Iger, too.

369
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, that's what some of this article was about.

370
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,820
I feel it was kind of like, remember all that stuff that we were all.

371
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,260
We were really mean.

372
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
We gave his whatever we call it.

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,200
We call it Mr.

374
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,560
Turd's wild ride.

375
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,760
I remember he left.

376
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,600
And now it's become clear that some of the things like the Scarlett Johansson

377
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,860
really bad PR and the being muddy, but don't say gay, that maybe Iger

378
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,260
had his little mischievous figment pause.

379
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,860
That's right.

380
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,240
In some of these messes.

381
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,260
Maybe he was hoping that Chipick would pull a figment and collapse.

382
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Well, that's the one walking out.

383
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,020
I never talked to Bug about this theory, but it's certainly a theory

384
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,680
I had right when the pandemic started that this was the plan the whole time.

385
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,760
Was to make this guy fall on his face.

386
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,980
I think that big article.

387
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,320
Where was the big article?

388
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,380
Yeah, I don't know.

389
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,860
I remember a couple of weeks ago.

390
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,040
CNBC, maybe.

391
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Yes.

392
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,040
If you didn't read it, this big Iger, Chipick,

393
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,420
why the succession plan worked out so badly.

394
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,520
This big expose.

395
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah, it definitely lent a lot of credence to what you might have called

396
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,560
conspiracy theories before.

397
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,020
Yes.

398
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,020
You call them theories.

399
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,900
There are theories.

400
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,020
Well, this is unfortunate because I've already made a salt T-shirts

401
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,000
that say I live for those two shower days.

402
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,360
So I thought that was pretty cool.

403
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,640
A man who wakes up at 415 a.

404
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:06,940
m.

405
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,640
to start his day and exercise and then look at his phone

406
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,120
only after exercising and then works all day

407
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,520
and then insists on having the shower office that was built for Michael Eisner.

408
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,220
Eisner got the shower office.

409
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,700
I have worked for a company where someone told it's like,

410
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,160
oh, you know, the CEO has a shower in his office.

411
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,660
I was like, boy, that's weird.

412
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,640
And no one else was like, I feel like I was the only one who kept talking to me.

413
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,080
It was like, she had been the shower.

414
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,300
That's kind of strange, right?

415
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,020
The guys.

416
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,920
But aren't you?

417
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,060
But what are you saying now?

418
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,620
Eisner, who we love,

419
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,900
commissioned the shower office.

420
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,460
So don't we have to like shower offices?

421
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,360
We do have to like it.

422
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,160
That's the rule.

423
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,300
I thought you would like it that I thought.

424
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
I thought you uttered the phrase.

425
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,400
I love a two shower day.

426
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,460
It's very funny.

427
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,800
I that the company I used to work at is I think he

428
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,960
his two shower day was he would shower at the office.

429
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,940
And then he clearly had season tickets to the L.

430
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,240
A.

431
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,840
opera because they were always mass emailing the company.

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Like he cannot use his opera tickets tonight if anyone

433
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,760
to opera tickets.

434
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,560
And it's like, didn't you just tell us all there's no money for raises

435
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,760
this year and you're offering us opera tickets?

436
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,940
Well, if to be fair, if he well, OK, it implies that he is making a lot of money

437
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,060
if he can afford constant opera tickets he can't even use.

438
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,160
So I guess you're right.

439
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,060
But at the company, it doesn't seem like

440
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,140
this is something to dive into telemarketer style, like get down to the bottom of it.

441
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,300
But I don't it doesn't sound like the company's paying for the opera tickets.

442
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,500
Well, that's hard to say, because the company cars

443
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,660
that are meant to be doing deliveries were often picking up dry cleaning or coffee, you know,

444
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,640
blurring the line of what the job is.

445
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,720
So, you know, so anyway, that's why that company declared bankruptcy

446
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,940
eight years ago.

447
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,640
I was curious.

448
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,200
OK, OK.

449
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,040
So as as Disney, as the Walt Disney Company might

450
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,260
things keep going the way it really is.

451
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,200
Maybe being the rumor that comes along every year, maybe Apple will buy them,

452
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,360
which I feel like at the early 2000s, it was the other way around.

453
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,760
It was like, maybe Disney will buy Apple.

454
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,640
Really?

455
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
Oh, early 2000s.

456
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
Early 2000s.

457
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,040
I mean, then the iPad or the iPod.

458
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Changed everything.

460
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,880
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

461
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,740
I think that's happening, by the way.

462
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,080
Mm hmm.

463
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,600
It just feels like that's inevitable.

464
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,660
That's the way the world's going, that kind of thing.

465
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,060
And maybe I'm just depressed.

466
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,920
And that's why.

467
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,560
But yeah, I think it's.

468
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
Hey, hey, bought yourself.

469
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
Say what you like about it.

470
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,880
If you want to make that wealthy money that the Disney vloggers

471
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,140
in the yellow checkered cabbie hats make, start being positive about this stuff.

472
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,860
OK, well.

473
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,820
What do you like about Apple buying Disney?

474
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,640
Well, that all the characters will know everything about me when I go into the parks,

475
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,840
that it'll all be downloaded into their robot mouths that move.

476
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,180
You just need to give them.

477
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,460
I mean, not quite.

478
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,260
You know, the characters don't hug you anymore.

479
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,100
You put your hands up to their hands and the hands scan your fingerprints.

480
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,140
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,700
Suddenly, the characters have a lot to say about you.

482
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,360
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,280
So they'll know everything.

484
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,700
Yeah, they can read and they know your eyes from the goggle.

485
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,060
The unpleasant goggle VR.

486
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,460
Well, they know your eyes from the when your face unlocks your phone.

487
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,360
Oh, that's true.

488
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,700
So it really knows your face.

489
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,480
So Mickey, oh, hey there.

490
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,900
And then it's from far away.

491
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,760
You might want to wipe your history more often.

492
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,400
Your eye close almost full.

493
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
Did you enjoy a recent purchase of the sugar

494
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
egg cover of Abracadabra?

495
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,420
It rocks a lot more than the Steve Miller van one, don't you think?

496
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,380
They really brought something new to it.

497
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,600
Yeah, so that's good.

498
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,500
That'll be good.

499
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,660
There you go.

500
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,180
Well, now we're being positive.

501
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,560
Yeah.

502
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,740
Watch that money pour in.

503
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,280
How about Wendell singing?

504
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,840
We don't talk about Prudu.

505
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,580
Pretty cool.

506
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,260
Oh, is that a good place to start?

507
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,520
Well, that's a good place to start.

508
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm going to propose ending there.

509
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, you'll find out.

510
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,300
You'll see why.

511
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,060
So let's OK.

512
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,620
Well, we talk.

513
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,020
All right.

514
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,940
Is that what we had to say about tiny head figment?

515
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,720
He fell.

516
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,900
A tiny head figment.

517
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,520
He fell.

518
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,440
He fell.

519
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,280
Poor guy.

520
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,140
We were we were watching some of the not so scary parade

521
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,840
like live stream someone was doing last night.

522
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,800
And Jane was very concerned about the Ursula folding.

523
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,180
And I was like, I think it's like balanced.

524
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,340
Like, I don't know.

525
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,940
She said it was a pedal thing, kind of like it looks like a giant contraption.

526
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,760
Someone in.

527
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,540
Ursula fell in a parade?

528
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,000
No, no, she was concerned.

529
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,400
Like, what happens if that cast member falls?

530
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,260
What's happened?

531
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,620
Is Ursula on their own or are they on a float or?

532
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,800
No, she's on her own.

533
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,940
She's kind of but she's got the tentacles and everything.

534
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,480
So this is a hypothetical fall.

535
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
You're just worried about a possibility.

536
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,560
She was concerned.

537
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Yeah.

538
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,660
But I was like, I think that one's balanced.

539
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,500
But I don't now I can't say it figments eating shit on like day two or three.

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,240
But figments on there, you know, there's no mechanism.

541
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,140
Yeah, that's just a person having to feel their way through.

542
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,140
He's a, you know, waddle.

543
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,520
He wiggles around a lot.

544
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,460
He moves a lot.

545
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,120
You know?

546
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:25,540
Yeah.

547
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Yeah.

548
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:25,880
Yeah.

549
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,380
For imagination purposes.

550
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,820
That's how you get the brain juices flowing.

551
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Yeah.

552
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,440
Shake those arms.

553
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,420
So we got a falling figment.

554
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
We got they have they haven't announced

555
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,780
adding infrastructure to Ursula's float, but hopefully that's coming.

556
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh, my God.

557
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,480
Clear out the OK.

558
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,760
This is going to take 20 minutes.

559
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,180
Harmonious is now luminous, the symphony of us.

560
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,800
God, you guys just want to you want to break recording and high five for a while.

561
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,580
Yeah, we could do that.

562
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,540
Now, that one, I think I laughed when I read that name and Jing was in the other room.

563
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,940
And it was the whole it was one of those moments like

564
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,020
you say something.

565
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,720
Did you need me?

566
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,700
I was like, no, no, that never mind.

567
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,080
I'll explain later.

568
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,320
Jason was laughing like Joker on the bus uncontrollably

569
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,100
to himself alone.

570
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,120
I had the cards.

571
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,500
I had the cards explaining.

572
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,300
Yeah.

573
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah, this was maybe the most nonsense is phrase.

574
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Yeah, I don't know.

575
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
I don't know what to say about it.

576
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,780
I don't know.

577
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
No, I don't know what it is.

578
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,240
We liked harmonious.

579
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,720
There's a lot of slight a hand going on here in this presentation, too.

580
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,440
This is a three card Monte of a presentation is this way.

581
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,420
I like to think of it all.

582
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,320
Just keep moving.

583
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
Keep moving.

584
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,640
Distracting.

585
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,860
That's one thing.

586
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,980
There's more coming up.

587
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,680
OK, cool.

588
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,980
Or where's the ball now?

589
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,320
The balls on that one, right?

590
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,060
No, it's not.

591
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,520
OK.

592
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,100
I it's a shame because I thought harmonious was pretty fun.

593
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,280
We thought it was very moving and like cool pyro, cool screens and stuff.

594
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,460
But those giant black barges for years.

595
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Just hanging out, ruining the view, I think, did it in.

596
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,640
That's what dams that.

597
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:05,940
Yeah.

598
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,480
coming to Epcot.

599
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,140
World celebration is about to open Epcot's newest area with no attractions.

600
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
It will soon be open to the public.

601
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,460
That's right.

602
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,140
The gates will come down so you can explore a world of nothing.

603
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,860
What is it?

604
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,400
I don't know.

605
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
What are these announcements?

606
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,500
I don't know.

607
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah.

608
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,900
Well, there's that big fountain kind of carve out

609
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,880
that someone showed from the aerial view looks kind of suggestive.

610
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,320
What is it?

611
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,640
Oh, it looks like it looks like a vulva from above.

612
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,600
Oh, God.

613
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,740
Really?

614
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,460
Yeah.

615
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,100
Epcot put in a big vulva.

616
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,360
Well, I'm sure it just looks like fountains and seating areas from below.

617
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,060
It's all about the Disney words.

618
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Wish celebration vulva vulva.

619
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
He's at the tenets of Disney.

620
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,560
That's weird.

621
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,980
OK, there was a confusing attraction announcement.

622
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,560
Test Track 3, the rubber match, the test track rubber match.

623
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,500
Is it the confusing or is it just why?

624
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,780
It's an update.

625
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,140
Well, the reason is because it's got us.

626
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,880
That's one of the last rides that actually has a sponsor

627
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,820
that's willing to pay for that's what I was going to say.

628
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,300
So they got a Chevrolet.

629
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,640
Right.

630
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,440
So like that's the closest thing to a real announcement.

631
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,340
That's that's what some people were saying.

632
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,300
That's the closest thing to going, oh, cool.

633
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,360
There'll be like a new thing to see in a couple of years.

634
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,100
We were kind of with the concept art.

635
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,060
It's like, hey, the forest, the forest from the beginning.

636
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,820
OK, fine.

637
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,600
All right, cool.

638
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm not that high on test track in general these days, but, you know,

639
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,680
throw something in there.

640
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,460
Inspired by World of Motion.

641
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,520
I like that.

642
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,300
That's the thing I like.

643
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,500
I like the sound of it.

644
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:45,840
Yeah.

645
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,120
And we know when Epcot says it's going to be like the old thing,

646
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,100
they always deliver on that.

647
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,040
They always you can trust them.

648
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,120
Maybe a certain mischievous purple dragon will return.

649
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,620
Not in ride form will be giant scary creature with tiny head who falls.

650
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
Oh, it's just funny.

651
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,560
Again.

652
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah, Mike, you're probably 100 percent right that it's like

653
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,980
maybe the sponsors like, well, I think 100 percent.

654
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,040
And 11 years and cars are starting to look different.

655
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,860
Every other sponsor is like bailed on these rides or is like

656
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,920
doesn't want to pay a ton of money for a refresh.

657
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,060
Yeah, but they're on this second test track refresh.

658
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,580
I feel it before they've refreshed journey into imagination

659
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,020
because they probably presented to the what Chevy?

660
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,600
They presented to them and they go, yeah, we'll spend two hundred million dollars.

661
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
A hundred million dollars or if that makes it jump the line, huh?

662
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,100
If you don't have why would that be the priority?

663
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,740
Is there enough track record now

664
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,220
that the company, all the companies that used to sponsor attractions

665
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,620
have all figured out that there's no point in doing this?

666
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,600
I believe so.

667
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,120
Yes.

668
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,660
They have like that Disney shell game that started by Walt.

669
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,180
Yes.

670
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
Now like we really haven't seen any uptick in sales

671
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,940
because we've been we paid for this ride.

672
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,680
Well, they've also made too many documentaries where it's like,

673
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,500
well, figure it out.

674
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,620
The secret you get these other schmucks to pay for.

675
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,620
Oh, yeah.

676
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,540
They revealed it.

677
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,620
They revealed their tricks.

678
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,140
Yeah.

679
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,940
Look what all the attractions sponsoring did for Monsanto.

680
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,900
They sponsored like five things and look at them now,

681
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,700
kind of gone or hidden or merged into something

682
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,240
so that you don't remember that name that has bad associations.

683
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,140
I assure you, Monsanto is still around.

684
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,220
They're just working in the shadows.

685
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,080
No, they just got hidden and folded.

687
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,160
Haynes stopped sponsoring the Rock and Roller Coaster.

688
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,480
It was Haynes.

689
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah, we did.

690
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,740
I'm not sure about that in the episode.

691
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,460
Haynes, I think these.

692
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,780
How do I forget some of these details?

693
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,660
Yeah, that's an interesting Disney fact.

694
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,560
Top of mind.

695
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,780
That should have been a big announcement like Haynes is back

696
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,100
sponsoring Rock and Roller Coaster.

697
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,580
Haynes, I think, was one of the companies where I was watching

698
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,760
one of those videos about like company mergers and, you know, breakups and stuff.

699
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,320
And it's like, I think Haynes and Champion might have been owned

700
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,220
by Arm and Hammer for a while.

701
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,720
Really?

702
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,420
In the way that Philip Morris is just like, hey, like half the companies

703
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,220
you use in your daily life are OdeFi, Unilever, Philip Morris.

704
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,200
We own baking soda and underwear.

705
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:22,800
Yeah.

706
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,460
OK.

707
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,860
Well, we'll look into that.

708
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,900
We'll look into that.

709
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,520
Mm hmm.

710
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,440
So what owns forever, dog?

711
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm afraid.

712
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,680
Halliburton.

713
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, Black Rock.

714
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,200
We've never asked.

715
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,080
DuPont chemicals and weaponry.

716
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,300
It's CIA backed, actually.

717
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,240
Oh, OK.

718
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,160
I'll explain some of the nice stuff around here.

719
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

720
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
So, yeah, test track is the most exciting thing that was announced.

721
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,260
They well, second probably.

722
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,580
But but yeah, it's like, oh, it'll be a new thing.

723
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,260
OK.

724
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,760
Or do you think the first is Animal Kingdom?

725
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,600
No.

726
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,240
OK.

727
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,700
No.

728
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,920
Because I want to talk about this.

729
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,380
Yeah.

730
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,640
I misinterpreted.

731
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,280
And it'll seem foolish, my misinterpretation.

732
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
I thought it was saying so

733
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,680
imagineers have been spotted recently walking around the Dino land area

734
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,400
and they announced like in Canto and the Indiana Jones.

735
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,940
I assume that was a done deal.

736
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,660
I thought they were both coming to Animal Kingdom.

737
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,400
But some some bloggers said the same thing.

738
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,180
Oh, country.

739
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,100
Oh, country.

740
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,120
I I the more I was looking at my chat, I was reading

741
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,960
Arthur Levine, Substack, someone who's he's covered the theme

742
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,440
car industry for a long, long time for multiple outlets.

743
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,160
And it became clear the verbiage is

744
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,020
and this was coming up on Twitter a lot

745
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,640
being considered.

746
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,840
Yes.

747
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,140
Everything is being considered.

748
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,940
So it's and or so it could be both

749
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,200
or it could be one or maybe it could be neither.

750
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,160
Yeah.

751
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:03,560
Yeah.

752
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,460
Neither is a good neither is probably what's going to happen.

753
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,940
They're probably not going to do either of them.

754
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Yeah.

755
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
So by the way, nothing's getting better.

756
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
I think may have said this on recently.

757
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,120
Nothing's getting built for seven to 10 years.

758
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,600
There's not another ride happening for a long, long time.

759
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,940
They're about to get rid of other than Tiana 2025 by that.

760
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,540
Pick you up by a full theme park down.

761
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,180
It's coming so hard for them.

762
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,640
Still like there's stuff they could at least do to like help, I feel like.

763
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,980
And they are not going to do it like they are going to just run

764
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,500
right into this headfirst into a brick wall.

765
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,900
I feel like not to clear past if there's more to say about

766
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,540
in Kanto and Indiana Jones.

767
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,500
One thing, but go ahead.

768
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,140
I my only counter to that is do you think maybe

769
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,400
Avengers eat ticket because they teased it a little more.

770
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,400
It's not like they've broken ground or anything,

771
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,640
but they gave us a little more info.

772
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,580
I'm not I'm not seven to ten.

773
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,500
Five years, maybe I'll give you.

774
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,120
That's what I'm saying.

775
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,220
Maybe five years from now.

776
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm not optimistic.

777
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,760
I know this then that seems like a tron that's going to take forever.

778
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Maybe you're right.

779
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,460
Maybe that one.

780
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,340
But that one.

781
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,780
OK, other coast.

782
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,300
That's West Coast.

783
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,080
Yeah.

784
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,360
Yeah.

785
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,320
To the the concept art seems to be

786
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,440
not just shifting, but devolving.

787
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,360
Like it just gets.

788
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,580
Oh, it's just a screen, right?

789
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,900
It's just going to be a sort of ripoff man.

790
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,180
Yeah, right.

791
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
And then it's going to have like holes in the wall

792
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,580
that look like the transports into another screen.

793
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,280
It's just if only they had like, say, 60 years of Avengers art to pull from.

794
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,300
Some might say 60 years exactly the month of September.

795
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,280
You want the dawn of the anniversary.

796
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,360
It's a funny thing to be so

797
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
arguing about the we're in the month.

798
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,080
You said that and the troops must be honored to like celebrate.

799
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,020
But this fall is the 60th anniversary of both

800
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,300
the first Avengers comic and the first X-Men comic.

801
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,760
And I feel like there's like not much going like

802
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,560
not a whole lot going on.

803
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,700
Companies hanging on by a thread here.

804
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,600
Well, that's yeah.

805
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,940
They didn't even acknowledge the an anniversary.

806
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,720
I'm not shocked by this.

807
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,500
But I'm just saying like the first Avengers

808
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
ride discussion, it was like very specific.

809
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,100
And I think they scaled back on that after the reason

810
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,400
this passed away, the reason is art doesn't look like anything

811
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,300
is because they have not approved anything because they're still going to.

812
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,700
They want to make sure like they're not going to over promise at this point.

813
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,880
So it's going to be completely like shit.

814
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,380
They haven't shown the show you version as you go.

815
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,500
Was all multiverse stuff, which that means like, oh, we could be anything.

816
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,560
And then I feel like they've did.

817
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:52,900
They.

818
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,200
I actually didn't see.

819
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,580
Catch this.

820
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,940
Did they mention anything about the multiverse this time?

821
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,920
I think kind of.

822
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,500
Yeah.

823
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,040
Yeah.

824
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,320
Yeah.

825
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,360
You can jump between.

826
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,760
So I think the premise of this is what you're going to get to see like

827
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,200
Toby McGuire.

828
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,380
Well, the premise was like, OK, it's dark technology

829
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,120
and they can use the Xanadar gates and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I saw that.

830
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,300
And then what was the third black panther or something?

831
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,560
Oh, Wakanda technology.

832
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,340
I was just and there's like, is it?

833
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,540
Wait, Xanadar?

834
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,140
Well, that's that's from Guardians of the Galaxy.

835
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,940
That's not Xandar.

836
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,740
Xandar.

837
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,080
Yeah.

838
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,980
Isn't it Xandar?

839
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,880
No, I'm saying I think even I know that.

840
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,900
Well, Xandar is I think is that the planet and Xanadar is that the term?

841
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,340
Oh, I don't know.

842
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,240
They have a Xan.

843
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,760
No, it's still Xandar.

844
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,620
Xandar.

845
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,560
I beat you on a Marvel thing.

846
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,580
I did it.

847
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,020
Wow.

848
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,620
The cosmic stuff and the magic stuff.

849
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,100
I can't.

850
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,840
He doesn't.

851
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,560
I can lose.

852
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,240
It loses me when they go to space.

853
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,740
I don't know.

854
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
They got the planets and there's so many.

855
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,900
But even that's getting incomprehensible.

856
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,300
I love when the X-Men go to space.

857
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,640
But they don't run into these same Guardians characters.

858
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,480
Yeah, no, they're more day trippers.

859
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,580
I know that she are.

860
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,720
I know the Star Jammer.

861
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,140
Sure.

862
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,460
Those are my space characters.

863
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,500
What is I have another thing, though, Jason, you said that you implied

864
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,760
that something about Chadwick Boseman's passing changed the premise of the ride.

865
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,860
It seemed like the original iteration was going to be heavily like

866
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,700
you go to Wakanda and fight off an alien invasion.

867
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,900
And you think it was due to the death, not due to let's cut this budget

868
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,980
down to a quarter of what it was supposed to be.

869
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,820
That's my feeling.

870
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,660
Well, I think that is one thing.

871
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,820
And I think like, I don't know how the box.

872
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,820
It seems like the box offices for all these movies are like getting kind of tepid.

873
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,480
The first version of this looked like the coolest ride ever made.

874
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Yeah.

875
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,720
And that's where you were going to break off and be swung around.

876
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,680
Yeah.

877
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,180
Yeah.

878
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,660
And then they went, no, let's do something a lot cheaper

879
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,660
and then let's keep making it.

880
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,400
This is just a ship at night, which is funny because it's like, you don't.

881
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,940
I know your post-production, you make the special effects scenes at night.

882
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,440
So you have to fill out less of it, but you don't have to make the concept art at night.

883
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,760
Well, again, they're not going to show you anything cool

884
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,940
because they're not committed to making this cool yet.

885
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,020
They're not.

886
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,280
They haven't greenlit making this cool.

887
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,360
They don't know if it's going to be cool yet.

888
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,060
Again, I think that like benefit of the doubt is like, OK, well, it's still on the board.

889
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,020
Kind of.

890
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,600
Well, it is a good sign that they're saying it's exist.

891
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,320
It exists.

892
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,340
That's true.

893
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,540
A little more details than like the expansion behind Big Thunder Mountain,

894
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,620
which, folks, is going to be terrific.

895
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,400
It's going to be the best expansion I've ever seen.

896
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,700
Frankly, they've never seen anything like that.

897
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,340
No details.

898
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,560
We're not going to get into the muck in the mire.

899
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,540
They haven't even that is just the same as the last time we did this.

900
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,160
We've started dreaming about what's behind Big Thunder Mountain.

901
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,400
So anyway, we've got a new bathroom coming like they just there's no.

902
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,800
How many more times can they do this?

903
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,160
How many more times can Daddy Tomorrow get away with this?

904
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,860
But I feel like the expectations are much lower at these off year events, these smaller events.

905
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,540
So announcing like a figment test track, it's like, well,

906
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,240
but it's something I guess they don't.

907
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:25,180
The last the 23, I feel like was the first time they did such a crazy, big fake announcement.

908
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,020
I've never seen them do that before.

909
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,300
I've certainly seen them disappoint everybody over and over again.

910
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,300
But I've never seen them give a fake announcement like that.

911
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,860
What was like, look at this.

912
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,780
Maybe like that's never happened.

913
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,280
They they had they were so low on cool stuff.

914
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,780
They were desperate.

915
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,860
And so they go, I guess let's just say like maybe we're going to do this.

916
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,020
Like that's how bad the situation is.

917
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,480
And it got and it got it did not improve in the interview.

918
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,120
No, it got worse.

919
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,800
Yeah, it's still just well, have you ever noticed you ever gone on Google Maps

920
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,900
to see that there is technically property behind Big Thunder Mountain?

921
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,340
We noticed too.

922
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,560
So we're thinking about it.

923
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,380
Yeah, we're going to maybe we'll maybe we'll chop a tree down or two.

924
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,120
Well, it seems like they confirm that the parks panel and some of the other big

925
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,200
panels will be held in the Honda Center.

926
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,180
Well, that's a wild decision.

927
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,920
That they're going to have to do this for the next few years with fake announcements.

928
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,280
Yeah, they better have this center.

929
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,720
Oh, my God.

930
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,660
I don't know.

931
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,140
That feels like they're going to do like a musical performance

932
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,160
or something in there.

933
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,680
Is the Honda Center can you can someone to refresh my memory?

934
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,360
Is the Honda Center by Angel Stadium or is it by the pond?

935
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,000
It is.

936
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,620
It is the pond.

937
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh, it's the pond.

938
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,240
OK, yeah.

939
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,260
So all right.

940
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,080
It's at least next door to the convention center.

941
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,900
No, they don't know someone to the desolate parking lots around the

942
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,340
angel state.

943
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,020
It's very far away.

944
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520
Oh, the Honda Center is.

945
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:49,940
Yes.

946
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,460
OK, yeah.

947
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,940
You're going to have to like bus people over.

948
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,740
They're going to have to drive.

949
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,800
I don't know what the plan is for that.

950
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,800
There's nothing near there.

951
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,220
And they didn't even build Mike Love's Club Kokomo feet away from it.

952
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,460
So nobody will know anywhere to decompress and listen to some island rhythms.

953
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,680
But maybe none of that gangster ramp.

954
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,520
Yeah.

955
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,800
So I don't know what that plan.

956
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,340
I don't know why the hell they would do that other than just to make more money

957
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,800
and keep what is the only one.

958
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,980
Can they say that that will make the rafters shake?

959
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,720
How what is and what is an arena sized announcement

960
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,180
that what what what what befits that venue?

961
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,040
Disney Sky Park in Japan and a fifth gate in Japan.

962
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,960
Well, and what about third here or like the expansion here with both parks?

963
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,280
The expansion here plans have been so odd.

964
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,780
I it would have to be pretty concrete.

965
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,460
What if they said because, you know, there's been different sites

966
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,180
talked about for where does Disney expand and their Anaheim options are limited.

967
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,800
So what if they say third gate coming in Anaheim,

968
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,580
the very spot of this arena set in the wrecking ball

969
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,720
and somewhere that's safe, that's free of people or not, whatever.

970
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,460
Who cares if some people get it?

971
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,820
Wrecking ball comes in right then as if to signal we're doing it here.

972
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,040
The center's gone.

973
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,460
Wow.

974
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,100
A fam, we're checking out the new wrecking ball

975
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,980
that is currently heading toward our skulls right now.

976
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Little Easter egg.

977
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,540
It's actually as I see it swinging at me, it's actually got a hidden Mickey on it.

978
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,500
He's got the ears.

979
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,920
The balls got the ears on it.

980
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,780
It is my honor to get killed by killed by a giant Mickey.

981
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,240
My co-hosts are currently in line to buy the exclusive hard hats.

982
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,420
And I'm just getting word they've sold out.

983
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,980
So we might be done for.

984
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,400
If you purchase a ticket to D23 next year, you automatically are insured

985
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,980
under Bob Iger for a life insurance policy.

986
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,300
So he collects when you die.

987
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,080
Oh, yeah.

988
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,620
Kill everyone in the Honda Center.

989
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,580
That'll save Disney financially.

990
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,700
That saves.

991
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,120
Yes.

992
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,020
That is you being a soldier.

993
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,000
You're being a Disney martyr so that maybe you won't get to experience

994
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,220
the third gate, but somebody in the future will.

995
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,360
The third gate, that'll just be like mostly Apple product placement.

996
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,040
But yeah, you die so that it can be born.

997
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,600
My dream has always been for the Walt Disney Company to kill me

998
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,120
in a double indemnity type insurance.

999
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,260
That'd be great.

1000
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,200
Yeah, that's right.

1001
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,640
Well, that's going to happen next year in the center.

1002
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,260
That's the plan.

1003
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,800
Be there.

1004
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,440
Get killed.

1005
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,860
That's it's fire, fam.

1006
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,840
Let's go backwards, though.

1007
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,520
Is it what anything else about this?

1008
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,680
Indeed, this is interesting to fully explain this.

1009
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,800
This this is actually kind of an odd, surprising

1010
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,460
Disney acknowledgment of the possibility.

1011
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,060
This feels very fan theory, something that's been talked about for a long time,

1012
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,520
that if you've been on the dinosaur ride, it is essentially

1013
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,080
it has a lot in common with Indiana Jones.

1014
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,680
It's the same type of vehicle technology.

1015
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,840
They've said it's the same track layout, although I don't know

1016
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,480
how exactly true that is.

1017
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,900
And I don't know if they have I don't know how you do like the bridge

1018
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,860
in the full like, you know, Mara Skull Room or whatever.

1019
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,040
But you could see how you could take the bones of that building

1020
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,920
and ride and mod it out into something closer to Indiana Jones,

1021
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,780
like in Disneyland or Tokyo.

1022
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,240
So it's I was a little like, oh, it's kind of weird to even see that they

1023
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,920
did artwork showing what that would be like, even if it never happens.

1024
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,320
Right.

1025
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:19,820
Yes.

1026
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,280
I it's weird.

1027
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,280
I first of all, I think it's not going to happen because certain

1028
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,780
archaeologists didn't do so well this summer.

1029
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,180
The dial of destiny pointed at the point in south.

1030
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,760
Calista didn't do as well.

1031
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,360
I don't know.

1032
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,520
I was going to say I believe that I was going to say Indiana Jones

1033
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,580
seems like it'd be a real animal himself.

1034
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,140
But Carrie Fisher said it was more like a three month long one night stand.

1035
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,340
OK, now I know deciphering the joke with Jason Sheridan

1036
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,660
explain the joke.

1037
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
Oh, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford revealed 40 years

1038
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,120
after the fact that he did have a three month long affair making Star Wars

1039
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,580
briefly rekindled during.

1040
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,760
And you're saying he's an animal like a sack.

1041
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,500
I was like, oh, I bet he's a real animal.

1042
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,280
I was hoping you were going to say rekindled during Force Awakens.

1043
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,920
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,340
Man, if only.

1045
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,760
Boy, there were paparazzi photos of them in the Falcon.

1046
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,380
What's that in the window?

1047
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,760
Why is it so foggy in there?

1048
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,200
That's how he knocked the accent.

1049
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,360
League was flailing around, knocked the door over on his own.

1050
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,200
Oh, yeah.

1051
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,420
Carrie, I'm home.

1052
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,780
Yeah, I don't.

1053
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,600
It my reaction initially was like, well,

1054
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,280
are there that many animals in Indiana Jones and in Canto?

1055
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,180
You're right.

1056
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,160
In Canto, yes.

1057
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,700
And there are a lot of animals.

1058
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,160
Yeah, I kind of I'm of the perspective of now that that movie's

1059
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,400
been on in front of me a fair amount as a parent.

1060
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,820
I'm like, I kind of wanted the tree house to become in Canto

1061
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,300
as opposed to this generic whatever they're doing now.

1062
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,260
I'm not quite a Swiss family, but not quite.

1063
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1064
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,360
It's Nate's.

1065
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,560
I don't understand what it is.

1066
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,740
Maybe I'll like it when I see it.

1067
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,620
Indiana Jones, though.

1068
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,700
Well, hang on.

1069
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,580
Snakes, rats, the end of list.

1070
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,600
But that's good.

1071
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,640
Oh, monkeys, CGI monkeys.

1072
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,260
2008 monkeys.

1073
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,060
If we're swinging with 2008 monkeys with Mutt, then we're then

1074
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,400
premise justified animal kingdom.

1075
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
My pitch, and I don't know that I made this up.

1076
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,020
I may have seen it somewhere over the years.

1077
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,800
I don't know.

1078
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,560
But my pitch is you keep the dinosaurs on the ride.

1079
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,220
Oh, and he has to go back in time.

1080
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Oh, that'd be good.

1081
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,260
That's a great idea, I think.

1082
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,540
I don't know how it works exactly.

1083
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,200
He's going back to get you can keep Dr.

1084
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,280
Seeker, Dr.

1085
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,780
Seeker is and he's like you film new stuff with him.

1086
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,300
Like, you know, and I got this old fart.

1087
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,760
I'm sending back with you.

1088
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,300
He's all dismissive.

1089
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,140
Yeah, he's his age now.

1090
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,860
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,520
So it's not younger Indiana Jones.

1092
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,080
Or it's his father, Dr.

1093
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,460
Seeker, the first.

1094
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,560
OK, there's grandfather.

1095
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,600
Oh, you'd have to.

1096
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,100
Yeah, Dr.

1097
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,060
Seeker, senior.

1098
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,600
That's good.

1099
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah.

1100
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,640
Uh huh.

1101
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
I know that seems really fun.

1102
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,260
They're not going to do that.

1103
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,540
But I think that seemed that actually was like indie punching a T-Rex.

1104
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:19,860
Right.

1106
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,880
And that's good.

1107
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,960
Going keep guys.

1108
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,500
Yeah, like he's trying to block the T-Rex's eyes.

1109
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,660
So you can't lunge at you.

1110
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,280
Yeah.

1111
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,520
This dark back in that time.

1112
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,620
Yeah.

1113
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,500
Maybe he's like hanging from the rope and the T-Rex comes out at the end

1114
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,980
or whatever the last thing is.

1115
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,380
Whoa.

1116
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
That would be cool.

1117
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,840
I mean, that'd be very cool.

1118
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,320
Yeah.

1119
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,480
And it feels like it would be cheaper, too,

1120
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,240
because you don't have to get rid of all the dinosaurs on.

1121
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,300
And then you you you catch Indy at the end.

1122
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,480
He saved you like at the end of the Disneyland ride.

1123
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,700
But he he lost an arm.

1124
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,180
His arm got bitten off and it is canonical.

1125
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,940
So like this declares that Indiana Jones lost his arm.

1126
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,280
So he's a fake arm in the movies.

1127
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,900
Yeah.

1128
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,760
And then if they ever bring it back.

1129
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,180
And I got to say, it's looking good in number six.

1130
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,680
Then he's got to tie kind of a Star Wars homage.

1131
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,740
Yeah, that's good.

1132
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,080
Like C-3PO.

1133
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,800
Red arm.

1134
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,660
Red arm.

1135
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,260
And then he gets a red arm.

1136
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,820
Now I've got a red arm.

1137
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,060
I found an artifact that grew my arm back, but it's red.

1138
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,900
It is C-3PO's red arm.

1139
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,800
It is the tie the universes together.

1140
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,120
It got very, very like.

1141
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,680
And then there's some space adventure where he found it.

1142
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,540
They dug it up.

1143
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,300
My my feeling about like the theming at this point, it's just

1144
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,400
we've been worn down by this.

1145
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,720
And I try to be optimistic just if it's a new ride

1146
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,600
and it doesn't look like shit on the outside.

1147
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,460
Put it wherever.

1148
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,960
Like, yes, ruin everything.

1149
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,700
It's fine.

1150
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,520
I'll take it if it's a ride and it makes like the area look interesting or cool.

1151
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,500
And and you're I mean, the animal thing, absolutely.

1152
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,200
Is it concerned?

1153
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,860
Maybe there's be a new premise that involves animals more

1154
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,520
like what Mike has pitched, which is good.

1155
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,300
But it is at least it would at least fit in the ruins.

1156
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,760
You know, exotic, the roadie verse.

1157
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
Yeah, of animal kingdom.

1158
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,260
It would at least aesthetically be a fit.

1159
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,840
Yes, would in content, I think.

1160
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,520
I think.

1161
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:18,980
Sure.

1162
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,020
There's enough like nature to it.

1163
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,560
I'm pro that, you know, I hope it's more than like a walkthrough.

1164
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,160
But yeah, but neither are happening.

1165
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,920
So yeah, so let's not speculate about things.

1166
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,680
Yeah, yeah.

1167
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,400
Won't occur.

1168
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,600
OK, so Zootopia, this was another seemingly concrete announcement.

1169
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,940
There's an original Zootopia movie moving into the tray of life,

1170
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,740
kicking out tough to be a bug.

1171
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:50,000
Oddly enough, Kevin Spacey's Hopper is staying and he's recording the voices.

1172
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,400
A fully vindicated space.

1173
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,740
Yes, yeah, he's back.

1174
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,440
He needs work, too.

1175
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,120
So if people thought like, are they going to do because they they've

1176
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,920
announced they've shown a lot of the Shanghai Zootopia.

1177
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
That little fly through look good to me.

1178
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,680
And like this is a robust, real land.

1179
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:11,260
Big.

1180
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:11,880
Yeah, it's big.

1181
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,480
It looks a little like Seuss landing to me in places, but I guess that's not a bad thing.

1182
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,140
How dare you say that's a bad thing in front of Jason.

1183
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,340
I know you big Seuss.

1184
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:19,840
Yeah, yeah.

1185
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,220
Good.

1186
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,200
I mean, I like Seuss landing.

1187
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,740
I don't think you like it that much.

1188
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,620
I kind of breeze through it.

1189
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,880
I like the curved trees, the hurricane safe trees.

1190
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,420
That's all right.

1191
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,200
It's a little difficult to the color palette Dr.

1192
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,220
Seuss books when you paint it in reality in the harsh Florida sun.

1193
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,080
It looks immediately sun bleached.

1194
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,980
Well, yeah, any cartoon thing you have to keep up like painting it every other week.

1195
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,700
Stay on.

1196
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

1197
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,020
But I don't know.

1198
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,260
I like what they're showing.

1199
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,580
She is big.

1200
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,460
You get to go on a police car adventure.

1201
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,220
But yeah, the ride's a little they people were like, are they going to build the ride?

1202
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,580
That's like you're all cops now.

1203
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,280
Awesome.

1204
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,580
Hooray for cops.

1205
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,340
That's what it is.

1206
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,200
But they which it's.

1207
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,340
Hey, we haven't seen it.

1208
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,700
We don't know what it is yet.

1209
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,440
We know we don't know what it is yet.

1210
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,040
Yeah.

1211
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,360
We'll never ride it because it's not going to be built here.

1212
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,100
They did not build the ride here.

1213
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,060
Maybe it's a maybe they're going to clone it for the Avengers.

1214
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,460
Somebody also was floating the idea that the Avengers is a clone of the Peter Pan

1215
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,400
ride that's opening Japan because the ride vehicles look similar.

1216
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,140
Really?

1217
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:27,820
Yeah.

1218
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,320
What is it?

1219
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,760
I don't I don't know what that ride is.

1220
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,720
I don't know specifically.

1221
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,120
I just it's like it's a I think it's a trackless

1222
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,160
in the eyes, right in the new fantasy springs, where it's just like

1223
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,720
something's going to make you feel like you're flying or something.

1224
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,660
And maybe and there is it an attempt at like let's do a big Peter Pan.

1225
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,700
Yes, it's like a big up with so that it's not like jamming in two people at a time.

1226
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,720
I believe that's the idea.

1227
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,960
It's a big closer to maybe probably all three of those are probably a ticket.

1228
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,760
I think.

1229
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,920
Yeah.

1230
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,900
Stuff got to get back to Japan.

1231
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,540
Oh, my God.

1232
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:01,960
I know.

1233
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,420
Yeah.

1234
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,120
Springs, right?

1235
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,500
Good news there.

1236
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,500
Yeah, that stuff looks awesome.

1237
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:06,980
Yes.

1238
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,820
That stuff was the footage of that we've seen.

1239
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,400
Rousings.

1240
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:09,660
Yeah.

1241
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,320
Yes.

1242
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,480
OK, I'm being serious here.

1243
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,600
I know it's based on the animated Peter Pan.

1244
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,520
Did the live action remake ever come out?

1245
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,400
Which one of Peter Pan on Disney Plus or in theaters?

1246
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,540
I know that now there is a diff.

1247
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,300
There is a live action remake every three months made by some entity.

1248
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,220
But the Disney one, I couldn't.

1249
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,620
The Southern Wild director did one.

1250
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Really?

1251
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,180
Yeah.

1253
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,900
That's on the Disney one.

1254
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,540
No, that's not that was the smaller.

1255
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,920
Jude Law was in the Peter Pan, right?

1256
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,200
Was Jude Law and Jim Gaffigan were hooking Smee?

1257
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,220
Jim Gaffigan?

1258
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,820
I think Jim Gaffigan might have been Peter Pan.

1259
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,460
I think it's actually pretty good.

1260
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,020
I don't have a fucking clue.

1261
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,140
And I like Peter Pan and Wendy.

1262
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,340
OK, hold on.

1263
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,160
Hold on.

1264
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,760
It came out April 28th, 2023.

1265
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,060
What?

1266
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,340
Oh, so just a few months ago.

1267
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,640
Oh, yeah, we were because we were sending it to you.

1268
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,040
We were teasing you about it.

1269
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,620
And it is Gaffigan is me.

1270
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,280
This movie exists and has been out for months.

1271
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,220
Right, right, right.

1272
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,200
It is utterly unfamiliar to me.

1273
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,820
Granted, I'm I'm trying to purge Peter Pan from my brain.

1274
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,500
This is already uncomfortably long to be talking about Peter Pan,

1275
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,480
only dealing with it because it's a ride.

1276
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,820
But this this film, I can't believe this happened.

1277
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,580
And Wendy, yes, there it is.

1278
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,240
Which I think is different from Peter and Wendy.

1279
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,440
Yes.

1280
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,520
Which might be different than Peter and Wendy.

1281
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,700
It came out, though.

1282
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,760
But yes, I know it's not based on that, and I think it's based on the cartoon.

1283
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,040
It's based on the cartoon.

1284
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,640
OK.

1285
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,640
Yeah.

1286
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,400
So anyway, what is wrong with the person on this earth

1287
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,000
who tracks every quarterly Peter Pan film

1288
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,420
and can know the difference?

1289
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,900
The Pan world's number one pan enthusiast.

1290
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,740
We should look up if there is that person.

1291
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,280
Well, there was there was a reigning that person, but he died in 2009

1292
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,480
at the hands of Dr.

1293
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,460
Conrad Murray.

1294
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,120
That's a very good point.

1295
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,380
The title's been up for grabs ever since.

1296
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Point.

1297
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,080
There's got to be a number two, though.

1298
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,080
No one's going to beat him, though.

1299
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,080
Yeah, he's the all timer.

1300
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,060
He had the resources to make the lifestyle happen.

1301
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,160
To track Disney Plus, all the stuff episodes

1302
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,200
we did in 2019 where we're like making fun of like,

1303
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,880
oh, the world according to Jeff Goldblum or whatever.

1304
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,700
Like all of those are first wave of original Disney Plus things,

1305
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,240
I think are gone, gone, wiped, wiped, gone.

1306
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:39,620
Yeah.

1307
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,660
Did you hear that the the quibbys that moved to Roku are now off of Roku?

1308
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,500
Are they off?

1309
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,180
Yeah, right.

1310
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,400
Roku.

1311
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,500
Golden arm is gone.

1312
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,120
I think Golden.

1313
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,860
I mean, I would have to consult the specific list,

1314
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,620
but architecture is gone.

1315
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh, no.

1316
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,220
My can I name any more?

1317
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,380
Murder House Flip is gone.

1318
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,780
These poor orphan quibbys.

1319
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,640
Anna Kendrick with the sex doll is gone.

1320
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,500
Dummies gone.

1321
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,240
Dummies gone.

1322
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:04,880
Uh-huh.

1323
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,780
They're all gone.

1324
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,920
These poor orphan quibbys no longer have a Roku to call home.

1325
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,080
Oh, so sad.

1326
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:12,500
Mm hmm.

1327
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,900
Well, they'll find a place somewhere.

1328
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:15,760
Maybe.

1329
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,680
Well, yeah, Exumo.

1330
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,280
Exumo, the newest pre streaming service.

1331
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,000
Guess what?

1332
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,400
Zumo has the quibi Rokus.

1333
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:32,280
These sentences will grow and grow like somebody gaining maiden names from divorces.

1334
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,020
Oh, yeah.

1335
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,160
Like the sentences won't make any sense.

1336
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,320
It's in the contract, though, that you have to keep saying quibi.

1337
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,140
I can never be a legacy thing.

1338
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,720
You have to.

1339
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,300
They got me.

1340
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,500
I did download Zumo because AW had a lot of commercials for it the other day.

1341
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,800
And, you know, they have the fifth element.

1342
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,280
I like that movie.

1343
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,180
But then there were also Zumo originals.

1344
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,260
And I'm like, no.

1345
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,820
God, how can anywhere have originals?

1346
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,060
Haven't you learned originals are the way to bankruptcy?

1347
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:01,520
Nobody wants originals.

1348
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,680
Don't stop making originals.

1349
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,880
Because the only chance anybody has to get employed in this town is when some company

1350
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,540
thinks they want to do originals for four months and then bails on the entire thing.

1351
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah.

1352
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:11,200
But.

1353
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,160
And about you, reboot is real.

1354
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,140
It happened.

1355
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,040
God.

1356
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,580
Yeah.

1357
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,580
Spectrum original.

1358
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,460
Spectrum original.

1359
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,300
This what I learned about Zumo.

1360
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,180
Fifty percent.

1361
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,360
It was started by the company that owned MySpace.

1362
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,880
And then it was bought.

1363
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,680
Then Justin Timberlake on MySpace.

1364
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,520
Huh?

1365
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,220
Didn't Justin Timberlake buy some of MySpace or was that part of it?

1366
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,240
It's been sold off after that.

1367
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,660
Maybe he suggests to drop the my it's cleaner.

1368
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,720
Yeah.

1369
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,440
The owner of Zumo is 50 percent

1370
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,720
Tom Cast and 50 percent charter.

1371
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,420
Who is Spectrum?

1372
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,160
OK, I've lost the ability to track this.

1373
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,580
So the difference is so it's a half and half.

1374
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,480
It's a half and half.

1375
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,040
How much more Zumo information do you have?

1376
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,380
You're the first person ever to see no one listening has ever heard the word Zumo.

1377
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:58,820
No.

1378
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,700
I well, first off, we're assuming that this is how you say it.

1379
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,380
I didn't catch how they said it in the commercial.

1380
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,260
Zuma, Dar.

1381
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,860
You pronounce it Zuma Darian.

1382
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,440
You pronounce it Zuma Darian.

1383
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,020
If you watch it, you're a Zuma Darian.

1384
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,200
It's more Marvel Cosmic stuff.

1385
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,080
It's a big mess.

1386
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,720
I don't understand Zumo.

1387
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,580
Zumo.

1388
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,960
I've been following the X-Men nonsense since 1992.

1389
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,840
I know 2B and I'm happy with it.

1390
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,560
I know 2B.

1391
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,480
I know Free V.

1392
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,340
And that's what I like.

1393
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,300
That's what I watch.

1394
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,060
Zumo announced it will begin producing its own original content,

1395
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,460
starting with Bold Soul Studios White Elephant.

1396
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,080
So there's been a Zumo original film called White Elephant.

1397
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,320
Assuming that got finished.

1398
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,160
White Elephant.

1399
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,180
I wouldn't assume anything.

1400
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,700
I don't know if it did.

1401
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,980
Yeah, Zumo's not finishing their originals.

1402
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,120
Disney isn't building any of these.

1403
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,520
I don't think they did.

1404
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,760
I can't find any proof that there's a movie called White Elephant that exists.

1405
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,120
Well, it might be.

1406
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,820
It might be above Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1407
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,280
You don't know what's going to be in there.

1408
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,340
We might set up filming it back there.

1409
00:53:59,620 --> 00:53:59,980
Wait a minute.

1410
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,740
No, wait a minute.

1411
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,280
It says available now.

1412
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,060
This is the shadiest poster I've ever seen.

1413
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:05,560
What?

1414
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,920
This is like a flyer for a local Christmas.

1415
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,520
It's on all of them.

1416
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,880
It's on Zumo and Voodoo and Prime Video and Tubi.

1417
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:19,980
So if you're keeping track, White Elephant is a Zumo that's also on Tubi and Voodoo.

1418
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,440
White Elephant is like we what we where I was growing up,

1419
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,760
everyone called it Pollyanna, where you're like, get a name of who you're buying gift for.

1420
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,260
That's a new East Coast thing too.

1421
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,000
I've never heard that.

1422
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,560
Pollyanna?

1423
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,400
Yeah, I haven't heard Pollyanna now.

1424
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,440
Wow, that's a new one.

1425
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,880
Pollyanna is a white elephant.

1426
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,340
White Elephant is a Zumo and a Tubi and a Voodoo.

1427
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,500
What you what you would do in in like elementary school.

1428
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,940
No, I know what it is.

1429
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,880
I'm saying I've never heard that name before.

1430
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,440
I think it's going back.

1431
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,720
It's like, you know, when when I when we first knew each other,

1432
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,600
I called an Ottoman Hasek.

1433
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,420
Yeah, I remember that.

1434
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,020
It's a very old, old term.

1435
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,440
Look at this other poster for White Elephant, where it's a bunch of like preteens.

1436
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,480
And it says White Elephant, this Christmas, they will open more than presents.

1437
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,340
What?

1438
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,720
What are they opening?

1439
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,660
We're all in that photo.

1440
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,540
We're in the movie.

1441
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,760
This is like the shining photo.

1442
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,140
When did they film this?

1443
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,780
How did you get my image?

1444
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,700
New Year's.

1445
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,180
Scott's a human bodied into a white elephant.

1446
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,460
I like that Scott described this as teens, though.

1447
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,240
Some of them are, I think.

1448
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,860
I mean, some have facial hair.

1449
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,220
You're right.

1450
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,880
One thing's for certain, we've always been the groundskeepers.

1451
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,700
OK, too many of them are too young looking to have that phrase above it.

1452
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,000
And then it also says that White Elephant is what does this say?

1453
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,100
The link is in our bio if you want to watch on your computer or phone.

1454
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,480
Otherwise, Zumo is available on your Magnavox, Phillips, Sanyo or Vizio

1455
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,580
Channel Plus powered by Zumo.

1456
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,440
This is how does anyone wonder why media is collapsing right now?

1457
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,520
These look at the sentences they've given us to read to put.

1458
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,340
This is the like we are all solving Indiana Jones level.

1459
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:55,940
Oh, yeah.

1460
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,040
It's like a hunts and mysteries

1461
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,920
boxes in order to watch the movie White Elephant with no recognizable stars.

1462
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,100
It's very funny when it's like, you know, small operations like us

1463
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,940
were like, hey, good news, I got podcast to write at such and such website.

1464
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,100
And these giant companies

1465
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:21,340
do not seem to have that same impetus to like, hey, make it less confusing.

1466
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,260
This is I've used the phrase for a long time, content moat.

1467
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,720
A lot.

1468
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,580
Most shows that come out, you in order to watch it,

1469
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,520
you have to cross the content moat.

1470
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,960
And the people at the companies believe that people are willing to cross the content.

1471
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,020
Even if it's free, that's why they have something like free V.

1472
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,040
They got to say like free put free in it.

1473
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,000
Otherwise, they were actually very smart with that.

1474
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,680
But all these other places like, well, it's very easy to watch the go 90 content.

1475
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,800
All you need to do is enter your out out.

1476
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,000
Everyone has left.

1477
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,100
Yeah, he's flooded out of the building as fast as they can.

1478
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,500
If it's something other than turning on a box that's in my house and it's on already.

1479
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,780
Yeah, you're out.

1480
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,500
It's just falling over like the kitchen table, falling out of it.

1481
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,640
If anyone's like, oh, that sounds really cool.

1482
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,640
How do I watch it?

1483
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,360
It's just really quickly trying for us to like, here's the episode.

1484
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,080
Here's the page.

1485
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,960
This we have a very clean system, very clean.

1486
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,320
We have a system that is much cleaner than Zumo and then Voodoo.

1487
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,540
Yeah, we're very lucky.

1488
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,100
Yeah, why podcasts are we're working a little bit.

1489
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,660
That's right.

1490
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,060
Yeah.

1491
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,860
Mm hmm.

1492
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,480
Oh, you know, this is we're all breaking.

1493
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,660
What can we get?

1494
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,360
Let's get off of Zumo and get on Asha.

1495
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,740
Well, Asha's coming.

1496
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,600
Asha's coming.

1497
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,580
Asha's coming.

1498
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,200
The star movie.

1499
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,800
She's the star of the star.

1500
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,900
Asha from Wish.

1501
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,980
The star.

1502
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,580
Is Wish a star?

1503
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,320
I think Wish is the name of the star.

1504
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:42,860
Okay.

1505
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,160
So who's Asha?

1506
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,780
The star of the star.

1507
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,180
The star of the star movie?

1508
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,600
Asha is the star, but Asha isn't a star.

1509
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,820
They're on first base.

1510
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,100
I told you that already.

1511
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,720
Third base.

1512
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,660
Some of that classic.

1513
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,820
I don't.

1514
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,680
Asha's coming.

1515
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,040
Ahsoka is coming.

1516
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,560
Ahsoka is coming.

1517
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,740
Ahsoka's scenes in Star Tours.

1518
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,460
All right.

1519
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,620
At this point, that's something.

1520
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,540
Okay, Star Tours, is it just that she's going to like appear in between when,

1521
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,720
like, there's a transmission or is there actually a new level?

1522
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,000
I think it's scenes.

1523
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,740
So there's going to be a new like planet.

1524
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,060
Maybe a scene from the show.

1525
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,420
Yeah, planet maybe.

1526
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,240
Because I read something that made it seem like, well,

1527
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,500
there's just going to be an Ahsoka projection once in a while instead of like Yoda or BB-8.

1528
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,220
Sounds like.

1529
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,140
Sounds right.

1530
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,140
Uh-huh.

1531
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,000
Sounds easier.

1532
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,420
It's very easy, yeah.

1533
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,840
You got her for the day and the volume, you may as well get a couple shots of her.

1534
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:43,800
The coverage is, the verbiage, I think, at these panels was so vague that were,

1535
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,120
the coverage should be the same.

1536
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,260
It should be one press release.

1537
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,740
And it says, this is definitely happening.

1538
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,560
This we're looking into.

1539
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,320
But then you, but then now they've showed their cards.

1540
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:56,720
Yeah, yeah.

1541
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Now we're not getting fooled.

1542
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,300
They want to fool us.

1543
00:58:59,380 --> 00:58:59,820
Yeah.

1544
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,340
Leave it all, to leave you think, you're so confused that, all right,

1545
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,700
I think, I think that Indiana Jones is coming to Animal Kingdom.

1546
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,120
So, for sure.

1547
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,000
So therefore, I'm going to buy a ticket to the Honda Center when they announce the date.

1548
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,040
And then, so then Daddy Tomorrow says, it's September 4th, 2029.

1549
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:29,660
And then I can go, yeah, I'm so glad I paid hundreds of dollars, plane tickets,

1550
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,940
hotel tickets, D23 gold membership, then a separate ticket,

1551
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,320
then a bus ticket to the Honda Center so that I could yell when a date was said.

1552
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,480
Well, there is, uh.

1553
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,120
I think I'm being cured of my Disney interest within this episode.

1554
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,680
Wow.

1555
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,220
You're the fever.

1556
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,780
I think it's all, all the, it's all leaving my system.

1557
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,760
The fever's breaking.

1558
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,740
Finally, 30 years later, 35 years later.

1559
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:00,260
OK, we have to somehow swing this into things that are a little more positive.

1560
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:00,520
Yeah.

1561
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,380
This is, though this one is not earth shattering, obviously, because it's happened before,

1562
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,280
but not in Epcot.

1563
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:14,820
It is good news and funny timing also that Soren over California will be returning to

1564
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,440
Epcot.

1565
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,760
Funny announced just right after our episode about it.

1566
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,960
Jason, I feel like you did a good you're welcome.

1567
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,360
That's where you took credit for on our behalf as you should.

1568
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,540
Strange that nice acknowledgement, though.

1569
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:35,060
It is funny that, like, at this point, it is now like the classic mode of the like.

1570
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,400
It is old school.

1571
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,640
And I like that they can do this.

1572
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,300
I like that they can put California in.

1573
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:46,040
Sometimes you'll see people say, can you not trade out old star tours?

1574
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:51,060
And you can't because you need wrecks, you know, you can't just like suddenly put in

1575
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,360
unless you like give all that dialogue.

1576
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,640
You'd have to give C3PO.

1577
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,860
I don't think you're you would just have to perma make one cabin, but then everybody would

1578
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,440
want to pick that anyway.

1579
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,840
Soren, you can trade in and out.

1580
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,480
And it's cool that they do it and go back to the old school in which we had fun talking

1581
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,440
about the other day.

1582
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:14,600
Coming back at California Adventure in 2024, they didn't bring it back.

1583
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,160
I think we said on the episode for the food and wine back a couple of times so far.

1584
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,480
Yeah, yeah, they cycle it enough.

1585
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,900
Seasons of the fine occasionally shown as well.

1586
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,580
Oh, really?

1587
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,020
And that's still that's Jeremy Irons himself.

1588
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,540
Oh, wow.

1589
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,040
I forgot what you did that one in the near future.

1590
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:31,360
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,640
But so that's the the Soren announcement.

1592
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,260
However, something else happened at destination D23

1593
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,880
that was not part of this announcement panel.

1594
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,300
There was a separate panel.

1595
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:50,940
We got two little flag downs on Elon Musk's ex

1596
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,840
from Ryan Bray and also Chris at Ben Talk,

1597
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,040
indicating that also very strange timing.

1598
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,700
As we put out this episode where the big controversy is discussed,

1599
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,360
Eisner Gate, that apparently at a panel,

1600
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,400
it was discussed whether or not the golfer is Michael Eisner.

1601
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,860
And the people on stage said it is not Michael Eisner.

1602
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,520
I I almost I'm so skeptical of this because of the timing.

1603
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,500
I don't think these people are probably telling the truth.

1604
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,320
And it probably is right.

1605
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,140
And I'm not skeptical that it wouldn't be him.

1606
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:24,480
Sure.

1607
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,020
I'm just skeptical that this happened a day after two days.

1608
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,680
It's a little strange.

1609
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,200
I'm trying to get a handle on what.

1610
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,980
And if somehow anybody listening to the show was was part of it

1611
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:38,100
or who saw any of the back and forth with Jim Hill, which has occurred

1612
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,820
much as happens just since the posting of this episode several days ago

1613
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,160
as we record this.

1614
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,300
But I do.

1615
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,740
Yeah, Mike, I've I don't want to color what you're coming in with

1616
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,260
with this.

1617
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,700
I what I feel on your end is like, who are these people?

1618
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,120
What is that?

1619
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,720
What was this panel?

1620
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,460
What was this?

1621
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,560
It is that is what I feel.

1622
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,760
I feel like you're trying to debunk the debunkers.

1623
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,020
It's just the timing of it is insane.

1624
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,160
Obviously, like we like that episode influenced it.

1625
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:06,700
Maybe.

1626
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,300
But I don't look at let's name the names.

1627
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
They're archivists.

1628
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:09,580
Right.

1629
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,260
This is a panel called Down the Rabbit Hole.

1630
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,180
The Disney you didn't know.

1631
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,280
It was moderated by Kevin M.

1632
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,920
Kern and Stephen Vagnini.

1633
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,580
Two people said it.

1634
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,600
So that makes me more likely got two sources on it.

1635
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,940
To believe it, because it's just, you know, somebody can be.

1636
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:25,940
Ah, isn't that funny?

1637
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,820
I'm somebody said this thing in a panel.

1638
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,100
I thought, yeah, I mean, trying to get us get a rise out of us.

1639
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,420
Right.

1640
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,920
I do believe I'm not I'm not saying I don't believe it.

1641
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,620
I do believe it.

1642
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,240
I just believe Ryan and Chris.

1643
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,340
But Kevin and Stephen, you have some questions.

1644
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,200
Yes, I have some questions.

1645
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:40,620
OK.

1646
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,220
So but I was just like, oh, is it anybody archive this?

1647
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,460
Because I started looking last night.

1648
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,480
There is not a video.

1649
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,140
I made sure to find out that this was a real panel.

1650
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,300
Yeah, yeah, I looked it up.

1651
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:51,400
Yeah, yeah.

1652
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,000
Real panel.

1653
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,940
Because what are we getting out of all this lately?

1654
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,920
Is the need to vet and do our homework.

1655
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:02,060
So as long as we all do that, you don't get these falsehoods that go.

1656
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:02,620
The exciting.

1657
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,800
Obviously, I want it to be Michael Eisner as a golfer.

1658
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,320
That's true.

1659
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,380
But the exciting thing is like,

1660
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,400
it does feel like the influence is there.

1661
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,700
Maybe I'm crazy.

1662
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,320
Maybe I'm full of myself.

1663
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,240
But that's days later.

1664
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,040
This is we are a rare piece of media that had just come out

1665
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,440
that is poking holes in this long held Disney urban myth.

1666
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,940
And if we get the official proof, we get proof that we all sign off on,

1667
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,980
we'll forever impact that story.

1668
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,460
This fact is out there as fact.

1669
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,940
Eisner is in the IMDb for Soren.

1670
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,200
Right.

1671
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:36,500
Right.

1672
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:40,480
And if we we podcast the ride, which often is nonsense,

1673
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,140
we will end up being the official source that closes the door

1674
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,580
or opens the door to a glorious future where we know it's Eisner

1675
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,080
and we celebrate it.

1676
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,220
I think it's good either way.

1677
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,420
But we need to we're firming it up.

1678
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,240
That's the point.

1679
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:54,720
No, I.

1680
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,640
There's streaming down Mike's face and he keeps whispering.

1681
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,940
It's still real to me.

1682
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,380
Damn it.

1683
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,320
The song Fix You is playing as I cry

1684
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,320
knowing that he's not hitting the golf ball at me.

1685
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,740
Yeah, well, we're going to we're close to firming it up.

1686
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,120
I agree.

1687
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,900
It would be nice to.

1688
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,780
I believe you came before we started recording.

1689
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,100
You're like, does anyone have video of the panel?

1690
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,780
You're like, you're trying to figure it out.

1691
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,300
It's the proximity to the episode release.

1692
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,620
That's really what it is.

1693
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,700
I just it sounds even though obviously people listen to the show.

1694
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,000
It's still sometimes it's hard to believe.

1695
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,640
Yeah, that it would get into like the official Disney convention

1696
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,840
or something that quickly.

1697
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,560
That's really what I what's more about.

1698
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,060
Well, but discussing bug main theories and maybe it's a little bit of simulation.

1699
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,820
But yeah, yeah, I liked all the people.

1700
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,260
They were like, what did they know?

1701
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,700
What a podcast or I know.

1702
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,480
And it's like, well, hmm, we'll never tell.

1703
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,020
Well, you know, both you guys were the ones who brought it up.

1704
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,660
So just asking questions.

1705
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,980
Like, oh, we were just asking questions.

1706
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,340
I accepted it like an idiot, like an idiot, like a blind idiot.

1707
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,360
Well, look, you know, you shouldn't feel as as did I, by the way,

1708
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,310
until we started looking at it just like, you know,

1709
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:08,220
it is very influential to like

1710
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,940
start to actually do research on a ride for an episode.

1711
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,800
And I have my go tos, you know, Jim Hill among them.

1712
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,080
Yeah.

1713
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,420
Like, who can we trust with some of this info?

1714
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:21,920
And when you're looking for a piece of info and it's not on one of the five

1715
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,460
trustworthy ones, right.

1716
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:28,020
And you're on a lot of like, you know, mouse gloves dot heart.

1717
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,200
It's half of it broken.

1718
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,920
Angel's fire 2003 just demolished by pop up ads for companies

1719
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,180
that went out of business in 2005.

1720
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,700
Yeah, just can't even if you can manage to read, if you can manage to read.

1721
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,780
But then you're like, well, they do have like a perfect scan of an old press release

1722
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,060
or an old memo that doesn't exist.

1723
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,100
There's one thing that makes you think they're trustworthy.

1724
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,900
But it's yeah, that's what it's about is asking questions.

1725
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,140
And by the way, this is the other here's my little

1726
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,920
I'm not going to declare this official yet,

1727
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,120
especially because as we record this and maybe it will have been cleared up

1728
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,620
by the time you the listeners hearing it, Jim Hill has weighed in.

1729
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,840
I took the initiative.

1730
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,360
I tweeted.

1731
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,140
I said, let's bring in the big guns.

1732
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,980
Jim Hill Media is Michael Eisner, the golfer on Sorn.

1733
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,220
And he started thinking about it,

1734
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,280
and then realized the connection to

1735
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,680
Rick Rothschild, who was a longtime Imagineer, somebody

1736
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,960
part of I believe I believe this is the director of the ride film.

1737
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,720
Yeah, I think it's not one of the primary.

1738
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,180
Yeah, definitely one of the primary people putting the ride together.

1739
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:37,200
But I think also he may have literally been in the helicopter directing that shot.

1740
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,680
So that will I think if we hear back from Rick Rothschild via Jim Hill,

1741
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,820
yeah, seal the deal on Eisner Golf Gate.

1742
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,240
Right.

1743
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:49,660
But I'm just excited he's involved in because I've heard that name.

1744
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,340
I've heard interviews with him where, by the way, he did not mention

1745
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,860
directing Michael Eisner as the golfer in Soren.

1746
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,100
But this is the guy I think he might have thought of the premise of Captain EO.

1747
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,500
Oh, that is who is now part of it or at least like led the initiative.

1748
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,140
I think when it became Michael Jackson's coming in, we need ideas.

1749
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,000
He led the team, right?

1750
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,800
Gave him the three out of which he was picked.

1751
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,260
Alien encounter is a big part of.

1752
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,640
So I love that this guy, this is dangling out there.

1753
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,240
There's a question that he needs to answer in his inbox.

1754
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1755
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,620
And that's and it's just a matter of you do inboxes fill up.

1756
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,000
Wow.

1757
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,420
And as he actually busy and employed in

1758
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,020
because Jim said he's part of these flyover.

1759
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,940
Yes, yes.

1760
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,720
That's I was excited to learn that too.

1761
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1762
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:36,780
That's interesting.

1763
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,440
And somebody brought Soren carried over to the other.

1764
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,480
He just stole the idea.

1765
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,900
So I took it with him.

1766
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,700
Why not?

1767
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,740
So I think that's when we can maybe when we get the news on this,

1768
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,060
if we hear back from Rick, that is the but I got to say it's not

1769
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,300
it's not looking good.

1770
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,800
Jim Hill himself said he has concerns.

1771
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,260
I would certainly bet that it's not now at this point.

1772
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,700
That's the money I'm putting.

1773
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,480
Someone's got the call sheet.

1774
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,920
The next question I would have, which might be impossible to find,

1775
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:05,720
is I would love to track down where the rumor started.

1776
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,360
That's very interesting to me.

1777
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,640
Who started that rumor?

1778
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,060
He's never said it himself.

1779
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,780
Yeah.

1780
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,560
Somebody's made it up once.

1781
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,560
Was it a misremembering of watching him promoting

1782
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:21,380
the book camp did somehow something about him promoting a summer camp book?

1783
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,260
Not I wonder.

1784
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,500
That's so interesting, because like it's seems a random.

1785
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,900
It's a really it's a really specific rumor.

1786
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,100
And that's almost the reason to believe it, because why not?

1787
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:31,500
Right.

1788
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,940
And California Adventure was very his era.

1789
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,520
And yeah, you could see I've you know, when we did like a little straw poll,

1790
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,580
do you believe this or not?

1791
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,980
I think most people just felt it to be true because it seemed like

1792
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,120
something Eisner would do.

1793
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:44,900
Yeah.

1794
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,580
So, you know, anyway, I hope I'm not.

1795
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,740
I hope this isn't a big Santa Claus isn't real for everyone.

1796
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,660
I'm not trying.

1797
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,360
It's not about bumming everyone out.

1798
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,320
I just I I want to know the other way to.

1799
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,840
Yeah, no, you're right.

1800
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,700
So we'll see.

1801
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,560
We will see.

1802
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,280
What are before we get to what I think is the biggest news?

1803
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,080
Anything else?

1804
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,880
Any other grab bag we want to be?

1805
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,240
Pirates of the Caribbean lounge.

1806
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:10,620
Oh, yeah.

1807
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,540
Bar thing coming to the Magic Kingdom.

1808
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,640
With very unspecific concept art.

1809
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,340
It was a parrot leaning into a room full of rowdy pirates.

1810
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,340
And I'm like, where the where the guests sit?

1811
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,900
This doesn't look like a bar that I could go yet.

1812
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,600
Yeah, it's yeah.

1813
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,120
I like I heard I'm trying to remember which source I heard this from,

1814
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,920
because I want I have a new guy I like.

1815
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,140
I want to say of sources.

1816
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,140
So I like the way do we have a new a new trustworthy

1817
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,000
so far, there's a OK, there's a guy.

1818
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,640
He looks like he's 23 years old, 22 years old.

1819
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,020
His name is Braden.

1820
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:49,240
I don't know if you watch him and I got to find his channel.

1821
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,860
Braden, all 22 year old fact, all 22 year olds are named to Braden.

1822
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,800
Yeah, all young people are braided.

1823
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,740
Mickey Views and he's got a lot of subscribers.

1824
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,400
OK, Mickey Views and he kind of does like a daily show, little YouTube video.

1825
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,200
He's very young.

1826
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,840
I've seen his tweets before.

1827
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,900
And he predicted a lot of this stuff before it was announced.

1828
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,460
He see he was like tweeted very kind of like he tweeted

1829
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,640
like Zootopia coming to Animal Kingdom, but not the land or it's not.

1830
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,100
He tweeted something along those lines.

1831
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,720
He knew the bears announced them that we're going to get to.

1832
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,760
And I was like, and I think maybe he was the one who said like.

1833
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,220
There is a big push in Imagineering now to do like bars,

1834
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,000
restaurant type things next to classic attractions.

1835
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,720
Or just expand them out, which I think is what's happening.

1836
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,960
A haunted mansion in Disneyland.

1837
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,380
It's not a it's not a restaurant.

1838
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,260
Shop, but it's a little shop.

1839
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,660
But you're expanding the grounds of it a little more, which I think we're all

1840
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,520
totally into.

1841
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah.

1842
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,880
I mean, obviously is the first one that did this.

1843
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:47,620
But sure.

1844
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:50,700
So, yeah, in theory, I mean, I like a bar better than a store.

1845
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,520
But yes, if we're heading in this direction, I think I heard somebody say

1846
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,860
Haunted Mansion restaurant in Florida is on the table, maybe.

1847
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:04,280
But so I like where they're going with this, but I don't know that this is the

1848
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,960
ultimate this pirates is the ultimate version of what I could imagine.

1849
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,240
Yeah, I have to see.

1850
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,820
I mean, animatronics being involved in a bar is good news.

1851
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:13,660
Yeah, yeah.

1852
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:14,660
Yeah, I don't know.

1853
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,800
Yeah, we need more information, I'd say.

1854
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:17,360
Yeah.

1855
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,160
I mean, I think there is a desire for them.

1856
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,940
There's a hunger from the public.

1857
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,140
Well, you want we've said this many times.

1858
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:27,360
You want to eat and drink near one of your favorite rides.

1859
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,980
That is what people want.

1860
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:33,520
The Hollywood Tower Hotel bar that was like about to be built in Florida.

1861
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,760
I think they were concerned it would just cause too much back

1862
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,320
or just be too much of a mess people wise.

1863
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,400
But like they're very good with intimacy, but they they.

1864
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:44,940
Huh?

1865
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,960
I said, make it bigger.

1866
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:46,680
Make it bigger.

1867
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,540
Yeah, you got to you got to somehow simulate intimacy while making it bigger.

1868
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:57,100
Like those princess halls that are like a trick where the the meet and greets,

1869
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,520
where you meet the princesses.

1870
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,660
There's like you seem like you're just going into one,

1871
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,560
but there's really like six or seven.

1872
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,620
They should have built three cantinas that size is size and galaxy's edge.

1873
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,360
It's like Smuggler's Run that there's there's so many cabins.

1874
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:11,740
Yeah.

1875
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,160
So then you still got a feeling of like, oh, it's cool.

1876
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,320
A little tight space, but there's more capacity.

1877
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:17,820
Yeah.

1878
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,700
Three cantinas is a very good idea.

1879
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,400
Yeah, I just don't know why that to me.

1880
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,320
I don't know what they're doing.

1881
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,520
I don't know if it's I don't think it's hard to get into now,

1882
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,340
but it's still I think it's packed usually.

1883
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:26,720
Yeah.

1884
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,460
So like, I don't know why stuff like that.

1885
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,060
I don't know that that small budget, the kind of stuff that is

1886
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,600
bumming us out about all these announcements.

1887
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,260
Yeah.

1888
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:40,060
So like this, I will say, is a much cheaper way to get us a little more excited.

1889
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,560
You build shit like a place you can drink near a ride and we'll go,

1890
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,000
oh, I want to go drink with my favorite ride.

1891
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,480
Like I will.

1892
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,960
So yeah, so I do like that trend if it continues.

1893
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,460
Yeah.

1894
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,120
Yeah.

1895
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,220
I don't know if this is the ultimate pirate.

1896
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,260
Pirate.

1897
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
What else grab bag or do we?

1898
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:00,620
What do you know?

1899
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,460
What else is in here?

1900
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,340
There's a couple of little things that I don't care about.

1901
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,820
If we don't care about, let's talk about the big one.

1902
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,900
If nobody can think of it, then I think let's.

1903
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,100
I have a little list, but it doesn't.

1904
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:11,660
I don't care.

1905
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,420
Yeah, I think we mentioned.

1906
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,100
All right.

1907
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,700
Country Bears.

1908
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,640
Country Bears is the big country bears.

1909
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,200
The big one.

1910
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,200
This is a win.

1911
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,200
I think I hope so, because as Brayden said,

1912
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:29,820
and I believe Brayden, my new guy, believe Brayden.

1913
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:34,540
I knew this thing was has been on the chopping block for years.

1914
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,180
This was a fight to keep the country bears

1915
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,340
it all in the park.

1916
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,100
And I 100 percent believe that.

1917
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,020
And the idea that they're going to put new robots in, I think,

1918
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,300
like they're going to change them from the old school robots.

1919
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,520
You think all of them?

1920
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:51,640
I think so.

1921
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,860
I think that's what someone said.

1922
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,760
We'll see if that happens.

1923
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,220
But they're going to make them the newer.

1924
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,740
Disney didn't say it.

1925
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,840
Somebody claims that maybe that's not true.

1926
01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,180
I don't know.

1927
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,680
And I don't know if Brayden claimed that,

1928
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,380
but somebody claimed that they're going to make them

1929
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,240
the newer version of robots that are new.

1930
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:08,200
If it's fully new, all new country bears, that's a major victory.

1931
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,660
But I wonder about that.

1932
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,320
Maybe that's not maybe that's not going to happen.

1933
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,140
I mean, they can redress them.

1934
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,520
They redress them for the seasonal show.

1935
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,660
Well, I can't remember what the there's still like the old.

1936
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,480
Was it the hydraulic animatronics that have like fluid that need fluid to work?

1937
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,740
Oh, the fluid that sometimes looks like blood.

1938
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:26,180
Yeah.

1939
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,040
So so those are hard, much harder to maintain than the new animatronics.

1940
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,260
Somebody claims that it's new.

1941
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,000
I don't know if that Disney has that confirmed that.

1942
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,660
So we'll see.

1943
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:40,980
But just investing any money and keeping the bear characters there is absolutely

1944
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:45,080
the poster win completely tells you that it is the characters,

1945
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,280
which makes me think they would just use at least some of the old ones.

1946
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,300
But that is good.

1947
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:50,880
Isn't it good?

1948
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,000
Like it felt like they need to get ahead of that.

1949
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,180
So we don't start thinking like, you know, yeah, yeah.

1950
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,840
Is there like a new like a cool new bear?

1951
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:03,280
It might remind you of Lil Nas X for the Old Town Road,

1952
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,060
which it wouldn't be bad if they added him with the old characters.

1953
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:11,320
But yeah, if it's like if it's like we're going to make them look like the kid

1954
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,060
in the country bears movie, the bear kid and like, OK, good.

1955
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,660
It's the same characters that are funny and that we like.

1956
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:23,640
There's one that they renamed, so it doesn't have the name that's somewhat problematic.

1957
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,300
That's right.

1958
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,660
He is now named Romeo McGraw.

1959
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,780
Which is fine.

1960
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,500
He's got the hair.

1961
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,300
That's cool.

1962
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,720
Doesn't somebody else have a new nickname?

1963
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,460
The dude is that one of the other characters they kind of renamed as well.

1964
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,240
Yeah, I saw that.

1965
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,420
Yeah, I was a little confused by that.

1966
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,580
But maybe that's something to do with the song of the songs.

1967
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,780
The character you formerly know as Dixieland Johnny is now the dude.

1968
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:46,780
Better.

1969
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,680
Yes, better.

1970
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,600
So it's Disney.

1971
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,120
They're going to do Disney songs, but they're going to new versions of Disney songs.

1972
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,720
Do we is it fully?

1973
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,000
That's what it sounds like.

1974
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:57,780
It's all.

1975
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,500
Yeah, it's all old.

1976
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,320
Well, not old, but like it could be let it go or something.

1977
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,720
But it sounds like it's all going to be country versions.

1978
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,880
Bluegrass country versions.

1979
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,840
So this is maybe this is their calculation, maybe of keeping it relevant

1980
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,560
and making like a young like a child understand.

1981
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,080
Yes.

1982
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,640
So that's I think how they sold it to the money people.

1983
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,600
It's also it's very telling that they call it that the new show will be called

1984
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,820
Country Bear Musical Jamboree.

1985
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:30,640
It's like it's almost like if OK, if you are a modern six year old,

1986
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,360
you've never heard the word jamboree in your life.

1987
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:33,600
Yes.

1988
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,760
So let's put the word music in there so that it is clear

1989
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,740
that this is a thing where songs are sung.

1990
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,360
Yes.

1991
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:43,160
So and it's it's good that they didn't add four more words.

1992
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,840
That's also a win, I think.

1993
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,040
Yeah, just one.

1994
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,380
Yeah, that is a real victory.

1995
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:47,820
Right.

1996
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,260
Yeah.

1997
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,100
Simplicity to that.

1998
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,640
Country Bears, some might call in talking bears

1999
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:58,500
that aren't human, who presents like it could be.

2000
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,300
It could be worse.

2001
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:03,660
So the bears then them doing again, it has to happen, I guess.

2002
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,620
So maybe that's not there's a chance, I guess it doesn't happen.

2003
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,620
But it seems like this is progress, though.

2004
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,960
This one feels like it's pretty close.

2005
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,520
They didn't say it's possible.

2006
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:12,960
Yeah.

2007
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,780
He said it's happening.

2008
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:18,700
Now, there's people in our little social media world, I think,

2009
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,240
who they hear this announcement and they go,

2010
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,820
oh, Mike must be upset because he loves the country bears.

2011
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,340
And yet in the original is getting changed.

2012
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,940
But there but in tandem with that, there is a piece of news

2013
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,460
that I think 100 percent gets you on board.

2014
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,020
Well, yeah.

2015
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,160
So so, yeah, up until this piece of news

2016
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,980
you're talking about, I'm a realist about this,

2017
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,180
that I know this has been on the chopping block.

2018
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,600
There was a rumor for a while it was going to turn into a full

2019
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,300
like Toy Story musical review, which may have been a honey pot.

2020
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,420
That may have been a trick to try to catch a leaker.

2021
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,340
That was confusing because bears like honey.

2022
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,880
Oh, that is true.

2023
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,000
I really could say that it may have been a false fly.

2024
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:10,080
It may have been a trick where they fed it to people to see who like, OK,

2025
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,580
we were able to report that as I don't know this again.

2026
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,700
We're this message for jargon.

2027
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,660
That's there was that like WDW patriot.

2028
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,360
That was never the case, but it was fed to some people

2029
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,780
because they were trying to suss out who was leaking stuff.

2030
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,360
You got to say, because you you misheard it and you thought are people

2031
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,460
being fed honey and I wasn't invited.

2032
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,100
Look, my head's already caught on.

2033
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,340
But I brought this from home.

2034
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,480
I'm sure, though, all of this stuff, there's so much bureaucracy at the parks.

2035
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,760
There are 200 versions of everything just sitting in a drawer.

2036
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,420
Yeah.

2037
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,020
And I somebody said I saw somebody online say,

2038
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:56,140
this is an idea that's been kicking around for longer than five years.

2039
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:01,100
I've been kicking around for 10 years or something to try to, you know, freshen the show up.

2040
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:05,980
So, yeah, no, I am going to hopefully the new show is weird.

2041
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,660
What I like about the old show is that it's weird.

2042
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,080
You know, there are bizarre song choices.

2043
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,940
And yes.

2044
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:16,080
So hopefully they put a it's still a little weird, hopefully.

2045
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,280
But the thing that was revealed, they did not announce this on stage.

2046
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,660
You had to know a certain man's face to do.

2047
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:27,460
They feel like the general audience will not know this face.

2048
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,800
They felt like maybe this man is not known to a general audience.

2049
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,100
But on a couple of social media, they posted clips of musicians

2050
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,760
playing the new song, like a new version of the Bear Necessities.

2051
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,820
And in that clip was revealed Mac McAnally,

2052
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,580
who is Jimmy Buffett's right hand man.

2053
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,700
Rest in peace, Jimmy.

2054
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,780
Mac is going to be singing.

2055
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,240
It sounds looks like he's singing to do in the.

2056
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:52,540
Yeah.

2057
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,860
So he's going to be like, it was like he's doing big hours.

2058
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,460
You do, Henry, who knows what voice he's doing.

2059
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:02,240
But Mac is involved in this, which is pretty great.

2060
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,840
And he is also like a hit.

2061
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,740
Like he has written hits for people that's hung back where I come from.

2062
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,100
Yes.

2063
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,240
And him would do.

2064
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,140
Yes.

2065
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,340
So that is a pretty big feather in this new attractions camp.

2066
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,080
Just made for you.

2067
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,340
Simulation buzz buzz.

2068
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,320
It is perfectly.

2069
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:20,780
Yes.

2070
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,920
Another simulationist.

2071
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,740
It's like weirdly news that you might be nervous about.

2072
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:30,720
And then right in the wake of Jimmy's untimely passing.

2073
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,080
And you get this this big Mac news.

2074
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:38,920
Jimmy's last performance was a guest spot in a Mac show.

2075
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,520
He popped up on stage and did the hits.

2076
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,660
And that was over the summer.

2077
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:43,060
Right.

2078
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,060
So and then Mac, I think, is already like, you know,

2079
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,460
he's played a show and paid his tribute.

2080
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:49,920
Yeah.

2081
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,360
And what a crazy what a whirlwind.

2082
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,360
This is now part of the Disney family.

2083
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:54,840
Weird.

2084
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,600
I mean, this is close to the Daniel Roebuck playing Grandpa Monster.

2085
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,140
As far as the simulation.

2086
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:01,960
Yeah.

2087
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,680
Caving in on the characters.

2088
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,640
Oh, if only it was Frank Marshall playing them, doing the voices.

2089
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:08,860
It's possible he's involved.

2090
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,480
We don't know.

2091
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,560
We don't know everything.

2092
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,580
So that is it'll be exciting to see who Mac is voicing in the country bears.

2093
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,180
That's going to be a whole new show.

2094
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:18,560
I don't know.

2095
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,620
Maybe he's just a singing voice.

2096
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:20,760
Maybe he's going to do the care.

2097
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,200
I don't know.

2098
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:21,680
We'll see.

2099
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,880
But the bears being saved is a big victory.

2100
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,320
Yeah, this is a it could be a big probably going to be a big change.

2101
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,300
But the other option is the wrecking ball.

2102
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,760
You know, yes, which I thought was happening for sure.

2103
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,160
Yeah.

2104
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:36,520
Yeah.

2105
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,400
So, yeah.

2106
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,280
Obviously, the bears, I think, are still very popular in Japan.

2107
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,960
They still do their three shows.

2108
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:46,540
You probably get to see the three shows for a long time if it's still popular there.

2109
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,380
So, yeah, I need the ground swell here and maybe I don't know.

2110
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,320
Hopefully this plan helps or just modernizing it helps.

2111
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:53,880
Yeah.

2112
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:59,540
So but I mean, I got to get I got to get to Florida and see which we are going.

2113
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,760
I'm hoping they're not shutting this thing down before.

2114
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:02,660
Oh, that's a good question.

2115
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,080
Why don't they have to?

2116
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,440
I don't think I probably I could maybe the start of the next year I could see it.

2117
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,600
But hopefully maybe this is too new that it's still can see one last

2118
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,800
Jamboree on American soil.

2119
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,360
Hopefully.

2120
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:15,880
Yeah.

2121
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,940
Well, I had a thought about this.

2122
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,220
Well, first of all, I tweeted a joke

2123
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:26,000
that the finale of the show is going to be Rich Bears North of Richmond.

2124
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,840
And, you know, in tribute to the surprise,

2125
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,120
controversial country hit from this year by Oliver Anthony.

2126
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,160
But I do think that, you know, like, you know, there's

2127
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,260
if we're going to if we're going to they said they're going to reflect

2128
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,180
different country styles.

2129
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,620
Yeah.

2130
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,720
And which is a smart thing for its relevance.

2131
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,840
And I think if they want to keep it current, they really got to keep their eyes

2132
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,560
on the charts and on recent country pop cultural impact,

2133
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,740
because it's not just Richmond, North of Richmond that's had a big impact this year.

2134
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,360
I mean, maybe the country song of the year

2135
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,640
might have to be Try That in a Small Town by Jason Aldean.

2136
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,940
Try that in a fair town.

2137
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:10,940
Yeah.

2138
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:14,080
Well, Jason, I've been doing some thinking.

2139
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,220
Oh, my gosh.

2140
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,460
And I because I think I think they're leaving money off

2141
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:22,880
on the table if they don't reflect current country music, current pop culture.

2142
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:27,040
And this great this stirring song about standing up and protecting

2143
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,020
the rights of white people.

2144
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,640
I mean, small town people.

2145
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,160
It's you know, it's it's such an inspiring anthem.

2146
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,660
And yeah, I did a little bit of thinking.

2147
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,320
And this is free of charge, Disney.

2148
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,500
I know I've been critical, but I think this might be a direction that

2149
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,280
that you want to take it.

2150
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,720
Mike, I'm going to hand you a speaker.

2151
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,240
You can cut out the the base.

2152
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:50,840
You're handling.

2153
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:51,240
Yeah.

2154
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,880
Well, as we know, Disney and the people that work there

2155
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,580
are listening very closely to this show, to the Patreon.

2156
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,500
So to the Patreon specifically.

2157
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,440
Well, yeah, this is good because I was wearing on my pitch for the

2158
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,760
it's like Pekos Bill on a date night.

2159
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,940
You go to talk a bar.

2160
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,440
Yeah, keep going.

2161
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,100
I keep going.

2162
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,280
We don't even need to.

2163
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,680
I don't need to cut it out because you've been talking inside

2164
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,840
because it's pouring monsoon.

2165
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:25,000
OK, so here now my pitch for the biggest

2166
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,880
the big song to put in the new Country Bear musical Jamboree.

2167
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,320
Sucker punch some badger on a sidewalk.

2168
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:54,580
Car jack, a woodpecker in a red light.

2169
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,900
Steal a jar from the owner of a honey store.

2170
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:01,280
You think it's cool to keep the mule if you like.

2171
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,780
Cuts out a skunk spitting his snout.

2172
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,800
Stomp on a jug and light it up.

2173
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,080
Yeah, you think you're tough.

2174
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,060
But try that in a fair town.

2175
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,860
See how far you make it up the creek.

2176
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,540
Round here, we love the great outdoors.

2177
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:29,140
If you won't join us, we are going to chase you up a tree.

2178
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,580
I reckon that we will

2179
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,200
try that in a bear town.

2180
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:43,840
Got the gun that killed Max Buffett, Melvin

2181
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,460
that they say woke Disney wants to round up.

2182
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,640
Well, that shit might fly in tomorrow land.

2183
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,820
Good luck.

2184
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,560
Try that in a bear town.

2185
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:59,260
See how fast we claw you in the face.

2186
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,900
That's all I got.

2187
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:05,380
That's Jason didn't write more lyrics, so why should I?

2188
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,540
Yeah, no, please.

2189
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:08,440
Thank you.

2190
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:08,840
Thanks.

2191
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:09,380
Yeah.

2192
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,420
Well, let's get into it.

2193
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,200
All right.

2194
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,760
Well, that was pretty nice from Wendell Albean over there.

2195
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,920
Rhonda Santis has made this his new campaign headquarters.

2196
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,220
This is if he can like, if he can attach to it.

2197
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:26,220
And I was I was my pitch, actually.

2198
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:31,020
I worked with a young, a non woke comedy writer in California

2199
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:34,940
to get my vision that saves the whole thing.

2200
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:35,400
Wow.

2201
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,320
Yeah, that's great.

2202
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,220
And then maybe and that could maybe carry into that.

2203
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,960
Which one?

2204
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,560
Trixie Trixie.

2205
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,340
Yeah, it could go into a speech about open carry laws for big submarine sandwiches.

2206
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,720
Whatever they whatever they want to take it.

2207
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,400
Oh, that's great.

2208
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:53,840
Yeah.

2209
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:54,960
Yeah, that's great.

2210
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,420
I think we have to scrap the plans for whatever they have now.

2211
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,000
I think so.

2212
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,300
I hope they aren't too far down.

2213
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,040
I hope they can get Mac back for another or forget Mac.

2214
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,040
Get Jason in there.

2215
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:03,620
Get Jason.

2216
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,040
Yeah.

2217
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:04,320
Yeah.

2218
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,120
Uh huh.

2219
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:05,680
Wow.

2220
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:06,400
All right.

2221
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,360
Well, I guess you survived.

2222
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,480
Podcast the ride.

2223
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:09,920
Yeah.

2224
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,700
Second gate.

2225
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,240
Now, hey, I know a note of optimism.

2226
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,360
If they can tap into current pop culture.

2227
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,600
Yeah, I think it'll be a that makes me feel better.

2228
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:19,220
Uh huh.

2229
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,140
Hey, if you want to dig even deeper, join us on our VIP

2230
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:26,440

2232
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:31,780
What's coming to that cartoon All Stars to the rescue?

2233
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:36,600
Come into that beloved 1990 anti-drug classic.

2234
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,180
Barely squeaked by by a couple of votes.

2235
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,000
We'll be talking about that.

2236
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,060
And yeah, now all eyes are on the pond or on the on the Honda Center

2237
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:51,360
for the next set of pointing out land that exists.

2238
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,560
Yeah, that technically a theme park company could build stuff there.

2239
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,060
I will not get invited to that.

2240
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,960
Like we never we never get invited to that.

2241
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,640
Unless we start the Disney Daddy's podcast and pretend with some other guys.

2242
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,960
And then maybe we try that as an experiment a month before.

2243
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,960
Put two episodes out and then email.

2244
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,960
Well, and if if if all the Disney Daddy's have mustaches,

2245
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,440
maybe you can't tell that it's us.

2246
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,920
And yellow cabbie hats.

2247
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,240
OK, well, yeah, of course, we have yellow cabbie hats.
