1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Serpents and spiders, tale of a rat.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Haunted Mansion Part 3 is where we are at.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Will we progress to the big ghostly ball?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or will we not make it to a room at all?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can two mansion scenes creep into our talks?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not if we sidetrack on the history of clocks.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's a series with rules that make Scott want to scream.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's get into part 3 by playing the theme.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fabio Rodriguez!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Uh, why did that happen, you ask?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Because if you were listening last year to Haunted Mansion 2,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we said that we were going to open up next year by shouting

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the name of the Spanish voice of the ghost host who says

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Manos and Brazos, so cool.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And now we are off and running with the energy of Fabio Rodriguez.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, the Scream Park podcast

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
hosted by three headless men in their ghoulies.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I am Rick Zombieberg, joined by...

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
General Trag of Dimension X.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And Jack O'Lantern Skeleton.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The only name that made it through the whole thing.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Jack O'Lantern Slimed In! I got it wrong!

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Jack O'Lantern Slimed In.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I thought you became Dr. Murder Hog at some point.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought that was that for second gate only.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You know, we all got a lot of...

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Were we making them only the names are different for the tiers?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You know, there's lots of illusion, tricks and treats this time of year.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll make that a distinction next year that behind the paywall

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we have other fun Halloween names than we do on the free feed.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, and what a... I mean, if that doesn't get people over there

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to our Patreon, the Cemetery Gate,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then you get exclusive scary names that might have

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
no longer anything to do with our regular names.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, that's very exciting for a potential subscriber.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, yeah, stay tuned for that next year.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That is extremely alluring.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And it's nice that we can already be talking about next year

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
because that's what this whole franchise is about.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Haunted Mansion franchise, which we hit once a year

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
every Halloween.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I love that we gave ourselves a plan

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
like Doc Brown sending a note to Marty in the future

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
or leaving the DeLorean buried underground.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We set ourselves up for success.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I actually have a little more about Fabio Rodriguez.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've got a little.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This guy is great.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So there's an interview with him where he's telling the story

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of how he became the Spanish voice of the Ghost House.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He was recording an industrial narration

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
somewhere in Orange County.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And there was somebody also recording in the same building

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
who was doing stuff for Disney who I think ran a bunch of the records.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And he heard Fabio and he said,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you sounded great. Have you ever thought about doing this for Disney?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It was apparently his lifelong dream.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He truly very much wanted to do this for Disney.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And so he read sample copy right there on the spot.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it was great. We'll send it to Disney.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And then a little while later, he got a call from that guy who said,

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
not only does Disney want to hire you,

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
they're just going to use what you already did.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You nailed it. You don't even have to do it again.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He just like passed the audition with flying colors.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And he's like the official Spanish voice of Disneyland.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah. And of everything. Of everything.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah. And the guy who heard him and said, come here and do this

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
was Bill Rogers, who is the English language announcer voice in Disneyland.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, the Main Street announcements.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And Bill Rogers is married to Camille Dixon,

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
who does the announcements for California Adventure.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a husband and wife and the husband does one park and the wife does the other.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah. Isn't that charming?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Delightful. Just like how the voices of Mickey and Minnie were married for many years.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes. Another one of those.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This should be a precedent.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If there's source connecting or husband and wife on screen,

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
they should be married in real life. That's what I think.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When you're talking about animated voices.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think for, you know, if it's, let's say,

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Seth MacFarlane should be married to,

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and I'm forgetting her name, who does Lois on Family Guy.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alex Borstein?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Alex Borstein should be married to Seth MacFarlane.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's what I'm saying.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah. Dan Castellana and Julie Kavner.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right. Married. Should be.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But you're just about, you're just about purity.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're about people should not be fake out of wedlock, even in character.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah. There is a chapter in the Bible that I adhere to pretty strictly that says,

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
thou shalt not mimic a wedded relationship on screen.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah. Those famous chapters of the Bible.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For sure.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That foresaw filmed media.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And knew that this would be a problem at some point.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll say, yes, the religion I believe in is a very, very small group of people.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We've revised the Bible many, many times,

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and most of it has to do with rules about entertainment and theme parks.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah. Maybe some volleyball. Maybe get some volleyball in there, sure.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah. There's a lot of different rules.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So yeah, whatever the specific religion I subscribe to, yeah, is different.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, and that's a good...

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thou shalt limit thy bodiness.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, yeah.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah. The word bodiness appears on every page multiple times.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hey, and the volleyball reference, that's a good to pin it to 2020.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know, we do like to... It's fun to look back.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I looked back at the previous episodes.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What were some things we were talking about in the past?

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
2019, President John Delaney. Remember that loser? Remember that asshole?

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah. I don't. I don't remember what side he was on.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Was he a Democrat? Yeah, he was a bald, rich guy who ran for the DNC

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and just like sucked and got smoked out, like smoked really...

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Got his ass smoked really early in the race.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In 2018, we were talking about Michael Avenatti, the story Daniel's loser,

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
who everyone's like, maybe this guy will run for president.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What a time. Yeah.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mike last year was talking about, in Chapter 2,

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mike was talking about Pluto's disease-filled tongue.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Unfortunately, the tongue was patient zero and look what's happened.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There is a...

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Pluto didn't, he licked everybody.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wow. I didn't even think about that. You're right. That is what happened.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Though the end of the last year's episode is very, very frightening.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, some other stuff that's come up in the past, just as a refresher.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I certainly got my wish that the Haunted Mansion holiday was much shorter this year.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Unfortunately, the monkeys paw curled once again and it was non-existent.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And we may have opened a can of worms when we joked about Trump maniacs

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
complaining about Sharia law and asking the question,

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
how grim will the 2020 election cycle be?

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I heard, I went back last night and listened to that last four minutes.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And it was, I'm trying to think of an equivalent on like television

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
where like there was some, like some Breaking Bad finale

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
where you were like, maybe you go back and watch a show and you're like,

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
oh my God, Jesse has no idea what's about to happen,

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
what Walt is going to make him do. It's like that level of, oh my God,

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
these three idiots have no clue what's coming for them.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is it like, well, like, I mean, it cuts off, I think with Hank getting shot at,

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I guess he might know where it's come. Is this the end?

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Is this the, what leads to Ozymandias?

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes. Okay. Yes. The last one was Hank and Gomi in the desert getting gunned down by Nazis.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And now this is Ozymandias. We are in the end game at this point.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It has been, yeah, a full year that has felt like that, certainly.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And we were at Jack too, because we were like days away from getting on planes to go to Chicago and then Orlando.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And so, so we were very lively.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Seeing listeners, opening up a dimension of this podcast that was so much fun.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Like, boy, we got to get back at all these places and do it again soon. Well, whoops.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, pretty chilling.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I thought, though, even more egregious than us.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, when we said, I wonder what that election is going to be like, like, boy, we didn't know half of the half of it.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But the one that I thought, I actually have a quick clip I'm going to play.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I just thought this was like really brazen and I regret it. So here, let me just play this.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sure. Yeah. So I do feel like a lot of pessimism about 2020, but also I just don't understand why.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because there's so much more fun stuff coming. I mean, we got the Olympics in Tokyo.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's going to be a blast. Lana Del Rey is going to bring down the house at Coachella and we're all going to be talking about it.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean, I just don't. People are acting as if like the fundamental aspects of our society will be completely upended and we have to re-figure out how we do life.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I just I don't get it. Yeah. You know, you have a real egg on your face now, from that clip from last year that you just played.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was I mean, I look, what can I say? I take it back.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And actually, they're wait this because I kept adding to it. And just this one. This one really, I think I have egg on my face.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
As sure as I am in the same room as you guys right now, staring you in the eyes, us together,

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will look you in the eyes and say 2020 is going to be the best year of our lives and in theme park history. And you can you can quote me on that.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can use that against me. You can quote me on that. I mean, that clip is really a rough clip. Yeah.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, I feel very, very embarrassed for you, quite honestly. I feel like Lindsey Graham. And yeah, what can I say?

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now, I will take responsibility. I will apologize for what I look. I don't like to brag on this show a lot unless it's about how brave I am in certain situations.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But can I quickly play a clip that I'd like to play from last year? I think this is something that no one saw coming.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But I sort of remember it. I had sort of 20 vision when it comes to this. All right. I'll play the clip right now.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
320 vision. Yeah, very. Yeah. All right. Here's the clip. Hey, guys, remember the name Tony Bobulinski. That's all I'll say.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Was that like an Imagineer who worked on the attraction and we'll talk about him when we get to the the leotard room.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We'll be as excited about him as we are about any Imagineer. Tony Bobulinski.

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
OK, all right. Well, I don't know which books you're reading. You're reading a book, I guess, besides the Haunted Mansion, Imagineering a Disney classic by Jason Sorrell.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not sure where you're getting this from, Mike. Let's just say I'm reading it off a very special laptop.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Dude. Oh, my God, that clip. Wow. Bonkers. Can you believe that? I knew I knew I knew back then.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I was just blowing you off like what is Mike is becoming office rocket. This is some conspiracy theory.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going to I'm going to add in an edit here and I'll play the song Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional to prove the celebrate the victory I just had.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I know that song, of course. Yeah. Yeah. From the Spider-Man, right? Spider-Man 2.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I believe so. Yeah. Well, no one feels as stupid as I as I do after like this clip I pulled from me.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Can I play this real quick? I mean, let's make sure. Go ahead. Yeah. The screen share.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know I, for one, cannot wait to see the live action Mulan and a crowded sold out theater opening night and see my two best friends on screen

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
rendered in beautiful high definition footage, Mooshu the dragon and whatever that crickets name is.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, man, Jason. So that was wrong for a couple of reasons. And also, I still don't know the name of the cricket, but I guess they just swap them out for prison camps in the background.

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And they got rid of those fun loving characters and, you know, well, boy, only I look smart now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The two of us are just absolute fools. Well, especially here. I got one more quick one and I think. Oh yeah. Go ahead. Please, please.

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, and by the way, let's cut this from the episode, but I should tell you guys I'm having a baby.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm having a baby next year and I'm just here. I'm just going to like I'm just going to take a stab at it.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Girl, it's a girl. I just got a feeling I got a hunch.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean, wow. Yeah, why? I don't like to be. I don't like to be mean, but what a dumbass Scott. Yeah.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I mean, I feel like I've grown as a person, so I don't take that as an insult of 2020 me. I take it as an insult of 2019 me. Yeah, I'll add to it was a fucking bumbling dumbass. Yeah. Wow.

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I look I'm not even going to brag. I'm not even going to play the thing where I predicted McCartney was going to release McCartney 3, the final final album and a trilogy.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He started in 1970. I won't play that up. You were winning that whole you were you were just on a streak, I suppose. Yeah.

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, I mean, you know, anything we want to throw out through the episode and just kind of playing a flag and in 2021. Sure.

200
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I think I know I know how I felt last year and what ended up happening, but I think I'm just going to keep making as optimistic guesses as humanly possible.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, and that shouldn't matter now. This year's different. I don't think it'll bite me in the ass. No, I don't think so either. No, I think that's fine.

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah. Well, as for as for this, I mean, because we should get to it because there's as always, there's a lot of work to do.

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Now, the one thing that we remember is that we we got on the ride despite me being fought on this. We did get on the ride, the lab bar lowered. So we are off. We are heading into the actual attraction.

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes. And I was surprised. I have a couple of things. OK, I only have one thing that I was remiss that I did not talk about last year.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The other thing I was like, oh, I think it was just wrapping up and we couldn't get into it, which was we have not talked about the OmniMover ride system. We have to address that. Of course.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Of course. Yeah. So but first, this is just a personal thing because I wasn't going to drag us back through the queue and everything. I wasn't going to be vindictive, but I realized I didn't.

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I wasn't going to be like Scott, you're going to be for what you predicted. But I realized I didn't really, you know, there was a run in the second Haunted Mansion episode where you guys talked about being so scared of the.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The Maleficent, I believe, in the sing along song videos of the shiny face with the crazy face paint. Right. And as I was rewatching, like I watched Haunted Mansion ride through a couple of times, I remembered as a kid.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And even now I'm not wild about it, but I never liked the busts that follow you. And as a kid, I always went to the Florida Haunted Mansion and those you go buy them so quick in the Florida Haunted Mansion because they're in the ride itself.

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But in Disneyland, you could be stuck next to them for a while in the queue right before you get into your doom buggy. And that's just like a creepy effect, but it's another old optical illusion in that they are not actually busts.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They are impressions. And it's just the way the mind and the eyes fill in the blanks and process light hitting these impressions in the wall that they appear to be following you.

212
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We talked about that, though. I remember we did talk about that illusion. I know maybe about your specific saying you're just you're just like how frightened that was your scariest thing having to at least this part of the mansion.

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We talked about Maleficent's face being the scariest and you. Yes. This is maybe your scariest point at up till now in the mansion. Yeah, I just realizing that like, oh, I'm glad you couldn't stand next to these in the Florida version because I would have been very like unnerved.

214
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What we should do is going forward with these haunted mansions, you know, if we leave something out, we should do a George Lucas remaster new scenes and I'll take that chunk out and I'll edit it into last year and we'll post that up and destroy the original.

215
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Now we'll be able to see the original now.

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then and and put in all kinds of like cool, kooky music to like if we ever played a clip of kind of a neat mellow song, it should be replaced by like, hmm.

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Lay that let's lay like space gore music. Yeah, I think that's right. You Sean and mansion it was and we can edit out our blunders.

218
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Blunderers. Good. Right. So if you have a so if we have anything like that, we'll just announce it beforehand that this is going in the special edition for one of the last two year episode one of the last year's episodes.

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You know, it was crazy, though, is how we exactly predicted that Palpatine was Snoke and that he was growing many Snokes in test tubes and that one of the Snokes was upside down. I thought that was really oddly specific and we nailed on that. Yeah.

220
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I yeah, that was you know, that doesn't we were such we talked about Snokes so much that first year podcast arrived. So it's not surprising to me that we were experts on him. We had all kinds of snow. Well, yeah, certainly. Yeah. And I dropped that coffee mug at Mike's and when it shattered at the bottom of the mug said exit goal on it.

221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I only realized as I was leaving the Regal Cinema at Christmas time like, oh, oh, it was there the whole time. Yeah, the whole time. It's free. Yes. You had visions.

222
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, is that is that all of the history to revisit? Can we move forward or we're on the Omni mover? What do we have to say about the Omni Mover? Yeah, we're on the Omni Mover. We're in the loading area. You know, we talked a lot about that. You know, the loading area is kind of vacant.

223
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Could use a little plus up. There's some great Claude Coates like concept art that they could, you know, add to, you know, I think you could plus this up with a little bit of fog and some dead trees and gravestones. That's a pretty you're showing us real concept art. Yeah. Yeah. That looks amazing. Yeah. That's very cool.

224
00:19:44,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You we've talked about and I will another thing that I did over quarantine as I broke and watched a Phantom Man or ride through. Okay. Really? Yeah. I had not done it. But yes, that's that cue that loading area is very cool. And then the Disney World loading area is, I think, better than Disneyland. Yeah, it's not. It's all so much better, but it is better. Yeah. Well, this is one of those things we've talked about. Tony Baxter says there's things he would go back and hit and revise. Yeah, it's actually one a little bit better. Yeah.

225
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's actually one a little bit later in one of the rooms we'll talk about. But like, which I always like to hear. I like that he does. He doesn't view it as perfect and set in stone and you can't change it. And this is a good example. Yeah. You walk in that room and it's sort of just blank. And it's a thing I really like and on a mansion holiday, which is apparently become the villain of the theme park world. Like now it's like now you like can't like it seemingly.

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's I do feel like it's divisiveness grows by the day. And of course, now it has a very I mean, I'm sure he had this opinion a while, but recently a viral video of Ryan Gosling where he detailed his problem with it.

227
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, and Trump Jr. was on Fox News going on for like five straight minutes. He was like getting out of breath and red in the face just going on about like you don't want when you go there. You don't want to see Oogie Boogie. You want to see the ghost. And when you replace the ghost, it makes you as mad as one of laptop isn't fully exposed. Yeah. Yeah. You're seeing it more and more is what Scott is trying to say.

228
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So to answer your question, Scott, so the Omni mover ride system, this was the second iteration, you know, it first appeared in the inner space ride journey journey space adventures.

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The way you do Bob. I think Scott is right. Scott is right. I think it's a venture through inner space. Yes. I watched some of the Midsummer Scream panel from last year for the 50th of the Haunted Mansion and Bob Gert calls it voyage to inner space.

230
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But yeah, so so they had, you know, done a World's Fair. They had done World's Fair attractions that had continuous ride systems and they fine tune that into the Omni mover ride system for inner space.

231
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Another Claude Coates, you know, overseen project. And then they used it. They moved over to the Haunted Mansion. In earlier episodes, we discussed Haunted Mansion. There was discussions of would it be a walkthrough? Would it be a half walkthrough, half ride or a walkthrough next to it?

232
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And eventually they settled on the Omni mover system. What do you guys think about the Omni mover system?

233
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, I like it. I like it. Obviously, like you can feel that it's a little a little janky in its movements. Yeah, but but that is sort of the charm at this point. It's not it's not like you think you're like, oh, I'm on something that's 100 years old. But, you know, you can feel it's like wild aggressive swings.

234
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The lap bar hits me in the legs a lot. I'm a taller man. Yeah, I don't know if it does that to anybody else. Yeah, I kind of have to like really like squish my legs down to make sure I don't get a little a little bruise. It doesn't bruise me, but you know what I'm saying.

235
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think you got to give it up for those for the ride vehicles, aesthetically for the doom buggy specifically because there's other other Omni movers the clam shells on Little Mermaid our version of that and those look friendly and colorful. But I like that just the unadorned plastic shells painted black do look so funereal. They do all look like bizarre coffins, like either from the distant future or the distant past.

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Like this is some weird thing they would have buried somebody in and you're 900 or something. Yeah, they're amazing vehicles. Yeah, it does really I don't know how I mean it's it's similar to the inner space. Well, I mean, it looks I think it's almost the exact same right. Did the inner space one have a curl? It had a thing like the back is pretty similar. Yeah, it's sort of just by luck probably has as with Scott's describing this odd shape. I almost think of it like as some bizarre like contraption you would wheel around like.

237
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:19,000
A hundred year old man in or something like you would be going through the mansion in this like bizarre contraption not like Palpatine's exical contraption but like a bizarre wheelchair of some kind that you're sort of being wheeled through the mansion on. I don't know why that's my thought but like there the vehicles themselves have a lot of character for being so plain. Yeah.

238
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, yeah and the and the darkness of them and the fact that you like the way that it covers up on all sides which as we've discussed not only enables awesome make out experiences.

239
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:53,000
If you're trying to escape parents are keeping an eye on you but also like that it you get an element of surprise like they your own car covers up details until you turn to face them your you this stuff that you can't see because the one in front of you is so huge and blocking your vision. I think it just like adds to element of surprise all time as you go.

240
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yes, I mean I think one of the positives of it is an early innovation of treating the ride vehicle almost like a filmmakers like camera where you can like direct look at this like they're they're they can move what they want you to look at what's the primary thing you should be looking at and then if you're like looking around to the sides you get a different view.

241
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The trade off being though that like this continuously moving system. If there's an issue if they're like having an issue getting people on or getting people off. It can speed up and slow down but then sometimes just has to stop but they have to stop one it's kind of got to stop the whole thing.

242
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's a kid I'm trying to remember because that's like that's you know where you form your opinions about these things honestly like I guess that's as a kid it definitely felt like you're in a box, it definitely felt.

243
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I'm trying to think of there's any other vehicle that made me feel quite like there's a coziness to it that you I feel like I especially felt as a kid, but still feel now you know it's like you're being taken care of by the ghost hug you're getting hugged by that vehicle, the mansion is a really cozy ride.

244
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah maybe the coziest.

245
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah I mean obviously there's a lot of nice tranquil experiences but there is a coziness maybe just because you're in like a house that you're familiar with.

246
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think like the the decoration the sort of like dark dark wood and there's as you go through there's a lot of purples and like furniture I don't know it feels very warm there was a cozy story.

247
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I heard like again the midsummer story it is a cozy story I think from Bob Gurr who was explaining how they were coming up with like the Omni movers system, and he started the story with john hench happened to have a candy apple on his desk.

248
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And he I think the idea of being he picked it up by the stick and was like wait what if we put the everything we need to control it underneath it, and then you can like tilt it as if you were like holding a candy apple and you could tilt the apple around, you know and that's the ride vehicle.

249
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And you thought that was a cozy story because you like the idea of being at work and there's being plentiful candy apples around I just like the idea of someone yes someone happening to have a candy apple on their desk and Jason Jason can you show us the table is there a table behind you is there full of candy apples.

250
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There's not there's a couple of decorative gourds for the holiday.

251
00:27:46,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know we haven't we haven't talked. Are you a candy apple man. I cannot remember the last time I had a candy apple. I feel like every now and then when I go home to visit if it's in the fall or around Christmas.

252
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
My mom has like picked up a package of them.

253
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But I it's not one of my go to is even at the parks, and I think, I think Disney will cut them for you right if you buy one those I said, that's the only feasible way to eat it.

254
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh yeah they have these like monstrosity candy apples I've never ever gotten one at the park, it just seems like so much effort.

255
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I haven't had a candy apple in years I used to get them once in a while from school they'd be those like plastic packages, and it would be full of nuts, which wasn't my favorite at the time.

256
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And then it would just like it was fun, but then it's just like it was a fucking pain in the ass to eat. Oh yeah, so that's why I'm saying like if you if you slice it, and then like you can share the slices with someone, then I think it's manageable.

257
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What do you go to your candy apple stance. Um, I don't think I've had one in like 20. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah. That's reasonable.

258
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because you could pick up like a Twinkie or a candy bar to gas station, you're not like popping in somewhere like, oh the candy apple. Oh yeah, I'll get a candy apple is I got to be stuck in traffic for a while you know, dipping an apple and caramel is much more practical,

259
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but I haven't done that in years. I don't know Jason on the table behind you is there a whole big jug of caramel by any chance.

260
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No. No. Okay, he's checking checking small jug of there's a fudge jug hot.

261
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Caramel jug butterscotch jug. Oh, there is a car. He said Caramel. Yeah, there is Caramel. Okay.

262
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You have whole ice cream toppings. I have a yeah, I check the jug wall. Yeah.

263
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay, so, where are we now so the Omni mover some other facts about them.

264
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Bob I knew we weren't done Bob Gar and wed designed manufactured by the now defunct arrow development a very early manufacturing partner for Disney they of course worked on timber mountain log ride at knots.

265
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And this I didn't I don't think I ever really processed but for at Disneyland. There are 131 vehicles on that track.

266
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They move at 1.4 miles per hour, which is roughly 2500 guests an hour. So I think that gets it up to the people people eater status you know that's a lot of people per hour getting through the ride.

267
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And they run. They run this thing too fast.

268
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They there are different speeds and we've seen it because they adjust it sometimes all of a sudden you'll start to go slower and I think that sometimes if if maybe somebody is a wheelchair issue or they have to just, they're just want to make sure you know stepping out onto the conveyor belt isn't going to be an issue, they'll slow it down.

269
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But I think that they are they run this thing full speed a lot, and maybe it's not full speed and full speed I would like to see full speed as if it's like a cartoon, where you like go through the mansion in two minutes.

270
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But the Adams family right like what it's not a ride but when you end up going through all their shoots in the Adams family.

271
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes, exactly. But I my complaint is I think they should run it a little slower because sometimes I feel like you're whipping through that thing.

272
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, and I like to hang out a little more.

273
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But it's never occurred to me I have really I've never thought about the speed being too fast too fast.

274
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
They can go slower than go slow down.

275
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It is reliable though. People are saying it more and more. People are saying more and more.

276
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah. So anyway, sorry Jason go. Oh, Gurr Gurr is on, Bob Gurr is on record as going like he felt bad because there's so many like different sized gears and wheels as part of the track.

277
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And he felt bad about, you know, leaving the next generation with such a complicated system to maintain but it seems like the the attitude of the you know maintenance staff was like hey it works so it runs every day, you know, for the most part, it doesn't go down a lot like you know the more complicated modern day ride systems.

278
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Right. It's a very it's a real it's all reliable. All reliable. Listen boats, just very reliable. As far as Disney Disney rides are concerned. Yeah.

279
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, the I'm trying to think anything else about the Omnimover like speaker placement seems fine.

280
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I like it. Let's get in the room. Let's get in the room. I think that's everything I have. Oh, God is like a kid. Endless hallway. Let's go. Well, one more credit Fabio Rod. Fabio Rodriguez. We didn't give him enough credit.

281
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You can also hear him do the Spanish language safety spiel on pirates. Formerly the DCA Tower of Terror. And he also appears in the Mexico Pavilion at Epcot.

282
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And he said his kids love hearing him in the parks and their friends always send videos of like, hey, here's your dad and that's really sweet. And so, well, and he said that he I found an interview with him where he said he like watched the the

283
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:32,000
fireworks show and said they were and heard a voice booming through the park saying, ladies and gentlemen, and how he dreamed of one day that would be me saying Dama see Caballero's Nino see Nia's and it came true. Yes. Very specific and like amazing dream that is that in the most wonderful place that your voice is audible everywhere.

284
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's great. And also he mentioned somebody said his voice is a lot like Ricardo Montalban. And I mentioned in the last episode how sexy that voice is, especially on the mansion. And of course, who is sexier than Ricardo Montalban? No one.

285
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That kind of that added up to me that that like created some some little DNA connection like Oh, no wonder I like that voice so much. It very much is multiple. Yeah. So yeah, he's he rules.

286
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Amazing. I'm glad we I'm glad we made such a point of him at the end last year. Yeah, he's really good. Okay, Scott, you get your way.

287
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Take it away. Endless hallway. Wait, wait, no, wait, wait, I have a couple more candy apple questions. Oh, okay. Oh, I know. I never mind. I actually I solved it in my head. Scott, go ahead.

288
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, little circle back around. We haven't even addressed that I'm wearing a skeleton onesie this whole time. So don't worry about it. It'll come up later. What are you actually? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you want. We got skeleton onesie. It's fun. It's seasonal. Yeah.

289
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, I'd say go walk around and let us see it. But you're you're hooked in. Yeah, I'm all hooked up. Well, give us a turn when this is all over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Give us a little runway show. Oh, my God. We're in the right. We're actually in a room.

290
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We're in the endless hallway where the candelabra is floating down at the end of it. I like all the how they pulled this off because you really do think that just goes and goes and goes.

291
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But of course, they wouldn't have room for it. We're like once again back in a not I guess not a not a pepper's ghost here, but we're in the same territory as Tower of Terror, where it's a it's a shorter hallway than you think it's made to look longer than it is.

292
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And the end scrims are involved. Wait, so now I'm redo it's still so confusing to me even in the notes. The like the mirror at the end of the hallway is really close. It's way closer than you think. And then they've painted the candelabra black on the back. Yes, because it's really close to the mirror.

293
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So that you like you won't be able to see that and that and the candelabra also helps block the view of you and they like I feel like I'm getting away from myself here like anyone explain this better than me. You're doing a pretty good job, but I'm still confused.

294
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But I know it's funny because it's very it's very complicated, but also feels like we may have the ability to make it from stuff around the apartment. Yes. Yes. Yeah. It is like interesting about it. It is a trick like theatrical designers and like magicians have probably used for like over 100 years or something like that.

295
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just like there. It's very thin black wires holding up the candle. Like you said the back of the candelabra is painted black. The mirror that way like it does you don't pick up the the you know the back of the stuff in the mirror and then the scrim helps cut down on like crispness of like what you're looking at.

296
00:36:45,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So it makes it a little hazy and it also makes it harder to see us. Yeah, you don't see yourself even though that is a mirror right in front of you. Yeah, and it's and it uses force perspective like yeah that hallway is not very long past like what you're looking at.

297
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, do we know feet wise because in my mind it's 25 the candelabra is 25 feet away. Is it like seven feet away. That sounds right. Maybe it's something like that. Yeah, I think it's a little because as I'm sure we'll hit in this area like every now and then a guy hangs out around it.

298
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So it's got to be big enough for a guy to be around. Yeah, maybe it is closer 25 10 to 12 feet I think maybe like like 10 feet 25 might be too far 10 might be too close. Right. I, I again don't want to you know we'll we obviously will cover the you know nightmare or high mission holiday in some other juncture.

299
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Whenever I swear now every time I go on it. And I think, alright, let me go let me get into the head of someone who wouldn't like this so let me judge this with a critical eye do I not like this attraction or have I been over rating it or something.

300
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And when I see the dog when I see zero flood zero right floating in that hallway instead of the candelabra I really like it. That's the first thing that always makes me go and the well and the doors downstairs as you're boarding I like a lot. Yeah. And then I see that dog like this. That's great. It's fun. I don't.

301
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:42,000
If I'm the villain of the podcast for smiling about this fun ride, then I don't know how to get out of the villainy spot. I don't think you've ever been fought on and I think all I've ever said was I think I agree sure would be better but I like it. I like it. It's fun.

302
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Like it's I guess I don't disagree with that argument. I think it's just, I was we come back to the boring functional argument which is how do you have it open for like does it just have to be closed for all of November, then right I guess to change it right exactly.

303
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I suppose it's a bummer in and of itself. Yeah, I but you know last year's episode where we was before recorded before we went down to Florida and I will say that experience of being in Florida, Florida Park and we did not hit the Magic Kingdom.

304
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I believe until our last full day we were there but it was a pleasure to ride a traditional version of the Haunted Mansion in Halloween time because it was a late late October. Sure. Yeah, like it was it was just I don't know.

305
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It was the kind of fun. I love the whimsical side of like the spooky side of Halloween, you know, sure. I get that argument. I, this is the problem. Also, here's the thing I, I do think at my heart.

306
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I am a theme park populist. I don't want to throw that word around in any other way necessarily but a populist as far as theme park is our concern.

307
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:04,000
She's like guardians and stuff. You're not a like don't ever change anything ever. Right. Exactly. But my point about this is it is by far Haunted Mansion holiday.

308
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Three times four times as popular as regular Haunted Mansion. I understand it's still only there for a limited time but it's there from like now it's what early September or mid September to December.

309
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's like they are. It's I get it. It's less time but it's so popular. It adds like doubles the time. It triples the time of the queue. So like what is the incentive for them to do it? Right.

310
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
There's no being mad. People are mad about everything. People are mad if they like, you know, like take a red flag and make it a green flag. Right. People.

311
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So people love it. And I would imagine the prevailing opinion and it's of maybe maybe they don't listen to podcasts but the prevailing opinion is like we like this a lot and we get excited to go on it around Halloween and Christmas.

312
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So I have to be a populist here and say sometimes you got to give the people what they want. You got to serve demand at a certain point.

313
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And they're leaving money on the table if they don't serve that demand for it. I mean the other thing is they would have to like let's say they did keep the original Haunted Mansion around through October 31st like at midnight or whatever the park shuts down.

314
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They would have to immediately get in there and flip it in two weeks because November 15th I think used to be the start of the holidays. It seems like Christmas starts earlier and earlier every year at both the parks and like in popular culture in just TV and you know stores.

315
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But that's a pretty tight window for them to try and flip it. So I just it's not going to probably happen and I think if it's the majority opinion like what are we going to do. And plus you get that nice gingerbread smell that I love so much.

316
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well that's true. You can't argue with that. I'm with you there. It got kind of like thrown away a little bit in the fake smell Final Four but it is an excellent smell. Yes.

317
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah and I believe I was voted against by both of you. I think that is true but in those tournaments you know it's brother against brother it's you know you murder those that you love.

318
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's why they're so harrowing. It's the nature of those. Yeah dude. So then you keep moving on to the now I didn't I don't like I knew names before the conservatory.

319
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Ring stop. No way. Oh these episodes go three items. There's three. You.

320
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's a very good moving on to. No. No. The endless hallway is a dagger. This is the very first scene of the ride and there's like three big props like three big set pieces because there's also this suit of armor in here.

321
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,820
Disneyland student armors here. It's very simple

322
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,680
animatronic it moves a little to gives the illusion of like oh is that moving and you know, but

323
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,700
This seems like a good time right to discuss the what these colloquially called the night of the living dead. Oh

324
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,480
Is that okay? And but it wasn't they hey it wasn't in that room

325
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
Well, it was in a further farther, right? So we have to keep going to get to it. Oh

326
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,940
Well, hi your rules are played against you now

327
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
No, you're wrong

328
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:27,960
The night has appeared in multiple different places, but we can wait we can wait to discuss that he is wait

329
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,520
Okay, is that to wait? So there has the night has been in more than it does not always just it wasn't in that one room

330
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,920
Well, the animatronic night was always there the live actor in a night of a suit of armor

331
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,240
Depending on what year it was what time period moved around

332
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,840
Uh-huh. Wow. So you have a timeline of where the human actor of the night costume was? I have a rough layout

333
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,280
Wow, I have actually never been able to find this but we can wait a little we can we can wait a little bit

334
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,080
Let's go to the oh, yeah continue. Sorry. Sorry. So the third item you gotta talk about the chair

335
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,520
No more in an episode. You gotta talk about the big chair

336
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,480
The big arm chair with the face on it. We can't just go past the chair

337
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,680
I mean, this is why this ride gets talked about by us every year because like the opening scene has like three

338
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,920
Like there's more stuff in the opening scene that in some rides period. Is this your favorite chair in a ride?

339
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,440
I think it's up there because I this chair was like burned into my mind at a very young age

340
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,040
It's got a spooky face on it. It's a rolly crump

341
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,800
You know, it's definitely a rolly crump creation. It's a holdover kind of vibe from Museum of the Weird

342
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,040
Which was you know, one of the early iterations of the Haunted Mansion or an early accompaniment of the Haunted Mansion

343
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,200
And you this is like the start of a motif that appears throughout the ride of eyes

344
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,200
Often spirally kind of eyes to give the impression that you are being watched at all times

345
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,040
That the house is watching you right and it appears I assume you'll say like a wallpaper, etc, etc

346
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,480
Yes

347
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,880
Yeah, well, yeah, let's wolf the wallpaper. Oh my god. We may not get that

348
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,560
We might not get to the wallpaper mark. Sorry. Sorry. So sorry 15 minutes to go on it. We got a tea

349
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,640
I have a question. How long does anyone where does anyone think we're gonna get I have a prop bet on where I think we'll get to

350
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,080
And I'm not gonna tell you but I will write it down

351
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,560
Right now

352
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,000
Can I say can I say something about how this is how the three years have gone?

353
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,600
For me, I had notes about the leota room in 2018

354
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,040
It works out for me because I don't have to look up anything new

355
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,840
I took care of it all years ago. This was I will say this is your this

356
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,200
Concept of doing this yearly was Scott Gardner's

357
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,040
idea it is yeah, I dug my grave and now I I think I

358
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,720
I think I like I like the idea. I continue to like the idea, but I feel like

359
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,600
I I don't know how we got into the trap of now how the episodes work

360
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,120
Is that we room by room it and as we try to progress then everyone screams no with me

361
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,800
I don't know that part of it. I did not

362
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,440
It is sort of a part of the podcast though. I think that probably started in the citywalk saga

363
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,360
So I feel like that's yeah off this this sort of dynamic traps. Yeah

364
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,520
Yes, and then I think when you you probably had a little bit of a different vision for this

365
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,280
But this resembles a citywalk saga in and of itself

366
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,120
so

367
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,480
The default was tedium traps as yeah

368
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,400
Which believe me the whole podcast probably a good idea

369
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,200
To be made tedium trap

370
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,360
Well one might one might even go so far as to say that Mike and I are wall to wall creeps

371
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,560
And it's giving Scott hot and cold running chills

372
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,000
All right, uh Mike just make a note put in a grand slam

373
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,200
Baseball being hit out of the park sound effect there. Thank you so much

374
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,800
That'll be but that's in the special. I'll put that in the special edition of yeah, that'll go back

375
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah, special edition of podcast, which is just gaslighting the audience making them think they

376
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
Wait, no, I remember there was something different at this moment

377
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,760
That's such a good idea to go back and add in little things here and there

378
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
And just like never tell anybody and make ghosts haunting the old episode

379
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,640
I think they're going nuts if they ever re-listen to something

380
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,200
Like if you put something in just the home video release of a movie that wasn't in the theatrical

381
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,600
But I think yeah bold predictions that are couldn't possibly be predicted years prior would be really great

382
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeah, yeah, that's a good one. Just well, all right. So start going back this this prize

383
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,480
There's hidden things now in three of our old episodes and if you find them you get a prize

384
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,800
You'll know what they are when you hear this also are really gonna help of our listener account

385
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,440
Oh, yeah, you gotta go back into the archives. Yeah, yeah, and especially the ones on the patreon at patreon.com slash podcast

386
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,200
Yeah, anyway help me unload some of the club 33 towels that I still have

387
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:22,480
You gave away the prize towels. No, you gave away the prize. It's towels. The real prize is how many do I have?

388
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,480
I don't know. I'm not sure I do 990. Yeah

389
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So

390
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,440
That is why you were you look like violet Beauregard coming out of the club 33

391
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
bathroom

392
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,240
After the blueberry situation. Yeah, just did a lot just stuff

393
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,840
Okay, hand towels falling out of your shirt

394
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,600
Um, there's not a lot about the chair. I mean, I I think uh, you know, uh, it's it's just

395
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,400
I was in my mind. It's creepy. I like the chair detail for real that it sets the eye the eyes precedent

396
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,120
I like the eyes precedent here. Yeah

397
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:09,760
Yeah, I do too that that motif i'm not sure that it had ever really occurred to me about the wallpaper and everything that you're being watched

398
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Certainly the bus and and such

399
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,560
Um, but I I do like like reading about like all the you you get the feeling even if you aren't like super aware of it

400
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:25,040
As you're on the ride, like you have this uneasy feeling and when you read about all these details you you start to understand why yeah

401
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,360
And for me who thinks the ride is cozy i'm being watched and I love it

402
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,480
You're being watched by disney security too and I love it

403
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:41,680
Yeah, and and which cuts out riff raff like teenage makeouts and marijuana abuse. I I I should tell a story. I've heard secondhand

404
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,360
That's something that there apparently people have been caught doing more than just making out let's say yeah

405
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Yeah

406
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,360
Um, what threesomes?

407
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,400
Uh, yes two humans and a ghost two on the ride

408
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,800
And they'll follow you home because he's a clinger the ultimate halloween threesome. Yeah

409
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:14,320
I overall I like the haunted uh, the endless hallway and I it's it's so it's very it's pretty subtle like for rides

410
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,360
Uh, I I think it's very subtle. It definitely is

411
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:25,920
Like is a good tease for like what you're about to experience and I feel like it it kind of epitomizes a thing about like the

412
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,640
Haunted mansion being so dense and so detailed filled of like well, there's like three big things right in this first scene

413
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,040
And and some rides, you know don't even have that some rides have a lot of black hallways some rides

414
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,800
Take place in time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time

415
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,880
Some rides take place entirely at night pitch black of night like dinosaur, you know

416
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,480
Yes, the dinosaur does not have its chair moment

417
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,680
No, there's no cool smiling chair in dinosaur. Um, yeah very that

418
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,640
Whoa, do we even have enough time for another room?

419
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,040
What else about the chair how long are the arm rests and now what's the

420
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,280
What do you think what are the napping situation in that chair be do you think that's a long nap or maybe just a 15 minute

421
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:23,440
Not all I think that's a quick one because that is like a high backed arm chair made more for reading

422
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,960
So you're you're back might you're not going to get a lot of give like leaning back in that sort of chair

423
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,640
You know, you're gonna be a little stiff. What type of books would you read in the chair?

424
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,920
Oh ghost stories, I would think haunting of hill house

425
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
mask of the red death

426
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,920
Uh, you know spooky stuff turn of the screw would you read one of your uh crime novels? Oh, yeah, absolutely

427
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,880
Yeah, you can read like a lou archer book or a john

428
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,600
chan d mcdonald

429
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,520
You know, one of my favorite things is when we went to that bachelor party in las vegas

430
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,820
Uh, we got there. We're four of us. We got like a pitcher of margaritas

431
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,680
You said i'm not going in the pool. I'm gonna read a crime novel by the pool

432
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,240
You found out how much the pitcher was you said well, that's the last one of these i'm having

433
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,880
And then you just read your book the whole time while we drank in the pool. Yeah

434
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
So so great

435
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,440
Thrilling to the end just blinks like why are you telling this? There's nothing unusual about anything you're saying

436
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,880
It's like yeah, we're in las vegas. Yes, the pitcher margaritas is more expensive

437
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,400
You are also giving me shit because I was wearing like an old beat up like beach like fish house t-shirt

438
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
so

439
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,600
Fish house. Yeah, that's you know, like a clam bar

440
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh, okay house, you know, I don't know what a clam bar is either a place down the shore

441
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,480
It's like a clam bar where you get fried fish. You get like clams on the half shell and raw bar restaurant

442
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,400
Yeah restaurant. Yeah seafood out. I guess there is a little bit of an odd thing about it

443
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,920
even the place there's a place over on los felis that has clams and stuff and they have a little bit of a

444
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,440
Bar situation. It kind of looks almost like a sushi like sushi where they make it in front of you

445
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
Am I wrong?

446
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,960
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah, they're cracking. Yeah, you are wrong

447
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,800
Yeah, kind of kind of just becomes a catch-all at a certain point

448
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,120
Well, you're from is it kind of like that place the conservatory in the haunted mansion. Yes

449
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
We can move on to the conservatory

450
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,000
All right. All right scott. What do you got about it? There's a guy he's trying to get out of a

451
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,840
He's he's there's a guy trying to get out of a coffin and the voice of his efforts trying to push out of it

452
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:36,640
It is exitencio who is also the voice of the skull that you hear that you see before you go down the drop in

453
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,480
Pirates and he's a he was a nice man who my mom knew his daughter went to school with his daughter

454
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,720
And I got to meet him in a church parking lot

455
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,280
And I think I just found he like did that he did a sketch of of mickey and signed it to me

456
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,440
Wow, really? Whoa. Yeah, I don't say that before. Yeah, one thing. Yeah one time

457
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,560
I and I was already so disney obsessed by like eight or nine years old and my mom like okay

458
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:05,360
Now we're gonna go speak to uh, she calling mr. X. I don't speak to mr. X or x cool

459
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,920
Um, yeah, but I always I was like I was so blown away by that that he was like, yeah like

460
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,040
My mom like met this guy like was it like around him as a kid and he is the skull and this uh, yeah

461
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
I don't think I knew he was the guy trying to get out of the coffin

462
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,960
um

463
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,440
And he's the wait. He's he's the lyrics of the song

464
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,840
Correct lyrics of the song and script of the ride. He was the smoother who like combined the claude coats visions and the mark

465
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,900
Davis visions and kind of made them more copacetic

466
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,360
The dark and the light. Yes. Yeah, right, which we explored the dye in 2018. I had to remember like

467
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,680
Who the names were?

468
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,320
Um, and we're still kind of in the dark here at the beginning the claude coats were yes

469
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:55,680
I'm realizing now that mark and claude were part of a dyad. Oh, hmm

470
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,840
A dyad in the mansion forts. Yeah. Wow. Interesting like you predicted we all pretty you predicted dyads

471
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:09,200
I believe too. I absolutely predicted dyads. Uh, you kept saying and you two did because you were a dyad in predicting dyads

472
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,960
We were because I was predicting I called uh, yale gracy and ken anderson a dyad

473
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,160
Uh, and and mike was like well and they they paid the way for the dyad of uh, you know coats and davis

474
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,400
Of course, right, right, right. I remember the dyad of dyads in the history of the haunted mansion

475
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,580
Uh, I have a question from a narrative point of view about the conservatory

476
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,200
Okay, so this got this is not a ghost yet. This is a zombie trying to get out of this casket

477
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,000
Or a fully alive or a fully alive. We don't know right?

478
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,040
Yeah, well, I think it's ghoul right?

479
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,400
But we don't have many ghouls in this ride. It's almost exclusively ghosts

480
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,880
You're forgetting the graveyard seek with the I believe I saw them listed as pop-up ghouls or maybe they're

481
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,840
Oh, wait a minute. Okay, so maybe the ones that actually shoot up on the spring

482
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,560
That do a look a little more solid

483
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,480
Are ghouls and not ghosts. Do you know what i'm saying scott?

484
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:18,240
Yeah, you're saying that okay a ghost is uh translucent exactly and a ghoul is uh, still somewhat fleshed

485
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,400
So a ghoul is a zombie like character

486
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,360
So there are a couple ghouls

487
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,720
In this ride, that's interesting. I never actually thought about in the mansion and jason. I'm so sorry

488
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,960
We're talking about the graveyard real quick. Uh, I don't I never thought about uh,

489
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,440
I never thought about those things because those things are that on the weird like spring they really shoot up like behind the graveyard

490
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,160
Those things do look more solid than the projections like bluish projections of the ghosts. Okay, that's interesting

491
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:53,120
Well, madame leo refers to goblins and ghoulies, right? Um, so those are around now a goblin

492
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,600
I'm not sure what in the ride you would say is a goblin

493
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
Yeah, is there a goblin?

494
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Does a goblin have to look a certain way?

495
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,080
I have a certain idea in my head what a goblin looks like but could a goblin be a different take a different form?

496
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:13,840
Um, I don't know. Well, you can take a form that's green. I'm all right most famous goblin that I know

497
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,800
Um stanchions are kind of goblin like

498
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,880
But they're not a lot bats. They're not alive. I don't know. I think it gets complicated. I I think

499
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,720
ghosts and ghoul I think the line is very fine because

500
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,240
The hatpox ghost looks kind of corporeal like he's kind of solid

501
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,680
He but he's a ghost and his head he's a ghost and it disappears. Yeah, he's for sure a ghost it isn't in the name

502
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,520
Yeah

503
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,840
So I think there's I think that one of my plus ups is got add some goblins

504
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,400
You know

505
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,200
Is it possible that what if all of the eyes?

506
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,320
In the wallpaper are goblin eyes. Maybe that's what she's talking about

507
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,880
It's possible, but those eyes don't really move in the wallpaper. So that's just a drawing of a goblin if it is a goblin

508
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,080
Mmm, okay. Yeah, unless they're

509
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,560
Frozen

510
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:14,320
They're they're stuck in place. Right. There's possible the wallpaper is frozen goblins

511
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,160
Yeah

512
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,200
Um, I had a question feel free to we can back up but on the topic of those

513
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,680
But of the eyes on the wallpaper, um, do those

514
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:32,000
Because we were discussing are those alive or not are do those count in the count of?

515
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,580
999 happy haunts or all of those sets of eyes a haunt

516
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,540
Yes, because I read an anecdote that cast people go like where all the 99

517
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,940
How are there 999 goats and the people have said like well, you gotta count though

518
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,100
Ones in the wallpaper

519
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:54,260
So that come up so then they could be goblins if that's actually a part of the canon that those are happy haunts

520
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,460
Yeah, I mean it depends on your

521
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:05,300
Hmm are the ghoulies happy haunts or only the ghosts happy haunts because ghosts haunts ghoulies don't necessarily haunt

522
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,460
They might terrorize

523
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,180
They lurk feel like they there are lurkers

524
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,260
Right, and they eat they eat people sometimes if they're a zombie

525
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,820
Yeah

526
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,820
So I i'm confused still

527
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,300
I mean, I don't think I know who's who we need to take a quiz like what harry potter house you're in

528
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,860
and um, we need to like discover the difference between creepies and ghoulies and

529
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,580
Yeah, and put like a dobby like a dobby like character on haunted mansion

530
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,060
Dobby from harry potter who's like goblin. He's a goblin. Am I wrong?

531
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,260
No, is he not? No, he's a little

532
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,140
He's a house. So I love okay. I like to formally apologize to dobby

533
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,780
he's some sort of

534
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,980
Unfortunate racial caricature

535
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,660
Likely likely said then I was like, oh my god. Is that the name?

536
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,540
Is that the really good description?

537
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:04,340
It does sound like old timey racist. It does sound like something. Yeah, I looked it up grandma. You can't you can't christ

538
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
It's on the wikipedia

539
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,140
Yeah

540
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,980
All right. Well new reason to ignore. All right, let's move on

541
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:11,940
Sure

542
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:17,540
Anyway, all right scott's right deck room. So the fella the fella in the coffin, uh

543
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,180
That as we said we were talking about extencio

544
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:26,500
Apparently one of those hands, I believe they've replaced the hands over the years one of those hands

545
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,300
How much do you think it's sold for at auction?

546
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,940
An old one of these hands hundred hundred. Oh no seventy five thousand dollars

547
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:41,460
Scott twenty four thousand. I'll just go low for some reason. Oh not low enough thirteen hundred pretty reasonable thirteen hundred

548
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,820
Yeah, oh, oh wow. Why would we put?

549
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,860
Well, we're suckers we would have paid way more I guess yeah

550
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:53,780
I was opening up my my money bin right now to fork it over if they would have had your bin

551
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,340
I have a tiny money bin like scrooge

552
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
It's a small though

553
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:05,060
Um, so interesting this is uh, this is a casket by the way

554
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:11,060
It's not a coffin. I looked that up. I was like wait are caskets caskets and coffins the same?

555
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:19,620
Are they synonym but like no coffin is the one tapered on the side right like draculus and yeah

556
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,340
This one doesn't have a hinge

557
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,380
Uh, I

558
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,820
I think he's just kind of bursting out of it. I think he's just pushing it open

559
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,020
It's possible. It does have a hinge on the other side and he's burst through it

560
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:39,220
Uh, it seems like seems to imply that he died a while ago because he's surrounded by did floral arrangements

561
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,660
and

562
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:46,420
This is also the first appearance of a character from the haunted mansion the raven

563
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,900
That recurs throughout the ride

564
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,700
You can it is the same raven

565
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,660
I believe it is meant to be the same raven seen interesting here

566
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,820
um

567
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,300
I don't know if this is coming up right. Can you see this picture?

568
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,940
Yes, the raven is sort of here

569
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:10,180
And I don't know if I just like after hours of reading about the haunted mansion was reading into stuff

570
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,020
But to me

571
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,940
It looks like there's spiral eyes underneath the raven

572
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:24,100
On the stand that's holding up flowers and it's very subtle and likely hard to see but if you watch a 4k ride through

573
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,500
You can see there's another set of spiral eyes hidden. Yeah, you're right

574
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,940
Some more rolly eyes more rolly eyes

575
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,260
Is that a haunt those eyes of haunt is that count as one of the haunts happy haunts

576
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,540
Uh, good question. I don't know

577
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:46,500
Now someone bother bill gir about that bob garg about that borrow my father's brother bill

578
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:52,420
Well, he got the name of one of the ride wrong and then I got his name wrong now. We're even punished bob

579
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,700
Um

580
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,900
Incorrect information they did write dialogue for this bird and they opted to keep it

581
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,180
They opted to keep it just calling or silence

582
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:08,180
In most of the scenes do we have the dialogue that they had?

583
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,220
Well, I have the dialogue it did it is used dialogue is used in the

584
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,780
Souvenir story and song of the haunted mansion album. The raven says you've disturbed a guest call

585
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,420
You'll be sorry for that call call

586
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,420
so

587
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,420
That's a threat

588
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,580
Well

589
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,900
Uh, I feel like that's I feel like it's too early to have that threat in the ride

590
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,420
so I think it's a good call I think that's the right answer you still want to kind of have a

591
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:42,100
Spooky atmosphere with no no one saying anything to you yet. No one's not talking

592
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:46,660
Yeah, we kind of lose the ghost host for a while too. Right? Yeah, this is like all atmosphere

593
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,220
Except for guy saying let me out

594
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:54,260
Yes, but that's yeah, but he's not directing. He's not talking to you. Well, he's hoping you hear but he's not

595
01:03:54,260 --> 01:04:00,100
Directly addressing you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the general hundreds of people who would like to help him

596
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,100
But the lap bar has been lowered stop making out and help me

597
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,580
Stop

598
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,660
This is impure you are not married

599
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,780
Show me your wedding rings and i'll let you continue

600
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,300
Reelect richard nixon my friend

601
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,900
Well, that's most of the audio recording in the park. If you listen to it, you can hear that message

602
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,860
Yeah, you play backwards and it's all nixon. Yeah, bro nixon messaging

603
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,180
Walt made sure

604
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,180
Now are we in the corridor of doors?

605
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:41,140
Can we jason? I think we can go on the corridor doors and I just want to say I do appreciate that they there's kind of like

606
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,760
Official names for each one of these scenes the endless hallway the conservatory

607
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:52,920
Conservatory, um, although traditional victorian conservatories would be you wouldn't really display a funeral casket in there

608
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,560
You would display curios and odysseys and artifacts

609
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,200
Um and uh at other haunted mansions they do but uh, yeah corridor of doors

610
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:07,560
Let's talk about it. Did you know about the history of conservatories and verandas and all these things before we did these podcasts?

611
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,960
um, uh

612
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,960
No, I

613
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,280
Honestly, those are just like the threads I followed through the haunted mansion stuff comes up where I go like wait are

614
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:23,720
Caskets and coffins the same and I was like, oh no how silly of me and then I just go down

615
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,800
Like a week of reset. I feel like you like you referred to hours

616
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,600
I feel like you like really hit the books here. I for haunted mansion. I devote a lot of time

617
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,680
I think I did it mostly all

618
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,600
The day before we recorded this I started

619
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,760
on uh

620
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:45,560
The two days before and I was watching garfield the dog

621
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,480
And I alluded to this a spooky trick for halloween

622
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,860
He pulled my laptop off the desk and it bent the power adapter

623
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,600
I talked about this

624
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,120
That was the problem that you hyped that you hyped that up like

625
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,400
Your car maybe just spontaneously exploded

626
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,640
It just exploded well, I just I had never had that happen because on the old laptops is something like that happened

627
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,240
Uh the magsafe pulled it out and usbc just pulls the whole thing down

628
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,160
And it just just killed the whole cable. It just bent the cable

629
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,440
And mercury is in retrograde it's you know a spooky season too

630
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,120
And I had the third time you've blamed something on mercury being in retro mercury in retrograde

631
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,520
Melrose mac was about to close. I was like, can I bring a dog in like?

632
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:47,320
You know, I broke an iphone cable two weeks ago. Was that sort of like the universe getting ready for mercury being in retrograde?

633
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,360
Yeah, but we were recording the next morning and my computer was at like 10%

634
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,880
So I was like, oh I have to fix this like in the next couple hours, you know

635
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,680
Um, yes, I get it. Uh, let me ask you this in preparation for haunted mansion

636
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,240
Because these all have fun named rooms

637
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:10,280
Did you play haunted mansion clue which does exist and these room names are in it? What really? No, did you?

638
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
No, oh, okay

639
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Well, we'll have to do it, uh

640
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,920
On twitch or something. I googled a

641
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,920
Seven hour game that is fun all with separate sets. I'm not a big board game guy

642
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,480
But I do like clue. I like clue and I love I loved clues. Yeah

643
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,520
The game of life. I loved I loved clue

644
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:39,080
Uh, maybe that was it corridor of doors or doors. What you got scott?

645
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,320
There's a I feel like I don't have any I just like wrote down what happens in it. So yes, I say what happens

646
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,520
Oh, yeah, don't worry. I'll fill it in. I got a ton of trouble

647
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,600
What?

648
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,040
What was that? I said, you know a ton of shit. I said i'll fill that I got a ton of shit

649
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,400
All right. Well, then you go. No, no wrote down what happens

650
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:04,520
The spirits are having trouble escaping and there's little maces that all knock on the door and they all make sounds

651
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,200
Uh, it's all like rapping on the door. And that was the thing. I found that tony baxter like doesn't like that

652
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,360
He uh, he like saw some plan where it was supposed to be more

653
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,960
um

654
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,880
like ambient and like

655
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,400
Added sound effects like these big pounds like boom

656
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:28,120
Boom and he prefers that rather than like practical tapping which he thinks is just uh, actually he didn't say this

657
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,360
I wonder if he just thinks that's annoying like he'd rather have a designed sound there

658
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,240
Um, I think he was referring to the haunting the movie that this sequence is based on

659
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:43,800
um, and he uh, he said he wants it to be like that like that's another thing that he would plus up is not because he's

660
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,800
Doing an interview in this room

661
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,480
So there's a bunch of like tap tap tap tap interrupting the interview

662
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:55,240
Which is maybe why he wants it out of there. I I I never thought of that, but I completely agree

663
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,240
Yeah

664
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:02,120
Yeah, interesting. Um, he yeah, I guess it is more like irritating right frightening

665
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:08,520
Because I know exactly what it sounds like. Okay, as soon as you say like oh, yeah like that that that annoying noise and that

666
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,680
The when doors are there. Yeah, I know what that is. Yeah. Okay, that could be better. Sure

667
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:19,880
Yeah, I I think in the original version of the haunting which was a movie adaptation of the haunting of hillhouse novel

668
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,280
um, it's more of a like a

669
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,280
ominous like

670
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,240
bong

671
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Like thunk like the inception

672
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,960
noise maybe um

673
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,680
and then uh, he also made sure to clarify the

674
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,880
1963 haunting not the late 90s liam-neeson haunting which does feature

675
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,320
The incredible hulk roller coaster it like an insane sequence where the coaster goes off the track

676
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,280
Really? Yes weird

677
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,280
Uh, I didn't know that um, huh?

678
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:56,200
Uh, uh, does that time that times out the hulk would have been and was it a universal movie? I

679
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,560
I think it would it might have been a universal movie

680
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,880
I think they got it filmed like either right before right after it opened

681
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,280
Right after it opened. Wow. Hmm strange, but uh, yeah the door knockers are maces

682
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,240
Uh, some of the door handles are apparently like, you know serpent like or like dragons

683
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,040
Uh, you know as if just more more images of the house

684
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,680
Almost coming alive

685
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,880
Um, did you guys come across the sculptor who did a lot of woodwork for the haunted mansion?

686
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,120
I actually did not

687
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:36,360
No, um, this is a guy named he is a cuban sculptor named ciro

688
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
Rolando santana iarite

689
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:47,240
And he had just arrived in the united states and he heard wed was looking for a sculptor he had uh exhibited in

690
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:52,520
central america in spain and they quickly scooped him up and got him to work

691
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,640
and he carved a lot of the wood the door frames and the chairs and and

692
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:03,240
And all of that sort of thing. So, you know that attention to detail again, that's like a real

693
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,560
Pro sculptor

694
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:11,480
And are these the same that they replaced them since they have to right? Like these have to be new

695
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,120
Yeah, some stuff has been

696
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,000
Copied over the years some stuff has been replaced

697
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,560
Right. It's hard. Yeah, i'm sure there's very little as far as like

698
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:27,400
Like original opening day items like they've replaced the wallpaper. They've obviously they have to do that

699
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,880
I wonder what is in there that's actually original

700
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:37,880
Um, presumably they have replaced the air conditioners which come into play in this area

701
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,040
Sure, which like as you enter the corridor of doors

702
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,960
They have angled the air conditioners to blast you so that you get chills when you get into this part of the mansion

703
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:54,760
And yeah, I that's I know exactly what that is and that's good. That's very good a nice chill

704
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,640
Yeah, but blood

705
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,360
Running hot cold chills. Yes

706
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,360
When we haven't as I said, we haven't heard the ghost toast in a while and that's an awesome line

707
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,480
Every room as wall to wall creeps and hot and cold running chills

708
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:15,160
Um, I like that you don't like you start to miss him. They like use him so sparingly

709
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,800
Uh that every one every little appearance in the ride really lands. Yeah

710
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:26,200
Yeah, he he is yeah, he he you want him to like hold your hand through the whole thing, but he's not gonna do it

711
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,400
Point hard to get yeah now

712
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,920
Yeah, and and in this section of the ride there is I mean you're talking about canon like there's the official

713
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,960
Imagineering canon then there's guest canon and then there's like

714
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,360
Cast member canon in this part of the ride. There is a portrait

715
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:48,360
You do see portraits on the walls and this mark davis drawing some have speculated that this is the ghost host

716
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,600
In this drawing because he has a noose that he has chopped

717
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,760
right

718
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,480
Well, wait, does this drawing appear anywhere where is this was this just concept art or was it used in anything?

719
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,840
It's in the it's in the hallway. It's on the wall with the portraits

720
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,920
oh

721
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,480
Yeah in disneyland, too. I believe so

722
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,680
No, I think it's on the wall. I think I saw it was on the wall. They have put so many honestly

723
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,120
I can't my memory now of the pictures on the wall has been flooded with hatbox ghosts because they put

724
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,320
My memory is that they put more pictures of hatbox on the wall once they added him to disneyland

725
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,960
Okay, and I don't know if that was I was just looking for it, but he was everywhere. Oh, yeah

726
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:35,820
Yeah, it's I think it's been updated a couple times or uh updated or you know different versions for different mansions

727
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:40,700
Go i'm wondering I I what did I think the ghost host looked like?

728
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,660
I don't know that I I had ever really pictured him and then once I knew what paul freese looked like

729
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,700
I think I always picture. It's just paul freese himself. Yeah

730
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,660
I thought he looked like snook

731
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,660
That's that's right. This guy looks like a ghoul. I would say this is a ghoul

732
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:05,500
Like right there's a lot of haunted mansion stuff like concept art that has the one eye really closed and the other eye really big

733
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,140
And open is is snook a ghoul though?

734
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,940
I think snook's a ghoul for sure

735
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:16,620
But he's palpatine ultimately though is palpatine a ghoul, right?

736
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:24,860
Uh palpatine, I guess he is a ghoul because like he kind of he kind of dies, but he becomes more powerful once he's fighting mace windu

737
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,060
So he's sort of like I don't they don't really call him undead but there is an element to it where it's like

738
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,220
You know strike me down and i'll become more powerful. He keeps like leveling up by

739
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,220
getting hurt

740
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:42,860
Yeah, is um is chubaka a ghoul because he dies and then comes back all of a sudden with no real

741
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,260
Information about why and what happened now look what you're proposing

742
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,980
Honestly, it would have been awesome

743
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,780
If because a ghoul chubaka

744
01:14:54,140 --> 01:15:00,860
In like two scenes later after he dies in arise of skywalker you think he dies he's just back but he's zombie chubaka

745
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:04,620
Uh, I think that would have been great. That would have ruled. Let's do that. Yeah

746
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:14,140
Like yeah, he would like say the sound is now like scary. Yeah. Well, it could be half and half

747
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,140
It could be like I can't do the chubaka noise but

748
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,180
Like he could have gone back and forth between it

749
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,960
Or he sounds like hello. I'm chubaka

750
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,740
You know, I love a a furry character speaking with an english accent

751
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,660
Yeah, that's something I do like stately now. Yeah

752
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,980
um

753
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,420
Uh, okay

754
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:36,860
Uh, what else we got here?

755
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,820
This is the big this is the big hand shadow that passes by the wait. Am I at the clock?

756
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:47,260
Am I going too fast? Yeah, there's more portraits. There's lots of pictures. Wait, wait, there's lots of ghost pictures

757
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,060
I want to talk about the door. What can we talk about favorite doors?

758
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,860
Yeah, I know what's the difference between the doors? Well, they all do different things

759
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,740
This is a this is i'm not even doing this to troll or anything. This is true

760
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:03,420
There's one door that I find especially scary that i'm always fascinated by and it's from a little kid place

761
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:09,260
It's the the door that pushes out. Yeah, that is always so creepy to me. The like flex it. Yeah

762
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:14,300
Yeah, that like you think it's wood in it like it's pushing out like it's you know foam or something

763
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,500
Which obviously it's not wood

764
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:21,020
But as a kid that's that freaked me out and I still going through that room stare at that illusion

765
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,820
And I just like i'm unnerved by it

766
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,620
I'm fascinated by it. It's my favorite door

767
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,140
Yeah

768
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,300
I I think just the pounding to worse like scare me as a kid

769
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,540
Because as a kid the guy in the coffin didn't scare me that much because he had a funny delivery

770
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,980
Like I was like, oh this is this is kooky. This is silly

771
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:45,580
But like just someone pounding on a door a lot is like just unnerved like always unnerving

772
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:49,180
Yeah, and the doors are so close. They're like very close to your personal space

773
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,940
It's been the hallway. It's pretty narrow there too. So anyway, that's my favorite door

774
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:00,060
Um, there's a lot of portraits of the hatbox ghost in here in the hallways

775
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,580
um

776
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:06,060
There are portraits of the pop-up ghosts that come later on at the swinging wake

777
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:12,780
And they're all kind of done in a style to mimic daguerreotypes, which is an early style of photography

778
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,580
Um, and some of them around a sign that says tomb sweet tomb

779
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,620
Right, which is a funny cute little cross stitch

780
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:26,540
Um k abc horror funny and we like it. It is funny. It is cute next

781
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:30,140
Cross how do you jason? Do you know what a cross stitch?

782
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:36,140
I don't jane does though. Uh, and it's it's very nice. Uh, it looks very nice. Um

783
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,940
Um k abc horror host vampira had a sign. That's a tomb sweet tomb

784
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,860
In her set as well who stole can I i'm gonna sidetrack a little bit and I'm gonna

785
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:51,580
Back a little bit and I don't know if this makes scott happy or mad but a quick sidetrack

786
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:57,420
Uh is that we're talking about vampira. I believe that is how you pronounce it and then alvira people say, you know

787
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,540
they she stole the gimmick of vampira, which is sort of like a

788
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,900
What do you what was is she a vampire? I guess she's vampire is a vampire, but is alvira vampire?

789
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,220
She's just some sort of a scary monster

790
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:13,260
There is a there are ghouls. They are definitely ghouls. They are not ghosts. I think they're ghouls

791
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:19,100
Okay, they're both ghouls alvira. I bobby boris bobby boris pickett made the monster mash

792
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:24,700
And I found a song and I know there's a lot of these monsters sort of songs

793
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,940
I found a song by a guy named don hinson

794
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,580
and the rigor morticians

795
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,060
That I believe bobby boris pickett stole

796
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,140
Two and it was two years later when the monster mesh was written

797
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:43,180
That bobby boris stole a lot of the elements of it and made the monster mash and made it a big hit

798
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,180
and it blew my mind because

799
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:50,460
Like drum parts are pretty much the same the structure of it's the same. It's four chords

800
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,660
And I want to I want to learn more about this

801
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:58,380
I want to know who invented this maybe don hinson and the rigor morticians stole it from somebody

802
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:03,980
But i'd really like to break this case open did bobby boris pickett steal the monster mash

803
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,940
I want to throw that out to the listeners

804
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:10,300
Well, look get juliani on the case

805
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:18,620
He'll he'll he'll be invested as he is as he himself is a ghoul. Uh, yeah, we can all agree

806
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,300
Rudolph juliani is a ghoul hundred percent cool

807
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,700
um

808
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:30,700
No question there and I do want to give the song which is a very riboflavin flavored

809
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,960
non-carbonated poly

810
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:41,100
Unsaturated blood is the name of don hinson and the rigor mortician song that I believe

811
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,020
was stolen

812
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,020
To create monster mash

813
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:50,460
Monster match is probably a better song though, but they're both doing the same like boris carloff voice like this

814
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,100
Anyway, we'll look into it

815
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,940
I just wanted to say that because this is a recent thing. That's been just keeping me up at night

816
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,860
Well, and that's one of those we're gonna look back in 2021 when that is the biggest scandal in the country

817
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:10,060
And it'll seem so odd that it was just brought up in this casual way, right the hinson estate versus the boris pickett estate

818
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:17,340
By the way, if you don't look into bobby boris pickett and look into his other monster songs like the monster swim

819
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,740
And the monster rap

820
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:25,660
Because he has yeah, and then there's a couple like there's a song goofing on star trek. It's called star drek

821
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,420
A little mad magazine a very mad magazine style

822
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:36,300
Um, anyway, we're not getting we're not getting to leota are we well, this is where I find out

823
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,260
It's possible. I haven't how long have we been going do we know where there was a break?

824
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:45,980
Uh, there's like an hour I think an hour and 15. Yeah, I think we still got some time

825
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,700
Let's keep it. I got some time. Can we um talk about the wallpaper?

826
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:56,700
Yeah, this this purple wallpaper, yes with the eyes, yeah the purple wallpaper, I mean

827
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,060
I I think it was always popular

828
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,740
I think people always liked it, but it feels like there was a moment like

829
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,380
10 15 years ago

830
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:09,740
Where everyone was just stepped on the gas?

831
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:15,180
And I I don't know if it's disney was like we got to merchandise this more

832
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,860
Or people on netzy are like we got to sell

833
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,900
We got to sell some stuff with this wallpaper, but I feel like there is so much wallpaper now

834
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:30,940
You mean as far as merchant you mean like wallpaper merch at wallpaper merch to the point where you can buy wallpaper of the wallpaper now

835
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:36,220
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, and like there's a dress pattern with this wallpaper. Yes the wallpaper pattern

836
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:41,260
The wallpaper never really struck me as like you maybe 10 years ago

837
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:46,060
I wouldn't have said oh, that's the one of the iconic things but it does feel like you're right if you go in the gift shop

838
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,060
There's a lot of

839
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:54,220
Representation of the wallpaper on items and clothes. Yes, and in terms of third-party sellers

840
01:21:54,780 --> 01:22:00,220
I have to give jane credit on this one because I said I was going on etsy to try and find wallpaper merchandise

841
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:05,580
And she said see if there are garters and sure enough there are garters

842
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,980
Is this because of what we were talking about on the on the patreon?

843
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:15,900
No, this is another spooky coincidence that has happened to me recently that happened to me

844
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:22,700
Before she said look up garters and then it came up naturally on the bagged halloween costumes episode

845
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:29,820
Yeah, so on the patreon we discussed uh, the and I was like a memory of been unlocked the bizarre thing where the problem they make

846
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:36,380
17 and 18 year olds males like take a garter off of a woman's leg of the yes

847
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:43,420
They're 17 or 18 year old dates leg usually this is we're we're discussing it as if we haven't there's a part of me that wants to

848
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,580
Delete that discussion and forget and remove it for all of time

849
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,940
So upsetting is that idea this thing that happened to all of you at prom?

850
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:58,620
I don't understand we can move on we can move on but yes, you can get a garter if you wanted a haunted mansion wallpaper

851
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:03,740
Garter, but there's more that's this is an etsy one though. That's an etsy. Oh, yeah, this is on official

852
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:09,020
They're not selling garters at disneyland. Yeah, not selling this filth anymore. Yeah

853
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,660
Yeah, they used to have a garter store on main street. Yes, it opened

854
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,020
That is true where walt would go in and fit you for one

855
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:22,460
On opening day people got their garters stuck in the fresh cement. So they have to give out

856
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:29,340
Fresh ones, but there's more wholesome stuff one etsy. You know, here's a wall like the light switch cover

857
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,340
You put on a wall cute. Here's a face mask

858
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:41,100
Cute here's a face mask. Uh, and then here's another gonna predict to that last year. Yeah, here's another face mask

859
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,300
This is a different face mask

860
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:50,300
And then this is a face mask and then lastly a face mask

861
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:55,740
Those are five different sellers five different styles of masks. So

862
01:23:56,780 --> 01:24:02,540
If you want some wallpaper merch you can get official stuff. You can get on official stuff. It's there

863
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,140
um

864
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:09,420
Credited to roly crump, but I also saw people citing a woman named tanya

865
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,860
Norris

866
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,100
well

867
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,660
here's yes

868
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:15,260
it's a little confusing because I saw tanya nor speak at midsummer scream last year and it was

869
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:22,380
Fascinating because she hadn't really been interviewed in years and she she worked with walt's like traveled on walt's plane with his wife to

870
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:27,500
Go to like new orleans to like find decorations and things to put in the mansion

871
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:32,700
And stuff to put around new orleans square to make it authentic and she is very upset

872
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,860
About the wallpaper in the mansion

873
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:39,980
But in hindsight, I can't remember if she's talking about the wallpaper in the stretching room because she just said it's been replaced

874
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:43,900
I understand things have to change but she was not pleased

875
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:48,940
That her original like wallpaper that she picked out was not quite the same anymore

876
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:52,380
So I'm a little into garret type nixons. Yeah. Yeah

877
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:59,340
I really know I got at it. I think though. I think it's probably different wallpaper than this eye wallpaper, but I could be wrong

878
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:05,180
I think I guess she did the original version and then roly crump in the sorrel book

879
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,500
It's it credits the wallpaper to roly crump

880
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,140
With the guiding hand of claude coats and I i've written out roly crump

881
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,020
Phonetically because I always say roly

882
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:24,060
Um, I also think there is some dispute between these some of these people about whose thing is what?

883
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:30,300
I've read like just there's certain people take credit for things and I think other people don't think that's correct

884
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,340
So it's still a little cloudy when it comes to these details

885
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,380
Yeah, so if you can catch them at a cocktail party when those sorts of things happen again

886
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:46,620
You might get a different story than documented the official publications and and roly tanya and bob all alive all still alive

887
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:49,340
All still alive. Yeah for sure. Yeah, so

888
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,900
You can get their perspective

889
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:59,020
And I guess the last thing to be said more eyes the wallpaper is all these creepy looking things are all eyes more eyes watching you

890
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,700
More eyes the mansion is alive keeping an eye on you

891
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,500
I yeah eyes

892
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:10,860
Luckily the eyes are not more together because I do have a little thing where like when eyes are like really close together

893
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:14,780
That is extra scary to me. There was a character called eye guy and power rangers

894
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,780
No, yeah, really freaked my sister and I out because he was just made of eyes

895
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,260
Do you know who eye guy is anybody know who eye guy? I know yeah

896
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,700
Nope. All right scott. I have to show you eye guy real quick

897
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:35,260
Uh, yeah, he's he's gross. There's a newer x-man character called eye boy too, and he's just got a face full of eyes

898
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:39,340
And it is creepy. I mean nothing's as creepy though

899
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:45,020
Is that channel zero tv show that just had a creature made of teeth? That's one of the most upsetting things

900
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,020
They put that in the haunted mansion. I think everyone would be upset

901
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,980
Uh here right here. That's eye guy

902
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:59,180
No, I can't I still recall a guy. I like his I kind of like him. Yeah, he's a cute. Yeah. Whoa. Whoa cute

903
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:03,820
Yeah, smile. It's like he's got like a cookie monster face. Bah

904
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:10,060
All right. All right. Well, we'll throw it up. Do you think the power ranger villain eye guy is cute?

905
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:14,540
They're kind of googly. That's why they're cute. They're a little they're in the

906
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:21,580
Ballpark of googly. Maybe i'll come around there was something else. I oh I took that I declared um, uh the mummy guy

907
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,060
Uh cute Arnold V. Sloop

908
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,940
Uh, no, what the who's the the character?

909
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:29,180
The from the

910
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:32,300
Yeah, yeah, I thought yeah. Yeah, I found emo tep cute. Oh, yes

911
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,940
And I don't understand. Yeah, it's hard to turn the trick

912
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:40,700
Um, uh, so so that's the wallpaper the clock you want to talk about the clock?

913
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:46,300
Clock yes, i'll let you do it though. No, you probably got a lot of stuff

914
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:51,660
No, I don't have much on the actually I just have this a rel page uh bookmarked for the clock. Um

915
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,780
So because there's I mean it's great

916
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,860
And a big shadow hand moves in front of it and that's scary and there's like a demon face in it

917
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:04,060
and I don't think I realized until I saw the book that the

918
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,300
Well, I don't know what part of the clock it is the big chime. I guess

919
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,940
Is a is a forked tongue

920
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:17,500
adds to the whole demon face of it all right and that is so that's an appearance of like a demon character

921
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:22,300
I guess a whole other thing right a whole other thing new type. Yeah

922
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,940
Yeah, so that's from gobblet. They should mention. Um, and the is this where

923
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:32,700
Here. Oh, sorry. Well, I was gonna say the only number on it is the number 13 where the number 12 usually is

924
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,300
A spooky number that apparently that shows up later

925
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,780
Uh in the ride

926
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:42,140
Um, I also we're in this zone where you start going backwards

927
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:48,780
This is another one where I if i'm questioning do I like haunted mansion holiday when you get to those wreaths the wreaths rule

928
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:53,820
What are people going on about if you don't like love the wreaths?

929
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:58,960
I think there's just singing little plants. Amy. Coney. Barrett is an originalist

930
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:06,540
When it comes to interpreting the constitution and some people are just originalists when it comes to haunted mansion, you know

931
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,980
Well, there's a prediction that I will make

932
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:15,180
Uh that i'm sure won't it won't be undone even by the time this episode comes out

933
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:21,900
That republicans are going to do the right thing and you'll realize that they need to leave her on the bench until the american people

934
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:28,540
Have spoken i'd also like to say that by the time we're uh doing probably the ballroom in 2021

935
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,940
Uh, if donald trump if you're hearing this, I hope you're enjoying jail

936
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,260
Well, I'd like those words against me

937
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:41,500
I would like to uh back up what you're saying here because I think you

938
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:46,140
I would bet that all the 75 000 I was going to spend on that hand

939
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,900
I would put it up against I would put it in favor of what you're saying

940
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:55,340
That's right. And now he will be given podcast access and he will be listening to podcasts the ride

941
01:29:55,580 --> 01:30:00,940
Because he thinks he can escape and think about a fun ride and not hear me say enjoy jail

942
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:07,100
For your crimes, sir, and I just want to say congratulations to president howie hawkins

943
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:12,480
It was so exciting to vote for you in the state of ohio where i'm an official resident

944
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,020
and uh

945
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:20,140
Yeah, boy, I really don't know howie hawkins. He's the green party candidate. Look

946
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:26,300
Oh, I have my boy shows you how much i'm paying at that my piden ballot ballot has already been accepted by the

947
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,100
The state of california. I can make this joke. It's fine

948
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:38,540
So is it now what I saw was that's in this zone that this night

949
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:42,780
Appeared and what we're talking about if we talked about the night animatronic

950
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:46,220
But that there was a point in time where there were real characters

951
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:50,140
They tried having real characters jump out and scare you on this ride

952
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:55,980
And tony baxter tells a story and I see it's a fun story, but maybe it's true

953
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,660
Uh, I don't know why I should doubt it, but he claims like somebody got punched

954
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:06,780
At a certain point. That's what the book implies too, which yeah, that's an issue in a lot of these kind. Yeah, that's true

955
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,300
That's probably possible

956
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:13,580
It seems hard to get some leverage on punching just from that seated position in the in the doom buggy

957
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,060
But I guess I guess if somebody

958
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:22,220
Yeah, if they like kind of invade your personal space on the left past sort of the barrier in in the doom buggy

959
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,220
I guess you just go ah and like

960
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,900
I would probably I would do more of a shove I think than a punch

961
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:33,100
Well, if you punched a knight in the face, that would hurt a lot that would

962
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:40,860
Uh really ruin your hand. I would think yeah, it would be like the jim carrey the batman forever scene where jim carrey tries to punch a guy

963
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,620
He's like show me how to punch a guy

964
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,740
And then he's ah then two-faced does it easily?

965
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,500
So um

966
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:57,660
I uh, where does they tried this in the 80s? Yes, uh at least if not multiple times

967
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:01,020
That's the one i'm aware of jason. What is your time timeline for that stuff?

968
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:06,140
So I came across yeah that they tried in the 80s. They thought disneyland was getting a little stale

969
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,660
and

970
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:13,580
There is an interview with a cast member named kyle clark who was one of the people was one of the live action people

971
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:18,540
And he said that they actually had free rein to roam

972
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:23,580
from like the graveyard to the endless hallway

973
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,460
and one of the issues was

974
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:33,820
That some of the cast members were less than trustworthy and would just like hang out backstage for a lot of their shift

975
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,580
or

976
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:40,780
They would just there were scams going like that people would go into the parts room

977
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:47,740
And steal like backup pieces and then sell them on the black market like people would flip pieces of the mansion

978
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,620
And he that's why he said like

979
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:56,540
Not that it was you know, it was a pain in the ass and they had to staff it but like later on he heard there were scams going on

980
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,980
With people selling like buzzy stuff, you know

981
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:06,060
So that was the primary reason was you just couldn't trust a disneyland cast member to hang around the mansion in that capacity

982
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:11,980
I am sure it was not the necessarily the primary reason i'm sure like budget and staffing and all of that had to be

983
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,940
factored in this I they were also trying the

984
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:19,340
That was the time they tried the phantom of the opera kind of character

985
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:24,380
Who would be in the corridor of doors sometimes sometimes he'd be in the queue

986
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:27,740
And um, yeah, that did not go over great

987
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:36,220
In 1999 he was the night was in the corridor doors and then in a 2019 special event the night

988
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:41,900
The live action night showed up in the endless hallway presumably for the 50th anniversary of the mansion

989
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:47,100
I think here's my stance on this and I think that

990
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:53,900
I don't think don't do the like try to like jump in front of the car like car or anything like that or try to come on the side

991
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,900
I do kind of like

992
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:03,020
Whatever there'll be a couple like new figures somewhere in the mansion every time you ride that sounds fun to me

993
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:08,380
And it's kind of a it's much more subtle than a like a jump scare. I think I would be all for that

994
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:13,660
But I don't think I I don't think it's gonna make the mansion better to have like

995
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:19,580
A valencia teen scaring you I mean live actors always scared me like as a kid

996
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:25,420
If you'd be at a carnival or like a beachside amusement park and there was a haunted house

997
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:30,060
I loved the haunted mansion, but then there were sometimes besides like caution

998
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:37,020
There are live people in here in costume and that always just scared like I just the idea of that that like there could be a chaotic

999
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:40,220
Who knows what a live person would do, you know

1000
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:44,940
Yeah, I get what you're saying, but I think I think not don't do if you knew it was just not jump scares

1001
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:49,100
But like there would be like an extra night hanging around. I kind of think that's cool

1002
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,060
Yeah, moving stuff around. I think it's cool

1003
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:57,820
The the idea that the boardwalkers of work will occasionally move the nanny chairs the spooky nanny chairs

1004
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,260
To different rooms or different places sometimes the other chairs you like those chairs

1005
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,900
Assess those chairs for a nap, please

1006
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:12,860
Oh, um, you know, I think it's for a you know, a care worker taking a load off

1007
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:18,220
I don't think those are meant to be sat in for extended periods of time but are a blessing when you need one got it

1008
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,420
Wow

1009
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:26,860
It's like you've thought about it a lot. No one is able to assess a chair for its comfortability. Yeah, no

1010
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,580
That's what that's what the people want

1011
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:33,180
When there's when county fairs open up again, we need to open up again

1012
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:36,220
We need to open up a booth where people bring you a picture of a chair

1013
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,780
You assess it for a dollar. Sure

1014
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:44,540
What kind of relaxing do you do in this chair? Yeah, just rattles it off

1015
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:47,180
Uh

1016
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,700
Dare I say can we did we can we talk about?

1017
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:56,460
Madame leota here it is. There it is. I think no need to fear to it. No need to

1018
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,740
Wow, here we are

1019
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,020
Oh my gosh

1020
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:03,420
I was I I think I was worried about coming up short. I mean this was my goal

1021
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:09,580
I just try to like reach goals like if you're you know, like if you're running what's my distance gonna be?

1022
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:17,580
And uh, you know my outside goal was ballroom. I'm not sure about that one, but uh, uh leota and seance circle

1023
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:24,300
I uh, this is this is good. This feels good to me. Yeah, okay. We are uh, this is this is the first I think

1024
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:28,300
Truly iconic scene. Yeah, if you've been to disney

1025
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,020
Everybody remembers this

1026
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:36,220
Maybe your average dad doesn't remember the wallpaper or that there's multiple doors

1027
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:41,500
Or the raven, but he does know there was a head in a glass circle

1028
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,980
He knows that

1029
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:51,420
Yeah, well and it's where it all kind of opens up because we've been in some very narrow scenes and now suddenly this is very

1030
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:54,620
Grand we actually like it's it's much taller

1031
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:59,420
Uh, this the scope of it is huge the chairs start moving in a different way in this round way

1032
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:07,340
We're incorporating kind of a new kind of ghostly magic that we're bringing. You know, like the the tarot card worlds into it

1033
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:12,060
Yeah, I mean this it's uh, yeah, this is an amazing iconic scene

1034
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:17,660
Yeah, and this is uh changed a few times over the years. There's there's some pretty decent

1035
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:21,580
Uh, there's some decent footage of the original

1036
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,460
Which is not like it was more it was more stationary

1037
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:29,340
illusion, yeah, the floating was added in 2005 for the

1038
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:33,180
50th anniversary kind of a much derided event

1039
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:36,700
I feel like I I didn't see any of the 50th anniversary stuff

1040
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,820
But I feel like people were not exactly thrilled about it. But

1041
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,460
The 60th was kind of a wash

1042
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,660
So I don't know how bad the 50th could have been because if they had a

1043
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:48,460
I mean the floating leota alone is such an impressive effect

1044
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:55,580
Well, 65th was uh real bad 65th for sure. That was this not great. That's what i'm saying. Yeah

1045
01:37:56,540 --> 01:38:01,260
Yeah, I was surprised that the the the floating was so recent

1046
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:04,620
I I maybe thought it was earlier in the 90s at some point

1047
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:10,140
Do we have a preference? Do we think we we like it floating? Do we recall liking it not floating?

1048
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:15,180
Um, it's an interesting question because this is a room that tony often cites as

1049
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,980
Something that needs a plus up

1050
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,660
And I agree with it

1051
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:27,180
And I think i'm trying to really figure it. I like the floating a lot

1052
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,180
but

1053
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,180
I think that like

1054
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:37,340
I maybe i'm just like a little too cynical where I see the wires on the musical instruments around

1055
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:41,020
I don't know the whole room now to me feels a little little cheap

1056
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:46,460
See I was going to say the opposite that I think this room is a good

1057
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:53,340
Illustration of like you don't need many things to plus it up like they could add a few things like this to the loading area

1058
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
And I think it would be a much

1059
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:03,180
A greater a great improvement. I I think the effect in the ball still looks cool for the most part

1060
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:08,060
I don't need it floating sort of in that very I don't know boring. I I

1061
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:14,940
It might be a wash to me honestly that it's floating versus just sitting because I think that the illusion of leota tombs's head

1062
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,940
In there is is the draw

1063
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:20,700
I like that. I like the floating through the room

1064
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:25,580
Yeah, I don't know i'm neither here nor there like it's I don't think it's like

1065
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:29,100
Unbelievably better. I think it was really exciting when it came in

1066
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,540
And then it really made you question. Well, how are they?

1067
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:38,780
Doing this projection because that's changed a couple times. It's moved from front to inside

1068
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:43,820
And I feel i'm still confused about it. Are they are they projecting the face?

1069
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:51,500
From the front now still currently I feel like I read that they do which I don't know how they do it through the

1070
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,300
the the sphere

1071
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,300
Right. Yeah, I think

1072
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:02,140
I was reading a little bit and I yeah, it was my understanding it was sort of similar to just how they've always done like the

1073
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,020
heads in the cemetery

1074
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:11,980
But I see what you're saying that makes it like it seems like that's an extra level of how is that work

1075
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:17,020
And I did not there was a point in time. It was definitely done from the front when it

1076
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:20,220
Started. Yeah, they're they're right. They're projecting

1077
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:23,820
The video on to is still a bit of a

1078
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:27,740
video on to is still a bust of a face, um,

1079
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,300
it I think when they

1080
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,620
Like they had to update it and change it

1081
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,340
It was done

1082
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:38,140
It was being projected on old film and then they updated to laser discs and that prompted

1083
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:42,700
It to be updated and they wanted to like look can we crack this even better?

1084
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:47,660
And then so suddenly they started projecting it from the inside and they built a very small projector

1085
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:53,500
Of that kind of like domes out like it's a reverse fish eye which allows it to you know

1086
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:56,700
Spread as far as it can within the round head

1087
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:01,420
Um, and there's a patent that you can look up on one of these sites on doom buggies or something

1088
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:09,740
Where they show how that works having a little projector inside which is that also how they do buzz lightyear is uh in the queue for

1089
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:17,100
Or right right space ranger spin or whichever the many names of that right ester buzzer. Yeah, you say that and those do feel similar to me

1090
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:21,580
As i'm thinking about how they look so that may would make sense to me that that was the same

1091
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:25,100
The same tech I think so. I think it's coming from the inside

1092
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:31,100
I think they move around so much like where else what other common point could there be that you're projecting?

1093
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:33,420
But then I also remember hearing how

1094
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:38,060
Like some of the mouths and radiator strings racers are still ours done from the front

1095
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:41,980
Even though those characters move around a lot and that sometimes if you look real close

1096
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:46,780
You'll catch them moving out of sync and that a little lens has to move around. It's a little like

1097
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:51,580
Uh, there's the italian because luigi and then his little like helper guy

1098
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:58,940
Um, like they have to move the lens around as he hops around. Yes. I have I have seen yeah you that illusion

1099
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,940
I think you can see a little more clear

1100
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:04,700
For whatever re probably because it's a little lighter in that car's ride

1101
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:10,540
Um, but uh, I I do think that with the floating

1102
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:16,860
Because when it was being projected from the inside they had they did it from the table like it's wired up through the table

1103
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:23,980
And when they started floating it again, I think now they have to follow it and I think somewhere there is something projecting

1104
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:31,500
Uh from outside onto the front of her face again, but where where is it in that room? Yeah, that's a very good question

1105
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:38,460
Um, it really is a testament. There's all of these things that we that we still aren't totally sure

1106
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,340
Even though we've been to these websites and we've read the books

1107
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:46,540
Um, I I honestly don't know or the explanation is so confusing that you're like, I don't know

1108
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:50,380
Well, i'll just pretend it's magic right because I can't keep it straight in my magic

1109
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:55,900
Um, I think one of the things that always worked on me as a kid

1110
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:00,700
Uh one the voice is I don't think she's given enough credit

1111
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:03,500
That was an actor named elinor oddly

1112
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:09,100
um, and she was the voice of maleficent and the um

1113
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:18,060
Stepmother the wicked stepmother in cinderella and kind of define that like disney villain voice. Oh, yeah that voice is

1114
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,860
Iconic, I guess I don't keep yeah keep saying is it epic?

1115
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:25,660
I mean it might be

1116
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:31,740
I think it is fair to say because I always think of leo de tombs like as an enthusiast of this stuff

1117
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:37,100
But I feel like she does not get enough credit. It's a great performance. It's a very well written

1118
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:45,100
Script too from yeah, extencio. It is the most like ice cold delivery that she had

1119
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,900
Like just the most like distant

1120
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,420
Cold delivery that is so like creepy

1121
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:56,780
Yeah, it's really great. Do we all want to take a turn? Do we all want to try some different lines?

1122
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,300
Um, I guess

1123
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,580
We're gonna do karaoke you're gonna challenge me i'll do it

1124
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:12,220
I wasn't expecting are we gonna do it like she did it. I think so

1125
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:17,340
We're just gonna do we're doing a reading sure why not it's church

1126
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:23,020
Shh people want to hear the lines people like to hear the hits, you know, all right people are saying

1127
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:30,380
They're saying it more and more and we're looking into it and we're going to make it happen

1128
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:33,900
All right. I do I have to find the complete ride transcript here

1129
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:40,300
Uh, I got i'm gonna try the creature one. I have it in the book right in front of me

1130
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,700
Okay, you go go ahead first. All right

1131
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:46,540
serpents and spiders tail of a rat

1132
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:49,980
At calling the spirits wherever they're at

1133
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:55,980
Damn people are shouting in their cars right now. They're freaking amped

1134
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:00,540
I think part of the addition as time goes on part of the thing that adds to it

1135
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:05,580
It's just the fact that like well, no one does like the mid-atlantic deliver like accent anymore

1136
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:11,260
No one does that old hollywood like well now listen here you like it's kind of like uh,

1137
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:16,540
Uh, the the upper crust characters in a marks brothers movie where it's just like

1138
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,740
A little stuffy and sinister, you know, should I am I gonna do the next line?

1139
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,620
Yeah, sure. Yeah, okay

1140
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,220
Wrap on a table. It's time to respond

1141
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,780
Some send us a message from somewhere beyond

1142
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,900
I almost had a dom parto there

1143
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,940
Yeah, somewhere be a table

1144
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:44,960
And you're with musical guest goblins and your host goolies

1145
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:51,740
Oh the dom parto overlay of haunted mansion we want to make that happen, please

1146
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:56,140
That's what tony wants it to yes. Um, is it my turn? It is your turn. Yeah

1147
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,700
Okay, let's see

1148
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:05,180
I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight

1149
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:12,460
For my monster from his slab began to rise and suddenly to my surprise

1150
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,900
He did the mash he did the mash

1151
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,460
Musical guest bobby boris pickett

1152
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:28,000
And host uh-oh that guy he stole it from don henson and the rigor morticians

1153
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,040
I don't like to editorialize in these voiceovers, but they're probably gonna get into a backstage fight

1154
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,320
Like bill and chevy did

1155
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,840
Um, all right, I don't think I got it right but that's close enough

1156
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,440
Yeah, that's pretty good, you know, we can't all be ellen or oddly, you know

1157
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:56,720
And she had time to rehearse. She had time to rehearse. I put everyone on the spot. She had a take there. Yeah

1158
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,520
uh, um, I mean so this is covered in the in the

1159
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:04,880
Imagineering story and it's sort of a famous thing but the there's the whole the thing about the bus

1160
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:10,320
So, uh the idea of projecting which comes back again in the graveyard later, obviously

1161
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:15,040
But the idea of projecting onto a bust I think was a raleigh crump idea

1162
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:22,000
Um, there was this there's this scary footage of one of the one of the great, uh, frequent disney voice actors hans

1163
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,020
Conn reed who I believe was captain hook this footage of him live action as the magic mirror

1164
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:33,380
In in snow white and it's from some special from the disney 50s tv special

1165
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:37,140
But that's like kind of a pure white face filmed over black

1166
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:41,460
And so they had that footage like what if he took that and you like put it onto a bust

1167
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,100
There was a bust of beithoven around

1168
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,660
uh, imagining somewhere so

1169
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:51,300
They they tried that it didn't sync up at all, but it was kind of cool

1170
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:55,780
Like well, it's a like sort of successful test. So then they realized well

1171
01:47:55,780 --> 01:48:01,460
what if we if we made it the bust of if we filmed somebody and then made the bust of them too and

1172
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:07,660
They came to leota tombs who did work as a sculptor for Imagineering

1173
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:15,060
She really downplays it. She when asked well, why is it you she says well because my eyes were the right distance apart

1174
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:17,380
So she's very like flippant

1175
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:19,380
About it

1176
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,700
Now they they did replace her voice

1177
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,780
um

1178
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:30,500
Yeah with elinor oddly but she is the voice of hurry back

1179
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:35,480
At the end. Yes, which is also an extremely good voice performance

1180
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:42,980
Um, so she gets her voice in there too. And I remember I remember learning that and being very surprised because something about like

1181
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:44,580
the

1182
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:49,380
I like the vibe that you get from the otto tombs and if they felt necessary necessary to change her voice

1183
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:54,280
I was wondering if her real voice was like awful. I was wondering if it was like lunch lady doris

1184
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:08,820
Send us a message from somewhere beyond hurry back. What do you mean? You don't like it. Give me a reading here

1185
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:10,820
Do it how you want it

1186
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:16,580
Um, cool, but a real voice is quite lovely and quite haunting and wonderfully used

1187
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,140
later in the attraction

1188
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:22,740
And then this is very like super covered in the imaginary story

1189
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:28,580
But if you don't know, uh, they did this again. They had to do new leota stuff for the haunted mansion holiday

1190
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:32,260
Uh, so but leota tombs had passed away. So how do you do that?

1191
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,380
How do you get somebody who could double so exactly and the effect didn't work?

1192
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:40,420
Uh when it was not the right face why her daughter kim irvine?

1193
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:46,100
Works at it works at imagineering still a major imagineering figure. These are both like not even just you know

1194
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:52,660
They don't like just do some odd job at imagineering. They're like major imagineers. Yeah, uh mother and daughter

1195
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:57,060
Yeah, so she got to participate in this and and do a tribute

1196
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:00,500
uh to her mom and then and it's so wonderful in the

1197
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:07,700
Uh in the documentary how she you know can take her kids on it and say there's there's grandma. That is very cool

1198
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:10,260
I like that that stays in the family

1199
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,540
um

1200
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:17,300
Kim we've talked about before is like been in charge of like the the small world project to put the ip on it

1201
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:23,940
And then she was doing the castle colors and she's just it seems like she's always stressed out by disney nerds

1202
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:28,920
Like being mad at her for like ruining for not being an originalist

1203
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,600
by the way, that's the name right now we're gonna use when it comes to people that don't want anything to change at the parks then

1204
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:39,640
A theme park originalist. I think that's good. It's a good little there's a little like stink to that

1205
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:46,040
Yes, good, and it makes us sound very academic. It makes sound very professional. We're using like language, you know

1206
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,680
term terminology

1207
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:54,920
I do we need a new one that isn't popular. I mean, I think populist works otherwise, but I know populist isn't a bad word

1208
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:57,400
But I try I don't know trump ran as a populist four years ago

1209
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,400
I mean he's not doing it now

1210
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:02,920
But is it but bernie's a popular? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I I sort of

1211
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,880
I just wanted it to be gone from the steve bannon trump use of it. Yeah. Yeah now being that

1212
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
Populism is not necessarily bad

1213
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:20,360
Okay marvin, I believe was also doing the newer entrance to anaheim's tomorrow land which was kind of in the works as the park shut

1214
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,320
down

1215
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:26,840
Uh back in march. Oh really? Okay, which was going well and that that's cool. Nice so far

1216
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,520
Yeah, clean line out of 98 trash aesthetic

1217
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:37,000
You know, I guess that's the one thing you can say about like I feel like the instruments

1218
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:41,080
you know, I guess the instruments floating were always there but

1219
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,720
That is kind of like there are some

1220
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:51,640
2000s aesthetic stuff throughout the mansion from plus ups that could be swapped out for something a little classier

1221
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:57,160
There is I don't know you don't have to fill that space in that room with anything crazy, but there are illusions

1222
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:04,760
Especially there's one in tower of terror in tokyo disney c there's an effect in the in the pre-show

1223
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:09,160
That is so amazing and they have something they've used in other things in the american parks

1224
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:12,120
But there's scott, you know i'm talking about there's a disappearance

1225
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:18,840
There's a disappearing thing that blew our minds so much you could employ these newer versions

1226
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:24,840
I'm sure it's just an old trick with a newer version. You can employ some new cool version of that trick in there

1227
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,400
You could i'm sure there's a couple

1228
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,440
Little things and again, you don't have to fill up the space or anything

1229
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:36,120
But I bet you really could take that room to another level with some like higher tech

1230
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:42,520
Illusion that would still feel like kind of low tech in its execution. Like yeah, you don't want it to be like

1231
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:46,120
You're not adding a transformer screen in that room

1232
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,440
Oh

1233
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:50,440
leona shoots a hug a

1234
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:55,720
Harpoon towards your car and then you fly along with her outside the mansion. Yeah

1235
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,080
Evac comes to help you

1236
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:06,760
Look out calling calling evac wherever you are. I'm here. Oh, no, that's optimus evac doesn't talk

1237
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,640
Yeah, we're we're evac sorry sorry and then I mean it's easier remember

1238
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:17,240
I guess we should count our blessings because if that haunted mansion movie had like

1239
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,240
like you know

1240
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,240
Broken records or like blowing the door off stuff like i'm sure

1241
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,640
jennifer tilley

1242
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:33,480
Would have been around or like they tony talked about like we thought about maybe adding some conservatory stuff to the loading area

1243
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,520
but then the movie came out and that was a whole thing and

1244
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,360
Yeah, it doesn't feel like it would have worked

1245
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:46,840
Good about jennifer tilley also the the second guest on the episode of leno that I appeared on right? Oh, yeah

1246
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,560
1994 all these

1247
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:54,060
Coincidences coming up this year garters and during retrograde

1248
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:59,640
Yeah, and a broken computer plug and a broken computer plug

1249
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:06,040
Um, so I don't want to trash this room. Sorry scott. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I um, yeah, there's something about yeah

1250
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:09,560
They just feel like a little like sheepo. Maybe those things spinning around in the air

1251
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,880
Yeah, and I feel like that didn't used to strike me and maybe another thing

1252
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:17,240
I like when the haunted mansion holiday rolls around that you get all those those cards and like what yeah

1253
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:22,520
I guess they're also 2d but that's just sort of the the estate like the haunted mansion all it is more like

1254
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:28,360
Silly 2d cartoony right in general. Yeah, yeah, and certainly more than the haunted mansion movie

1255
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,240
I watched a haunted mansion movie a couple years ago when I was like, oh this is

1256
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:36,680
it's it's this I appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into it, but I was like

1257
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:41,400
Oh, this movie is kind of a nervous like I was like, I don't know if I like this aesthetic

1258
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:45,160
You know, I think I like it when it's melded with the haunted mansion

1259
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:48,120
Mm-hmm, right?

1260
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,080
um

1261
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,200
Yeah, wait, well, I mean we didn't yeah, we didn't like that movie

1262
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,800
So you can listen to that from last year, but we did like the nelly video. That's where that's probably

1263
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:03,080
Oh, I mean nightmare before christmas the movie. Oh, didn't I wait? I think you said on a minute. Oh, no

1264
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,440
No, it yeah. No didn't really care for the haunted mansion movie

1265
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:11,560
Like the big digital bridge at the end the ponchon train. I believe I was corrected

1266
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,920
And of course, of course the great wallace shawn

1267
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:19,240
Oh, yeah, I mean, he's just a killer wallace shawn is the only

1268
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:22,840
Character in the movie that would be fine on the ride. I think

1269
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,640
Would fit seamlessly into the ride

1270
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,800
mike, do you feel like you're like

1271
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:34,440
Arguing like do you have like a villain in your head who doesn't like wallace shawn and you're like ready in every episode to

1272
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,240
Defend him go to war for on his behalf

1273
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:44,840
Uh, yes, I think I see anytime he comes up. I I imagine like a schoolyard bully who's like wallace shawn sucks

1274
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:51,080
And i'm like, no, he's not he's in a great actor very unique and a good playwright

1275
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:57,160
If there was that bully you would have even though that's such an offensive opinion

1276
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:03,000
You would almost have to try to become friends with him because like you'd be like, well, this is a weird kid

1277
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:07,880
That if he's making his bully stance being stridently anti wallace shawn

1278
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,400
Yeah

1279
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:13,000
I've seen my dinner with andre over 15 times and I can't get into it

1280
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,720
Wait a minute. Wait

1281
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,160
Maybe we were

1282
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:23,320
Did we just become best friends? The designated the timeline on the designated mortar doesn't make any sense

1283
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:28,120
Uh, I've seen his play five times in the first month of quarantine

1284
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,920
I read a book of his essays and two of his plays and the plays are the craziest fucking things

1285
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,560
The essays are very personal and endearing

1286
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:41,960
And just about society and and everything and he's so thoughtful and the plays are the most

1287
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:47,000
kookiest like dark absurd things and I was like, I cannot believe

1288
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:51,720
Because he usually plays a character in one of the plays so to read these

1289
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:56,200
These bonkers lines coming from his mouth is so crazy

1290
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,480
And i've told you the story of seeing that I assume on the podcast

1291
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,480
Yeah, I was sitting in front of armin shimmerman who played quark on deep space nine

1292
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:08,600
And wallace shawn played a faranghi also on deep space nine in a guest starring role a couple episodes

1293
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:14,760
And it uh at the halfway point when we all we all got up armin goes, huh? Oh, I thought it was over

1294
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,520
Well

1295
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
Well, I guess we'll see what happens next

1296
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
I

1297
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:24,280
Not know how plays worked he was just like that was long

1298
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,920
It's long. It is long. It's like close to three hours and then I hope you won't I hope you won't mind me telling the story

1299
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,400
But then ryan perez sort of hung around wallace and andre gregory who had directed the play which was crazy

1300
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:43,800
His co-star in my dinner with andre and he like kind of was hovering around a birthday celebration for andre

1301
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:50,600
That was happening in the lobby and he like he went up and said uh, good show to them

1302
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,160
And it was very nice. They were very nice

1303
01:57:53,960 --> 01:58:00,440
Yeah, well, I guess we're heading for our uh year-long intermission. Um on this series. We're almost there

1304
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,280
I I there's one more little thing I I had which is that um

1305
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:11,000
The I I didn't I I really never do this. This is I think is from doom buggies the website that there is a

1306
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,440
Uh you if you wanted to get out of your doom buggy and walk up to leota's table

1307
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:19,960
You could not do it because there is no floor there

1308
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:25,240
Uh, it is done in the dark so they don't build anything that you don't see

1309
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:31,480
Um, thus there is no floor. Why would you need it? It still is bizarre to me that i'm still like picture

1310
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,200
Like why would there be like a chasm but that is

1311
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,920
Uh, that is the case like there's a 15 foot drop if you tried to make that walk

1312
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,480
And somebody who worked there said they added a rope net one year. You've probably heard why

1313
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:49,640
And then the editor of the site fills in well because somebody once tried to leave their doom buggy and go to the table

1314
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:55,480
And then they they fell a pretty good distance. That's a giant fall. Gee. Yeah. Wow

1315
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:57,960
There's oh, there's a net there

1316
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
Yeah, there's a net

1317
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:04,200
And not only that for whatever reason I guess it's just I just don't

1318
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:07,880
It makes the this the room is going to be so much creepier to me next time I go in

1319
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:12,440
There because knowing that it's just this big chasm and there's a ton of space underneath

1320
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:15,160
That for whatever reason I guess just because like

1321
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,120
I don't know. Well, there's a bunch of empty space. We should do something with it

1322
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:25,240
There were a bunch of props and spare animatronics from other attractions sitting around under the circle. Oh my god

1323
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,960
And this I don't know the last name is pots

1324
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,000
I don't know who's saying all this but this person says when I was around

1325
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:37,000
A wendy figure from peter pan's flight was down there as well as spare crocodiles from the

1326
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,240
crocodiles from the train track, oh

1327
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,200
That's like the stuff of nightmares

1328
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Yeah, just unmoving

1329
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,560
Like mismatching animatronics. Well

1330
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:54,380
The plus up I have is let's see the moat that surrounds the table and fill it with crocodiles

1331
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:00,520
They have spare crocodiles ghost crocodiles surround the table in a moat

1332
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:06,200
And add a very quiet audio track of the wendy voice going

1333
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:07,240
help

1334
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,240
help me

1335
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,240
crocodiles help me

1336
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,240
There's crocodiles down here

1337
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,240
There's crocodiles down here help me

1338
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,240
And the body of a guy who fell two years ago and nobody spowned him

1339
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:21,240
This is also like this is just a pet peeve of mine. I feel like this is the room

1340
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:25,240
where someone fires off a flash

1341
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,240
the most because it is an interesting

1342
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:29,240
to upload and take a picture of

1343
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:33,240
and that just kills it because then your eyes have to read and I just hate that

1344
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:41,240
because everyone these flashes are automatic on phones now and it thinks it's dark it needs a flash and no one ever thinks to look

1345
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:45,240
So don't take pictures folks

1346
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,240
No

1347
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,240
No, you're not supposed to take pictures the whole place is dark

1348
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,240
Hey, I agree

1349
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,240
Have your chest mounted gopro

1350
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,240
If you do it, yes, make sure that flash is off

1351
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:57,240
Yeah

1352
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,240
Yes, anyway

1353
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,240
Well on that stern warning

1354
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:17,240
Look, Ernest Hemingway always said stop working when it's good and like stop working at a good stopping place and going from the seance circle into the next scene

1355
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:23,240
That's so great. That's perfect for us. That's such a great note to pick up on next year

1356
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,240
We're ending on an Ernest Hemingway lecture

1357
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,240
That's right

1358
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
He a ghost

1359
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,240
Ernest Hemingway always said this

1360
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,240
Alright, we'll be back

1361
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:39,240
And A, if you get to see his house in Cuba, check out Ernest Hemingway's ghost

1362
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,240
Is he a ghost or a ghoulie?

1363
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,240
I think he's a ghost

1364
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,240
Yeah

1365
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:53,240
I mean, yeah, are we agreed here or do we do like one arbitrary thing? What's like the closest thing in the ballroom?

1366
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:58,240
Could we say one thing or is there a cliffhanger?

1367
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:00,240
Handrail

1368
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:02,240
The handrail

1369
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:07,240
Start off the year. Yeah, there's a handrail, right? Isn't there a handrail preventing you from jumping out?

1370
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,240
You mean in front of the actual ballroom?

1371
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,240
In front of the ballroom window

1372
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:14,240
I mean, yeah, there's something like that

1373
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:31,240
Okay, so the handrail, because I like that thing that we like, I like to teaser for last time. Is there anything we can throw out? I'm like watching the ride through. Is there one little thing?

1374
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:44,240
Well, you know what's a name we can, I know, I know, because I like shouting a name for energy at the top. Let's next year start with the name of the guy who's kind of drunk and hanging off of the chandelier

1375
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,240
Oh, of course. Yes, yes, yes, that's good. Perfect

1376
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:55,240
That's a good thing to shout. We will celebrate the accomplishments of that ghost at the top of next year's episode

1377
02:02:55,240 --> 02:03:03,240
That's good. Should we negotiate how many minutes this room is going to take?

1378
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,240
There's a lot of characters in here.

1379
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,240
Should we settle on it now?

1380
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:08,240
Well, no, maybe, or maybe that's a poof.

1381
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,240
We decide now. How do we decide though? Because we will never gonna, we're never gonna come to terms.

1382
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:17,240
Yeah. Well, Jason and I, 45 minutes I think each one.

1383
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:27,240
Now you think at 90 minutes. Look, I already lost. I wrote down, I lost the prop bet with myself that we would stop at the end of the corridor of doors. So that's okay.

1384
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:28,240
That's only two rooms.

1385
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:32,240
No, that's three rooms. The endless hallway, the conservatory, the corridor of doors.

1386
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:40,240
Here's what I'll say. Here's what I'll say. I think in my head when we started this, I thought it would be fun if the one year was just Hatbox Ghost.

1387
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:48,240
So next year would just have to be Attic and Ballroom.

1388
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,240
Yeah, I guess.

1389
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,240
Well, you get into.

1390
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:52,240
Because Hatbox is its own episode.

1391
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:53,240
It's a lot of changes.

1392
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,240
In what, 2022?

1393
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,240
Yeah.

1394
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:56,240
I think it's fun.

1395
02:03:56,240 --> 02:04:00,240
This is, I'm going to have a high schooler by the time we're done with this.

1396
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:01,240
He'll be going to the show.

1397
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:04,240
I'm going to be bidding him a due to, yeah, he could be the guest.

1398
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:10,240
You will be, and that episode like Boratu will be a love letter to your teenage daughter, you know?

1399
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,240
That's right.

1400
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,240
The one you predicted.

1401
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:14,240
Like, yes.

1402
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:20,240
Honestly, that's not so crazy because then at that point it's the graveyard and the end follow you home.

1403
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:25,240
The ballroom is dense. It's very dense. I think we can all agree on that.

1404
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:30,240
I mean, that means there's really just three episodes of Haunted Mansion proper left.

1405
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:31,240
That's not so bad.

1406
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,240
That's not crazy.

1407
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:33,240
Yeah.

1408
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,240
I guess that's not bad.

1409
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,240
Yeah.

1410
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:37,240
All right.

1411
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:40,240
I guess when you put it that way, we got to commit to that three, I think.

1412
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:42,240
Okay. I'll commit to the three.

1413
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:44,240
We can get it done in three.

1414
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:45,240
Yeah. Three more years.

1415
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:46,240
For Anaheim.

1416
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:47,240
Which will bring it to Anaheim.

1417
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:48,240
For Anaheim, of course.

1418
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,240
For Anaheim.

1419
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:50,240
Oh, man.

1420
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,240
Yeah.

1421
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,240
There's a multiple Haunted Mansions.

1422
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,240
For Anaheim, three more, I think.

1423
02:04:55,240 --> 02:05:00,240
I'm going to start learning French now, let alone.

1424
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:05,240
All right. Well, we'll negotiate the terms here.

1425
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:14,240
All right. Well, with that, you survived Huntcast, The Fright, Year 3, and the whole thing.

1426
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:16,240
I hope you had fun.

1427
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:23,240
We covered a lot of ground, some silly shows, and some bagged Halloween costumes, and some Eddie, Frank, and Murphy.

1428
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:26,240
That was a blast in general.

1429
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:31,240
And I don't know, any thoughts about 2021?

1430
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,240
Do we dare?

1431
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:35,240
I don't want to be on record.

1432
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,240
Yes, in this case.

1433
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:41,240
Things are a tad in flux.

1434
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,240
Almost anything is on the table.

1435
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:44,240
Everything is tense.

1436
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,240
Everyone is tense.

1437
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,240
Yeah.

1438
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:55,240
I'm just happy that no matter what, we don't this time have to say, well, next year, boys, you'll be heading for an election.

1439
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,240
Yes, that's true.

1440
02:05:56,240 --> 02:06:01,240
And we'll be done with Disneyland, Son of Mansion before the next election.

1441
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:02,240
Yeah.

1442
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,240
Well, all right.

1443
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:04,240
Yeah.

1444
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:07,240
When you put it that way, there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

1445
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,240
Right. Not so bad.

1446
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:13,240
We'll almost be 40.

1447
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,240
Insane.

1448
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,240
This is getting close to 40.

1449
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:19,240
I've had no plans for what happens in the next five years in my life.

1450
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:28,240
The only things I know now are that we'll be doing the What's Different in Disney World in 2024.

1451
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,240
Exactly.

1452
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:30,240
I have one plan.

1453
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,240
It's good to be present.

1454
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:47,240
I've been reading a book on Zen Buddhism, and I learned that our delusions and attachments are the things from keeping us from realizing in enlightenment that we are all the Buddha.

1455
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,240
I do know.

1456
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,240
Whoa.

1457
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,240
See.

1458
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,240
Also, subscribe to our Patreon.

1459
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:56,240
It's patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1460
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:59,240
Yeah, that's the wisest of them all would say do that.

1461
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:00,240
Yes, sir.

1462
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:12,240
I will say if unless we have anything else, I would like to go out playing Don Hinson and the Rigor Morticians, riboflavin flavored non carbonated poly unsaturated blood.

1463
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:13,240
If you would allow me.

1464
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,240
That sounds right.

1465
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:15,240
Yeah.

1466
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:20,240
Let's just play the first half of the first verse and then we'll do the second half of the first verse in 2021.

1467
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:29,240
Happy Halloween, everybody.

1468
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:37,240
When the moon arises in the western sky, and the vampires are out on the slide.

1469
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:53,240
At times they have trouble finding next to bite. That's why I concocted my new delight. My rival flavor, non carbonated poly unsaturated blood.

1470
02:07:53,240 --> 02:08:08,240
Forever.

1471
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:27,240
Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehm, Joe Sileo and Alex Ramsey.

1472
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:39,240
