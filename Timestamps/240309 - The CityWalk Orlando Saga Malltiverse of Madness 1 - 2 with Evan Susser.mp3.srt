1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,180
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,760
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,320
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,880
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,960
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,000
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,350
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,250
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,310
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,760
So let's go take a walk.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,260
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Multiverse of madness.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,360
A daily, extremely necessary series.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,100
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,280
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,680
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the City Walk Orlando Saga.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,680
Multiverse of madness.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,660
Day two, we are back.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,340
I hope you listened yesterday.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,660
I hope the only way you're consuming this is every day.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,800
Because hearing it back after the fact, with days in between,

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,000
it's not how we're doing it.

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,440
It shouldn't be how you're doing it.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm Scott Gardner.

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,720
There's Mike Carlson.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,560
Hey, I'm here and I hope the reality for you listeners is setting in

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,900
to know that this is coming out every day and that you're not going to be able to keep up with it.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,220
Unless you give up like important parts of your daily routine.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,740
Yeah.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,420
So you need to realize that right now.

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,500
There's Jason Sheridan.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,080
Hi.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,060
We're asking a lot of you.

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,440
Yeah.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,020
Look, if you're, if you're worried about your phone storage space,

38
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,160
turn off the automatic download.

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,700
Follow the episode.

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,420
I don't know what.

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,360
What are you doing?

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,120
It's madness.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,860
We need those downloads.

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,440
That equals cash.

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,500
Get the downloads, but turn on the delete after you listen.

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,620
No, don't do that.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,480
What if they need to listen to it again?

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,520
Patreon ultimately is the answer to all of this.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,860
For the full multiverse of madness experience, go to patreon.

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,020
com slash podcast thread.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,820
It'll solve all of this somehow.

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,940
I would imagine.

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,420
I hope.

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,240
But hey, that's not everybody.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,500
We got to bring the other, the other guy in the mix.

56
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,560
Wait, he's not here again.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
So we have to say the full thing.

58
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,740
Basin is now Sunook.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Is now California's soul.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,760
Boys, boys, it's good to be back.

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,320
Hey, hey, how you guys doing?

62
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,500
You guys, you spent the night together.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,740
We can spend the night together.

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,820
That's the way it sounds.

65
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,360
I stayed at Mike's place, man.

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,380
You've also to catch you up from, you know, yesterday.

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,620
Not only is the sector keeper joining us every day, he's also crashing with us.

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,080
Yeah.

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
Does he have anywhere else to go?

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,980
That's kind of in question, but I don't know.

72
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,300
We're trying to be gentlemen here.

73
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,820
Yeah, it's just kind of a little bit of a rough patch.

74
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,480
And I'm so thankful for it.

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,220
Mike, man, your place is, you got a sweet little pad.

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,080
Yeah, I had to clear.

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
He's sleeping on a shelf.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,480
I had to clear some mighty mutanimals action figures away for him to have some space.

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,560
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,320
When I walked in, I was like, is this your apartment or a KB toy store, man?

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,380
Yeah, he said that, which is a good burn.

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,820
Funny burns.

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
It's a nice thing for it.

84
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,840
That's what he wants.

85
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,600
He's a child.

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,080
I was like, I giggled with Kalee when you said it.

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,900
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,080
We stayed up most of the night, man, just playing.

89
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,200
Yeah, we were playing.

90
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,060
And yeah, I just recently got the sewer playset so I can really like make a little like diorama

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,140
of the Ninja Turtles characters hanging out.

92
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,940
Where do they, where do the ones, what do the ones go when you're not playing with them?

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Because you have.

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,340
Oh, there's, well, they're on different shelves.

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,620
There's other little dioramas.

96
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,680
There's a street diorama.

97
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,540
I can put them on and then I can.

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,880
There's a lot of different places for them if they're not participating in the actual

99
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
sewer layer diorama.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,040
I know I'm scheduled to be passed off to Scott tonight, but Scott, can I stay at Mike's tonight?

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Oh, geez.

102
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,640
I mean, I was really looking forward to it, but oh, if you might, I don't want to get

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,860
in the way of all that fun.

104
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,080
You know what?

105
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,240
All right.

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,760
I guess I can deal.

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,620
All right.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,100
All right.

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,440
Oh, man.

110
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,080
Let's bring our guest into it.

111
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,560
The first.

112
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,800
We have so many questions so far.

113
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,580
Well, you'll be an audience surrogate.

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,240
We can, we can catch you up.

116
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,380
Hey, the first guest of the saga joining us from Peacock's Killing It and from, of course,

117
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,460
Illumination's Villain Con Minion Blast at Universal Studios Florida.

118
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,720
It's Evan Susser.

119
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,920
Hey, guys.

120
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,200
Excited to be here.

121
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Excited to be returning to CityWalk, but a different CityWalk, and excited to finally

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,920
face be face to face with the Sector Keeper himself.

123
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,720
I know he just beamed in for our assignment last time.

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,620
You guys are together now.

125
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,860
I was curious, the Sector Keeper, you are the same Sector Keeper from the CityWalk saga

126
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,900
in California, or is this from like another dimension?

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,100
No, no, I'm the same one.

128
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,160
I got a little confused by the multiverse of madness.

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,990
Excuse me, the multiverse.

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,160
Multiverse.

131
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,480
Multiverse.

132
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,300
I didn't see it written.

133
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,120
I heard it said, I like that a lot.

134
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,180
This is good because you may not, you may not be the only one with questions.

135
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
I don't understand it all now.

136
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,500
And naturally, so, and you're, the conceit is that this is being recorded here in California?

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,740
Yes.

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

139
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,900
We were sent on a mission.

140
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,500
So why did he need to, does Sector Keeper, don't you usually live at CityWalk in California?

141
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
Yeah, it's like my home base.

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,520
Right.

143
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,340
So why do you need to sleep in people's houses?

144
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,180
You're still only 15 minutes away.

145
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,920
You missed a lot of story yesterday.

146
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,700
Yeah, no, the multiverse, he frees him up to kind of go, he can transport wherever using,

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,280
you know, jump points and gates and wormholes.

148
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, okay, yes, that makes sense.

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,440
Jump points.

150
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,040
Got it.

151
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,200
Sensor Jump Points.

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:07,760
Jump points.

153
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,280
I understand.

154
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,880
He's lived in our real world for many years.

155
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,940
He had a job at Cricket Wireless for many years.

156
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,700
So he's sort of just been hanging out.

157
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,140
Kind of a liminal scan.

158
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,720
I got caught up in what I'll call a commune.

159
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,520
Uh-huh.

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah.

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,340
So you're pretty self-sufficient, it seems like.

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,160
So then why do you need to be sleeping at people's houses?

163
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,100
I just, it's nice to have like…

164
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,100
Oh, it's just fun.

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,260
Well, like Jason said, three hots and a cot, man.

166
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,820
I get it.

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,660
Yeah, okay.

168
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,320
He's also…

169
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,360
Back in the park.

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,020
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,360
A lot of his, there's a bunch of his ghost cousins who seem to be like bilking him out

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,780
of his watery winnings.

173
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,700
He won a Powerball, naturally.

174
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,980
At least.

175
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,940
I won the Powerball.

176
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,020
Oh, cool, congratulations.

177
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,520
Well, it's actually been a curse.

178
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

179
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm one of those kind of like cautionary tales.

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,560
Oh, no.

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
I did a Reddit on it.

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,200
I did an AMI.

183
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,880
No, but I don't need to look it up.

184
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,040
I got it.

185
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Seriously.

186
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,640
Spend some more time with it.

187
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,380
I want to hear the whole story.

188
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
He also asked a bunch of questions and was trying to get out of the questions almost immediately.

189
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,880
Eventually, I had a spill of questions.

190
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,060
No, the point is it's like, you know, it's kind of, we've ended up in this multiverse

191
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,680
situation.

192
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
It's like, you know, it's a multiverse scenario.

193
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,360
Like the kind you'd see…

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
That time he did say multiverse.

195
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,440
He said multiverse.

196
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,740
No, no, I'm saying the multiverse is a multiverse scenario.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,640
It's like the kind of thing you'd see in a movie, like a superhero movie.

198
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,540
I don't know.

199
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
I didn't make that connection until now, but I get it now.

200
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,260
Yeah, well, it's kind of like something in like The Flash.

201
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,180
Right.

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,100
Do you ever see The Flash?

203
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Do you ever get a chance to check out that flick?

204
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,720
You know, I have seen The Flash.

205
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,380
What did you think of The Flash?

206
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,160
You know, I didn't really care for it.

207
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,600
I understand this has been a source of some debate on the podcast.

208
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,860
Yeah, yes.

209
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,480
Interesting.

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,220
That's weird that you say that you didn't care for it because when this came up for

211
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,800
the first time on a Patreon episode called Holiday in Holodomes…

212
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
Yeah, Jason's birthday shot.

213
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,560
Jason's birthday shot was deviated from when Mike said one of the most insane things I've

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,280
heard a person say in a while.

215
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,880
What you said in the episode was that the Ezra Miller, The Flash from last year was

216
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,280
not as bad as everyone is saying it is.

217
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,120
Yes, that is what I said.

218
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
And I screamed at this.

219
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,740
The only logical reaction.

220
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,480
The maddest I've ever seen him for real.

221
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,040
I did.

222
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,920
I leaned back from the microphone.

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,540
Mike!

224
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,320
Jason said, please don't fight on my birthday.

225
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,380
I just started bawling.

226
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,300
I think it was stored up.

227
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah, that was from an old memory coming back.

228
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,760
But here's what, now because I've questioned this opinion, because The Flash, many people

229
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,520
have said it is quite terrible and I would certainly side with them.

230
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,060
This was not your feeling apparently and what you spit out was other people you respect

231
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
agree with the movie.

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,380
Well, hold on.

233
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,360
What I said was The Flash was not that bad.

234
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,800
First of all, which is not The Flash is amazing or The Flash is my favorite movie.

235
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh, I know.

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,340
I know.

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,380
You went back and listened.

238
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,840
And then I specifically said the parts of The Flash I like, including the first half

239
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,320
and what aspects of it I like.

240
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,920
And then I said, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, that other people agreed with me.

241
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,260
Only about that part?

242
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,840
Well, I was specifying the parts where someone would agree with me versus maybe somebody

243
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,820
saying the whole Flash movie was good or not that good.

244
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,440
In my head, we were still at general movie.

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,220
But, Keeper, you want to go get a hoagie or something?

246
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,080
I feel like we're not needed for the podcast.

247
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,860
No, chime in.

248
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,240
Brother, I thought you'd never ask.

249
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,260
Yeah, you guys go get a bite.

250
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,480
I think, look, I think, yes, in general, I was saying I was enjoying The Flash more than I thought

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
because I went into it thinking, oh, this is going to be a big pile of dog shit.

252
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,700
And it was not a big pile of dog shit.

253
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,040
It was maybe a smaller one.

254
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,560
Okay.

255
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,800
And what you're saying is very reasonable.

256
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,160
I still think it's a crackpot opinion.

257
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,580
Well, that's fine.

258
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,320
I think Giants is the only one.

259
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I watched this film.

260
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,340
Somehow I got roped into this whole thing.

261
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Well, I got screamed at to say, give up your sources.

262
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,760
Name names, I said.

263
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,900
I would go up so quickly if I was under interrogation.

264
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,820
If I was being waterboarded, it would come out in two seconds.

265
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,940
Who else said something positive about The Flash?

266
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,720
I can't point fingers.

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
I flipped on Sam Bankman Friedman.

268
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,960
Oh, no.

269
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,080
Were you mixed up in that, Sector Keeper?

270
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,600
Because of a jump point?

271
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,740
Because of a jump point.

272
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,880
Jump point brought him right into the crypto.

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,600
Yeah.

274
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,060
This is hard.

275
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,800
I won the Powerball.

276
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,340
Were you in that relationship with him and the girl?

277
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,420
Yeah, the polycule.

278
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
I flipped on the polycule.

279
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,880
No, it's good to recap.

280
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,980
No, no, no.

281
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,860
No, and to clarify, this one's not change.

282
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,420
It's not a mollycule.

283
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,160
It's a polycule.

284
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
That one is regular.

285
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,320
That's regular.

286
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,400
One dimension.

287
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,740
Many bodies.

288
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,540
Under this pressure, you named your own wife and you named Evan Suser as a person who agreed

289
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,440
that in my head, we could parse what that is, but I feel like it was saying that you,

290
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,780
that Suser generally thought The Flash was not as bad as everyone's been saying.

291
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,520
I believe the sequence of words backs what I'm saying up.

292
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,120
But it was in the heat of the moment.

293
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,740
I don't know.

294
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,740
Maybe things were placed in the wrong position as far as, so I'm not even sure.

295
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,780
I can't quite remember.

296
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,640
It's a real Rochamon.

297
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,060
It's a bit of a Rochamon.

298
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,380
I even couldn't, you know, I wasn't under such duress.

299
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,380
Actually, the biggest.

300
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,420
A movie I do like.

301
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,420
The biggest.

302
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,100
Well, I hate that.

303
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,380
Not a divisive opinion.

304
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,380
Is it part of a cinematic universe of some kind?

305
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,120
If only.

306
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,300
Or Salo was a chump.

307
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,860
He only made one movie at a time.

308
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,140
He wasn't setting up nine.

309
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,020
I should have said, you know what I should have said?

310
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,380
Andrew Grissom, friend of the show, is also a liker of parts of The Flash.

311
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,600
What do you mean?

312
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,500
I'll investigate that one.

313
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,460
Text them right now.

314
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,420
Say, are there parts of The Flash you like?

315
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,040
Or amused or enjoyable?

316
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,980
Let me get into, let me bring up, because this opinion stayed with me for hours.

317
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,640
We were done with the recording for hours.

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,300
And I texted the both of you and I said, guys, you're insane.

319
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,900
And Suser was like, what are we talking about?

320
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
And I said, wait a minute, I have the transcripts.

321
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,580
The two Esras is one of the most irritating things I've ever seen.

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,600
That's the part I was talking about.

323
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,300
You're insane.

324
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,240
Your response was LOL what?

325
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
All caps.

326
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,340
And soon after you said, I said I hated the movie.

327
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,420
You know, this is like pretty niche and specific.

328
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,680
And we should get onto the much broader appeal of breaking down Orlando City Walk.

329
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,260
Of course.

330
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,880
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,420
We can do a tangent time, by the way.

332
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,360
Oh, sure.

333
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,580
We can cut this off.

334
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,480
But we better set it soon because I have more stuff.

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,300
I have things.

336
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,700
We'll say this is like a portal.

337
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,060
We're in a portal right now.

338
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,840
Well, that's true.

339
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,840
We're all just, we're all slowing down time to talk about this for who knows, an hour,

340
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,580
an hour and a half.

341
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,880
And if there's a cosmic treadmill in here, oh boy.

342
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
Well, it's going to take a while.

343
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,120
I guess I'm curious just for your thoughts about this, because I felt like we're discovering that in that moment.

344
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,300
I think that Mike's Mike had severely misinterpreted your take on this.

345
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:34,900
Yeah, I would say there's a little bit of a misinterpretation, but also maybe a little bit of, you know, a little bit of a witch hunt going on here, Scott.

346
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,400
Who me?

347
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,260
Does this seem like the kind of thing I do on this?

348
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,860
I did not enjoy the movie.

349
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,640
I watched it, I think, partially because Carlson Mike had said, oh, it's actually not that bad.

350
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,860
And I think I initiated the conversation by saying you're wrong.

351
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,960
Well, you said I'm not sure if it's not so, but you are not sure I can get on board with the it's not so bad thing.

352
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

353
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,880
Yes.

354
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:10,020
And then I think that, you know, but Mike's a very persuasive and likeable guy.

355
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,460
And you know, even on text and even on text, it comes through.

356
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah, but the part with the as a person, I guess, got some other parts.

357
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:24,160
I guess we broke some other parts that I really didn't like, including him saving a baby in space.

358
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,740
Now that's a different we all deserve.

359
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,860
I I believe the baby scene is good.

360
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,960
So the Mike and you and you're trying to save face right now.

361
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,440
And you're doing that by saying I have compiled a flash report.

362
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:46,700
This is a printout with a logo of the physical report is a revelation that Mike has a functioning printer.

363
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,640
And you said that to me once before you're baffled by someone having a printer.

364
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,540
I all mine.

365
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,880
I'd like just keep breaking.

366
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,300
Like how many printers are broke?

367
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,500
Two or three.

368
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,800
I feel like I don't think it's a strange thing.

369
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
So do you have a printer?

370
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,920
I do have a printer.

371
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,020
I think a lot of people.

372
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,060
I'm going to the library.

373
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm going to FedEx, Kinko's.

374
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
They give away printers.

375
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,780
I got too many printers.

376
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,560
I got one in the garage.

377
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,020
It's not up.

378
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,940
Give one to Jason.

379
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,580
Give it to Jason.

380
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,060
What kind of printer is it?

381
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,920
You're going to ask.

382
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,060
I just take it.

383
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,200
You want to go to the library.

384
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,840
You want to pay per copy.

385
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,320
Is it a 3D printer?

386
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,360
That's a gift.

387
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,220
Are you paying taxes?

388
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,180
You get gifted a plastic printer.

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,240
Is it a sandwich printer?

390
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,880
What's in your report, Michael?

391
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,360
Well, I just have time code and different lines and things.

392
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,360
We don't have to read all of it.

393
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm just saying I went through some of the scenes that I liked.

394
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,760
I said two and basically the way HBO Max or now Max plays it, it kind of counts down sort of what you have left.

395
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,260
So, you know, two hours, 23 minutes, 29 seconds.

396
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,920
I like the actor playing the barista.

397
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,060
And I believe I haven't even agreed with me that he liked this guy and some of the lines, especially this.

398
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,120
You can't rush a good sandwich dude line.

399
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,320
I believe we agreed.

400
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,300
Wait a minute.

401
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,980
Wait a minute.

402
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:11,720
Me saying that a movie is a giant pile of shit, like truly an era defining shows you everything that's wrong with that's rotten in our culture right now.

403
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,100
A movie like that can have two, one actor who doesn't fuck up.

404
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,740
There's a couple more things in this report.

405
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,980
This is a report here fully of different things we'd like.

406
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,280
Again, I don't have to read all of it.

407
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,340
I'm just saying there's enough things to add up here.

408
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,340
There's a lot of pages.

409
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, go to the middle.

410
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,020
What's in the middle?

411
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,220
And publish the whole report.

412
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,500
Publish the flash paper.

413
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,760
All right.

414
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,720
I'll publish the whole.

415
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,120
Hold on.

416
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,760
Where's the middle?

417
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,100
And if things are lagging in the episode, throw out a random part of the flash you like.

418
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,800
That'll pick it up.

419
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,260
That's good.

420
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,100
Yeah, that's good.

421
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,020
Hold on one second.

422
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,580
Where's the middle?

423
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,920
Blow away in the wind.

424
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
We got the garage door open.

425
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,440
All right.

426
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Hold on.

427
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,260
Let me just read.

428
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,540
Hold on.

429
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,200
Let me read the middle of this thing.

430
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,400
Once you finish reading this, can you explain how this leaked on WikiLeaks?

431
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,760
When Ezra says that he goes, he goes, Ezra says the mic just cut out when I tried to talk.

432
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,260
That's never happened before.

433
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,280
The mic cut out.

434
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,900
It's the ghost of Nick Mundy.

435
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,360
Oh, no, it is.

436
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
He teleported.

437
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:08,760
Wow.

438
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,600
The multiverse is full of magical things.

439
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,160
Do you need to replug in your microphone?

440
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,280
No, it's fine now.

441
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,520
Wow.

442
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,440
It literally shorted out when I was trying to talk.

443
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,400
It's like the world's trying to tell you something about the flash.

444
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,520
When Ezra says he has to, he goes, shit.

445
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,880
And he goes, I have to shit.

446
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,820
That's funny.

447
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,140
That was a funny line.

448
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,100
Did I agree with that?

449
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,260
We never talked about that line.

450
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,960
I can't imagine I agreed with that.

451
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,080
I think you forgot it, though.

452
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,660
We never talked about it.

453
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,080
Also, in your text exchange, there was something you said.

454
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,280
OK, after a while of Carlson defending it, I maybe said, I guess that the two Ezras are an OK part.

455
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,000
When you said it was the best stuff in the movie, but I said the movie was terrible.

456
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,120
So to me, that was a very low bar.

457
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,360
I don't believe I believe.

458
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,300
I mean, fair enough, he was being nice to me.

459
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,560
He never said terrible.

460
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,040
You did say you were right.

461
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,920
You said you were right.

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,140
The movie really fell off in the second half.

463
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,520
Yes.

464
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,140
It does get even worse.

465
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,340
The second half of the movie is bad.

466
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,540
Don't get me wrong.

467
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,140
You are not arguing this.

468
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,740
There's a part where they call Boba Fett, the guy who plays Boba Fett.

469
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,520
You remember this?

470
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:12,820
No.

471
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,120
And then he thinks he's the he thinks he's Aquaman.

472
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,580
And he said he's like, is this Arthur Curry?

473
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,380
And he goes, yeah, yeah.

474
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,320
And then he goes, is your wife the queen of Atlantis?

475
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,540
And then he looks over and this is like a lady with a sweatshirt looking at the TV.

476
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,220
Funny, funny stuff.

477
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,960
You don't even remember.

478
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,960
I know we're rushing.

479
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,900
We that one.

480
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
And I don't want to do this.

481
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,280
I think I need like a five minute breakdown of that to understand what that block of words even meant.

482
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:34,860
All right.

483
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Well, we don't have to laugh.

484
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm trying to.

485
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,200
You should laugh.

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,040
First of all, just do me the favor and everyone laugh about it right now.

487
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,960
Is it just that he's a guy?

488
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,140
Only says he's the only true friend.

489
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,440
He's going to a different universe where there's no Aquaman, where there's not any meta humans anymore.

490
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:49,720
Oh, OK.

491
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,020
So he's calling around to figure out who actually is still around.

492
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,860
Boys, boys.

493
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:06,660
You're probably a good time to remember that the sector keeper has in the past, you've, you know, coughed and lost strength when we weren't staying on topic.

494
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,960
If you feel if you need to cough, feel free to cough.

495
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
Oh, goodness gracious.

496
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,820
I'm just trying to keep wrap my head around what's.

497
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,280
You seem like you fell asleep during most of that with a cigarette hanging out of your mouth and you really should be careful about that.

498
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,660
Yeah.

499
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,300
Get off my back, man.

500
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,200
All right.

501
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,720
This is what's going to happen if you go stay with Jason.

502
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,920
If you spend the weekend with then he's going to be.

503
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,280
Wait a minute.

504
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,340
I should be building up Jason.

505
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,500
No, you'll have a fun time with Jason.

506
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,820
Yeah.

507
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,560
This guy has the hot dogs for every meal.

508
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,760
You'll have so many hot dogs.

509
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
That's right.

510
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Get over there.

511
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,280
Jason can prepare hot dogs nine different ways.

512
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,040
Sure.

513
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,100
Boiled pan fried boiled then pan fried.

514
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,760
Oh, wow.

515
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,600
Baked.

516
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,980
Grilled.

517
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,860
Huh?

518
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,600
Grilled.

519
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,220
Grilled.

520
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,780
Blended.

521
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
Put into a blender.

522
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,480
Drank like a milkshake.

523
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,380
That's a little ridiculous, but yeah.

524
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm just trying to get to nine.

525
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,660
Sous vide.

526
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,860
Raw.

527
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,240
Raw.

528
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,620
It's kind of nasty.

529
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
What are we at?

530
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,100
Seven.

531
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,240
Okay.

532
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,280
Broiled.

533
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,820
Different from boiled.

534
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah.

535
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,180
One letter off.

536
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,760
Yeah.

537
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,400
One letter off.

538
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,120
In blankets?

539
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,120
Yeah.

540
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:16,960
In blankets.

541
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,620
Blanketed.

542
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,300
Blanketed.

543
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,860
Like baked.

544
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:19,920
Hey.

545
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,660
We didn't even get to deep frying.

546
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:23,840
Yeah.

547
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,300
That's true.

548
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,220
Bonus points.

549
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,040
Mike, can I stay at Jason's tonight?

550
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,960
Well, if.

551
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Yeah.

552
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,220
Thanks.

553
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,160
Yay.

554
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,240
Have fun.

555
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,400
Hot dogs, 10 ways for you.

556
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,140
Okay.

557
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,700
Well, look, maybe we should move to our assignments.

558
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,740
Sector keeper, can you give us today's.

559
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
Susser, you'll be interested to know it's now not just sectors.

560
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,900
It's also there's phases.

561
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,700
Oh yeah.

562
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,080
I figured.

563
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,640
Okay.

564
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,480
Yes.

565
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,060
Of course.

566
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,860
Of course.

567
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,320
Boys, boys.

568
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,560
Susser.

569
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,800
Thank you so much.

570
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,760
You give me strength.

571
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,320
Thank you for being here.

572
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,660
I don't know why I'm starting this.

573
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,860
Like a keynote.

574
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,840
You're a good person.

575
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
A good father.

576
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,780
Phase one, sector two.

577
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,020
Voodoo donut.

578
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,720
Auntie Anne's.

579
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
And waterfront kiosks.

580
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:09,980
North.

581
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,540
Or as I know it, sapphire.

582
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,040
Oh, wait, you've given us a new mechanism here.

583
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,860
So north.

584
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay.

585
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,500
Well, there's different gemstones.

586
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
Designate different kiosk zones.

587
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay.

588
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,560
So if you had a jump point, make sure that you have that particular gemstone.

589
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,580
You have to have it with you, the gemstone?

590
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,000
Someone should have it on.

591
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,620
Oh.

592
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,100
Wait a minute.

593
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,520
Sorry.

594
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,880
This is like that flash joke.

595
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,540
Say it again.

596
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,920
The, I, in order, if we're at a jump point, we need to make sure that we have our sapphire

597
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,420
gem that we'll get after the end of this.

598
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,860
Yeah.

599
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,980
And the joke is I've got a shit.

600
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
He says it is funny.

601
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,740
I wish there were two sector keepers.

602
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,680
Oh, maybe in the future.

603
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:00,920
Yay.

604
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,900
Oh, the flash has given us all kinds of ideas.

605
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,200
Okay.

606
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,540
Well, I think you, you, oh, and you know what?

607
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,680
A little bit of backstory.

608
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:16,060
We, Evan, we had you on recently to talk about the ride that you wrote, Villain Con, Minion

609
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,540
Blast.

610
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,500
And when you were down there doing actual Universal Studios work, we pounced on you.

611
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,960
Wait a minute.

612
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,720
Suster's there.

613
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,180
We got to get him to do something.

614
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,080
This was a long time ago now.

615
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,440
I have no idea how long ago.

616
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
A long time.

617
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,260
But you, you said, hey, while you're down there, can you head over to City Walk?

618
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,480
And, you know, it was pretty busy when I was down there.

619
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,320
It was, and I was like, you know, from start to finish, it was a 12 hour day.

620
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,500
But, you know, day ended and I said, well, I've made a promise.

621
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,420
Sorry.

622
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,240
I was staying.

623
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,620
Much less well paid work.

624
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,820
I was staying at Royal Pacific, not too bad, on Universal.

625
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,280
And hopped on the boat and took a little cruise down to City Walk, which I don't know.

626
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,300
I assume you guys have, you know, a little bit like painted the picture of what Orlando City Walk is like.

627
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,920
Maybe not enough still.

628
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:18,100
But the fact that you do take like, that it is all along a lake or a big waterway and that boats or water taxis, as we'll get into tomorrow, maybe it should have been in your sector.

629
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,420
We had flash stuff to go over though.

630
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,480
But the hotels connect City Walk and then you can walk to the theme parks.

631
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:34,580
Yeah, so it was, it was really great just to be on that boat and just see, I could see as I approached the Voodoo Donuts, which on the one hand I said, is this insane?

632
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:43,360
There's a Voodoo Donuts that I can go to any time that's 12 minutes from my house and I'm exhausted, but I got to get on this boat.

633
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,800
This specific Voodoo Donuts.

634
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,060
I go to this specific Voodoo Donuts, which I don't even think they have a regionally specific menu, but okay.

635
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,060
And do you like the first Voodoo Donuts?

636
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,080
No, I don't.

637
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:06,290
Yeah, no, it's not particularly, but I, so I got there and it's so much more as you mentioned Sector Keeper because it's also the waterfront north or sapphire kiosk.

638
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,760
Yes, yes.

639
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,120
So the kiosk.

640
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,500
Good man, good man.

641
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,420
The kiosk for me is what really got exciting.

642
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,560
Should we jump right into my experience or is there more that you guys want to talk about or set up in this?

643
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,020
No, and I don't know how much order matters.

644
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:32,280
If there's a flow through this that works for you, I think now that you've established that you're a good man, Sector Keeper is going to let you do whatever you want.

645
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:46,780
Well, first of all, right away I see the kiosk that is Fat Tuesday, which is kind of a New Orleans themed, you know, getting like daiquiris and those kind of drinks, frozen daiquiris.

646
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,500
Big tall mushy colorful drinks.

647
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, that you can drink right there on the boardwalk.

648
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,720
While you walk.

649
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,540
At City Walk and I was like, whoa, hey, we're not in California City Walk right away.

650
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm realizing that.

651
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm like, oh, the vibe is different here, especially at the north or sapphire kiosk.

652
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,360
That's right.

653
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,020
We haven't talked about this yet.

654
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:16,920
How, you know, if you remember the original City Walk saga that we went to a dueling piano bar and there was all kinds of crazy logic of like somebody has to walk your drink.

655
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,240
Yeah, like a 10 foot walkway.

656
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,820
Just do it all the insane liquor rules.

657
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,920
None of that in City Walk.

658
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,920
Orlando is Vegas.

659
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,360
You can just walk around with drinks.

660
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,200
It did feel like Vegas.

661
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:37,300
You know, this I think that City Walk here feel in California feels like a place for like middle schoolers to hang out.

662
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,660
And this felt like, oh, this is like high school or like first year of college.

663
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,820
Yeah, but not our age.

664
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,120
So right away I got in there and I just got myself a drink, a very sugary sweet drink.

665
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,440
It was not great, but very fun to be able to just have that thing.

666
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,400
Now something to establish.

667
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,960
I kind of I forgot that there was a mini Fat Tuesday kiosk.

668
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,520
Fat Tuesday.

669
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,840
And I'll confer the set your cupers.

670
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:19,080
As far as I recall, you laid out, you gave us a guide map and Fat Tuesday, the standing establishment is in a different sector and even phase, I believe.

671
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,760
So we'll deal with that one down the road.

672
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,780
Of course, of course.

673
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,080
All right.

674
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,180
Well, I don't want to talk about.

675
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,620
No, don't, no, no, anything that's applicable about yours.

676
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,640
No, but please.

677
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:31,940
Good.

678
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,320
We said good man, good man.

679
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,300
Thank you.

680
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,660
Yeah.

681
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,120
Then you also have the Auntie Anne's kiosk, which, you know, is great.

682
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,180
I was easy to just get a stop by, get some pretzel bites.

683
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,080
I got those.

684
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,680
It was nice.

685
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,320
I sat in the chairs.

686
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,800
It's really like a nice little setup that you can just be enjoying beyond the water with your daiquiri.

687
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,720
Wow.

688
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:05,820
Now, this weirdly waterfront kiosks are kind of like a general area, but the city walk map has Auntie Anne's as a separate thing.

689
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,060
So Auntie Anne's by their designation doesn't count within the waterfront kiosk.

690
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,180
I think I have, I think I have a little bit of, because I did some investigating while I was down there.

691
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh, wow.

692
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:27,020
Then, unfortunately, there was also the, the wraps and braids kiosk where you could get your hair braided or face paint.

693
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,980
It was unfortunately closed because I would have done that.

694
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,980
Would you have done that for us?

695
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,780
Yeah, I think that would have been a good picture.

696
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:48,780
And then surprisingly, there is also, and I asked you guys how to say it and I now I'm forgetting, but an anime or manga kiosk.

697
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,420
Yeah, you got your Nerudo, your Dragon Ball Z.

698
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,640
Diamond Slayer.

699
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,560
What's that?

700
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,080
I don't know that one.

701
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,700
So maybe it's video games.

702
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,940
I don't know, but it definitely looks like there's some Dragon Ball stuff.

703
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,260
It was, and I asked them, I said, is this a permanent, like this is always here.

704
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,640
And they explained to me that some of the kiosks rotate and change what they are.

705
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:20,740
So maybe that's why Auntie Anne's is on the map because maybe it's a permanent one and maybe some of these other ones kind of.

706
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,340
Portals, portals.

707
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,780
Yeah, they rotate it through different portals.

708
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,100
And then they have, in addition to the Voodoo Donuts, the store, they also have the giant chair of donuts.

709
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,540
Which I don't know.

710
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,920
Do they have that here in California?

711
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,940
The throne is really good.

712
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,960
I, of course, got a picture on the throne.

713
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,720
Jason did one right.

714
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,980
I got a picture on the throne.

715
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,000
It was late at night and there was also a long line for Voodoo Donuts.

716
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,660
Insanely long line at that location.

717
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,980
Is that not the case in Hollywood?

718
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,040
There's always something of a line.

719
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,780
I've seen it.

720
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
I've seen it where it's short.

721
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,080
But oftentimes there is a line to go and get it, get them.

722
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:14,160
And I asked myself at that point, do I really need to extend this trip for 30 more minutes to just get the exact same donut?

723
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,640
There was a kiosk.

724
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,940
There was a little shed where if you mobile ordered, you could pick up your Voodoo Donuts there.

725
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,920
And it seemed sporadically open.

726
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,940
I did not see it.

727
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,540
Separate from the, more closer to the water.

728
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,160
I did not see it.

729
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,260
I did not see it open.

730
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:42,620
And I thought to myself, well, if I come on the podcast and say I didn't go, it will be very disappointing and sad for the listeners.

731
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,560
And it might make the centerkeeper lose strength.

732
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,720
Yes, thank you.

733
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,780
So my two options were either to lie or to tell the truth.

734
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,940
But if I were to tell the truth, I felt like I would have to do it.

735
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,280
Because I couldn't say I didn't do it.

736
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,900
I could either, if I wanted to tell the truth, I would have to wait in line, get a Voodoo Donut and another donut or whatever.

737
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,920
Or lie and make up a whole story about how I got it and what I got.

738
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,940
There's no way you could just make that up.

739
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,160
There's no way you could just look up what they have on the website.

740
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,280
The audience would know.

741
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,140
It was pretty good.

742
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,960
I thought it was pretty good.

743
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,280
But to make a lie more believable, do you even introduce the idea of a lie?

744
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,180
Because why would a liar do that?

745
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,920
Why would they say that they thought about lying if they were going to lie?

746
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,340
So I contemplated all of that, but I said, hey, for the podcast, I'm going to do it.

747
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,520
I waited on the long line.

748
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,580
I took some pictures for some other families.

749
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,720
And I got a Voodoo Donut and the Bubblegum one, which I believe you can also get in California.

750
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
I asked, are there any special ones?

751
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,460
And they didn't hear me and I didn't ask again.

752
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,380
And I got my donuts.

753
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,680
And at that point, I was very tired and kind of in a grumpy mood.

754
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,960
And I waited in line to get back on the boat.

755
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,560
That was your entire outing.

756
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,840
That was my entire outing.

757
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,900
What was the amount of time that all took?

758
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,240
Well, the whole beginning part was probably because I was rocking and rolling at the beginning.

759
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:24,440
I got like no line for the margarita, no line for getting the Anteans.

760
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,600
I got a conversation.

761
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,620
So that was all like probably 10 minutes.

762
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,800
I took a picture and then it was like probably 30 minutes waiting for Voodoo Donuts.

763
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,300
Now you were…

764
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,240
The whole trip was 20 minutes and I lied.

765
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,600
Well, this is where, you know, this is a pod.

766
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,040
We show our work on this podcast as evidenced by the forms that Mike brought out.

767
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,940
I don't suppose you have a photograph of one of those Voodoo Donuts, do you?

768
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,760
Let's see.

769
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,900
What do I have in my universe?

770
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,780
The photo on the throne.

771
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,320
So he definitely did the throne.

772
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,140
He did do the throne.

773
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,740
And it's up to you.

774
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,480
Does he need, does his mouth need to have touched a donut in order for his participation to qualify?

775
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,940
Well, he's introduced an interesting aspect that I never thought of is that you could lie.

776
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,040
Yeah.

777
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,100
You've never, like as a being, you've never thought that you could lie?

778
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,020
Well, you know, just, you know, I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.

779
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,280
It's like the invention of lying.

780
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,420
What if there wasn't lying and then one guy thought of lying?

781
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,820
That's a pretty good movie idea.

782
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,820
It could be.

784
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,120
Am I wrong in that you learned about lying in the Downtown Disney ordeal?

785
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,520
For the first time?

786
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,400
For the first time.

787
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,420
I think that would seem right.

788
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,920
I don't know.

789
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,160
But it was four years ago.

790
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,740
Who knows?

791
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,040
I think someone on this podcast in six years learned about lying.

792
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,860
Oh, he's smoking.

793
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,760
All those clove cigarettes.

794
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,740
Yeah, that happens.

795
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,760
They cloud the mind, you know?

796
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:53,700
But I'll say the, you know, this conundrum that Cesar brings up is still one of the simplest aspects of the ordeal.

797
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,860
Yeah.

798
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,880
Of the saga, excuse me.

799
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,440
No, much like The Flash, you learn a lot of information.

800
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,840
You're onboarded with a lot of stuff.

801
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,160
And if you understand all six levels of it, you're laughing.

802
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,180
That's this series.

803
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:16,820
Cesar, could you question Susser and learn just by kind of looking into his soul?

804
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,190
Because you're sort of an otherworldly.

805
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
So just maybe ask him a few simple questions and see.

806
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,320
I am part of, once you die, your spirit is almost like a lie detector of sorts.

807
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,900
Oh, great.

808
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,760
Oh, perfect.

809
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,520
So, Susser, if you're comfortable.

810
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,340
I suppose I am.

811
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,520
I will now stare into your soul.

812
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,200
Yes.

813
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,380
You went to Voodoo Donuts.

814
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,680
Yes.

815
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
You sat in the throne.

816
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,200
I did.

817
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,060
Yes.

818
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,540
Yes.

819
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,680
You stood in line.

820
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,340
Yes.

821
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
While standing in line, could you see a menu?

822
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,100
Could I see a menu?

823
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
No, actually.

824
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,720
The menu is when you walk into the store itself.

825
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,220
It's not out when you're outside when you're waiting in line.

826
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,280
So you have been looking at the menu.

827
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
What do you see?

828
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,440
When I reach that point.

829
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,620
When you reach that point.

830
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,560
Well, it's big and bright.

831
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:06,860
And.

832
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,960
Okay, checks out.

833
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,780
It has a list of the donuts.

834
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:11,680
Sure.

835
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,540
It has coffee.

836
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,940
It has coffee as well.

837
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,320
Do you have any idea how many months ago as we record this, this occurred?

838
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,460
Was it in 2023?

839
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,580
I believe so.

840
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,820
Okay, but maybe early in 2023.

841
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,540
Another point of clarification.

842
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,060
You also had just worked 12 hours and we're doing this as a favor.

843
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,620
Yes.

844
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,780
That's correct.

845
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,660
Okay.

846
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,000
So you're looking at the menu and what catches your eye?

847
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,720
Well, nothing, to be honest.

848
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Because I was also, as you said, it would have been 12 hours and I was doing it as a favor.

849
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:56,440
And typically, you know, if I'm on another food driven podcast, I would maybe, you know, really want to get the best thing on the menu or a real comprehensive thing.

850
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:06,480
And I had also, as a part of that 12 hour day, I think I had, I did a food tasting for desserts and treats at Minion Cafe.

851
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,740
So I had already eaten a fair bit of donuts.

852
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,160
Of sugar.

853
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,420
Jason's hat just flew over.

854
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,440
That's your job?

855
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,260
Quite a bit.

856
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,860
So either that was part of the motivating factor that told me you don't need to have a donut.

857
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,100
Just lie and say you went.

858
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:37,540
Or that was a motivating factor that made me say, I'm just going to get the Voodoo donut and I guess a bubblegum one or if they have a special one, which they didn't seem to immediately suggest.

859
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:47,320
You could have just texted me and I would have just said like, just save yourselves some, just say the phrase buttermilk bar and we'll move on.

860
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,740
To say the phrase maple long john.

861
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,880
You wouldn't have had the ghost of a child interrogated.

862
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah, we wouldn't have had to do all that waterboarding that we cut, you know.

863
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,560
What do you think now?

864
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,180
I think that he went.

865
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,540
I think that he had a donut.

866
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,020
Wow.

867
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,140
Thank you.

868
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:20,240
I feel like, you know where you got me was with the specifics of the menu and it was over here but not up there.

869
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,320
That did seem kind of, that felt specific.

870
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I guess you could have seen all that without going into the store.

871
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,040
He said the menu was bright.

872
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,260
That's an adjective.

873
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,940
You remember that?

874
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,760
From experience, yeah.

875
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,120
Does anybody, what do we think in general?

876
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,340
And I cannot believe this.

877
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:43,120
I was looking through my pictures and I, because again, I was thinking about this whole thing as I was online and I thought, oh, I'll bring up the idea and I could lie.

878
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,800
And then I said, well, you got to remember to take a picture with the donut.

879
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,480
And I am sure I did, but I cannot find the picture.

880
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,440
Oh, well, that's very convenient.

881
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,120
It is.

882
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,140
But also, why would I bring that up at this point?

883
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,140
We've moved on.

884
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,020
Only the sector keeper can say if we've moved on.

885
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,220
Yeah, he's the one who's been put in.

886
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,820
And the throne is inside, yes.

887
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,960
The throne is outside.

888
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,300
Oh.

889
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,540
Wait, the sector keeper didn't know that?

890
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,520
Well, he's not really, he keeps the jump points.

891
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,460
No, he hasn't been to CityWalkerLand.

893
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,080
He's concerned about it.

894
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
Takes a lot out of him.

895
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
It takes a lot.

896
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,820
Oh, goodness.

897
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,840
I don't know.

898
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:37,140
But part of my point of talking about the kiosks of the Waterfront North or Sapphire is that to make the case of this, this sector is so much more than the Voodoo Donuts, even though that seems to be leading the name.

899
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,260
I think that it should be called Waterfront Kiosks North and Voodoo Donuts.

900
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,140
And Ante-Anns is separate because it's on the map.

901
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
Don't forget Ante-Anns.

902
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,700
But that could be last maybe?

903
00:37:48,960 --> 00:38:07,120
I'll also say right behind Voodoo Donuts, there is a giant, always empty bathroom and some very old press penny machines that I somehow managed to get all four of these slightly different, incredible Hulk designs on the map.

904
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,400
All these really they're all partially functioning.

905
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,460
No, the other ones like Spider-Man and SpongeBob.

906
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,180
But there is one machine that has probably been there since like 2000.

907
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,440
That is just slight variations on the Hulk.

908
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,800
Buy an empty, like an always empty bathroom?

909
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,020
Buy an always empty bathroom.

910
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,280
So you it's a random one you get or?

911
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,180
I.

912
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,600
Were you playing it like a slot?

913
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,920
How many pennies do you carry with you?

914
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,240
Well, I don't have any on me right now.

915
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,640
Well, how many smash pennies do you have on you?

916
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,780
From going to the train tracks?

917
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,580
Yeah.

918
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,800
Whoops.

919
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,600
But did you bring pennies to CityWalk to get the press pennies?

920
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,380
Well, I don't think you do that anymore.

921
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,720
These ones.

922
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,540
Oh, they just come out because they cost.

923
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,700
I thought it was like a like a $2 and then you put a penny in.

924
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,720
No, the penny just comes out.

925
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,420
You can pay cash or you can do like Apple Pay.

926
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,160
Really?

927
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,840
And then it's kind of like you sort of don't know what you're going to get.

928
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,180
Or I just didn't understand it.

929
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,200
But we just had to turn in the crank.

930
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,060
But I did get all four incredible.

931
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
For how much money?

932
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,380
$100.

933
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,460
At least $5.

934
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,120
Like at least.

935
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,320
What a value.

936
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,200
But isn't the fun of the press penny machine that you put your penny in and then you see

937
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,740
what like it transforms your penny?

938
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Well, back in the day.

939
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,460
Okay, so but now they have their own pennies set aside in the machine for you.

940
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,560
So if you just have a card or a phone.

941
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,340
That seems less fun, doesn't it?

942
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,020
Am I crazy?

943
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,980
You're not watching your penny.

944
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,580
I think it's been a long time since that's been the case.

945
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,880
I think they've been running a scam on this for…

946
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,220
Did the Disneyland ones do that?

947
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,500
Well, the Disneyland 100 coins that Tarrant Killam was talking about,

948
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,750
I did Apple pay on one of those once and I wanted one coin and they're like,

949
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,420
here's your four coins.

950
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,160
And like it was like $20.

951
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,620
Hey guys.

952
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,560
So you paid $20 for four pennies?

953
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,560
I was pimped into buying four.

954
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,780
No, not the Hulk.

955
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,700
But the Disney anniversary ones.

956
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,420
Right, but are those pennies or are those just different coins?

957
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
Those are like slugs.

958
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,840
Those are like the size of like half dollars.

959
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,360
So it can't just be the cost of a penny.

960
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:23,580
Because…

961
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:23,940
No, I understand.

962
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,820
That's not a business.

963
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,960
You're paying for the labor.

964
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,360
No, I understand that.

965
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,500
For the labor of the machine.

966
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,780
I understand that, but I'm saying they've taken away…

967
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,480
It used to be a quarter and a penny and then it was 50 cents and a penny and now…

968
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,440
Yeah.

969
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,160
They just fucking go wild.

970
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,040
So they've taken away the transformational aspect of it.

971
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,600
I think that maybe has been decades that there has been smashed penny machines.

972
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,000
Really?

973
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,500
This reminds me of the episode where we went to, it was the K1 Speed, where we went to

974
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,660
it was an arcade and it's not tokens, it's a card.

975
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,880
And you guys are both like, oh, that's the new thing now is the cards.

976
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,400
They're doing the cards these days.

977
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm like, I think it's been 15 years or more of cards.

978
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,400
It's been a look at…

979
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,340
Dave and Buster's have been around for a while with those cards.

980
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,280
I agree with that.

981
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,820
But they are doing cards now.

982
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,440
Deep in the card era.

983
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,960
Well, I'll do a little research and find out if there's any real machines left in this

984
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,740
world, okay?

985
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
The authentic machines.

986
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,940
Well, you know what?

987
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,820
But I don't think that matters.

988
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:23,860
So what you need is a machine that is crushing your penny, built this millennium, built

989
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,540
since 2000.

990
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,320
I see what you're saying.

991
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah, they still make new ones the old fashioned way.

992
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,680
Right.

993
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,440
Or also, has it never been your penny getting crushed?

994
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,760
Has this always been?

995
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,840
Holy shit.

996
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,220
Whoa.

997
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,240
I don't know.

998
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,540
It could be fake the whole time.

999
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,180
It's just pressed copper that's already pressed.

1000
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,700
They might have them already.

1001
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,880
No, no, no.

1002
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,000
There's not a copper heating mechanism in many of these machines.

1003
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,440
Wow, real maybe.

1004
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,720
I don't know.

1005
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,240
I mean, this is a thing at carnivals.

1006
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,060
Can we trust the carnival to not do tricks?

1007
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,080
No, we can't.

1008
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,520
Wow.

1009
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,440
Oh my gosh.

1010
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,340
I also should say I patronize one of the kiosks.

1011
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,880
Which kiosk?

1012
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,080
Whoa.

1013
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,420
There was a kiosk of like…

1014
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,300
In Sapphire Sector?

1015
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,080
Yeah, in Sapphire Sector.

1016
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,800
Okay, go ahead.

1017
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,880
I don't know, and this was after I had been there.

1018
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,580
Yes.

1019
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,540
You didn't ask any of them if they had seen somebody go into a voodoo donuts or not, did you?

1020
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,380
No, I didn't.

1021
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:18,840
Okay, good.

1022
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,420
Which would have been answered with like…

1023
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,020
Yes.

1024
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,580
What?

1025
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,340
Yes, of course.

1026
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,860
Yeah, I see people all day right next to it.

1027
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,200
There's a photo of a man.

1028
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,240
Yes, he's at the premiere of the movie Fist Fight.

1029
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,740
You've seen this man at…

1030
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,060
Anyway, which kiosk?

1031
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,680
There was a sports kiosk because it was still football season.

1032
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,220
Oh.

1033
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:49,820
And it was mostly like teens from the Northeast, so it was like Patriots and Eagles, but then

1034
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,140
all the Florida colleges.

1035
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,100
And Jane went to UCF, and she's like, oh, look at that UCF tumbler.

1036
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,200
And I was like, oh, well, let's get you a souvenir.

1037
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,960
So I bought her like the metal cup with the metal straw and lid and stuff.

1038
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,000
That's interesting.

1039
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,440
So one of the rotating kiosks became a football kiosk.

1040
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,720
Yeah, I could see it changing of like when football season's over, maybe it's basketball

1041
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,040
and then maybe it's baseball.

1042
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,640
The multiverses twisted, man.

1043
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,700
Yeah.

1044
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,880
Yeah.

1045
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,640
Yeah, it goes, they go from one reality to the other into different universes.

1046
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,420
So the baseball one like goes into a wormhole and that kiosk moves into a different reality.

1047
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,880
Well, there might be a step between phases where the three of us get crushed like pennies.

1048
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,480
That's how…

1049
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:36,980
Oh, wow.

1050
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,280
Yeah.

1051
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,100
It has to be.

1052
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,720
It's infinite.

1053
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Yeah, that's how it works.

1054
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,600
And some of the pennies already were in the machine.

1055
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,480
Ooh, let down.

1056
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,300
I know.

1057
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,740
Let's not get mixed up with those.

1058
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Are there other sectors of other places?

1059
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,520
I don't know.

1060
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,240
I mean, he's been a little ambiguous, I'd say, about like what we're trying to solve here.

1061
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:00,900
I can't get into it.

1062
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,500
This is a great question, but I can't get into them.

1063
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,460
I understand.

1064
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,180
No, City Walk Orlando is not as simple as it seems.

1065
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,800
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,400
That's all he'll say to us.

1067
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,800
Makes sense.

1068
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,560
For every beginning, there's an end.

1069
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,160
Right.

1070
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,560
And every end, there's a beginning.

1071
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,860
Oh, okay.

1072
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,080
I don't know if you've ever thought about that.

1073
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:20,960
Wow, wow.

1074
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,480
I think the cigarette's laced that I'm smoking.

1075
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,860
You're talking crazy talk.

1076
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,220
Sector Keeper, I didn't know you liked to get wet.

1077
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,460
Yeah, man.

1078
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,580
What?

1079
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,400
What does getting wet mean when you lace a cigarette?

1080
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,620
There's PCP in that.

1081
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,880
Oh, that's what that means?

1082
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,560
Did you know that?

1083
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:39,840
Yeah.

1084
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:46,100
I don't remember your training day movie, your famous scenes from the long, long ago

1085
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,400
movie Training Day.

1086
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,480
When he goes, I didn't know you liked to get wet.

1087
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,440
He smells.

1088
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,020
And he's laced Ethan Hawke's cigarette with PCP.

1089
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,680
Oh, my goodness.

1090
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,420
Or joint with PCP.

1091
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,340
Usually, when Jason says, oh, you want to get wet, he means go on the Popeye ride at

1092
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:00,980
Islands of Adventure.

1093
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,560
Yeah.

1094
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,520
Not smoke PCP.

1095
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,000
Or he wants to do a cannonball in the wave pool.

1096
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,740
Yeah.

1097
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:06,960
Yeah.

1098
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,120
On the high dive.

1099
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Have you guys, or Sector Keeper, maybe you know, how often do people jump into the river

1100
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,340
at City Walk or the lake or whatever?

1101
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,600
The waterways.

1102
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,720
I do know, but I'll let these guys go.

1103
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,140
Is that a problem?

1104
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,680
It seems like it would be, especially with Fat Tuesday, you know, supplying.

1105
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah, yeah.

1106
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,880
It takes away inhibitions.

1107
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,380
I don't know.

1108
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,280
I've never looked up the crime blotter on that.

1109
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,780
I'll say a general thing.

1110
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,020
I was talking to a friend of the show, texting with a friend of the show, Matt Cardona, and

1111
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:41,180
he made it seem like City Walk used to be a hot spot, a wilder spot, perhaps.

1112
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,500
And now it is not.

1113
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,200
Where is the hot spot now?

1114
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,760
Or just it's…

1115
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,920
I think it's maybe on iDrive somewhere more so than it is City Walk.

1116
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,480
Yeah.

1117
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,340
Disney Springs and City Walk definitely seem like they pulled back on operating hours.

1118
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,160
Yeah.

1119
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,260
It was like 2020.

1120
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,320
They're not looking maybe for it to be a place where people are inspired to jump in the water

1121
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,820
anymore.

1122
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:09,180
It feels like maybe that even though you can still drink and walk around, it doesn't feel

1123
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,560
lively at night in some of these spots.

1124
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,560
Not that that's a bad thing, as we'll figure out as we go on.

1125
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,880
But I'm sure there were some incidents where someone had, you know, too many Long Island

1126
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,880
ice teas at an Alter Bridge concert at Hard Rock Live.

1127
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,420
Oh, that's true.

1128
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,100
Something stumbled out, you know.

1129
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Is Alter Bridge a religious band?

1130
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,820
I think it's all like…

1131
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,840
It's the members of Creed without Scott Stapp.

1132
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,660
Yeah.

1133
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,060
So it's a little harder, but it's got some good messages, you know?

1134
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:38,980
It's harder without…

1135
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,500
They're finally free to rock as hard as they always wanted to.

1136
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,260
Stapp was dragging them down.

1137
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:51,080
They were all changed after they filmed that music video in Universal Florida.

1138
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,600
Well, let's why don't we get closer to maybe a Jason definition of getting wet, which is

1139
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,760
having an odd type of pretzel because, Mike?

1140
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,980
Well, you know, can I just quickly say that I got a Voodoo doughnut.

1141
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,580
Yes.

1142
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,460
And I got it to go and I ordered it on the mobile, on the app.

1143
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,420
And I have a photo of it.

1144
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,820
Did you get it at the shed?

1145
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,180
You keep saying shed and I'm confused by that.

1146
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,260
It just seems like a really unfinished kiosk.

1147
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,100
I think it was just like a little window at the restaurant.

1148
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,820
It's like a bunch of shelves.

1149
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,300
No, no.

1150
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,960
I'm saying across from the restaurant there was a pickup spot.

1151
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,380
Oh, no.

1152
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,640
I didn't go to that shed.

1153
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,260
No, no.

1154
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,060
I got it at the…

1155
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,020
Yeah.

1156
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,520
You just went in there in the physical.

1157
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,840
And for some reason I can't find the name of it, but I got just the to go.

1158
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,180
I was going to go eat it at the hotel as I was leaving.

1159
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,280
So, yeah, you would think that these doughnuts should be able to travel somewhat in a bag.

1160
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,840
And they put it in a bag.

1161
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,100
And look, it has some orange cream on the outside.

1162
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,620
And it just immediately started leaking, seeping through the bag as I was carrying it.

1163
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,800
Just immediate.

1164
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,780
Didn't they test that out?

1165
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,100
Like the frosting wouldn't just push its way through the membrane of the paper?

1166
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,380
It was through as if being pushed in like a crushed penny machine.

1167
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,020
Yeah, they're very messy, the voodoo doughnuts.

1168
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,580
I had similar problems with mess.

1169
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,140
And so then I tried to open the bag.

1170
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:29,380
And the doughnut stuck to the bag and the tissue paper so thoroughly that just taking the doughnut out destroyed the doughnut.

1171
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,160
This looks like Garfield got crushed by a car.

1172
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,060
And which doughnut was this again?

1173
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,360
Well, I'm going to have to go back and find the name of it.

1174
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,160
But it's basically like an orange cream doughnut on a stick.

1175
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,700
So it's like kind of a fun like you're having a popsicle or something.

1176
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,320
But the whole doughnut was ruined.

1177
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,980
It was destroyed just by trying to retrieve it from the bag.

1178
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,360
So then I just tried to lick it while it was still stuck to the bag and have a piece of it.

1179
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,480
And it was again, it's voodoo doughnuts.

1180
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
It's not very good.

1181
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,340
It's not that good.

1182
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,420
I don't think this is maybe the original, the real ones, but the theme park iterations, because I ended up, I'm like, let me remember.

1183
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,760
Maybe I could find something that actually really satisfies me.

1184
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,780
I went up to the Hollywood one.

1185
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,520
Maybe I'll get something weird and funny or that my son can have some.

1186
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,960
I don't even want an entire doughnut to myself.

1187
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,180
Look, I'm not I'm not the person to judge doughnuts.

1188
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,380
I don't have a lot of them, but I don't.

1189
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,180
This was not especially it was fine.

1190
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,420
I've had better things just like from Trader Joe's prepackaged.

1191
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,800
And it was three dollars for one doughnut.

1192
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,860
I don't think this is a good at least the theme park iterations.

1193
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,020
I don't think are good.

1194
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,320
I don't I don't know what's going on here.

1195
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,040
I haven't had the Portland one.

1196
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,320
The only good thing you can say, I know for sure.

1197
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,500
And I don't know if they're still doing it.

1198
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:55,360
And we mentioned it in the last saga is that the Portland one at least at a certain point was giving you the option to buy a bucket of misshapen of misshapen.

1199
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:05,320
So you so to me, Jason, Jason, this predates the podcast, but they've been talking about misshapen for years and years.

1200
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,980
Now they've expanded the original one and, you know, the company's gone through like they had some labor issues.

1201
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:19,100
I died in Denver trying to do the like eat the cake sized doughnut in like under 90 seconds.

1202
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,620
What?

1203
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,180
He choked on it.

1204
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,940
Oh, my God.

1205
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:36,640
And then they they were trying to open a location in New Orleans in the French Quarter and between like historical preservationists and actual voodoo practices.

1206
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,180
They were like, you know, we don't want that.

1207
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,940
They got too cocky being so close to the Fat Tuesday kiosk.

1208
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,800
They felt they were basically in New Orleans already.

1210
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:57,360
This is what it's a creamsicle doughnut and it has a little universal Orlando like like some sort of some sort of like little sign that you can eat remotely resemble.

1211
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,500
That's not like the other.

1212
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,340
That is what I tried.

1213
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,720
That is what it looked like when I opened up the bag.

1214
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,300
Wow.

1215
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,480
It was just like it had been in an accident or something.

1216
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,880
And I just carried it in a bag into death.

1217
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,340
Yeah, I just carried it in a bag to the hotel.

1218
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:17,980
The stick is adding a whole other level of competence that can't have helped keep it together.

1219
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,180
You know, the stick.

1220
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,580
I don't think the stick.

1221
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,700
I like it.

1222
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,920
I don't think the stick helped, but I don't know it in the bag.

1223
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,460
You know, oh, it may be.

1224
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,660
Oh, it punctured it, causing an ooze out potentially like, I don't know.

1225
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,060
Jason's like the Richard Feynman, a challenger explosion.

1226
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,140
Like he's he's trying to break it down.

1227
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,940
He's figuring out what happened.

1228
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,560
It's a movie.

1229
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,480
I anatomy of a fall.

1230
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:45,780
Yes.

1231
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,780
Jason.

1232
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,960
Bear changing.

1233
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,740
Jason, I'll send you the photos.

1234
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,040
And if you want to perform a full forensics analysis, please.

1235
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,660
Donut.

1236
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,390
Can we cut out anatomy of a spill so it can be a doughboy's episode?

1237
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,140
Get to work.

1238
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,460
I'm excited to hear it in nine months.

1239
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:16,360
I mean, as the doughnut enthusiast, I don't know that I've loved anything I've had from Voodoo either.

1240
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
The price is not great.

1241
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,680
I realize I have a photo of when I finally got it out of the bag.

1242
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,440
And this is what it looked like.

1243
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,860
This is the this is the situation.

1244
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:37,480
Yeah.

1245
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,060
And again, it wasn't even like you could tell it was like stale, stale ish.

1246
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,560
They're all kind of stale.

1247
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,040
I feel like it's almost like their thing is to have them all taste bad a little bit.

1248
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,960
Do we do we think Fallen Brothers soon?

1249
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,780
No, people love it.

1250
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,820
No, it's popular.

1251
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,440
It should be.

1252
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,660
I think it should be a Fallen Brothers.

1253
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,740
Seems to like it.

1254
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:57,880
Yeah.

1255
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,460
Get something better in there.

1256
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,260
I think there's let me correct.

1257
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:01,960
All right.

1258
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,000
Bucket of Miss Shapens is good, but there is something else to bring up about this.

1259
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,400
And I didn't know about this in the previous saga.

1260
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,400
And this is true of both city walk locations.

1261
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,620
Both of them can provide legal weddings.

1262
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,680
You can have your a full wedding ceremony in the Voodoo doughnuts.

1263
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,280
And I mean, I mean, they will provide an ordained person to perform the ceremony.

1264
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,020
The Hollywood one smaller rights.

1265
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,780
You can only invite 13 people.

1266
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,960
But Orlando, you can invite 60.

1267
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,100
Oh, wow.

1268
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,440
60 person wedding at that Voodoo doughnuts, as well as Denver and Austin.

1269
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,020
And you with that, you get a legal wedding ceremony.

1270
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,780
Seven staff picked Voodoo dozens.

1271
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,920
A doughnut heart centerpiece.

1272
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,060
The couple's name spelled out in doughnuts.

1273
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,060
You get bride and groom custom doughnuts where they look like you.

1274
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,680
No, they don't.

1275
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,680
They look like you if you get smooshed.

1276
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,380
Staff pick dozens.

1277
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,080
Like it's our wedding.

1278
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,680
We'd actually like to pick the doughnuts.

1279
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,540
Unfortunately, no, Gary's going to pick them.

1280
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,620
Experts only.

1281
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,560
You don't know what you're doing.

1282
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,740
Sorry, it's the end of the night.

1283
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,160
We don't got a lot left.

1284
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,240
And three airpots of coffee as needed.

1285
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,120
Wow.

1286
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,740
They're not just going to put those out.

1287
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,480
Do we want coffee or what's the vibe?

1288
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,200
Do we want it or not?

1289
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:21,980
Airpots.

1290
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,260
It's 8 o'clock at night.

1291
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,240
You don't want the coffee, right?

1292
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,040
You just want milk?

1293
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,020
You want milk?

1294
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,360
It's at the shed.

1295
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,980
Cross the walkway.

1296
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,600
If you see Goku, you've gone too far.

1297
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:48,800
So there's some married men here, but you know, in the future, just file away that you could do your ceremony.

1298
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,520
You got a price quote on that?

1299
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,800
No, I think you got to inquire further.

1300
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,180
Inquire.

1301
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,960
Well, I can shoot them an email.

1302
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,840
They do warn you they need at least a week's notice.

1303
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,580
Oh, wow.

1304
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,800
So they're really booked.

1305
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,100
This is an eye class ceremony.

1306
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,480
Donuts that get stale.

1307
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:08,920
Yeah.

1308
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,460
What if you wanted to marry one of the donuts?

1309
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,720
They don't specify that.

1310
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,580
Some of their donuts look like a little guy.

1311
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,960
Actually, you can do it, but the staff has to pick it.

1312
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,760
Okay.

1313
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,740
So there you go.

1314
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
We've learned a lot.

1315
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,820
You can get married there and we've learned this is not a good donut place and nobody should go.

1316
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,520
And regardless of whether you went or not, Evan, I can't quite tell.

1317
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,800
But you shouldn't.

1318
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,860
We shouldn't have made you.

1319
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,160
How much do we owe you?

1320
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,920
It was my pleasure, guys.

1321
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,020
It was my pleasure.

1322
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,820
Okay, great.

1323
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,520
Well, it was our pleasure to treat you with something else.

1324
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,740
Here's something I'm sure everybody's going to want.

1325
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,160
Auntie Anne's snacks that were purchased hours ago.

1326
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,580
Ice cold, baby.

1327
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,960
We've been recording.

1328
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,160
It was in a progressively colder environment with the garage door open.

1329
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,840
Sent Mike on a crowded Sunday.

1330
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,740
It was awful.

1331
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,800
Went to a busy mall so we could get a little taste of downtown Pennsylvania.

1332
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,780
Originally founded in downtown Pennsylvania.

1333
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,520
Of course, Anne is Beeler, Byler.

1334
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,300
Raised in Amish sect and then they converted to a Mennonite.

1335
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,740
Sound.

1336
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,760
The smell just hit me so hard in the face.

1337
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,100
I love that smell.

1338
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,220
Well, here it is.

1339
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,040
Let me poke around that, brother.

1340
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,820
What has he got?

1341
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,340
What do you got?

1342
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,460
Open up your bag for you, Jason.

1343
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,120
Open it not too close from the mic.

1344
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,740
What is it?

1345
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,540
What is it?

1346
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,280
Little nugs.

1347
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,080
Little hot dog nugs.

1348
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,200
Little hot dog nugs.

1349
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,980
Hot dog nugs?

1350
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,320
Jason does not contrive these phrases.

1351
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,580
They come straight out of his brain.

1352
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,740
Jason, there's your tenth way to make a hot dog.

1353
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,540
Pretzel.

1354
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah, pretzel.

1355
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,060
Now these filled me at Wetzel's, if you remember the previous City Walk.

1356
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,700
Oh yeah, not Wetzel's in Orlando.

1357
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,360
It's Auntie Anne's.

1358
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,860
Oh, we got pretzels too.

1359
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,600
Are those regular or what's going on with them?

1360
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,000
Marvel at Universal.

1361
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,580
What if it's regular?

1362
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,660
This is like a dessert pretzel.

1363
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,440
Regular.

1364
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,580
Now is anyone going to take any of it?

1365
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,080
No.

1366
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,380
Evan's going for it.

1367
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,480
The sexual keeper.

1368
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,320
I've already died once.

1369
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,880
Jason, how are you liking those nugs?

1370
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,560
Nice and chilly.

1371
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,660
I like them.

1372
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,360
I was trying to take less and it wouldn't let me.

1373
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,120
Mike, let me get a little of that classic.

1374
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,180
Cinnamon crumble.

1375
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,000
Jason called it a classic.

1376
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,420
Let me get some of that classic, he said.

1377
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,100
Jason wants some classic, he said.

1378
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh, we've got a big piece of classic.

1379
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,820
We're all talking about stale.

1380
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,240
Oh boy, this is as chewy as, I mean it's not awful.

1381
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,880
Not awful.

1382
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,520
It's really up to you, Jason.

1383
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,980
You're the only true arbiter.

1384
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:58,300
Well, you know, the thing with Auntie Anne's is that they're usually pretty greasy, pretty buttery and wet.

1385
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,640
And these are cold and dry.

1386
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,420
So, an interesting experience.

1387
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,380
Well, you're seeing how they hold up to the elements.

1388
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,560
Like my voodoo donuts didn't hold up.

1389
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,380
I would say that these don't either.

1390
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,140
Either the classic or the sweet.

1391
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,400
The sweet maybe was the best just because the sugar doesn't really get bad.

1392
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,580
It's just like a cinnamon sugar?

1393
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:26,260
Yeah.

1394
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,400
It's okay.

1395
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,540
So, warning about Sector 2 for any listeners who want to visit Sector 2.

1396
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,560
The flavors don't hold up to the elements.

1397
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,840
We stress test them.

1398
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,160
Eat it fresh.

1399
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,780
Yes.

1400
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,900
Don't sit on it for two hours.

1401
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,520
Get that strawberry daiquiri in that audience and just woof it down, you know?

1402
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,320
That being said, I'm going to still finish all of the thing I'm eating.

1403
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,180
And then wait a half hour before you go swimming in the water.

1404
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,080
Before you jump into the water.

1405
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,520
And by the way, now there has been a weigh-in from a friend of the show, Andrew Grissom.

1406
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,300
Hey, did you like any of the Flash?

1407
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:04,620
Yes.

1408
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,060
I saw it opening night.

1409
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,820
There was excited crowd energy.

1410
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,640
Also, I have not rewatched it and I have no desire to rewatch.

1411
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,280
He liked the technology.

1412
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,480
And then he said, perhaps intuiting what was happening here,

1413
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,320
please don't make me represent this movie in court as its appointed lawyer.

1414
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,180
So, but I do technically, Mike, you are correct.

1415
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,060
You've won this round of relitigation.

1416
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,000
Many more rounds to come.

1417
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1418
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:31,940
I know it.

1419
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,140
And as for you, Evan Susser, you survived podcast, The Ride,

1420
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,740
the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness.

1421
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,240
I feel like I need to come clean about if I did go to it or not.

1422
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,180
If you're willing to.

1423
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,400
Or not come clean, rather just like, well, you know what?

1424
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,900
I know everyone likes this a lot.

1425
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,360
Maybe it's time for another Moves Like Burt.

1426
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,520
Oh, yeah.

1427
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,980
Another big audience hit.

1428
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,740
I will, I'll say what happened,

1429
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:03,340
whether I've been fibbing or telling the truth and just being weird to make a

1430
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,820
fun little bit for my appearance.

1431
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,200
And then maybe Sector Keeper, this might be outside of your purview,

1432
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,640
but maybe you could respond with a cryptic, unclear what I said after the,

1433
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,560
you know, Moves Like Burt.

1434
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,060
Will you give us this deal?

1435
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,640
Moves Like Burt?

1436
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,340
Oh, God, more explanation.

1437
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,860
Oh, you'll be laughing once we explain it.

1438
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:27,220
We had to censor a story that he told about something disturbing at Sesame

1439
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:32,020
Place, the Sesame Street theme park, and we censored it with a song that Burt

1440
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,160
sang, which was Moves Like Burt.

1441
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,480
So will you cut us this deal?

1442
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,900
This is main feed.

1443
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,060
We are, we'll censor it here.

1444
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:48,360
Will you allow us on the Club 3 all the way on the Patreon?

1445
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:55,060
Will you help us drive subscribers to our Patreon by having the unbelieved,

1446
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,260
un-Burted version on Club 3?

1447
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,120
No.

1448
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,020
You know what?

1449
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,680
I will allow that.

1450
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,460
Okay.

1451
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,100
So can you, will you tell us the full Sesame Place story?

1452
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:08,980
Can we hear that?

1453
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,100
I will tell the truth.

1454
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,780
So did I, in the interest of being a good podcast guest, wait in line for a half an

1455
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:25,040
hour to actually get a Voodoo donut, even though it is identical to the Voodoo

1456
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,680
house?

1457
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,980
Or did I telephib this whole episode and convince myself while in line that, oh,

1458
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,120
you know, lying creates a fun dynamic on the show and I'll do that?

1459
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,180
Or did I actually go, but say, oh, the lying idea is funny.

1460
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,780
Why don't I just kind of play with that the whole time and then reveal at the end

1461
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,920
that I actually did go?

1462
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,200
Well, and this is only going to be revealed for people on the Patreon, the real

1463
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,340
answer.

1464
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,600
Everybody else will have Moves Like Burt.

1465
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,800
Well, here is the truth.

1466
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,880
I didn't go.

1467
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,340
I'm sorry.

1468
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,540
And also it's Sesame Place.

1469
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,300
I heard someone pleasuring themselves until completion.

1470
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,620
That's it guys.

1471
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,040
It was great being here.

1472
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,820
What a conclusion.

1473
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,760
But I'll say this.

1474
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,040
The sector is complete, but only because of one heroic man amongst us.

1475
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,120
Michael R.

1476
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,280
Carlson.

1477
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:26,220
Not only went to Voodoo Donuts, Donuts purchased a donut, but eight.

1478
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,390
It's smashed carcass.

1479
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,500
That's true.

1480
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,540
Looks like spaghetti grease and a paper bag.

1481
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,380
So therefore it is complete.

1482
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,400
Wow.

1483
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:37,800
Wow.

1484
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Oh, and there it is.

1485
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,760
It's forming.

1486
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,520
I see it.

1487
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,180
That's right.

1488
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,000
It's landing.

1489
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,700
It's landing right in front of us.

1490
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,700
There it is.

1491
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,520
It's the Sapphire Nug.

1492
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,720
It's the Sapphire Nug.

1493
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,040
Jason's trying to eat it.

1494
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,260
Jason, Jason, don't eat that.

1495
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,580
Look, I'm not going to now.

1496
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,620
I already broke a couple of teeth on it.

1497
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,620
So put it on the shelf next to the Coke mirror with Hermione on it.

1498
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,220
Carl R.

1499
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:05,540
Curio.

1500
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,140
That was from the other episode.

1501
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, we're collecting all these things.

1502
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,180
Well, wow.

1503
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,000
There it is.

1504
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,800
Looks beautiful.

1505
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,280
A shining Sapphire Nug.

1506
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,700
And Evan says, let's exit through the, let's go through the, let's go through the

1507
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,560
plug portal.

1508
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,920
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1509
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,140
Well, you know, it's just here, guys.

1510
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,740
I think the same thing, the VillainCon Minion Blast Universal.

1511
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:28,960
Yes.

1512
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,740
Go check it out.

1513
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:29,920
Yeah.

1514
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,740
It's really great.

1515
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,720
It's a lot of fun.

1516
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,600
You did a great job on it.

1517
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,180
And in the brief moments when you're enjoying wine.

1518
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,060
And also you need a Minion Cafe if you're there too, which is also a lot of fun, which

1519
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,460
I don't know.

1520
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,220
It is fun.

1521
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:40,640
Yeah.

1522
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,200
Delicious.

1523
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,720
More than the, but better than all of the great food items, offerings that we're going

1524
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,720
to be discussing for many, many days.

1525
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,660
Okay.
