1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Warning! The following half-live podcast may contain real feel action, ghost musks, and a slammin' conversation about the price of roller blades.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Slam into our San Diego Comic Con Report featuring our Street Sharks panel with Griffin Newman on Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three guys who are as tedious to listen to as a Comic Con Q&A. My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always is Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We got to marry those two things, those two levels of tedious.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Or we didn't do the Q&A, sorry, no.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know, first tedious is not anything, and second we didn't do a Q&A, but yeah.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I forgot.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're only down two in the first sentence.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, alright, I'll show myself out. Mike, I rode with you, so I'll just sit in your car.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright, that's fine.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Give him the keys.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Give him the keys, yeah, let him have some AC.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't clash him.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The AC, though, drains the gas a little bit.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, I'll just sit inside with the windows up.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's give him ten more sentences, and if there's any outbursts like that, then no AC.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Teediness is a cute word, though.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, I do like it.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I do like the word teediness.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Teediness?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, we're here.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a Polly Pocket kind of word.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It is a Polly Pocket kind of word. Yeah, that'll come into play. I guess we could talk a little bit about that real quick.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, we will. We're talking about Comic Con today.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We will?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's related to a Polly Pocket, like, activation.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, I forgot.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Or party at Comic Con.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, that's right.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I thought that's what you were referencing.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, no. I forgot it because it looked very generic and not worth the struggle to get through the VIP barricade.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right, and it wasn't. It was too hard.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But all of a sudden, you know, when you're walking around Comic Con in a hotel, you'll just see things going on.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there was like an event happening with a bunch of people in dresses.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It felt very like people were excited about it.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And these were regular sized people, to be clear. None of them could fit in your pocket.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Fucking bullshit.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, I know.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I mean, unless, well, I guess, look, it's possible we could have gotten in there and then seen like one table, a VIP table with lots of tiny, tiny people like Polly Pocket.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Screaming in horror.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, that would have been awesome.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We have to live like this. We were downsized without our permission.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The only movie we're allowed to watch, too, is downsized.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the only way they know how to make those toys is to shrink people down.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That would be what a movie that would be.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Huh?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, that's what that could have been an angle for the Lena Dunham.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was going to say that was what Lena was thinking when she was doing hers, but she's not doing it anymore.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Imagine the pressure that is on, like, OK, so Barbie made $2 billion, one of the biggest films of the decade culturally awards-wise and box office.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So now you go.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You take the toy movie. You go for it. Yeah, seems intimidating. Seems hard. So I understand. I get it.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She's going to lie low.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What if camping was any indication she would have knocked it out of the park?

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Does anyone even remember what camping was when I said that word?

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. But if the name of the show wasn't camping and it was something else, I would I would.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. If you said anything about it further, I would have gone, oh, yeah, you're right.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And you could have lied to me. I wouldn't have known.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is another time where I remember nothing about the show, but I kind of remember the poster very visually in my head.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And let me ask, is it David Tennant and Jennifer Garner?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't think so.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The stars.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm trying to. There's a mush of faces in my head and I'm trying to.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How do we have to look up camping?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Clear it. Oh, wait. Oh, it is. Yeah, it is.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right, he's got it.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Jason has redeemed himself.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Shows you what I know. Look, it was years ago.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Jason fell on his face.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're right. He gets to stay.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Scott fell on his face. I'm back, baby.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not knowing the cast of Camping.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've also watched Camping.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Clearly you remember it better than I do.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Downsizing. Who am I?

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've watched Camping. I did watch the full first season of Young Pope.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know, we've talked about, you love Young Pope.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I love Young Pope. You've talked a lot about Young Pope.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I never watched his second season.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Boy, this is, and this is one of those.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's years and years ago.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That I somehow didn't retain the vast amount of Young Pope conversation.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think first City Walk, Jason is really like Young Pope-pilled at that point.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's an old show.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah. That happened a long, that was 2016.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So he was already two years old talking about the Young Pope.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was late then. We're talking about it more now.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That sounds about right.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're Young Poping in 20, 20, 24.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He got really into Gangnam Style like three years after it came out.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No joke. He would just like opa Gangnam Style.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We're like Jason, that joke is very old at this point.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It didn't deter him at all. He was very excited to make it.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And he is, he's gone, he's gone easy on the Gangnam Style jokes lately.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I'm thinking it might be time for a comeback.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It might be time to bring it back.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We never know when you least expect it.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well let's talk about some things that happened more recently.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This very week in fact.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just to sort of say the plan here.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A week ago today as this is being released we hosted a panel put together by Mattel

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
for the 30th anniversary of Street Sharks.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And we're going to play that full panel for you in the second half of this episode.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So that's where this is going.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But we figured we would flesh out the first half because it was only a 50 minute panel.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Those tight slots, the tight library slot we had.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So we figured we got a little bit of time here.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's talk about some other stuff that happened down at San Diego Comic Con 2024.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As we were all down there. Griffin Newman down there as well.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And yeah, I don't know. I think some things were done.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Some activations were attended.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Some big dumb slides and stuff were gone on.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know that. I don't know if anyone went on a big themed slide.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You did go on a big slide.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I went on a big slide, yeah.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You did. I didn't.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, I'm glad we're having this conversation because I missed this while I was there.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What was your big dumb slide?

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was at the Adult Swim Outdoor Pop-Up or whatever you would call it.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was waiting to see AEW Wrestling.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The wrestlers were wrestling Adult Swim characters which is confusing sounding.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And it is. It was still confusing to watch it.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And confusing being.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And confusing doing I think as well.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It was human beings dressed as like Meatwad and then they were wrestling human AEW wrestlers.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And yeah, but they had a lot of different things.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There was shaved ice there. There were slides.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There were all sorts of fun to be had in this big inflatable kind of area.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know if you saw it if you walked by there.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And it was by the back by the water, closer to the Joe's Crab Shack.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, sure.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If that helps you geographically.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It helps me a little bit, but also I'm less Joe's Crab Shack in San Diego centric than you.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Which it seems like it is one of your primary beacons encouraging you to keep fighting on when times are tough.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, it is, but also we found a new spot.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We had a new spot that I think is going to definitely be a yearly tradition now.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sally's Fish House?

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We did not do Sally's Fish House, but we went to Mike Hess Brewery which is right on the water.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh yes, I just missed you for the second time.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you and I went there in front of the Van Roos show.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And there's a thing called Hess Fest that happens in a couple of weeks with live music.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't think I'm going to make it to Hess Fest, but this is my new Comic-Con thing.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think we're going to do at least one Mike Hess because it's right by the water.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You get good tacos, not too expensive.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
View on the bottom, view on the top.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's in the Seaport Village area, which is a lot of the lure for me going down.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've done a trip that was mainly about Seaport Village without even a Comic-Con going on.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You might say that I spent far more time in Seaport Village than I did on the floor of Comic-Con,

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
in which I spent zero minutes.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I would say that.

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I also think that maybe next year we do a full Seaport Village episode.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Maybe.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was just extolling the virtues of it, but how interesting is that going to be?

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, there are two Ben and Jerry's locations and there are two Mike Hess Breweries.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And they have different things you can get at each one.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But they are located about a six to seven minute walk apart from each other for some reason.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So all that confusion.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not saying it has to be main feed.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm just saying there's theming there.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And there's, as we were saying, there's the carousel.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There's a carousel there.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That used to be in the Burbank Mall.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And if the Burbank Mall is part of the history, we are alert.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yep.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is it something that happens a mile within where we all live?

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then that is right.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That is the front and center on Podcast The Ride's desk.

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's right.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Just to confirm, the Seaport Village is where the Cheesecake Factory is?

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No.

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's the area that used to be a prison that is now, and I don't remember the name of it offhand,

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but that is a converted prison that is now a shopping center that has a puesto

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and that used to have something called Seasons 52 that is a pleasant generic brand that I like a lot.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I like that place too.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, Dearly Departed, right?

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, boy.

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Poor one out.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But yeah, I don't remember the name of that offhand.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You've never been to Seaport Village?

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't think I have.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, my God.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You would live there.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You would move into one of the little houses there.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That would be perfect.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Just one little kind of priest-sized little room with a cot.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, Young Pope style small house.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, hang on.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The Young Pope lives lavishly.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're right.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Young priest.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A poor pope.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You could live like a poor pope.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, I live like a resident of Sweet Haven.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It is kind of Sweet Haven.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a little bit like Sweet Haven, Jason.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How have we never been there together?

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't know where it is.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where is it?

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's kind of behind that Cheesecake Factory, and then it just extends out.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Near the Hyatt, which is kind of the northernmost hotel in the row of hotels by the convention center.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, okay.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You've been over there.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sure you didn't realize you were in Seaport Village though.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's possible, yeah.

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a cute little town.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's very cute.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Though I think it's threatened to be taken away.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I think that's on the shopping block.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's that thing where they want to replace something that's little and fun and charming with a bunch of boring apartments and garbage.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, hopefully not.

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If there's something that has a little bit of charm to it, we've got to get a sweet green in there as soon as possible.

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please, no.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Seaport Village.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Keep San Diego, not weird, but what?

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Charming.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Charming.

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Charming.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Little.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But yeah, so I spent a lot of time in Seaport Village too, but I also spent a lot of time on the Comic-Con floor.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you've never been to Comic-Con, it isn't just walking endless amounts of miles on a show floor with a bunch of crowds and looking through comic bins and seeing stuff and being bumped into.

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's not just that.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can attest it's possible for it to be literally none of that.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It can be almost literally none of that.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Absolutely zero.

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But there are, obviously, there are panels.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You hear people talk, varying degrees of excitement, depending on what the panel is.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:49,000
To me, Comic-Con isn't necessarily about excitement as much as it is about feeling comfortable, feeling like when I was a kid and I would walk and see Walter Koenig talk at the Chicago Comic-Con and you'd sit down and it was so boring, but I was so excited to see Chekhov from Star Trek.

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're chasing a boring chat with Walter Koenig.

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, there's something mundane about it.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was talking to Griffin about this too.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's something so nice and mundane, because even though you have your Hall H and Robert Downey Jr.'s there and that is produced and they've gone over what the copy of that is and what everybody has to say, everything else is so not scripted and feels so boring and human to me, including things with celebrities or Q&As and stuff.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Sure.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I am chasing kind of that sort of like Saturday afternoon vibe where you're sitting and listening to Walter Koenig spin a tale of shooting Star Trek IV or something.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I didn't see him this time, but I'm just remembering being a kid and listening to him tell a story he's no doubt told a hundred, a thousand times at these conventions.

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This kind of helps me to understand it.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean, it's not my deal, but I see the charm.

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I see the Seaport Village in what you're describing.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And I think that's a big draw of it.

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Jason and I have been in many of these panels where a comic book writer will try to make jokes and the audience doesn't like it and it's a little uncomfortable.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He didn't workshop any of this, but now he's in front of a crowd and he does something cool and he's finally getting a chance to see human beings that might actually know his work or whatever.

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And he's like eating shit.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it's great.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's really fun to watch rooms that are excessively easy to bomb.

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Worst environments for a joke going over.

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Right. And it's like it's and especially if it's been a couple of days in the con, everyone's tired.

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Everyone's a little hot, depending on how long they've been outside.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For how they may not have gotten into their first choice panel.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Right. This could be a second choice if the first one was crowded like or they could be watching it to have the seat for the next.

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, that happens a lot to half the crowd is not for you.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They're waiting for like a bigger star in the next panel.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So half your room is not full.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's full of people not paying any attention.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, that's right.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like once I might have said this in the show once before, but I was part of some panel that was surprisingly packed of like people making Internet videos.

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was like people from cracked and I think Nick Mundy was on it with me and I'm like this room boy.

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I guess some of these videos have more reach than I thought.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But it's funny.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They aren't really laughing, but maybe I don't know.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe they're just quiet folks.

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Quiet folks.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And then we finish and then like ladies and gentlemen, the cast of all that.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Kell Mitchell, Lori Beth, and they all go ape shit.

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
All right.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So we're opening for them.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sorry.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But that said, we had a very nice turnout for our panel.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sure, we did.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, yeah.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Nice people before and after like.

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No doubt.

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Friends of the show.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Julia Presko is there.

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Justin Michael is there.

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And Mr. Morrow is there.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Nate was there.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Mr. Morrow showed up.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Which I didn't know was going to.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You gave us no indication that, or at least not me, any indication that was happening.

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, I was texting with him a couple of weeks ago and I told him what we were doing.

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So I hadn't known that, oh my God, he just landed and he's on his way.

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I knew he knew about it, but if we saw him, we saw him.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's another fun thing about Comic-Con is that you run into people constantly.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
People that you know personally or you haven't seen in a while.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Good friends.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
People you watch on YouTube that review toys that you don't know and you just want to say hello to.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And you get as excited or more excited than any famous celebrity,

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
which is something Griffin and I would be like, oh my God, did you see what it is?

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because you, at some point, you went to something that was a star-studded event in terms of toy people.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then he showed me your text to him, which was inscrutable to me.

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Right.

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was just kind of like, guess who's here?

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
James and Walter.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Whoa.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But if those were Imagineers, I would have.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, of course.

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's the thing.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, yeah, we share this.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The niche.

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, there's niche.

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Not even niche.

325
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's just the hyper specificity of what you like and people.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am engaged in so many of these YouTube channels with toy people that I have very strong opinions about them.

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And it's almost like my reality show now to watch all of this stuff because I have sort of constructed narratives,

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
even like fan fiction for human beings on YouTube.

329
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Scott and I at the bar one night got a crash course and some of the toy guys from Griffin.

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, yeah.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Anise and Justin.

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And they all watch and we all sort of go back and forth and talk about it.

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And so we were all in contact of like, oh my God, did you see who it is?

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's Mad Hatter from the YouTube channel, Mad Hatter, who we watch.

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And then it's, yeah, so that's what happens.

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There's people I haven't seen in years that you just run into that's really fun.

338
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And I'm trying to still even explain more of what Comic-Con is.

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And in addition to all that, as I was saying with the Adult Swim, there's just temporary themed entertainment all over the city.

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Pops up everywhere.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That often don't require the badge because it's promotional and they just they want people in there and learn about new properties coming down the pike.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Right.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And so like you go there and it's again it's crowded, but it's turned into a big temporary theme park kind of like there even were rides.

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like there was a Abbott Elementary carnival set up, which I didn't have a chance to do.

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But there's a full carnival theme park set up right by the pier.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I passed by it while it was closed.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Griffin and I were trying to parse it.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The AvaFest.

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AvaFest, yes.

350
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And then but then that's an acronym.

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We're like, what does that mean?

352
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's a very Abbott Festival.

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't know until I looked it up today.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Featuring an exclusive festival playlist created by Questlove.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Questlove dragged some files into a Spotify for AvaFest.

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I didn't know that either about AvaFest.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's great.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's one of the other.

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was just taking screenshots of like stuff that I didn't get to experience.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I like I'm kicking myself.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't get to go to Mr. Beast Labs slime spill.

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I did not do that.

366
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I saw a number of Mr. Beast things.

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There was something on the show.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I didn't go to them.

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I just saw the giant logo.

370
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There was something on the show floor.

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And then there was something like around the gas lamp quarter, which the gas lamp quarter is kind of like five blocks of CityWalk.

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In some ways.

373
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, there's sugar in the gas lamp.

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There is.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And there is any number of sports bars and taquerias.

376
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There's an old.

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, it's funny.

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You say it's like CityWalk, but those are things that are like useful.

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Well, human beings might want to go to.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There's aspects that are CityWalk ask for sure.

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
A thing that yes, you're both correct.

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Correct.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But I think I really like is when the generic sports bar or like a Mexican restaurant just slaps up a sticker that says like Biff Bam Pow or like a really shitty Spider-Man cardboard thing that's like bent and falling apart.

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Like they just pull it out every year and just put it off.

385
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I love generic comic con.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's great.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It always makes me laugh.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's great.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sometimes the restaurant goes to some sort of effort and sometimes they have a new menu printed in it as like comic con.

390
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But then just Jason saying sometimes it's just like it's yeah.

391
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Welcome to the superhero cafe.

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it's just like a person in their regular clothes with a cape.

393
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

394
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then just a couple.

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like party city Spider-Man decorations hanging out.

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They're just like here.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Enjoy this slop.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You little piggies like Gotham massage parlor.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Right.

401
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Wow.

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not just a regular massage.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a chance to experience the kind of stress relief Batman might need.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's right.

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
After a long day of crime fighting.

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And that works.

407
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Superman margarita.

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This one is 16 ounces not 12 ounces.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Whoa.

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And even though I laugh it like Jason laughs at it.

411
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It still works on me.

412
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A little piggy who likes Spider-Man.

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's cute.

414
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's what I want.

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Give me that more of that slop.

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And then yeah.

417
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And then there's just as we alluded to earlier talked about earlier the Polly Pocket type thing.

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Where you just wander into like parties or activations or weird events.

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Scott you and I wandered and talked our way into a unofficial Ninja Turtle event where we ate free pizza and had free drinks was not planned.

420
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It was just sort of like we happened upon it.

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And then people were like yeah okay.

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Like we just had to download an app in front of them and get at least to the screen that shows that you've set up a screen name for this app.

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah.

425
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Clearly it worked this app that I definitely do have and I definitely definitely remember the name of.

426
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I do remember the name of it but it's funnier if we don't say it.

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And it was a very funny negotiation process of like well are you on the list.

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

429
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well do you have the app.

430
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Not yet.

431
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Can we just download the app and come in.

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
OK well show me you have the app and you've signed up.

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
All right.

434
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then like 10 minutes later while this slow download speeds on the phones are like all right I think.

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
All right I think I got it.

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
OK here it is.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
In there free pizza free drinks.

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Good deal.

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's the comic comic magic.

440
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's that's you never know.

442
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The bump into we had no plan and before you know it we are trans we were transported sort of to the world of the Ninja Turtles sort of.

443
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Unofficial.

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
A license.

446
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What we were transported to was a bunch of tables that had pizza boxes and we're like ooh pizza.

447
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh no the pizza boxes have toys and merch in them.

448
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh yeah.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well that's free.

450
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's good but I can't eat any of this.

451
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh good.

452
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
These other pizza boxes that look identical do have pizza in them.

453
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's a little confusing to parse.

454
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
When I saw Griffin once he did have a souvenir pizza box and in my head I was like are you going to try to get that back to New York.

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I think so.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I do want to ask him like how does he do like does he pack an extra suitcase for Comic Con stuff.

457
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Does he ship it.

458
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I imagine because I like what I've gathered about Griffin is that he comes back from anywhere he goes with 12 big cumbersome souvenir glasses.

459
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh yeah.

461
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He did it in Florida.

462
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There was a plastic mugs all like like bashing into each other.

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's like yeah he just takes a garbage bag like like full of aluminum cans and just like just a big mug sack.

464
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's his personal item.

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There was there's a FedEx in the Manchester Grand.

466
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So I saw a bunch of people with their boxes just boxed up shipping all of their stuff home.

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wow.

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So I don't know if he does that but that is an option if you go do one of these things.

469
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's true.

470
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think there's one in the convention center itself.

471
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There is.

472
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So that's an option.

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

475
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You want to box up your unlicensed Ninja Turtle like pizza cutter.

476
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Now this was now you allude to something.

477
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This was a little bit of a conflict while we were up there is that I think Griffin was more than happy to take all of the you know whatever materials were were up there and other others of us were as well.

478
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And you made a firm declaration.

479
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You opened the box and you said unlicensed and you refuse to have any of this stuff in your hand.

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well I just like it was trying to trick me.

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It was trying to fool me with the logo that looks similar to the Turtles logo.

483
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But if you look there was no Viacom licensing.

484
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
There's no actual Turtle characters on it.

485
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It was just sort of stuff to make me think that the Turtles were involved when they weren't.

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Wow.

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The Turtles were not.

488
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I smelled it.

489
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And people didn't necessarily believe me right away.

490
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But then they looked unlicensed.

491
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

492
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well yeah.

493
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's the kind of thing you would be right on.

494
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Certainly.

495
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah.

496
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's my expertise is in noticing Turtle merchandise that's licensed not licensed.

497
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But this and this is the kind of thing.

498
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OK.

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We've talked a lot on this show about how Jason comes to life when he is at Islands of Adventure.

500
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

501
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It is another Jason.

502
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It is.

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not Jason.

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's the Flash.

505
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He is.

506
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He's another man.

507
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Just like.

508
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Transform.

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That or if you're like talking about a place where you ate clams on the Jersey Shore in

511
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
1998.

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
These are the things that turn Jason into Mecca Jason.

513
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Right.

514
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Right.

515
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And for Mike and you know some of that stuff you know theme parks do it for Mike as well.

516
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But it does feel like Comic Con is particularly where you become Mega Mike.

517
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A hundred percent.

518
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I was I love Comic Con so much.

519
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It is so I like it's it's again it's a big theme park that's like oftentimes shitty

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
in ways but oftentimes mundane.

521
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And some of which is free.

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Some of it is free.

523
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Most theme parks.

524
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I love to perform.

525
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I like getting to go to Comic Con and do stuff which I've done here and there is always fun.

526
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We get the I've said this before the name card that has my name on it.

527
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have it with me.

528
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't know where it is.

529
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You brought it.

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I do have it.

531
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I had it in there.

532
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Did you just want to show off to us who also got them?

533
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I know you guys have it too.

534
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah.

535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah.

536
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I saved my I was so excited to get a name card and discover all the text on the back

537
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
of the name card.

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But I guess it's Comic Con for me is the there's checking involved.

540
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There's a lot of prep now.

541
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm very good at doing Comic Con in general.

542
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I think there's a lot of prep because I like to figure out what the stuff is I want to

543
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
do.

544
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then there are parties I try to get into beforehand that then sometimes it works.

545
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Sometimes it does not.

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And you got us into I got into a very fun party.

547
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That was a great got to go to an IG the IGN party which was fun.

549
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And these parties are like hard to get into but also not in some way where it's like I

550
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
feel like when I first started going I was like well no way I'm getting into that thing

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
over there.

552
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And it's like if you have the right email address you can kind of do it.

553
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But yes I I the last day of Comic Con I walked twenty six thousand miles.

554
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Twenty miles.

555
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Steps I assume.

556
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No no miles.

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It might have been.

558
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't know.

559
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Again this is another mic.

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But it is I don't know it's it's it's so much stimulation for my brain I think is what

561
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
it is because like I like to be checking I like to like fidget and stuff but it's like

562
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm here I'm running here I'm running here I'm doing this.

563
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There's four things I have to do tonight.

564
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I have to see four different sets of people tonight.

565
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

566
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And it's I'm certainly feeling like I'm older and I'm a little more tired during this.

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That being said I did just as well as I always did.

568
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And after a day of it.

569
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Got it.

570
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I still fucking got it.

571
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can still go hard.

572
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We really we didn't do much on Sunday but that's because we were down there with my

573
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
daughter and we were staying with Lindsay's mom and stuff and we were doing some more

574
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
family stuff.

575
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Boo snooze!

576
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Why'd you do that?

577
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You missed so many you could have met Stanley.

578
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You could have met toy guy Stanley.

579
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Instead of your daughter.

580
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You were your daughter all the time.

581
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Stanley is dead.

582
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Not Stanley.

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
He's Stanley.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Stanley the toy guy.

585
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
All right fair enough.

586
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well I would like to meet Stanley from the office and don't go to the movie.

587
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Stanley Clatch.

588
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
One of the biggest names in action figures.

589
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Every year I almost I also start to question it because sometimes people will be like Comic

590
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Con this and that and then I will go to Comic Con and I'll end and I'll be like I miss Comic

591
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Con.

592
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Bring it on next year.

593
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah.

594
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I feel that same way this year.

595
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I had so much fun.

596
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I you get into like every year Matt Cardona sees me at Comic Con he insults my shirt.

597
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Makes fun of my shirt.

598
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So there's traditions is what I'm saying that happens.

599
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This year I was wearing you know that shirt I have like little oranges on it.

600
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You ever seen me wear that?

601
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah I've seen you wear that number of times.

602
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He was like that looks like you're looking for a lot of attention wearing that shirt.

603
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I was like what are you talking about?

604
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And then I talked.

605
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
How dare somebody want attention the wrestler.

606
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Right.

607
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That's what I was saying to him.

608
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What do you wear usually.

609
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And then I turned to the person working at like the front who like checks your ID and

610
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I go does your shirt look weird.

611
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And the guy was like really nice young guy and he goes well I guess the oranges look

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
a little bit like balls.

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I go and then I turn the card and I go is this what you meant.

614
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I said do you mean that.

615
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And he goes no that's not what I was talking about.

616
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And I go why balls.

617
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And then I went to what I started polling ever got in your head.

618
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He did get in my head and we're going to throw this poll up and we're going to let the

619
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
listener decide if the shirt we took a photo.

620
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What is the question for the shirt.

621
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What is it.

622
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is the shirt weird for me to be wearing.

623
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That's really what the question is for the listener.

624
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well look and that's that.

625
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't know.

626
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You might want to rephrase it because weird has become the key word of this election cycle.

627
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Well and I don't think I look I don't think it's that kind of weird.

628
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's not that kind of.

629
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah no.

630
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This is not a JD Vance situation.

631
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No.

632
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't think but you have to refresh my memory.

633
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Well and you know what's funny you say weird and weird yes that weird has been used to

634
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
paint the Republican Party which is it's really good and seems like it's been very

635
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
effective in making just like an average person go.

636
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
These people are weird which is right is correct.

637
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The low bar.

638
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You're a basic thing to remind people weird is though too too soft of a word.

639
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Let's be honest.

640
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It is.

641
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes.

642
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But I see.

643
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But I get this.

644
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah.

645
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I see how it's like more tangible of a thing to go after than this is going to end the

646
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
world and democracy.

647
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

648
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

649
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Feel hyperbolic even if you believe it's true.

650
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's a little more palatable than like total fucking psycho.

651
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Right.

652
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And it's smart.

653
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's a smart.

654
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's they're good.

655
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
They're in the real world to use that.

656
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That makes sense.

657
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But what's funny is we talk about weird and I was talking to somebody I just met that

658
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
same night where my shirt had been insulted and I was explaining that and this is this

659
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
is I hate to drop so many names tonight but I was explaining how I'm responsible for Len

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Testa and Matt Cardona becoming friends.

661
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This is what I did.

662
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And this person.

663
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's a hell of a name job.

664
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And this person said and she meant this in the best possible way she goes oh she goes

665
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
your life is weird.

666
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I went my life is weird like that.

667
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah it is.

668
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That is right.

669
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And she meant it positively.

670
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well this is what this election is about is reclaiming the word.

671
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I would make it a good thing and a fun thing.

672
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Right.

673
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No.

674
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Well no.

675
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well let's wait till after the election.

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Using it to assassinate them character wise and then.

677
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah.

678
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah.

679
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
This is a shirt I was wearing.

680
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I think that's a little understated.

681
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't agree with Cardona here.

682
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Of course.

683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He's out of his mind.

684
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Those aren't big oranges.

685
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No they're not.

686
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I bought one like that a year or two ago.

687
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Like it just didn't fit so I returned it.

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I love the orange pattern.

689
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Of course.

690
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I mean people were supportive.

691
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're trying to look like Mike.

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You like it that much.

693
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You're trying to dress like your buddy Mike.

694
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I think I was first.

695
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Whoa.

696
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Whoa.

697
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Mike Mike when did you get this.

698
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Over a year ago.

699
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Here's a conflict I'm even more interested in.

700
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Over a year ago.

701
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But yeah but didn't you say two years.

702
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
A couple years.

703
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I gotta look.

704
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We gotta find out when.

705
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'll find.

706
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's a hell of an accusation.

707
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But he never wore it.

708
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
No because it was like a tag.

709
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So I wouldn't have seen it.

710
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It doesn't count as a trend.

711
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And you never heard that he had it.

712
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You didn't hear about a shirt that Jason got.

713
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You got jealous and then got a similar shirt.

714
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The conversation that Jason and I have generally do involve well I got a shirt and then I had

715
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
to return it.

716
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Like that is something we would talk about.

717
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh I know.

718
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm aware of the kind of conversations you have.

719
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The long and short of it I'd love Len tested to get in the ring and break a light tube

720
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
over Cardona's back.

721
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well look I don't need Len to fight my battles for me all right.

722
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm just saying if I have to do it.

723
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
All right if you can still go you can get in the GCW.

724
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well I could still do Comic Con.

725
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I could still go to Comic Con.

726
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You think you can go for a short little death match.

727
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
As long as it's short.

728
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay.

729
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
As long as the death match is short.

730
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You can still go and walk to different panels and boxes of comics.

731
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Therefore I could do a death match.

732
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Same thing.

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Just a little.

734
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Just a little.

735
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Well just a little.

736
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah a little.

737
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
A little death match.

738
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah no.

739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Jane and I ran into Mike at about four o'clock on Friday afternoon after we had done the

740
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
panel.

741
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We went through the kind of crowd like Gaslamp Quarter.

742
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We did a lap on the convention floor.

743
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That was kind of enough for both of us.

744
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And we see Mike at the street corner outside the hotel and he goes you going to the Paramount

745
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Lodge.

746
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's like no we're going to go take a nap.

747
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah I was on my way to the Paramount Lodge.

748
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I also went to take a nap but I was a little you know in my heart I did I understand the

749
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
question.

750
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I understand the desire to get people into the Paramount Lodge.

751
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
In fact I ask you now how was the Paramount Lodge?

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The Paramount Lodge.

753
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Jason what was that sigh about?

754
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Well it's just what I heard already about the Paramount Lodge.

755
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm a little disappointed and I'm glad I didn't make the effort.

756
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Well there was no Frasier part of the lodge.

757
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That was like the main thing luring us.

758
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You're kidding.

759
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Really?

760
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That was some confusing part of the press release that I read and that was something

761
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
else.

762
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We went up and asked where's Frasier?

763
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Is Frasier here?

764
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And Frasier was not there.

765
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah because you build it to us as you get to go to Frasier's bar.

766
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh Shears?

767
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No.

768
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
His new bar Mahoney's.

769
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Mahoney's Tap Room.

770
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
His bar from the new show presumably in tribute to the actor who played his father.

771
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
John Mahoney yeah.

772
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah yeah.

773
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So not even all right it's not Shears.

774
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's a bar that I don't know and then they don't even have it.

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That was disappointing but pretty like and it was pretty small overall the lodge because

776
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
again all your favorite Paramount properties are under one roof we didn't say this.

777
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ninja Turtles.

778
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Ghosts.

779
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Evil.

780
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah that tattoo show that I can't think of the name of.

781
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Ink Master?

782
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Ink Master yes.

783
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Old episodes of Unplugged.

784
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's all there.

785
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And we all know it's Paramount.

786
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Was there a Halo thing in the Paramount Lodge?

787
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
No.

788
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.

789
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But.

790
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That would have been weird because they had canceled the Halo TV show mere days before

791
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
despite saying like check out the Halo Target range in the Paramount Lodge.

792
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah so the Halo not there but you walk right into Tulsa King's Bread 2 Buck Saloon.

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Bread.

794
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Sorry.

795
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Number 2.

796
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Bread.

797
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Bread 2 Buck Saloon.

798
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Bread and not bread like the food bread but bread like you were breeding.

799
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah.

800
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
An animal.

801
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Right.

802
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Becomes a buck.

803
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's what they're conveying here.

804
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
An animal husbandry presumably but it does sound like some cuckoldry sort of stuff.

805
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't know.

806
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Bread 2 Cuck.

807
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If it was.

808
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The Bread 2 Cuck Saloon.

809
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
If there was any sort of cuckolding going on I don't know.

810
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm not sure.

811
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Sorry the RNC was in a different city a few weeks before Comic Con.

812
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
If Jason had heard about that some sort of Paramount cuckolding activation he would have

813
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
maybe not taken that nap but come with me.

814
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's what I think.

815
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Well.

816
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
For which side of it.

817
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
For which side of it.

818
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
In what way do you participate in the Bread 2 Cuck.

819
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Observer.

820
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Observer.

821
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I believe that's called a switch.

822
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah you have Frazier and Niles.

823
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I know there's no Niles representation.

824
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If there's no Niles representation on the show there certainly won't be in the lot.

825
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Niles is out.

826
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But Roz came back I think at the end of the season.

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't know anything about that Jason.

828
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I do have Paramount plus so I should get caught up.

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
There's another thing I think me and Andrew Grissom were talking about this.

830
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah and on the new Frazier his old pal, because he was back in Boston so his old friends show

831
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
up.

832
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh you mean like from the bar?

833
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

834
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Roz.

835
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Briefly.

836
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So you don't get to see Clifford.

837
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
No.

838
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No you don't.

839
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What aren't you understanding about new Frazier?

840
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Get your head out of your ass.

841
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I actually am pretty excited Roz came back.

842
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Like I loved Roz.

843
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You were a big Roz kid.

844
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I thought she was very funny.

845
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I liked Roz fine.

846
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I did too but I'd be excited about a full participation of Roz not like one episode

847
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ends with Roz's shadow and then in the next one you get two minutes with Roz.

848
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Sure.

849
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

850
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I would lose my shit.

851
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I would be like the Robert Downey Jr. on stage if I saw Niles came back unannounced.

852
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Like if Dr. Doom took off his mask and it was Niles.

853
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It was Niles?

854
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It was David Hyde Pierce.

855
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh man.

856
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah.

857
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What if they were like who's playing Dr. Doom when it's David Hyde Pierce?

858
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Same thing.

859
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We needed the greatest actor in the world and then David Hyde Pierce showed up.

860
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You couldn't argue with that.

861
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's a good candidate.

862
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think David Hyde Pierce actually would be a very good Dr. Doom.

863
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I agree.

864
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I don't know if the audience would give him the pop that he deserves like that.

865
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
He might have been more confused than anything, yes.

866
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He's kind of a chameleon in recent years.

867
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
His hair and then beard.

868
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Like for parts and stuff I feel like he's a very good character actor.

869
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's what you say after the mask is unveiled.

870
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Nobody knows who it was.

871
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then some people kind of murmur, David Hyde Pierce?

872
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Is that David Hyde?

873
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And then you get on a mic.

874
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Actually he's been a bit of a chameleon in recent years.

875
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Does that help you out?

876
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Now will you cheer?

877
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Wonderful performer.

878
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Very versatile.

879
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Wait until you see how long his hair can grow.

880
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And then you'll know.

881
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Then you'll see.

882
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I know you think he's just house, but he can also grow long hair.

883
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He can do Shakespeare.

884
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I had two free complimentary drinks at the Bread to Buck Saloon.

885
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Damn.

886
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I had the specialty, the Golden Driller and the General.

887
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The General was good.

888
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It was a little sweet, but good.

889
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And the Golden Driller was awful.

890
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I didn't like it at all.

891
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I drank it, but I did not like it.

892
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I did not like it at all.

893
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
They have a lot of...

894
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There's a photo opportunity for the Paramount's If.

895
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

896
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The movie If.

897
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

898
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And there's a hopscotch sort of on the ground here.

899
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You could sort of do the hopscotch from If.

900
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Tired of doing your own crummy hopscotch on your own sidewalk or backyard.

901
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Guess what?

902
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Hopscotch.

903
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's so boring.

904
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This hopscotch doesn't teach me about any movies.

905
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then, yes, my friend Anise and I took the photo op,

906
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and we were there with one of our favorite characters from If.

907
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, there he is.

908
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So what's that character's name up there?

909
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know what?

910
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's funny.

911
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I thought I knew the name, but I sent it to our friend Andrew Grissom,

912
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and he just said, hey, that's one of the better characters in If.

913
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So all I know about that character is that's one of the better characters.

914
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's Goobles.

915
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You got your picture with Goobles.

916
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Goobles?

917
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You're supposed to goobles.

918
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh, I know.

919
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I think that's Goobles.

920
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh, excuse me.

921
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes, you're right.

922
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Goobles.

923
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We got free pizza in the Ninja Turtle area.

924
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Wow, there's a lot of competing turtle bars.

925
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That is licensed.

926
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The pictures were there.

927
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And then my favorite part of it is that the show Ghosts, which I don't know.

928
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Jason, are you familiar with Ghosts?

929
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I know of Ghosts.

930
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay, nobody watches it.

931
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Ghosts is not evil.

932
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ghosts is not evil, no.

933
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But you go into a perfumery or something room, and there's all these different scents.

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And they're like, you know, ghosts can't taste, but they can smell, which I didn't know.

935
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I'm excited about this lore, this ghost lore.

936
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And so they had six different scents or seven scents that you could pick one,

937
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and they would give you a little piece of paper that had the scent on it, and you could use the scent.

938
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And I was like, this is interesting.

939
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've never seen this in one of these activations before comic.

940
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That is unique, yeah.

941
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So I got some.

942
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I was like, I don't know anything about scents.

943
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I just said, musk?

944
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What about musk?

945
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Do you have anything musk-related?

946
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And they're like, oh, we do.

947
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yeah, absolutely.

948
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And it's this one.

949
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I think I took a photo of it.

950
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And that was one where I went, oh, that was very nice.

951
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That was, I really.

952
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So thumbs up on ghosts.

953
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm feeling good.

954
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You know, I'm looking at the Wikipedia ghost, too.

955
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And apparently Betsy Sidaro is a recurring ghost cholera victim from the 18th century.

956
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I believe Mary Holland also recurring in the upcoming season of Ghosts.

957
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So Pat's guests of this show are here.

958
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, she's Patience, a Puritan ghost.

959
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
All right.

960
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Look out for Patience.

961
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Patience.

962
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And look out for Nancy, friends of the show, Patience and Nancy.

963
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Lenape?

964
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Lenape?

965
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Legends?

966
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't know what this is called.

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But it's originally, it says, from the mind of a storyteller, fragrance description, sage,

968
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
cedarwood, amber, pepperoni spice.

969
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then, yeah, so they have all these different things.

970
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And there was a very nicely themed room.

971
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And that was the last thing we did, which was good.

972
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh, the last thing we did was that I got a free poster for the movie If.

973
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Great.

974
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And I tried getting rid of it.

975
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The rest of it, I would try to hand it to people.

976
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I almost left it behind.

977
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I had like a quick bowl of salmon and something.

978
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And so I could get a vegetable.

979
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And there's broccoli in there.

980
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I left it on the seat.

981
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I was walking down the street.

982
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And I hear, hey, hey, hey, excuse me.

983
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I go, what?

984
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And I turn around.

985
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And it's like a wait staff person going, hey, your poster?

986
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Your If poster?

987
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Ah, shit.

988
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That would have been a perfect way to guilt free, get rid of the If poster.

989
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I thought the broccoli diversion would work.

990
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And then, yeah, so then we met up with friends that day.

991
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That was really fun.

992
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Saw a lot of different people.

993
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Lindsay got to meet Mr. Morrow.

994
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, I was going to say, that was part of the Mr. Morrow experience.

995
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I watched this moment from across the table.

996
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And Lindsay did like a full body shiver.

997
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It was unreal.

998
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It was like watching a child meet the real Easter bunny.

999
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
If one of the characters from If, who you've only imagined, shows up in your real life,

1000
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
that was what Lindsay did to Mr. Morrow.

1001
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
She was, she would have really liked to have gone with us to Orlando last October.

1002
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
But, you know, she stayed behind, watched Baby.

1003
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But the one thing in that, during that trip that she was really jealous of,

1004
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
it was not Guardians, it was not Velocicoaster.

1005
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It was that we got to meet Mr. Morrow.

1006
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That was the thing.

1007
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
She was insanely, like, seething with jealousy over her.

1008
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Wow.

1009
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So I remember, because I had alluded, oh, I think Mr. Morrow will be at Comic Con.

1010
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe we'll see him or something.

1011
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But I hadn't told, I hadn't reminded her about it.

1012
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
She also really wanted to see the Bourne stuntacular.

1013
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I'm like, Lindsay, actually none of us made it to that.

1014
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's not true.

1015
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Griffin and I did.

1016
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We haven't talked about it at all.

1017
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
What?

1018
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah.

1019
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Didn't rush to do that episode.

1020
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That doesn't be, actually, well, I'll keep it, I don't know.

1021
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I think I liked it enough.

1022
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's just sometimes, you know.

1023
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, we'll wait until I do it.

1024
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Sometimes you'd rather it be like insanely good or insanely bad to fuel that up.

1025
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But now I did get to do it.

1026
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I got instructions from Julius Stiles on how to move into the next room.

1027
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah.

1028
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Whoa.

1029
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Is it Stiles?

1030
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Is it really Stiles?

1031
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Stiles, I guess that's a spoiler if you actually know.

1032
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh, man.

1033
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I got to get back down there.

1034
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's your custom theme park celebrity appearance.

1035
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah.

1036
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I want to go just to see the preview center and do stuntacular and get a bright blue Trolls

1037
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
ice cream.

1038
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Are you going to try to fit in a trip for preview center before the park itself opens?

1039
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That park is opening soon.

1040
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That park is opening very soon.

1041
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We'll see.

1042
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We'll see.

1043
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know.

1044
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The rumors continue that this thing is like March or something.

1045
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

1046
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We're coming up quick.

1047
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Keeping an eye on what we're supposed to be there for and we'll see.

1048
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Getting a hotel, renting a scooter solely to do the preview center.

1049
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think you should do it.

1050
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Jason, it does sound like you.

1051
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It does sound like I considered it.

1052
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can do it tomorrow.

1053
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Jason, get your phone out and book a ticket.

1054
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Do it in front of us.

1055
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Tomorrow.

1056
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Let us know you did it.

1057
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I did it.

1058
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We had a funny moment the other day because we were talking about we were going to try

1059
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to go back east and see my family in the fall.

1060
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No.

1061
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Orlando.

1062
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No, no, no.

1063
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Orlando might come out with his family.

1064
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Boring.

1065
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You're seeing your family.

1066
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But then I was like, hey, Philadelphia to Orlando is really short.

1067
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We go to Universal for a couple of days.

1068
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
That's true.

1069
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He's like, I thought you were going to say go see my family.

1070
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
No.

1071
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Boring.

1072
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Sorry.

1073
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sorry.

1074
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
No one should see their family.

1075
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Your only family should be the Minions.

1076
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Augmented reality.

1077
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Little model.

1078
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
My family are the imaginary family from If.

1079
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
My extended family, the Island of Burke residence, the Isle of Burke.

1080
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Isle of Burke.

1081
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Thank you.

1082
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Excuse me.

1083
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But we'll be back.

1084
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We'll do Stuntacular.

1085
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
If you don't go in a few days, which you should, we'll be back.

1086
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We'll be back sooner rather than later to Orlando.

1087
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But yeah, but you know what was great was getting to do a little live experience again,

1088
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
which we hadn't gotten to do in a minute.

1089
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And this was a blast to do.

1090
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And as we sort of referred to, getting to go to Mattel and see behind the scenes of Mattel

1091
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and have their participation and top secret Street Shirts info.

1092
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We get into all that in the show.

1093
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Is there anything final to say about Comic-Con or do we throw to?

1094
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No, it's a lot.

1095
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Those were the highlights.

1096
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm already sort of, I'm already like trying to like, how do we make Comic-Con bigger and

1097
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
better next year?

1098
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And I don't know.

1099
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't know.

1100
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't have an answer yet, but I'm working on it.

1101
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm thinking about it.

1102
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

1103
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah.

1104
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Well, it requires a big jump.

1105
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I got, I know.

1106
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Cause we would have liked to have done some other thing, but we wouldn't know we were

1107
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
going until kind of recently.

1108
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But I was glad this came together and yeah, thanks everybody at Mattel and Griffin for

1109
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and you Mike for helping put it all together.

1110
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Uh, so I think we'll probably do some sort of little, little break here.

1111
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And then after that will be our, our panel, uh, audio is fine.

1112
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Like you said, Griffin's made a little blown out, but anything we want to warn anybody

1113
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
about the first couple of minutes, I think it'll be, end up being fine.

1114
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
First couple of minutes, it was a little too, it was turned up a little too much, but I'll

1115
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
adjust that should be fine.

1116
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But then Griffin's a little blown up, but I think it's fine.

1117
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's you'll, you'll be fine.

1118
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Worth posting anyway.

1119
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That's what happens when the panels is about to start and you're plugging in a zoom on

1120
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the floor.

1121
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That was wild.

1122
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah.

1123
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The way the emails leading up to the, to the pan, I don't want to throw too much shade

1124
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
at Comic-Con.

1125
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's like, Oh yeah.

1126
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And this will be this.

1127
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And then they'll have a person there that'll record everything for you.

1128
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But if you want to bring a recorder and then I got there and it's like, Oh, so you're recording

1129
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
the panel.

1130
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They're like, no way.

1131
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Not happening.

1132
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm not doing that.

1133
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And I'm like, Oh, okay.

1134
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Okay.

1135
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So I have a recorder and then what?

1136
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, I'll just go over the size.

1137
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
They just plug it in.

1138
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I go, okay.

1139
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Plug it in over here, but you're in the back.

1140
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Why are you, why are you over here?

1141
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Why can't you look at it?

1142
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, no, no, no.

1143
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Over here.

1144
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Okay.

1145
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Uh, the panel starts in two minutes.

1146
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Okay.

1147
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Great.

1148
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm doing so like I left two minutes into us talking to check and I turned it down a

1149
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
little bit.

1150
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,080
So there's also like, there are instructions on by the microphones of how to use the microphones

1151
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,680
and we immediately sat down and I feel like we all started moving them and bending them

1152
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,680
like, no, no.

1153
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
We got this.

1154
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
No.

1155
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Yeah.

1156
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
The instructions made no sense.

1157
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
I didn't know.

1158
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,680
You're fascinated by what's behind the signs.

1159
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
I gotta say.

1160
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,880
Jason is about to refer to it for the third time in this episode.

1161
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,280
I'm so excited.

1162
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
That's a different sign.

1163
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
No, no.

1164
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,960
I'm not referring to the same sign.

1165
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
That's a different sign.

1166
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,360
There's Mike etiquette sign and then what's behind the name.

1167
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:23,240
I'll post the behind the scenes of the signs because I took them all when I left.

1168
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Uh, okay.

1169
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,240
But yeah.

1170
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,260
Hey, look, it's better than if we recorded off a phone, right?

1171
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,260
So that's better.

1172
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,260
Yeah.

1173
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,260
You'll hear that.

1174
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,380
There's a lot to do and it'll take a quick break and then you will hear our panel put

1175
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,180
together by Mattel with our pal Griffin Newman Street Sharks 30 years of Jawsome.

1176
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,740
How is everybody doing?

1177
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Hello Comic Con.

1178
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,740
What's happening?

1179
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,740
Hello.

1180
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Hi.

1181
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,740
Hi.

1182
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,740
My name's Mike.

1183
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,020
Uh, this is, this reminds me of like, we're in like a Senate hearing or something where

1184
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,620
I'm like, yes, Mr. Mr. Secretary, I did not help Dr. Piranoid.

1185
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,620
I was no part of his experiments.

1186
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Welcome to Comic Con.

1187
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,620
Please be aware that many members of your audience may be under 18 years of age.

1188
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Did you know there's stuff on the back of these?

1189
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,620
I never knew that.

1190
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,620
Oh, we did?

1191
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,620
Wow.

1192
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,620
Okay.

1193
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,620
Hey.

1194
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,620
Thank you.

1195
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,620
Great.

1196
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,620
Great.

1197
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,420
Was that for all three or just one of us specifically?

1198
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,020
It was Jason only, apparently.

1199
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,020
Jason only.

1200
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,620
Uh, you know, here's, here's something to calibrate here as we begin this.

1201
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,620
Who here is aware of or listener to our podcast, Podcast The Ride?

1202
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,620
It's pretty good.

1203
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Pretty good.

1204
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,260
We're happy to hear that.

1205
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
So thank you for coming out.

1206
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,700
But let me ask another question.

1207
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:43,300
Who here does no idea who we are and you are just big fans of the ultimate fin force known

1208
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,180
as the street sharks.

1209
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,180
Okay.

1210
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,180
Okay.

1211
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Okay.

1212
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,900
This is extremely helpful to calibrate.

1213
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:58,380
I just want to say, uh, in terms of, uh, just balancing out everything and, you know, we're

1214
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,420
in the library right now and there might, I don't, I don't want to end up with library

1215
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,420
energy.

1216
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,860
I actually need everybody to kick it up a notch because we're to celebrate 30 years

1217
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,660
of Jawsome with the street sharks.

1218
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,660
Let's do it.

1219
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,660
Great.

1220
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:19,900
But now, now not too loud, we are in a library, so we need to be considerate.

1221
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,140
A little less Jawsome would be fine.

1222
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:27,820
Uh, so yeah, look, I mean, if you don't know our show, it is usually about theme parks.

1223
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,260
So why are we here talking about street sharks?

1224
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,340
My theory is that somebody mumbled on the phone and misheard what was said.

1225
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,180
They do a podcast about street sharks.

1226
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Yeah, that's it.

1227
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,180
That's it.

1228
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Let's get them.

1229
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Uh, but you know what?

1230
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,460
It doesn't matter anyway, because the podcast, the ride you thought you knew is dead.

1231
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,460
Let's remind you of the logo.

1232
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,460
This is our normal logo, but it doesn't matter.

1233
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,020
It's dead because we are now today, Jodcast the Bite.

1234
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,020
That's right.

1235
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,020
Yeah.

1236
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,900
And in fact, let's reintroduce ourselves.

1237
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,540
I'm Scrod Gardner.

1238
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:09,020
That's Jawsome Sharkadin and there's, and that's Pike Carlschum.

1239
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
Yeah.

1240
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,620
And we're, we really, we wouldn't be street sharks.

1241
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,140
We wouldn't be like book sharks.

1242
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:21,020
We would be, well, there's, you know, there's like a street smarts and then there's book

1243
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,580
smarts and I think we're more book smart than street smart.

1244
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,580
Am I wrong?

1245
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,580
I see.

1246
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,540
Shark was a pun on smart.

1247
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,540
Okay.

1248
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,540
Yes.

1249
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,540
Great.

1250
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,540
We got it.

1251
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,540
Wasn't it obvious?

1252
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,340
I think, you know, I think that we're playing in the right area here because as we have

1253
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,980
delved into 30 years of Jawsome with the street sharks, it does seem like puns are a big part

1254
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,660
of this property.

1255
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,180
So we will try to bust out as many of them as we can while we're here.

1256
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,300
You know, something we do love on our show, regardless of where it comes from, is big

1257
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:01,100
silly entertainment, especially from the 1990s, properties that aren't afraid to just be a

1258
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,260
big dumb unbridled fun.

1259
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,220
And that's what I think the street sharks are.

1260
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,500
And that's why we're excited to be here and talk about the property, talk about the relaunch

1261
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
of the toy.

1262
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,940
And new figures or people aware of this that you can get new street sharks this year from

1263
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,060
the fine people at Mattel.

1264
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,420
And I do say the fine people at Mattel put this thing together and who gave us a tour

1265
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,100
of the Mattel facilities.

1266
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,100
That's one of the cool.

1267
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,940
It's actually a place that is as cool as you might imagine it is.

1268
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:34,260
Like if a kid had to draw their idea of what the Mattel factory is like, it actually matches.

1269
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,420
There's a big Hot Wheels loop.

1270
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,380
They get that every day.

1271
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,340
I work on Zoom in my house.

1272
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,860
That's much more boring.

1273
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:48,420
And they do have a William Frawley head from a doll a few years ago.

1274
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,900
I was very excited to see that.

1275
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:55,580
We have limited time here, but there was a whole roll of Lucille ball heads in there.

1276
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,140
I don't think we're spoiling anything by saying that.

1277
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,900
I got very excited very quickly.

1278
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,900
And then I went, oh my God, is that William Frawley's head sitting in a glass case?

1279
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,980
And the answer was yes.

1280
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,420
And then eventually they turned the lights off because they're like, we need to go home.

1281
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,420
Please leave, sir.

1282
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,260
I tried to break the glass, but it was tough glass.

1283
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,180
If I had been a street shark, I could have done it.

1284
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,380
If I was stronger.

1285
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,940
We're not here for Frawley talk.

1286
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,460
We are here to talk about the street sharks.

1287
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,620
We're here to talk about how they fight.

1288
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,580
We are going to delve into how they bite.

1289
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,740
And time permitting, we will address how they kick some serious fin.

1290
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,140
Are you guys ready for that?

1291
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,140
Great.

1292
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,660
As you may know, street sharks are the ultimate fin force.

1293
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,780
The only big and buff half man, half shark action figures that empower kids with jawsome

1294
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,880
force to bite and battle the world's most evil creatures.

1295
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,300
What I have just read is from the official original Bible for street sharks.

1296
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,260
For the toys, the advertisements and the series, the people at Mattel opened the shark vault

1297
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,940
for us and therefore for you.

1298
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,340
As dangerous as that may seem, they were willing to do it.

1299
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,140
So we'll be reading snippets and getting some cool stuff out of that.

1300
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:11,460
I hope before Biden leaves office, he declassifies the street sharks Bible.

1301
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,220
Yeah, because we cannot.

1302
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,220
Our names are watermarked all over it and we'll get into a lot of trouble if we share

1303
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,220
it.

1304
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,220
I just think, yeah.

1305
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,740
He'd be a legend if he did that.

1306
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,540
Freedom of Information Act should be in play here, I think, but anyway.

1307
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,340
You know, there's three of us, but there's four street sharks.

1308
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,700
And I feel like we aren't really matching right now.

1309
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,700
We aren't matching and stacking up to the Bolton brothers, the group that became the

1310
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,180
street sharks.

1311
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,260
So I think we need to up our ranks here.

1312
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,620
And that is why I'd like to introduce our fourth Bolton brother.

1313
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,780
He is the voice of Orko on Masters of the Universe Revelation.

1314
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,700
He has a podcast, Blank Check, and I hope he's actually like in the room and ready.

1315
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,700
That's a question I have.

1316
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,940
And if not, we'll just do this again.

1317
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,500
But hopefully we'll find out.

1318
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,940
Do we have with us the round mound of Pound?

1319
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,940
Good.

1320
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,940
Wow.

1321
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,940
There he is.

1322
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,940
The completer himself, Griffin Newman.

1323
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,940
Hey.

1324
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,940
Hello.

1325
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,940
Fantastic to be here, boys.

1326
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Fantastic.

1327
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:22,460
You have a better sense of the microphones, I think.

1328
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,500
You're an expert at these things.

1329
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,640
You've done plenty of these.

1330
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,680
So I got to admire your microphone work.

1331
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,680
Thank you.

1332
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,680
Thank you.

1333
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,680
Great look, also.

1334
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,120
This was just, yeah.

1335
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,960
Some people like to cosplay at the convention.

1336
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,120
For me, it's all about comfort.

1337
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,760
I'm just going to wear whatever's easiest to walk around.

1338
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,880
I'm not really trying to show off for anybody, you know?

1339
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,240
And so the necklace with the shark tooth, that's part of the comfort?

1340
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Oh, I guess.

1341
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
You know what?

1342
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
Actually, yeah.

1343
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
You're right.

1344
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
That is kind of funny for this panel.

1345
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
You didn't even think about it.

1346
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
That's just your day-to-day style.

1347
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
That's a good walking outfit.

1348
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Yeah.

1349
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
No, you're right.

1350
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
That does line up pretty nicely.

1351
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,840
Well, it gives you a weapon, too, if you're in a pinch.

1352
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,320
I got two weapons right here.

1353
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Wow.

1354
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,320
And a killer bite.

1355
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,880
You're going to have to move one seat over.

1356
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
I'm scared to be next to you now.

1357
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,120
And that thing on your head is to protect your hair from getting too hot?

1358
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Correct.

1359
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
Yes.

1360
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,360
It's a hair coolant system.

1361
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,000
I feel like when hair gets hot, the best thing to do is to wrap it in rubber.

1362
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Smart.

1363
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Just kind of cook your noggin.

1364
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah.

1365
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Okay.

1366
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
That makes a lot of sense.

1367
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,760
Yeah.

1368
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
Welcome.

1369
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,520
Thank you for joining us for the Street Sharks conversation, for taking a trip to Fission

1370
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,520
City.

1371
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,520
A symposium.

1372
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,880
Let's say the first annual Street Sharks symposium.

1373
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,880
Today, this is the Fission City Library.

1374
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,320
Your previous familiarity with the genre, with the toys, what do you flash to when we

1375
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,160
say Street Sharks?

1376
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,120
I think the toys primarily were the thing.

1377
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,400
I think the folks at Mattel sent you some of the new figures, right?

1378
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Indeed, we did.

1379
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
We got some figures.

1380
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Some are down here, here.

1381
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,160
Talk while I fish out some Sharks.

1382
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,160
Oh yeah, go.

1383
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,440
So yeah, no, we did.

1384
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,440
We got some of the new figures.

1385
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
They're very cool.

1386
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
Wave one available now.

1387
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,600
Wave two up for pre-order today.

1388
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,040
Jason knows his talking points.

1389
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,640
Jocking points.

1390
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,920
What I believe they call the real feel rubber skin, that was a big appeal in the day was

1391
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,920
you could walk down a Toys R Us aisle and the Street Sharks had the access.

1392
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,120
You could feel them still in the packaging, you know?

1393
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
You could touch.

1394
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,120
They're open.

1395
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
They came in cages.

1396
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,120
They come in cages.

1397
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,960
And there was enough room to reach through the cages.

1398
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,520
Not enough for them to escape, thank God, but enough for us to real feel.

1399
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
Yes, of course.

1400
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Right.

1401
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,700
And a lot of the other anthropomorphic crime fighters at the time, the toys did not have

1402
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,180
skin.

1403
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Yes.

1404
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,460
So they've corrected that mistake with Street Sharks.

1405
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,940
And Mike, you and I are both big action figure collectors and we always talk about flesh.

1406
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,780
That is where a lot of toy companies fail, where they come short, is in approximating

1407
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,780
flesh.

1408
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,580
I am still waiting for any human character figures to have realistic human flesh.

1409
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Yes, of course.

1410
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,080
I feel like that has not happened yet.

1411
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,220
If Mattel wants to make a new William Frawley with realistic flesh, I would be very interested.

1412
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,980
We'll feel Bill Frawley with light action.

1413
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,980
Bill Frawley.

1414
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,980
Bill Frawley.

1415
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Yeah.

1416
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,980
Well, let's bust him out.

1417
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,140
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the panel, Ripster.

1418
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Wow.

1419
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,340
Look at that.

1420
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:35,620
And this is, it's both an audio medium and also you guys are far, far away and I can't,

1421
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,740
I guess, I mean, I guess we could pass it through the aisles for everyone to real feel,

1422
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,660
but it's hard to not go straight there because you're absolutely right.

1423
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:49,540
It is really addictive to touch these figures because like, yeah, like, you know, pants

1424
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
are hard.

1425
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,900
They're hard at the bottom.

1426
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,940
But up here, just, oh, so gentle to the, it's really like, you cannot stop.

1427
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
It's a sensual toy.

1428
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
Yeah.

1429
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
It is.

1430
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,620
It is like, and they're like, the Street Sharks are jacked and very vascular.

1431
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:10,460
So I'm not, I'm not a vascular man, but I would be interested to feel like somebody's

1432
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,980
arm that was very vascular.

1433
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,740
So this is the next best thing to doing that.

1434
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:20,380
But Ripster does have like tasteful shoes and casual slacks.

1435
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,580
So that's how he balances out his extreme muscles and large jaw.

1436
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,260
I think you're getting at something here though, Mike, which as a child, you're fascinated

1437
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,060
by super muscly men, but it is a social faux pas to go up and just touch them.

1438
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,060
Yes.

1439
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,820
And Street Sharks solved that problem.

1440
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,580
You know now what veins feel like.

1441
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,780
I finally know what veins feel like because of the Street Sharks.

1442
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,780
Yes.

1443
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,780
Yeah.

1444
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,780
Very good point.

1445
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,780
And that, yeah.

1446
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,780
So the abs, they have so many abs.

1447
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,780
Yeah.

1448
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:51,140
Can I say also something that came out of our visit to Mattel was discussion of the,

1449
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:56,700
of the bodies and the jacked nature of the Street Sharks and what we were told from people

1450
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,100
who were there 30 years ago when the original toys were designed was that often specific

1451
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:07,060
features would be based on the bodies of the people making them.

1452
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:13,220
There was like, I think a gym was new to Mattel and everybody was going and getting ripped.

1453
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,300
So I guess all of the Mattel designers in the 90s looked literally like this.

1454
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,740
Well, you had to have those sculpting arms, you know?

1455
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,740
Oh, that's true.

1456
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,220
In a pre-digital age, yeah, you're required upper body strength.

1457
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,260
But that's, they said that, that like, oh, check out this vein.

1458
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,260
I got a new vein here.

1459
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,260
Yeah.

1460
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,260
Got to represent that on Jab.

1461
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,540
So good for them.

1462
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,060
We'll try to find old photos of what they looked like back then shirtless and release

1463
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,060
those to you guys.

1464
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,060
Yeah.

1465
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,620
But he, okay, wait, Ripster like, Ripster spins, correct?

1466
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,620
Like there we go.

1467
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,620
Got a power punch.

1468
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,620
Power punch.

1469
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,620
Yeah.

1470
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,620
Yeah.

1471
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,620
Yeah.

1472
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,620
And then let me, let me bring Jab out.

1473
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,620
Jab is here as well.

1474
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,620
A round of applause for Jab.

1475
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,620
Thank you, Jab.

1476
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,620
Great.

1477
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,620
Great.

1478
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,740
Jab, you kind of, you crank an arm and then out that hammerhead goes.

1479
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,740
Pretty solid.

1480
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,740
Yeah.

1481
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,140
They all, they all do cool stuff.

1482
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,620
You want to do some real feeling, by the way?

1483
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,620
Let me pass them around.

1484
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,620
I love to do some real feeling.

1485
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:16,540
The other thing as like a puppet obsessed child myself, the fact that the street sharks

1486
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:21,340
figures kind of doubled, you know, there was an animating factor here.

1487
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,140
And they had giant puppets.

1488
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,860
Well, we're talking about hand sharks, of course.

1489
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,860
Yeah, hand sharks.

1490
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,860
Yeah.

1491
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,860
But Jason, you're getting ahead of yourself.

1492
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,860
I think.

1493
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,860
All right.

1494
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,860
All right.

1495
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:40,420
But yes, I, as a child and as a middle aged man, I enjoy making little toys talk and these

1496
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,180
things can bite and talk and I can, you can do any voice you want.

1497
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
Obviously they had voices in the cartoon.

1498
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,980
A lot of them were like, like a lot of voice were like this on the old cartoon, but I could

1499
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
do anything.

1500
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,620
You could make it sound, you can make them sound like, you can make them sound like Jab

1501
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,580
could sound like this in your own universe.

1502
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,940
You could do anything you want.

1503
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:01,940
And now that yes, I have a daughter that's two years old and now I can really justify

1504
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:06,180
making all these toys talk and not doing it to the wall.

1505
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,180
Yes.

1506
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:11,940
Like I was doing two years before.

1507
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,460
So yeah, that's, it is very cool.

1508
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:20,020
Well, this, I think what's cool about this line is that they have, the sharks have maintained

1509
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,100
their inherent ninetiesness.

1510
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:27,660
They have not hid from the nineties in terms of their style, in terms of their attitude,

1511
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:33,020
in terms of the box fonts, in terms of the, the pants.

1512
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,380
And but what they, but what Mattel has done is up the degree of articulation to what we

1513
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:43,060
now expect and demand out of our action figures.

1514
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:50,380
So the, so the puppeting is so much more fluid and, and, and their battle modes are that

1515
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,380
much tougher.

1516
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,460
Yeah.

1517
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,820
I really think like the street sharks is like the pinnacle of nineties everything in my

1518
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,820
mind.

1519
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:03,460
Cause like, obviously there were other anthropomorphic animal teams, but everything is just so aggressive

1520
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,900
in nineties.

1521
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,820
And in a lot of ways they're the face of the nineties to me, just as far as the decade

1522
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,380
American culture in the nineties is the street shark.

1523
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:18,220
So if you see some CNN special about the nineties and it's the face of Bill Clinton or Bill

1524
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,140
Gates or something, don't trust it.

1525
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,780
It should be Big Slam-oo.

1526
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,780
It should be.

1527
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:27,940
I would hope, yeah, that there would be a talking head, hopefully me on one of those

1528
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:33,620
specials where they're talking about like the Monica Lewinsky scandal or something.

1529
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:38,580
And I'm like, yes, but you understand, uh, Ripster's pants really for me to find the

1530
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,580
nineties.

1531
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,500
And you drive every question back to that, like, well, the nineties is when they first

1532
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,580
cloned a sheep.

1533
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,580
Can you answer some questions?

1534
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,700
Why don't you talk about Dolly?

1535
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:56,580
And your answer is Dolly was gene slammed in Scotland in the late nineties and Dolly

1536
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,580
didn't wear paint.

1537
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,980
Like she didn't wear pants.

1538
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,100
She didn't roller blade roller blades.

1539
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,100
Yeah.

1540
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,100
Dolly could have been cooler.

1541
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,620
So we'll not give her the time of day that you raised an important point, Jason, which

1542
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:12,860
is the technology that allows the four human Bolton brothers to become the street sharks

1543
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,660
is called gene slamming.

1544
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,660
Yes.

1545
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,660
And here, this is a picture.

1546
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,500
I took a little screenshot of the cartoon.

1547
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,620
These are the Bolton brothers being gene slammed right before.

1548
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,620
Yes.

1549
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,620
Just before slam.

1550
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,620
It's a pre slam shot.

1551
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,620
I think I love, I mean, talking about the essential ninetiesness, Mike, the Bolton brothers

1552
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:34,420
kind of represent the four social archetypes of the nineties, football quarterback, roller

1553
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:39,940
blader, slacker, and normal guy.

1554
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:45,940
They are all, here's what I also, I was like, they are all pretty ripped before too.

1555
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,540
So it's like sometimes like it's, you know, Captain America got ripped because he took

1556
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:53,580
the super soldier serum, but like these guys were doing well before and then they just

1557
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:58,020
got, they got even weller after the gene slamming.

1558
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:03,820
I think there's a core underlying theme of body positivity to the street sharks universe.

1559
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:07,740
As long as you're ripped as hell, you should feel proud of the way you look.

1560
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,980
That's the only thing that matters.

1561
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,900
And you can be ripped inside in your heart and your mind.

1562
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,880
But also if you have the vascular system, it doesn't hurt.

1563
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,140
But I feel like they are transformed, their genes slammed against their will, right?

1564
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,140
Yes.

1565
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,620
And we've seen so many narratives where people are transformed and mutated and they immediately

1566
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:26,340
go through the arc of I'm hideous, I'm a monster.

1567
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,380
I have to learn to love myself.

1568
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,940
I live in the shadows.

1569
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,940
Even Spider-Man, right?

1570
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,940
Yes.

1571
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:32,940
He's like, Oh God, I'm a freak.

1572
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
He doesn't look any different.

1573
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:34,940
He has a glow up.

1574
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,300
He loses the glasses.

1575
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,460
Street sharks have a three second acceptance arc.

1576
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,460
You watch the pilot.

1577
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,460
You just watch the pilot so you can affirm this.

1578
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,460
Yes.

1579
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,460
They transform.

1580
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,500
Then they all pass around a hand mirror and each take a look at themselves and the first

1581
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,500
balloon brother goes, Whoa.

1582
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,900
And the second one goes, Hey, I kind of like it.

1583
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,700
And they're immediately on board.

1584
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Wow.

1585
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,700
They're just taken to the streets.

1586
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,700
They're ready to be the sharks.

1587
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,540
Which as a kid is what I want.

1588
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,700
I don't want all that boring stuff where they deal with emotions.

1589
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,700
Oh yeah.

1590
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,100
Straight to loving it.

1591
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Straight to kicking fin.

1592
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,100
They're jacked.

1593
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,020
They can eat all items and they live underneath the comic book store.

1594
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,020
My dream.

1595
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,020
All of my dreams.

1596
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:20,460
Yeah, it is so quick.

1597
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:25,420
Every version of this, other than Street Sharks, has full arcs of a character like, Should

1598
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,420
I go back?

1599
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,420
I don't know.

1600
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,420
Beast from X-Men.

1601
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,420
I don't know.

1602
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,700
What's the cost of looking like this?

1603
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,220
I'm like, yeah, Street Sharks are just like, Hell yeah, let's go wreck some crap.

1604
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,900
No cost, zero cost.

1605
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:45,160
Could I get, just in case we don't know the names, John, we have Coop Bolton.

1606
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,140
We have Clint Bolton.

1607
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,680
We have Robert Bolton Jr.

1608
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:56,460
And then Ripster is John Bolton, who is not former defense secretary, John Bolton.

1609
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,740
Just in case you want to know, he had nothing to do with each other.

1610
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,180
This guy worked in a lot of, he worked in the Reagan administration, but yeah, he is

1611
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,940
not a shark currently.

1612
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:10,820
He was never a shark, as far as I know, but yeah, these are the four iconic brothers.

1613
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:17,020
I will say this, I would love, in the new Street Sharks line, to have the brothers pre-transformation.

1614
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,580
I know maybe, most people think of sharks when they think of these characters, but I

1615
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,580
want the guys to.

1616
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,780
You want the street guys.

1617
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,620
I want the street guys, yes.

1618
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:32,340
Do you want them lying down, being horrified by the needles that are coming for them?

1619
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:37,820
I would like the option to display them like this, but I don't need it to be, they don't

1620
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,900
need to be stuck to the, whatever, the slabs or whatever.

1621
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,500
I want the option, every couple months I change out my displays for my toys, and I would like

1622
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,500
the option.

1623
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:53,740
I would also like the display so I could put other toys in, other toys could be gene slammed.

1624
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,700
I have a couple Steven Tyler from Aerosmith Toys, and I would love to see what a pre-gene

1625
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,900
slammed Steven Tyler looks like.

1626
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,460
Wait, you're saying that he currently is post-gene slam?

1627
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,500
I mean that, it does explain a lot.

1628
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,140
Yeah, well, it makes sense to me.

1629
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,420
The ability to spin around with a scarf.

1630
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:18,560
In a lot of ways, Aerosmith Steven Tyler is a superhero to me, and he has special powers

1631
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,820
to rock an entire audience so thoroughly.

1632
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:27,660
There is the character Rox, R-O-X, gets gene slammed, he's a rock and roller.

1633
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,020
That's true.

1634
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:34,660
If I could have Rox displayed on my shelf with Steven Tyler, and they were sort of doing

1635
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,060
a duet or something on the mic, you know like when they share the mic and they can kind

1636
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,540
of like go back to back.

1637
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,900
If I could have Rox and Steven Tyler.

1638
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,700
Like Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Johnson in duets.

1639
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,700
A perfect reference.

1640
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,220
A perfect reference for all you toy heads.

1641
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:54,660
No more relatable time when two singers go back to back than the film duet.

1642
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,660
Duet.

1643
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:00,700
Jason really just playing to the Comic Con crowd trying to get that cheap pop on duets.

1644
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,700
Duet nation.

1645
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,780
There's too many duets cosplays here to even point out.

1646
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,940
Jason, are you going to the duets reunion panel in Hall H later tonight?

1647
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:11,940
I got shut out.

1648
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,140
Oh yeah, there's a lottery and you get it.

1649
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,700
I missed the pre-order on the toys too.

1650
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:22,180
I'm going to have to go to the panel for sliding doors because I got shut out of duets.

1651
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,900
The rumor is that Giamatti is going to come out at the duets panel and announce duets

1652
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,900
retribution.

1653
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,900
The legacyquel.

1654
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:35,940
There's another rumor also that they're going to do a duets drone show over Petco later.

1655
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,780
It's ten minutes and it'll tease the future of the franchise.

1656
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:41,780
It's too exciting though.

1657
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,780
Ships will crash.

1658
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,780
Big drone duets.

1659
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:53,900
So yeah, I want to have duets figures for sure, the movie duets, and I want to have

1660
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,260
duets with all the various franchise figures I have.

1661
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:04,020
We give some love to two of the post-Jean Slammed sharks I'm talking about, to Ripster

1662
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,020
and Jab.

1663
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:09,540
They are part of wave one, which are currently available from Mattel.

1664
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:13,580
Let's talk about some of these wave two characters that are available for pre-order.

1665
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:19,220
The other half of the team, Streaks, Streaks with an X.

1666
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,420
Do you have a Streaks available?

1667
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,420
That's the rollerblading?

1668
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,420
Great.

1669
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,420
Yes.

1670
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,420
Wow.

1671
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,420
Yeah, indeed.

1672
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,820
Everybody take it in.

1673
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:33,620
There's a tremendous amount going on.

1674
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,940
This is one of those, Mike, you're going to have to say the technical term for it, but

1675
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,660
he's got multiple sets of hands.

1676
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,060
That's something you like.

1677
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,380
I do like multiple sets of hands.

1678
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:48,620
I have six sewing kits full of hands at home for all the different figures.

1679
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,660
Anyone who collects figures knows what I'm talking about.

1680
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,580
There are heads, there are hands, sometimes there are half heads if they just go with

1681
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,580
the mouth.

1682
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:01,460
I think the turtles, you can take the top of their heads off and the bottom.

1683
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,860
I do look like a mad scientist in a lot of ways because I can make some abominations.

1684
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,900
I was going to say, so far, yeah, you have a box full of hands and you wish that toys

1685
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,900
felt like human flesh.

1686
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
I was going to say in a different context.

1687
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:20,900
The phrase, I have boxes of hands at home sounds like a confession.

1688
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,900
It is.

1689
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Yes.

1690
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,980
Jason, do you like this?

1691
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,700
Do you want to talk about this guy a lot?

1692
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:36,020
Streaks was my guy in the original one because he had roller blades and I was a very short,

1693
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,580
a very chubby child.

1694
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:44,980
I'm not the perfect specimen of health like I am now, but thank you.

1695
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:49,140
That's what he was fishing for, he told us.

1696
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:54,860
I had no center of balance so I lived vicariously through streaks and his roller blades.

1697
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,380
I also thought, oh, roller blades, what do those cost?

1698
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,700
This is a thing that comes up on the podcast a lot.

1699
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,300
I can't have those.

1700
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,580
Those must cost a million dollars.

1701
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:10,580
I looked up the other day on Amazon and you can get an adult pair of roller blades for

1702
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,580
$40 or $50.

1703
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,580
I didn't sense a surprise from the audience in the price of roller blades.

1704
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,580
I don't know.

1705
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,580
It's pretty established.

1706
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:25,580
He also had big claws and claws were also very big in the 90s, so that was very cool.

1707
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,580
Those you can't just get on Amazon.

1708
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,580
No, you can't.

1709
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,580
You've got to grow on yourself.

1710
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,580
I've always been a nail biter, so they're not really growing out myself.

1711
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,580
That's an option for you.

1712
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:41,580
Did you think as a kid that the roller blades had a motor in them to make them go independently

1713
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,580
of when you would push off?

1714
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,580
Why did you think they were so expensive, I guess what I'm saying?

1715
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,580
I don't know.

1716
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,580
I just didn't know anything about that.

1717
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,580
I didn't know anything about roller.

1718
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:55,580
We went roller skating at the roller rink once or twice for birthday parties.

1719
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:58,580
Right, but there were traditional roller skates.

1720
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,580
Yeah, yeah.

1721
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:04,580
I was just like, if I put those on, I am going to get injured immediately.

1722
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:09,580
I thought roller blades were futuristic technology, definitely when I was a kid.

1723
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:15,580
I felt like, oh, wow, we are really advancing technologically as a species.

1724
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:23,580
I think because of the blades or whatever you call the wheels, they were neon colors.

1725
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:31,580
And it didn't seem right that you could do that on just one thin, whatever you call it,

1726
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,580
thin line of wheels.

1727
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,580
It seemed morally right.

1728
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,580
It seemed like you were playing God.

1729
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,580
Yeah, you were spitting in the face of God when you would roller blade,

1730
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,580
because this didn't seem like it made sense from a physical standpoint.

1731
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:51,580
Can I say in the actual description of the premise of the series,

1732
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,580
this is from the Shark Vault, from the Bible,

1733
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,580
it does talk about the villain of the show,

1734
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,580
and how one brilliant genetic engineer chose to play God,

1735
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:03,580
seeking to tailor humanity to his idea of perfection,

1736
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,580
which involves sharks, I guess.

1737
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,580
Oh, sharks and squids and whales.

1738
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,580
Lobsters, yeah.

1739
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,580
Lobsters.

1740
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,580
Yeah, a lot of them in there.

1741
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,580
This is a doctor paradigm we are talking about.

1742
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,580
Well, you got two names here, right?

1743
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:24,580
This is the rare, sometimes the hero or the villain post-transformation has an exciting name,

1744
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,580
and before, it's boring.

1745
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:29,580
But his before is Dr. Luther Paradigm.

1746
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,580
We're already set in terms of villainy from the get-go,

1747
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,580
but he ups it and becomes Dr. Piranoid.

1748
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,580
Yeah.

1749
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,580
Yeah.

1750
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,580
Is there a Piranoid in there?

1751
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,580
Is there any mode of Piranoid?

1752
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,580
You could just put up John Bolton in his place, if you want,

1753
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
and he's got kind of Bolton vibes.

1754
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,580
Villainy-wise.

1755
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,580
There he is.

1756
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:53,580
But as you said, often there's this sort of a villainous transformation.

1757
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,580
They're scarred, they're hideous beyond belief, they take on a new persona,

1758
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,580
they change their name.

1759
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:01,580
The thing I love, cold open, just the opening shot of the Street Sharks pilot

1760
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,580
is Dr. Paradigm sitting behind a monitor, jean-slamming,

1761
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:11,580
wearing a leather duster, shaved head, and a bolted metal eye patch.

1762
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,580
And you're like, this is his before look.

1763
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:18,580
This is when he's just a guy clocking in to work at the lab,

1764
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:23,580
doing normal scientific experiments, kidnapping people's dads and children.

1765
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,580
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1766
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:29,580
Like, 90s-wise, I'm like, this is the ultimate version of the genre,

1767
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,580
because yeah, it's like, Dr. Paradigm is enough.

1768
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,580
Yes.

1769
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,580
He is enough, but no, no, they're going to put a hat on a hat,

1770
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,580
as they say here, and make it even more extreme.

1771
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,580
He didn't feel like he was enough.

1772
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,580
Yeah.

1773
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,580
That should get an Awe, too, yeah.

1774
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,580
Can I read something else from the Bible that I like a lot?

1775
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,580
This section is called The Quest.

1776
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,580
The Street Sharks are heroes by instinct.

1777
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,580
They did not set out to become modern-day Robin Hoods.

1778
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,580
But then you have to see what I'm seeing or just visualize it,

1779
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,580
because where it says Robin Hoods, they fit in parentheses in an F,

1780
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,580
thus making it Rob Finn Hoods.

1781
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,580
Yeah.

1782
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,580
They committed to the punch.

1783
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,580
On message.

1784
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
They still use documents only.

1785
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,580
They still were punning it up.

1786
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,580
Very impressive.

1787
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:20,580
Let's look at some of the vintage toys real quick.

1788
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,580
Can we give a little shout to, we have missed one of the big ones,

1789
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,580
maybe the biggest one, Big Slam-oo.

1790
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,580
Let's see a Big Slam-oo.

1791
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,580
There he is.

1792
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,580
Wow, yes.

1793
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,580
Hard to say who's the most 90s.

1794
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,580
He's very 90s.

1795
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,580
I mean, he's got his athletic wristbands.

1796
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:41,580
And he keeps his football pants on.

1797
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,580
Is that the term?

1798
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,580
Football pants?

1799
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,580
We wouldn't know.

1800
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:49,580
Can I real quick, my dad just listened to one of our episodes

1801
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:52,580
where we were trying to figure out baseball rules.

1802
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,580
He was so upset with us.

1803
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,580
He was like, I listened to the episode of Sky Dome,

1804
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,580
and I go, oh yeah, what do we say?

1805
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,580
And he goes, the sports talk.

1806
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,580
Oh man, come on.

1807
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,580
I go, oh yeah, I don't know.

1808
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,580
I'm sorry, Dad.

1809
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,580
I'll get around to understanding the infield fly rules.

1810
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,580
That's what it was.

1811
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,580
Maybe we're right by Petco Park.

1812
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,580
Maybe I'll get it there.

1813
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,580
You think there's a guy outside that'll just explain the rules of baseball to you?

1814
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,580
Rules, yes, rules.

1815
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,580
Booklets are rules.

1816
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,580
Or it's on the plaque of a statue or something.

1817
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,580
Maybe just the entire rule.

1818
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,580
I don't know why your dad was surprised.

1819
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:35,580
Does he not remember the 18 years of raising you?

1820
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,580
It's been a while.

1821
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,580
He forgot.

1822
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,580
Thought he liked sports.

1823
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,580
Thought he liked sports.

1824
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:48,580
Yeah, okay, so Slam-oo, and this is the best name for sure,

1825
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:56,580
and it reclaims the naming mechanism S-amoo from a San Diego institution

1826
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,580
that does some unsavory things.

1827
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:03,580
So then we need Slam-oo to allow this cool naming structure

1828
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,580
to be with us today.

1829
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,580
Thank you, Big Slam-oo, for liberating the rhyme amoo.

1830
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,580
Yes, thank you.

1831
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,580
Amoo.

1832
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:16,580
We could argue in a certain way the entire idea of street sharks as a property

1833
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,580
is standing in opposition to that San Diego landmark,

1834
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,580
and that the street sharks are not only not held in captivity,

1835
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,580
they roam the streets freely.

1836
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,580
Wow, yes.

1837
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,580
Their cages are easily pliable.

1838
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,580
They're just packaging.

1839
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,580
They're collectable packaging.

1840
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,580
That's all the cages are.

1841
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:36,580
Yeah, it's just a tiny, tiny apartment is what it is,

1842
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:38,580
and they can come and go as they please.

1843
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:43,580
Yeah, every street shark comes with a modest studio apartment

1844
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,580
just in case you can't visualize.

1845
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,580
Now, that is also a place that I would like.

1846
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:53,580
If I could get the street shark's apartment and see where they sleep,

1847
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,580
I would want that, like their big shark bed.

1848
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,580
Yes.

1849
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,580
But you don't want it to be like a cool lair?

1850
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,580
You want it to be little boxy apartments?

1851
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:05,580
I would like the option to have a small studio apartment

1852
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,580
and a cool Batcave-style lair.

1853
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,580
Now, not to shark-splain.

1854
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,580
I was jumping around watching a handful of different episodes last night.

1855
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,580
I don't know if this is kept as canon across the entire series,

1856
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,580
but there was an episode I watched last night where they mentioned

1857
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,580
that they don't sleep because they're half sharks,

1858
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:27,580
that in fact the street sharks must be moving at all times.

1859
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,580
So they might not have beds.

1860
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,580
Wow, it sounds like they don't have beds.

1861
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
Or they do.

1862
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,580
The beds are just for jumping on.

1863
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:39,580
All right, bedtime.

1864
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:44,580
At the very least, they would have like a waterbed because it's the 90s

1865
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:47,580
and they should have at least, yeah, right.

1866
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,580
They could go inside.

1867
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,580
Somebody take a note here.

1868
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,580
Somebody from a tell.

1869
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,580
They could go inside.

1870
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,580
They could go inside.

1871
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,580
Somebody take a note here.

1872
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,580
Somebody from a tell.

1873
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:00,580
They could go inside the bed and go on top of the bed

1874
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,580
if it's a special waterbed.

1875
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,580
That's a cool idea.

1876
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,580
Those fins are ripping through waterbeds.

1877
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,580
Well, these are different waterbeds created by a mad scientist.

1878
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,580
Yeah, you've never seen beds like this.

1879
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,580
They're gene-slammed beds.

1880
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,580
Gene-slammed beds, uh-huh.

1881
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,580
He combined a bed with the ocean.

1882
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,580
Yes.

1883
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,580
Can rebuild themselves.

1884
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,580
That's cool.

1885
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,580
Yeah.

1886
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,580
All right, a waterbed that can rebuild itself.

1887
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,580
Get on that Mattel.

1888
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:29,580
And get on creating the book sharks, characters based on The Four of Us.

1889
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,580
The book sharks?

1890
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,580
Yeah, that was said, I think, while you were getting ready.

1891
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,580
It was a joke in the beginning that went really well.

1892
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,580
So Mike is bringing it back around.

1893
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,580
It's very clear.

1894
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,580
It's called a callback.

1895
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,580
Got it, got it, got it.

1896
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,580
The only book I care about is the Street Sharks Bible that I was given access to,

1897
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,580
which there's also a slam-oo thing.

1898
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:56,580
Here's another thing that I like is when he's built to a pressure point,

1899
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:03,580
that he will then bellow his battle cry of slam-oo jam-oo parentheses

1900
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:06,580
or something even cooler, i.e. alternatives will be considered.

1901
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:12,580
You know, Scott, just because there is a fixed time on this panel,

1902
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:17,580
it might help us if we just started not saying the Street Sharks story Bible in full

1903
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,580
and instead just said the Holy Bible.

1904
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,580
They can carve a couple words out there.

1905
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,580
Yes, the Bible.

1906
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,580
The Bible.

1907
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:27,580
We haven't said the most important thing from the C. Ray's Bible

1908
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:31,580
is that an early iteration Streaks was called Blades.

1909
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,580
And some of the early toys said Blades.

1910
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:37,580
Some of the designers were like, I had a toy box that said Blades,

1911
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
and then the cartoon called him Streaks.

1912
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,580
So as you're walking around for the rest of the con,

1913
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,580
find a stranger and let them know.

1914
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,580
Accost them.

1915
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,580
Gene-slam them with the knowledge of Streaks and Blades.

1916
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:55,580
And maybe they'll do an exchange and they will tell you what the infield fly rule is.

1917
01:20:55,580 --> 01:21:00,580
Yeah, if anyone has access to a gene-slammed baseball

1918
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:05,580
and I can learn more about the sacrifice fly rules, that would be great.

1919
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:11,580
Do you want to show us some, because Mike, you found a bunch of photos of the retro toys.

1920
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,580
Oh, yeah, the old figures, yeah.

1921
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,580
I was on figurerealm.com.

1922
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,580
I want to shout out figurerealm.com.

1923
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,580
They have a pretty good archive of a lot of old figure lines.

1924
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,580
So that's what a lot of these photos are from.

1925
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,580
This, of course, is Ripster.

1926
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:30,580
And these are definitely like, you know, these have been lovingly played with

1927
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,580
because they're a little dirty.

1928
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,580
Lovingly real filled.

1929
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,580
Wow.

1930
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,580
Oh, the attitude.

1931
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,580
Yeah.

1932
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,580
So much attitude here.

1933
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,580
And that's Jason.

1934
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,580
Whoa.

1935
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,580
Jason referenced Rox earlier.

1936
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,580
Rox got a round of applause just from people looking at him.

1937
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,580
Just the appearance.

1938
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,580
That's how you know he's a star.

1939
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,580
Yeah, he's got it.

1940
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,580
Can you imagine Rox jamming with Aerosmith?

1941
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,580
Because I can.

1942
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,580
He does have a Steven Tyler-esque mouth.

1943
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,580
Yeah.

1944
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,580
He has, a lot of rock stars have interesting mouths.

1945
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,580
And Rox is no exception.

1946
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:13,580
Rox's real name is Melvin Kresnik.

1947
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,580
He needed a name slam.

1948
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,580
Yeah, he needed a stage name.

1949
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:20,580
And he accidentally digested contaminated popcorn and water

1950
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,580
that was tainted with a gene-slamming chemical.

1951
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:27,580
Well, we've all been there, right, folks?

1952
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,580
So yeah, so this was Rox.

1953
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,580
This was the toy of Benz,

1954
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:38,580
who was kind of like a surfer guy who helped the sharks out.

1955
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,580
He's their human friend and van driver primarily.

1956
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:45,580
Yeah, and he had kind of like a tactical vest.

1957
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,580
What would you even, how would you describe that?

1958
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,580
That's like a fishing vest.

1959
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,580
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1960
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,580
Yeah, it was a fishing vest.

1961
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:54,580
Tactical fishing vest.

1962
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:58,580
Yeah, so he was a cool guy, I think.

1963
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:03,580
Here's Jason's guy with his million dollar roller blades.

1964
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,580
Because you've got to buy the pads, too.

1965
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,580
And it really starts to add up.

1966
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,580
It is interesting.

1967
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,580
Pads, two million dollars.

1968
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,580
A lot of the toys, it is interesting.

1969
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:17,580
He didn't have crazy, he just had regular $40 roller blades on,

1970
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,580
at least of the figure.

1971
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,580
He seems like he didn't have some crazy,

1972
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,580
technologically advanced roller blades.

1973
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,580
That's where the street comes in.

1974
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:31,580
He has tools accessible to us, the humans, on the streets.

1975
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:32,580
Yes, they're every sharks.

1976
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,580
Yes.

1977
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:38,580
But then a big thing was, as we referenced earlier,

1978
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:42,580
the hand shark, which is a bigger puppet

1979
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:46,580
that you could put on your hand, make talk,

1980
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:48,580
and I guess punch things, you could do that.

1981
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,580
And this is, of course, a ripster.

1982
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,580
And then they had here, this is, of course, slobster.

1983
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,580
Slobster.

1984
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,580
The character slobster.

1985
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,580
Slobster is great.

1986
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:03,580
Slobster I love because there's some great backstory here.

1987
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,580
Obviously, all of these characters were slammed together

1988
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:10,580
from human and fish DNA,

1989
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,580
but in this case, they go into the specifics.

1990
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:17,580
And we are told that slobster has DNA from Genghis Khan.

1991
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:22,580
I don't know how this was kept and given to Dr. Paradigm.

1992
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,580
He just has vials.

1993
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,580
You see it at the beginning.

1994
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:30,580
He's just got a shelf of vials with the world's worst leaders.

1995
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,580
Well, and then that's what I could be up

1996
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:36,580
because Genghis Khan starts you at a point like, okay, yes, fearsome,

1997
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,580
killed many.

1998
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:38,580
Okay.

1999
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,580
Then the other one that they say is Colonel Thomas Blood.

2000
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,580
Colonel Thomas Blood was a notorious rogue from the 1600s

2001
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,580
who tried to steal the crown jewels and failed.

2002
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,580
So guy who killed a million people,

2003
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:56,580
sex with all these women, and then also a failed jewel thief.

2004
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,580
That is what is in slobster.

2005
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,580
And a lobster.

2006
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,580
Don't forget the lobster.

2007
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:02,580
You're absolutely right.

2008
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,580
And I didn't forget Griffin and I have the receipts to back it up.

2009
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,580
I made a little chart of how the DNA of slobster works

2010
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,580
just so we could all get eyes on that.

2011
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,580
Great.

2012
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:17,580
This plus this, Khan plus Blood plus lobster equals slobster.

2013
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,580
And that's your recipe you can take home to make your own slobster.

2014
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:28,580
And slobster is, of course, one of the bad guys known as the seviants.

2015
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:31,580
Combination sea and deviant.

2016
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,580
Along with Slash, who's cool, that's a figure you can buy now.

2017
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:38,580
This is deeper in the villain's rogues gallery.

2018
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,580
This is, wait, what is it?

2019
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:42,580
This is Shrimp Louie.

2020
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:48,580
Shrimp Louie, not to be confused with Bubba Gump mascot Shrimp Louie.

2021
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,580
Can we see the other Shrimp Louie?

2022
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,580
Yes, yes.

2023
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:56,580
And you decide, you can decide which is scarier.

2024
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,580
Yes.

2025
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,580
I will say this.

2026
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:02,580
Shrimp Louie needs to hit the gym.

2027
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:06,580
This is not a jacked anthropomorphic sea creature.

2028
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:09,580
No, I also want to say you said decide which one is scarier.

2029
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:16,580
I think if you ask the boy in this photo, he would say this Shrimp Louie is the scariest thing that's ever existed.

2030
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:24,580
And that boy was not in that photo when we looked at it an hour ago, so we don't know what is going on.

2031
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,580
Oh, God.

2032
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,580
On to the slideshow.

2033
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:31,580
So let me go real quick back to a couple more retro things.

2034
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,580
Non-figures.

2035
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:43,580
You could get a Street Sharks gift pack back in the day that had a zipped pouch, which I guess is not a fanny pack, but close.

2036
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
You could have a little watch.

2037
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,580
They sold the LCD watch here, which is cool.

2038
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,580
Do we have LCD watches as kids?

2039
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,580
Because I feel like this was a big kid thing for me.

2040
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,580
Oh, yeah, big time.

2041
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,580
Sure.

2042
01:26:54,580 --> 01:27:10,580
And then you could also get rings and shark tooth necklace, which is pretty cool, but it feels like it might get like hard to hold a shark's head on your hand all day if you were wearing that ring.

2043
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:13,580
So not good as a wedding ring.

2044
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,580
Right.

2045
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,580
The proposal might not work out.

2046
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:22,580
Do you think anyone has ever proposed with a Street Sharks ring?

2047
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:27,580
Slash, does anyone have anything they want to say right now?

2048
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,580
Oh, yeah.

2049
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,580
The floor is open.

2050
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,580
Yeah.

2051
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:34,580
We'll give you the microphone.

2052
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:38,580
So, yeah, I would say, too, I hope Street Sharks rings come back as well.

2053
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:48,580
They're doing, Mondo, the company that makes a lot of like big 1-6 toys, and they're doing like some soft vinyl Street Sharks they just announced yesterday, too.

2054
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:58,580
So I feel, and there's Hot Topic Street Sharks shirts, so I feel like a high-end ring company should license Street Sharks and start making Street Sharks engagement rings.

2055
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,580
Like K Jewelers.

2056
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,580
You want a K Jewelers X Street Sharks collab.

2057
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,580
Oh, sorry, Griffin.

2058
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,580
We're a Zales podcast.

2059
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:06,580
I'm sorry?

2060
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,580
So we're all about Zales.

2061
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,580
I'm sorry?

2062
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,580
That's on me.

2063
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,580
Zales could license the Street Sharks, yeah.

2064
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:18,580
Every kiss begins with jam!

2065
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:38,580
Can I, I think it might be worth bringing up that, you know, this has been cool for us to do, but also intimidating because being people in a public-facing setting talking about Street Sharks figures and hyping up what's cool about them, these are some of the biggest shoes there could ever be to fill.

2066
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:42,580
Because some of the world's great talents, one of the world's great talents.

2067
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,580
The world's single greatest talent.

2068
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:45,580
Let's just cut to it.

2069
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:50,580
The world's most talented man did what we're doing years ago.

2070
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,580
Do we have audio?

2071
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,580
Do we have audio?

2072
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,580
Let's find out.

2073
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,580
It is not coming through.

2074
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,580
Well, you know, it doesn't super matter.

2075
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,580
You know what's really funny?

2076
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:05,580
I'm actually realizing he's wearing something very similar to me in this video.

2077
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,580
Whoa!

2078
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,580
Whoa!

2079
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:27,580
Just to say, yes, this is a young Vin Diesel, and he is doing promotion, he's like showing how the interactivity of the Street Sharks works, and he's wearing, wait oh my god, as I'm adding it up, it's a black leather vest, it's a shark-toothed necklace just like you, and then sort of a relative lack of hair.

2080
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,580
Yeah.

2081
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,580
That's really interesting.

2082
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:32,580
He's got kind of like a strange Griffin Newman vibe going on.

2083
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Wow!

2084
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,580
Sort of Griffin Newman before his time.

2085
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,580
That's crazy.

2086
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,580
And I guess he had like a, he had a permanent head cooling system installed.

2087
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,580
He did.

2088
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,580
Well, that's why he's a star.

2089
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,580
You know, I've forgotten this footage.

2090
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:49,580
He launches Jab's head at a normal man action figure.

2091
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,580
So that's also an option, you know?

2092
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,580
Yeah, for sure.

2093
01:29:53,580 --> 01:30:04,580
I was talking to some of the folks from Mattel about how crazy it was that there is, A, that he was a toy fair demonstrator, which was this job that was often done by like out-of-work actors in New York City.

2094
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,580
Okay.

2095
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:09,580
To show off the upcoming toys to the media and the big buyers for the store and whatever.

2096
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:14,580
You very rarely find evidence that people who did that job went on to become major stars.

2097
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,580
Sure.

2098
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:19,580
And they were like, isn't that crazy that he started out like this and then became this whole different thing?

2099
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:24,580
And I was arguing, no, I think this is still what he is.

2100
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:32,580
I think he's the rare example of someone who was a toy fair demonstrator and went, I can ride this persona to the top of Hollywood.

2101
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,580
Like Dr. Paradigm, it was all there from the beginning.

2102
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,580
It was all there from the beginning.

2103
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,580
Everything he needed, including the baldness.

2104
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,580
He had it all figured out.

2105
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,580
Yeah.

2106
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:43,580
There's also, in this video, there's some of these alternate names that you refer to, Jason.

2107
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:46,580
He's like, all right, and here we got Boomer.

2108
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:48,580
Check out what Boomer could do.

2109
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:55,580
And I'm wondering if there was a name switch after that or if it was just Vin Diesel not listening carefully.

2110
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:59,580
Or he also knows them so well that maybe he has nicknames with them.

2111
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,580
Yeah, that's what I call it.

2112
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,580
That matters more.

2113
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,580
You personalize it.

2114
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,580
Okay.

2115
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,580
So remember, it's Big Slam-oo.

2116
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:06,580
Okay.

2117
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,580
Got it.

2118
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,580
Boomer.

2119
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,580
Good to go.

2120
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,580
Isn't that what you said?

2121
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,580
What else on our way?

2122
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,580
We got five minutes here.

2123
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,580
What have we missed?

2124
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:24,580
The Comic-Con exclusive this year is very exciting because it's Ripster wearing a jacket.

2125
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,580
Oh, yes.

2126
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:28,580
Well, let's acknowledge he's a literal pool shark.

2127
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,580
He's a literal pool shark.

2128
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,580
Yes.

2129
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:33,580
He's got the Q and the pool table and an explosion.

2130
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,580
He does pretty regularly play pool in the cartoon.

2131
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:42,580
Yeah, and he's wearing a jacket, which I asked the question at Mattel because I was like,

2132
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,580
well, he's got a soft goods jacket on, right?

2133
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,580
And then I realized I was trying to act cool.

2134
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,580
I knew the terminology for toys.

2135
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,580
But that is right.

2136
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:50,580
I was correct.

2137
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,580
And I was very excited to act like I knew the biz.

2138
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,580
And you call that acting cool, you say?

2139
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:59,580
For me.

2140
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:05,580
This comes from an episode that I believe is titled A Shark Among Us, which I watched last night

2141
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:13,580
and is about the street sharks and in particular, Ripper, trying to break open an underground network

2142
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:17,580
of oral steroid sales to children.

2143
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:23,580
They're all getting Ziploc bags of blue pills called Super Blues that are getting them as jacked as street sharks.

2144
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,580
And the street sharks don't believe in that.

2145
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:29,580
If you're going to gain muscle mass, you have to do it the honest way by getting jeans slammed.

2146
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:36,580
Do not buy bootleg Prednisone from seedy sellers.

2147
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:43,580
But so Ripper puts on a leather jacket and sunglasses and tries to just be like, hey, I'm a guy who loves steroids.

2148
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,580
Where can I get some?

2149
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:48,580
And everyone's like, what a cool, normal human man who needs pills.

2150
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:51,580
Big blue human guy here.

2151
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:56,580
Pay attention to the jacket and not the face between the ends of the jacket.

2152
01:32:56,580 --> 01:33:00,580
But this is basically his like, NARC disguise outfit.

2153
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,580
He's a street NARC in a way.

2154
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:08,580
That's actually a better name for what we would be as sharks.

2155
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,580
Street NARC.

2156
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:13,580
Officer, they're doing drugs over there.

2157
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,580
Or sharks, when we say that.

2158
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:19,580
And you're pointing at people who are drinking coffee.

2159
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,580
They're drinking caffeine, officer.

2160
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,580
It's a stimulant.

2161
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,580
Enhanced tattling powers.

2162
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:37,580
I think maybe there's time to address another thing that probably my favorite part of the Bible that we got to see.

2163
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:43,580
And that is the list of rules, things we should know in proceeding with this property.

2164
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:47,580
And rule number three, parlez-vous sharkies.

2165
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:53,580
And then what you get is a dictionary of how the street sharks talk.

2166
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:59,580
If you were going to write for them the kinds of things you should say rather than...

2167
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,580
It looks like you've got some of these.

2168
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,580
Yeah, I've got it too.

2169
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:08,580
I'll try to do it in order and maybe we can pass it around a little bit.

2170
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:11,580
A street shark would not say fantastic, he would say...

2171
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,580
Fintastic, of course.

2172
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,580
Very good.

2173
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:20,580
A street shark would not call something an impossible task, they would call it...

2174
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,580
A jaw-breaker.

2175
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:24,580
Very good.

2176
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:30,580
If somebody is not depressed, they are chummed out.

2177
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,580
That got our third awe.

2178
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:39,580
Panels and signings and travel arrangements is really chummed out dealing with Comic-Con.

2179
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:47,580
I swear this week it's been jaw-breaker after jaw-breaker and it doesn't make me feel fantastic, it makes me chummed out.

2180
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:51,580
It's also just nice to be up here on stage with friends just blowing bubbles.

2181
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:59,580
Yes, very good. Blowing bubbles, which I will censor and say that's the official term for BSing.

2182
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:02,580
Don't say, street sharks don't swear.

2183
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:03,580
They blow bubbles.

2184
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,580
Shut up is clam up.

2185
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:10,580
Throw up is spout.

2186
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:16,580
I have to shout out, just for fun is for the halibut.

2187
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,580
And I like that a lot.

2188
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,580
You were saying that before you read this, though, too.

2189
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:26,580
Yeah, no, I didn't see the document and I was saying that.

2190
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:31,580
Well, you know what? I think it's been a lot of fun to be here just for the halibut.

2191
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:36,580
And isn't that the spirit of the property? Isn't it really? It's not about anything serious.

2192
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:42,580
It's just a lot of silly fun. It's a property done for the halibut. Can we not agree on that?

2193
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,580
Yes, we can.

2194
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,580
I think it's a beautiful thing.

2195
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:54,580
And I really hope that nobody, I don't think anyone will be leaving here chummed out after everything we've addressed here.

2196
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:59,580
A reminder, wave one is available now. Wave two pre-orders are available.

The Street Sharks stuff on the Hot Topic website.

2198
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:10,580
And I think with that, you survived. Podcast The Ride, Times Mattel, Times Street Sharks, Times Griffin Newman.

2199
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:11,580
Thank you for being here, Griffin.

Wow, Times Vin Diesel. Yes. Griffin Newman, I should say. Griffin Newman and Vin Diesel.

2202
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:28,580
That worked out pretty cleanly. And thank you all for coming out here, making the trip to the library.
