1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Boo!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The following haunt cast may contain

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
socially conscious minds,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ghostly exhalations,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
rock and roll DJs barely trying.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Plus, Betsy Sidaro joins us for a look back into the spooky history of Not Scary Farm

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for its 50th anniversary.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ha ha ha ha!

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's Haunt Cast, The Fright!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast, The Fright, a haunt cast about screen parks

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
ghosted by three ghouls who are only comfortable with a monster mash

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
if it's a monster sized plate of mashed potatoes.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My name is Frightful Narleson, joining me as always, Scottle Juice.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Scottle Juice, yes. We are too scared of the monster mash.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The monster mash is terrible. This is how...

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You know that we are wimps and we don't do... I don't do a lot of haunts.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know I'm not going near that song.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I pee my pants every time. If it's on the radio, if it's in a store, I get out of the store.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I take all my groceries, knock them to the floor, and get the hell out of there.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, and it's not that we don't like the song, because the song is good,

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but the actual act of the monsters having a mash would be too frightening.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If somebody would just please, I love the melody, it's one of the great melodies,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and if you could just unmonsterify it and just make it, we'll do the normal mash.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, and then it's like the doctor was having a party, and he's a regular.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The regular doctor was having a party.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The regular doctor, like you'd see in a Nora Ephron movie.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's about a high society New York doctor's dinner.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And they were planning their expensive new kitchen or something,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and they explain they're just working on the plan.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, none of this gore.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jagged Slash and Drain is here also?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, I mean I'm very fearful everything you've talked about, I'm scared of it,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but I'm thinking about that big plate of mashed potatoes.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I thought you would, and I thought when I was putting this together,

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
maybe I would make a direct reference to you liking the monster-sized plate of mashed potatoes,

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but then I decided to make it all of us.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I love it.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, it's not a thing that I really make at home,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
unless it's like a bag of instant mashed potatoes,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and it just doesn't have the soul, you know?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I do know, yeah.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You live a soulless life.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I live a soulless life.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My mom was telling me about this just recently.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She's like, yeah, we all love mashed potatoes,

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but to buy a bag of potatoes and wash them and peel them in the mat,

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it's so labor-intensive.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, this is true.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not doing that much.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've done it once or twice, but it's not as bad as some other stuff that I find tedious.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, it's not.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
As far as cooking is concerned, but yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I certainly appreciate it when a restaurant serves it with stuff.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I appreciate it because I don't make it at home.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like with short ribs or something.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I appreciate it too when they serve it with stuff in it.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We love stuff.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's bring our guest in to see if she loves stuff.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's an actor, comedian, she's a podcast host.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Betsy Sadaro.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's here.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, I love this spooky name.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh yeah, well, create.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's figure it out.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Betsy.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Nice.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sadaro.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I add one, if you just do a little rearranging and it's dis-saro.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Good.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I like that one.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, not too bad.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah, and then it's just taking everything that's already in the list.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't even have to add anything.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's recycling.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's energy conscious.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I love it.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Betsy, are you making mashed potatoes at home?

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, not one.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, no, no.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
God, no.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm so not a cook of any type.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's ... I find it ...

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I eat stuff up.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sure.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I find that even when I make something, I'm so annoyed that I just made it.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't enjoy it.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So I don't know what the point is.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because you see all the dishes and stuff and you're like, that was so much work for like

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
two and a half minutes of just eating it.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, right.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I joylessly eat it.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, great.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was better than a normal thing I ate at McDonald's.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But it doesn't feel I earned anything.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, not one bit.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not even when we've made fresh cooked meals thanks to our partners, but not in a long

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
time, from HelloFresh.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
HelloFresh.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, for sure.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
HelloFresh will take an hour and 15 minutes of my time.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, those are ... yeah, no, it's like caused fights.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's like ... yeah, it's a spade.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
By the way, everything does taste as good as I've said it does in ads I've read.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, that part's not a lie, but we don't talk about the psychological damage.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But we don't talk about how upset I am while I'm eating.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm also terrible about plating everything so it's all hot.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's so hard.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So hard.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's very hard.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's too hard.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I started kind of just doing everything individually where it's like, okay, I'll heat up my veggies,

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and while I'm slamming those down, I'll heat up the chicken or whatever so that it is all

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
hot.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think that's a very crafty way to do it.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you so much.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's very smart.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you so much.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And cool, because slamming sounds cool.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, that is for sure cool.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's awesome to slam your veggies down, kids.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like dunking it into your own mouth.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Slammed it.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Choking a lot.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lot of like, okay, all right.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh yeah.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
As long as you survive.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But you have like a backwards baseball cap on and you're on a skateboard.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
On a skateboard, eating veggies.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Slamming.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Veggies.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Slamming it.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Slamming those veggies.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hell yeah.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, very cool.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Very cool.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Very cool.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, today we're going to talk a little bit about Not Scary Farm.

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
50 years.

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
50 years.

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
50 damn years.

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Which is 50 years of the original haunt, according to Nots, they created the haunt.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now I don't know if they-

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,280
The entire premise of a separate Halloween event in a typically snooze fest theme park

155
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
for little kiddies.

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
There's no slamming going on.

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
No slamming happening at Nots Berry Farm.

159
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
That's scary though.

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
No old prospector slamming.

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
No train conductor slamming.

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
No train conductor slamming.

163
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
No train conductor slamming.

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
No train conductor slamming.

165
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
No train conductor slamming.

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
No train conductor slamming.

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,560
None of the robots of mine workers that are on Death's Door, they're not slamming anything.

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
They don't have the strength.

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
That ride is so funny.

170
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I love that ride.

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
The strangest, most depressing.

172
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
You're just seeing real, well fake real suffering.

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Yes, yeah, yeah.

174
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Yeah, it's such a funny choice because pirates, of course the reality of pirates is they were

175
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
probably just like really nightmarish.

176
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Right.

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
But Pirates of the Caribbean makes this seem like really fun.

178
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Right.

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
They're just like, oh, I'm going to be a pirate.

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

182
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

184
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm going to be a pirate.

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Yes.

188
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:09,280
And they do not make that choice in the Knott's Berry Farm mine ride.

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
They basically are just like, let's just show what it would be like.

190
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
And everybody looks miserable.

191
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,440
They've aged terribly from the fumes in the mine.

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
Every character is 13 and below.

193
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
13 is an old scraggly beard.

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
I've seen so much.

195
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
But the scale is very impressive.

196
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
That one big scene.

197
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
That huge scene.

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
It's a great ride.

199
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
It's a great ride.

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
It is a fantastic ride.

201
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,600
It's just they went for the realism, which Disney did not when it was portraying some

202
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
real life situations.

203
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Right.

204
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,600
It was year round horrors and the horrors of what laborers face, but they still wanted

205
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,680
to add on top of that and have more fictionalized horrors like Dracula's.

206
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Yes, exactly.

207
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes, they needed that Dracula.

208
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
We need some Dracula's around here.

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
It's not sad and scary enough.

210
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,560
So, Betsy, you're very into haunts and scary stuff.

211
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
I love them so much.

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,680
And have you been going to them like for a long time?

213
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
Because I'm a newer enjoyer of this stuff.

214
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,840
I feel like moving to L.A. was when I got really into it.

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Like, as a kid, I was always so into Halloween, so stoked about the idea of haunted houses.

216
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,400
And I would go like my family very early on in my life would turn our basement into a

217
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,520
haunted house for like the neighbors to come through and stuff.

218
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,800
Oh, one of these deals.

219
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm always very impressed by anybody with the energy to do that.

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,280
Wow, your family.

221
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,720
My dad would put it together and like we would help and stuff.

222
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,880
And then, yes, on Halloween nights, just let kids come in and we would scare them and stuff.

223
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
That's fun.

224
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
Wow, you were a character.

225
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You were in childhood.

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I did it a little bit.

227
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Yeah, I was probably like three years old, just being like, hey, man.

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
With a mask on.

229
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,080
And then moving to L.A., though, it was a whole like, I had no clue Halloween could

230
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,960
be two months long of celebrating and scary stuff and everything.

231
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,360
And so in the last like probably 12 years or so is when I got really into it with the

232
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
haunted hayride.

233
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
It started.

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
We went on that and it was so fun.

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
And then they went to Shark Tank and sold out.

236
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that right?

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Those people.

238
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Wow.

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I guess I recall a haunted hayride set, but that's the L.A. one.

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
They would sell out.

242
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,360
They did the right move and got a lot more money and then decided to expand and stuff.

243
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
It's like, yeah, good job.

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
But it's different.

246
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
You know, it was better before those.

247
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Yeah.

248
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
So what was different about it?

249
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Before they there were so many more like.

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Cool interactive moments, not just like fun, big.

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Statues or whatever, like there was at one point, remember in Mad Max Fury Road, those

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
like dudes on those like the polls, the poll thing, they had that one haunted hayride.

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
And it was so fucking cool.

254
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Like these people as crows just like flinging themselves at you.

255
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
And it was so rad.

256
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,360
And they had this one like church moment that went to the OOAA song.

257
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Oh, the service of sickness.

258
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Yeah, that does.

259
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
It was really.

260
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,360
And it was like in the old zoo in Griffith Park.

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
So that alone was like.

262
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Just a great vibe all around.

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
And now they're just at like some baseball fields.

264
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
It's still pretty fun, but it is like it's different, man.

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Yeah, it does.

266
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
It sounds like it was more dangerous back then.

267
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
I think so.

268
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
And I think that's why I like it.

269
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
More dangerous for all the workers.

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Right.

271
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
For everybody involved.

272
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
But it ruled.

273
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Yeah.

274
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,360
A friend of the show and recent guest, Joe Quazzalla, has brought up something that's

275
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
at the I don't know if you've run into this before, but this is a good way to see this

276
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
mythology.

277
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,360
He's brought up the haunted hayride, but also specifically something that's there called

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
the Monte Rivolta show.

279
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
I saw him.

280
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
You have seen this.

281
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
I saw him like last year or something.

282
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
He's a haunt.

283
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
He's like a zombie lounge singer.

284
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Yes.

285
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
He ruled.

286
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Really?

287
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Friends, we were like talking about like, do we go back to the haunted hayride?

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,360
And everybody was like, I kind of don't want to unless Monte Rivolta is there.

289
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Wow.

290
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Wow.

291
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
This is what Joe is saying is he's thinking about going to just that.

292
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
That's free.

293
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
You just go to that.

294
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
And you don't got to get scared by state.

295
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
You just get to see a fun.

296
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Wait, really?

297
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
I think so.

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I got to tell everybody.

299
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Let them know.

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
We got to go.

301
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
He rules.

302
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Okay.

303
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
And he's here this year.

304
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
I've been meaning to get this going as an episode or something.

305
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,360
But now the excitement that I'm encountering here, we got to talk Monte.

306
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
He sings classic songs, but makes them spooky.

307
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
But I wish I had specifics.

308
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
He was a blast.

309
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Like to the point where it's like, can I hire him for like a birthday party or something?

310
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
This guy rules.

311
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Yeah.

312
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,360
So he sings a bunch of classic songs, but then makes them spooky.

313
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
But I can't remember.

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Is it in the rat pack genre?

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
What kind of what?

316
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I want to say it's like all different kinds of popular songs through the era.

317
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Okay.

318
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,360
And he has like a bit of spooky band and then like just spooky dancers and stuff.

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
He rules.

320
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Wow.

321
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
And what's he wearing?

322
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
What's the outfit?

323
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Well, I'm looking at like tuxedo.

324
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Yeah, just a cool, you know, yeah.

325
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah, just a cool jacket, but that's a little like goth.

326
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Like a little dusty.

327
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
His teeth are scary.

328
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
He's scarier than I thought he would be.

329
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I don't know if you can handle it.

330
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I was picturing him looking like Flabber from Big Bad Beetleborgs for some reason.

331
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I don't know why.

332
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,360
But well, I think it's easier maybe on a lower budget to get some decent prosthetics and spooky makeup.

333
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
So yeah, Monte Rivolta has somehow topped the production value of Big Bad Beetleborgs.

334
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah, okay.

335
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Well, that's exciting.

336
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I would like to see him.

337
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Wait, I didn't realize you could just go and watch him.

338
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I think maybe.

339
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Oh my God, I'm going tonight.

340
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
So this is exactly what you were...

341
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Oh my God, I'm going every single night hoping he's there.

342
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

343
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
This...

344
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Does it list with...

345
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Rules.

346
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

347
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,360
And you don't got to, and probably like you just get to walk up and do that.

348
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Yeah.

349
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
And they can not stand in a Hayride line either.

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Yeah.

351
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
You think he changes the set up a little bit?

352
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Yeah.

353
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Yeah.

354
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
You think he changes the set up every night?

355
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I think maybe a little bit.

356
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
You think maybe he throws in...

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
There's no band though, right?

358
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
There is.

359
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Well, there is.

360
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
I think there is, if I remember correctly.

361
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Well, he's joined by Rotley and Ms. Muerte.

362
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Okay.

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
So that sounds like a band to me or at least some like...

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Yeah.

365
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Some dancers.

366
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Yeah.

367
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Oh wow.

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Well, we'll investigate.

369
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
We'll do the deep dive.

370
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
You got to do the deep dive.

371
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
We have to do it.

372
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
We got to meet Monte.

373
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Monte Rivolta, yes.

374
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,360
His booking email, you can book it, Monte at Monte Rivolta dot com.

375
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
There we go.

376
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay.

377
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
And now the listeners have that too.

378
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Does he have a...

379
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Oh, it's on his public Instagram page.

380
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
So that's great.

381
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Great.

383
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Well, you can go straight to the source.

384
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I wonder if he has like a different persona for every holiday.

385
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Whoa.

386
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
What was Monte Christmas?

387
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Rudolph?

388
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Rudolpho.

389
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Rudolpho, yeah.

390
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Same songs too.

391
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,360
He's a human reindeer freak with a heck of a set of pipes.

392
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,360
It's the same look except he's got ants letters on.

393
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
It's the same face.

394
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Honestly, spectacular.

395
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I will hire him for every party.

396
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Wow.

397
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Okay.

398
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
So that's...

399
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
That's a do.

400
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Yeah, yeah, good.

401
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Yeah.

402
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I was just going to say, so do you, is your like level of comfortability with scares,

403
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
is it like...

404
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Is it like the knots universal or do you go harder, do you go to some weirder ones or

405
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
is it basically, you know, your big ones, your normal?

406
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Kind of the normal ones.

407
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I haven't...

408
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,360
I don't really have any desire for those like crazy hardcore ones.

409
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Yeah.

410
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
You know, where they like take your shoes and stuff and they're like, dig through this

411
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
toilet of shit.

412
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I like...

413
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I've no...

414
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
That doesn't...

415
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
That just...

416
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
I'm like, I don't need to fuck it.

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Do that.

418
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Like I've had friends who did that blackout one.

419
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Yes.

420
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
A couple of years ago that was like super intense.

421
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Like, and yeah, they immediately take your shoes from you.

422
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Yeah.

423
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
And like at one point like waterboard you and shit.

424
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
I don't need...

425
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't want to do anything like that.

426
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Yeah, I agree.

427
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
I don't need to be waterboarded.

428
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I want a goofy storyline that I don't really understand and people being like, this way,

429
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,360
come, you need to help and be like, okay, I'm going to do this.

430
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Help and be like, okay, I'll come help.

431
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I'll come help.

432
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Like delusion rules.

433
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Yeah.

434
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Have you done delusion?

435
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Yeah, we did one.

436
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Yeah.

437
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah.

438
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
That one's really cool.

439
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah.

440
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Yeah, for sure.

441
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I remember one year we ran...

442
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,360
My friend Luke and I ran into you and Justin Michael at Horror Nights.

443
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Yes.

444
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
And we went into a couple of mazes.

445
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I think we went into the Us Maze together.

446
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
The Us Maze was awesome.

447
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
I agree.

448
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
From what I remember.

449
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I agree.

450
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I feel like some people were negative about it, but that was my favorite one that year.

451
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Yeah.

452
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
It was cool.

453
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
It was really cool.

454
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,200
And because I always find that when you're in an area that resembles real life and that

455
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,720
things could jump out, that makes me more scared.

456
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,080
So when you're in the living room from the movie, I remember just...

457
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,840
And we were like, all four of us were alone.

458
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,000
For some reason there weren't a lot of people.

459
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't know why that was, but it felt like we were almost more alone in that maze.

460
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,360
And I do remember you and Justin waiting for the scares each time, which I wasn't brave

461
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,960
enough at that point to want to do that.

462
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,560
So I was like, what are they doing?

463
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,960
Why aren't they walking faster?

464
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,960
We go through them slow.

465
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Yeah.

466
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Geez, really.

467
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Because we are like, I want to look at everything and I want to get scared.

468
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah.

469
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
And there are some people who just walk through so casually.

470
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
It's like, don't you want to look around?

471
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
There's so much cool shit.

472
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Yeah.

473
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I'm better about that now.

474
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,960
But especially at the time we went, I was just like, I have to pretend I like this way

475
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
to do things.

476
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, this is your transition period.

477
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,640
You would not fully decided that you like that you love haunts now.

478
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
What got you into it?

479
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Like what?

480
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Do the podcast peer pressure to prove something about my adult hood and my toughness by and

481
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
large?

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Well, we went to nots.

483
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Nots is the first time I ever really did it.

484
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I did.

485
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
I've done like House of Horrors at Universal, but I hated it.

486
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,600
And then, yeah, we went to nots a couple of years ago and I was sort of like, I want to

487
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
force myself to get it.

488
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
Yeah.

489
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And then I took me two or three houses to like realize no one's going to kill me.

490
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Right.

491
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You know, and you start to realize your brain starts to understand the limitations of what

492
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
really can happen.

493
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Yes.

494
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Yeah.

495
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
And then as soon as you kind of recalibrate to that, then you're still getting like, ah,

496
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
you still like going like that.

497
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,600
But you don't, at least for me, I wasn't as stressed about doing it.

498
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Like a whole layer of fear goes away.

499
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Then it's just like little spikes and stabs of fear.

500
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Exactly.

501
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
But the broader like being afraid of the entire thing because you've like figured out some

502
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
of the system.

503
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Exactly.

504
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
That makes sense.

505
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Yes.

506
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
And you don't even consciously, I don't even know that was a conscious thought I had.

507
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Like I understand and this is what could be possible.

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
It's just like your brain just goes, oh yeah.

509
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I get this.

510
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh yeah.

511
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Wait a minute.

512
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
No one's assaulting me in these mazes.

513
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
You can go to some that will.

514
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Well, sure.

515
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Dig through a toilet of shit.

516
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Dig through a toilet of shit.

517
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Look for a key.

518
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
And have your shoes stolen.

519
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Yeah.

520
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
The shit at knots is just set decoration.

521
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh yeah.

522
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Cannot be dug through.

523
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
It's real shit.

524
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
But there's a little bit.

525
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Please don't.

526
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
No one does shit though like Six Flags is Sewer of Souls.

527
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I'll just say that.

528
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Sewer of Souls.

529
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Sewer of Souls.

530
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Wait, have you gone to the Six Flags one?

531
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I have been to the Six Flags one, yes.

532
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Is it fun?

533
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Is it fun?

534
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Justin and Marissa and I were talking about maybe hitting it up.

535
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I think that Six Flags is a lot of fun.

536
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
And it is.

537
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Six Flags is just like how you remember it if you've been 30 years ago.

538
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay.

539
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
And that's fun too if you want to see Mrs. Taz.

540
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
She's around.

541
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Of course I want to see Mrs. Taz.

542
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Come on.

543
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It is the same statue from 30 years ago.

544
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,600
You will see her with her purple pinkish paint chipping off.

545
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
But if you're okay with that.

546
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I love that.

547
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
If you're okay with seeing her in a sorry state.

548
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Zombified Mrs. Taz.

549
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
That's not even the Halloween thing.

550
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Doing Haunts 2 I feel like now as you get a little bit, you do upgrade a little bit to the point where then you do want to get fucked up a little more scare wise.

551
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Yes.

552
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,600
So like there was a universal Halloween maze and they had like seven Michael Myers on the way out.

553
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Yes.

554
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And like that was actually unusual for the pattern of horror nights.

555
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
And like you just get like scare, scare, scare, scare, scare all on the way out.

556
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
And I went ah.

557
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I remember.

558
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Yeah.

559
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,600
They've had a couple of Halloweens where it's so smart where it's like let's just have a shit ton of Michael Myers.

560
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Every room you everywhere you turn there's a Michael Myers.

561
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
And that's so fun and scary.

562
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
And I feel that was kind of the us maze too.

563
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Like yeah.

564
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
The bunch of those people with the scissors.

565
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Yeah.

566
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
With the scissors and stuff.

567
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Because when you go in the basement area.

568
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Yeah.

569
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
And you're walking to like that classroom and stuff.

570
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Yes.

571
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
And that area.

572
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah.

573
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
So yeah.

574
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
So I'm definitely I don't think I'll ever get to the point where I want the full shoe losing experience.

575
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,600
But we went to like Meow Wolf in Vegas and I was like kind of like come on scare me a little more.

576
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Jump out a little bit.

577
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Jump out a little bit.

578
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Jump out a little bit.

579
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Well I wanted it to just because it was one room that was like sensory like fucking you up with like noise and like lights.

580
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
And I was like OK a little more because it is a creepy place.

581
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
So I like a sense of unease.

582
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah.

583
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Yes.

584
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
The whole place is yeah there's a lot of unease going on.

585
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
But I definitely was just like I was like come on.

586
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Let's have a couple more people popping out.

587
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
They're going to be built.

588
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I don't know when it's coming but supposedly yes permanent horror nights in Vegas in that area 51.

589
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
15.

590
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah.

591
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah.

592
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Yeah.

593
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
So they're going to do.

594
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah.

595
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
It's supposedly what next year.

596
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It's not.

597
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
It's supposedly.

598
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
It's so smart.

599
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah.

600
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
We'll go all the time.

601
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Who was I was just talking to somebody about I think maybe it was last night.

602
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
It was last night.

603
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Some friends we were like how about a Halloween theme park.

604
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Yeah.

605
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Sure.

606
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Where it's just a spooky town.

607
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
People would fucking lose their minds for that with coasters and stuff like.

608
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Yeah.

609
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
It's all scary.

610
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Well if Six Flags was smarter they would just embrace that full of that siren.

611
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Yeah right.

612
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
It would be like let's just make it year round spooky.

613
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Yeah.

614
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Like the thing that they well I was going to say our best step but is that right.

615
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I don't know.

616
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Look this would sacrifice our you know our little kid Bugs Bunny rides and the big carrot.

617
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Right.

618
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Yes.

619
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
With all of the orange paint peeling off.

620
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,600
We'd have to get rid of some of our peeling looney tunes but besides that yes if they

621
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
just wanted to like embrace terror you're in.

622
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Yeah.

623
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Six Flags Terror Mountain.

624
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Sure.

625
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
The closest yeah the closest.

626
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm sure there's like a little like tiny little kind of haunted things but Universal is finally

627
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
they're doing a whole Monsters Land in Florida now for this new theme park.

628
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Cool.

629
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
So it's going to have a big Monsters ride and it's a Monsters Land.

630
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Cool.

631
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I think it's going to look kind of like.

632
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Restaurant.

633
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Yeah there'll be like two rides.

634
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
A spooky restaurant.

635
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah.

636
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Eyeballs and fingers.

637
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I will go.

638
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
That sounds like heaven on earth.

639
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,600
It's all well they do the thing like where you like they blindfold you and then you touch

640
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
the witch's hair but then at some point like it is spaghetti.

641
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
You want to eat the spaghetti.

642
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Now eat the spaghetti please.

643
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Now you are good.

644
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Please.

645
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
You can eat it blindfolded and pretend you're eating witches hair.

646
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Whatever you want we don't give a shit.

647
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
So that is the opening 2025.

648
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Okay.

649
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
And the ride is supposed to the rumor is the ride is like amazing.

650
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
It's through like a castle like Frankenstein's castle or something.

651
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
It's got all the monsters on it.

652
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Cool.

653
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
And the robots maybe and it's a big kooka arm like the Harry Potter ride.

654
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Oh my god.

655
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah.

656
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
So you're getting close to your wish.

657
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
You just got to travel for it.

658
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
You just got to go to Vegas.

659
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
You just got to go to speedy Florida.

660
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Yeah.

661
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
You got to get humid.

662
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
You got to get wet and stinky.

663
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
I'll get wet and stinky.

664
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Get some monster stuff.

665
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Yeah.

666
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah.

667
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Wow.

668
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
So that sounds awesome.

669
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
That sounds very cool.

670
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,600
And I think they may eventually build it out here but not within 10 years or something.

671
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Right.

672
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Yeah where.

673
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
But I think it probably will at least the ride will make it over here eventually.

674
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Cool.

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
But we'll see.

676
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Yeah.

677
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't have any inside information.

678
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Right.

679
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
That's just a guess.

680
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Sure.

681
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
So yeah so.

682
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
But first of all.

683
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
So yeah so.

684
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
But for now your scares are limited.

685
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
They're a mere two months out of the year.

686
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Just two months.

687
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Maybe August.

688
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Maybe November.

689
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Maybe it's creeping more and more on either end.

690
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
It really is like.

691
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Expanding out and why not.

692
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Truly after like 4th of July I'm like hell yeah.

693
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It's Halloween time.

694
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Just round up.

695
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Why not.

696
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh yeah.

697
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
August is bad.

698
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
August is so hot now probably everywhere you are.

699
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I don't even want to think about August.

700
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Let's just skip all the way to fall.

701
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Get rid of August.

702
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Let's get right into fall.

703
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Come on.

704
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Can we make this a.

705
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I don't want to get frozen for like many years.

706
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't want to live into like another century.

707
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Can I just get frozen every year just for August.

708
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Skip August.

709
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Just August.

710
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah.

711
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
My whole family will do it.

712
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
We'll all do it.

713
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Just no one does August anymore.

714
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Yeah.

715
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
There we go.

716
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I love fall.

717
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Like I love the weather.

718
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
And Halloween spooky times.

719
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
And like.

720
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Not the actual haunts.

721
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I hate them.

722
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Terrible haunts.

723
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I hate them.

724
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Terrified of them.

725
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
You love fall TV season when all of NBC and CBS's.

726
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
All my favorites come back.

727
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Yeah.

728
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
The best they have to offer.

729
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
All the game shows.

730
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,600
But I hate the end of summer when it's like end of summer back to school.

731
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,600
It still is mentally draining.

732
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
It's still like oh it's a bummer.

733
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I don't have to go to school.

734
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Or have children who go to school.

735
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
But you still feel it.

736
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
You just feel it in the air.

737
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
It just kind of bums me out.

738
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Because everyone's like.

739
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Especially this less out here.

740
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
But at the Jersey Shore.

741
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,600
They do like a lot of places like we're closing up the weekend after Labor Day.

742
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Like we're closing for the season.

743
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
And they'll just close for six months.

744
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
You know.

745
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
So you go there and you don't know that's the day.

746
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
And then like all right throw the taffy out.

747
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
And then just industrial drums of taffy.

748
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I'll get thrown in acid.

749
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Right in front of you.

750
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
The Good Taffy Shriver's is open year round.

751
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
12 months of the year.

752
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
So the Good Taffy is always available.

753
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,600
But yeah every now and then like if I go back to visit in August.

754
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Like places will be like really short hours or short staff.

755
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,600
It's like all our workers went back to college.

756
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,600
So the lifeguard like there was only lifeguards at like every other beach.

757
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Because everyone is back at school.

758
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
You know.

759
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I guarantee we'll save you.

760
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Every other person.

761
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Well Scott.

762
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
So Scott just did his first full haunt at Shacktoberfest.

763
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Wait how is Shacktoberfest?

764
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm so curious.

765
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
We really like Shacktoberfest.

766
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Yeah yeah recommended actually.

767
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Did you go to Dark Harbor before?

768
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
No.

769
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Because Dark Harbor ruled.

770
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,600
And I'm wondering if Shacktoberfest is kind of that but now with a little bit more basketball.

771
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Well there's no.

772
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Well not a lot.

773
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
All it has is we said some of this on the on the Patreon.

774
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
But it's if you.

775
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
All right.

776
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I imagine a lot of it's the same because it involves the ship and you're on the ship.

777
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
There's nautical themed stuff.

778
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,600
But on top of that you enter through a big inflatable shack who does pre-recorded announcements for you.

779
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Like three of them.

780
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I think I might have to go.

781
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
That's worth it.

782
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,600
The little cherry of Shack on top of your otherwise evil pirate Sunday.

783
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Yes.

784
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh I think I have to go.

785
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
We really.

786
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I've been curious about it because I loved Dark Harbor.

787
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
What's going on.

788
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Is that the.

789
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Was it all like scary pirate stuff and you're in the bowels of the ship.

790
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Yeah yeah.

791
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Like there were like three mazes throughout the Queen Mary.

792
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
OK.

793
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,600
And then like five or six other ones in that part in front of it.

794
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
And it was just spectacular.

795
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
It really elevates it.

796
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I think if you if if we're saying if Dark or if Shacktoberfest was just plopped in the middle of a parking lot without a historic ship next to it maybe there's not the shack flavor doesn't go far enough.

797
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:16,600
But yeah when when put next to nautical history when put next to a ship that nobody wants and it's sinking into the sea slowly.

798
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Long Beach would kind of get rid of.

799
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:36,600
In 2019 it had to have been we a big group of us rented rooms on the Queen Mary and then went and did Dark Harbor stayed the night and stayed the night and we were like pretty drunk and like ghost hunting like four in the morning.

800
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh yeah because they were.

801
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I don't think we said in the episode when we went into this other thing that's the engine room which is apparently open year round and.

802
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,600
And even Anderson told us after our episode you know those red lights you were wondering about they are on all the time.

803
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
So there is always that that's that isn't just Halloween.

804
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
So that was not really a special Halloween thing.

805
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Anyway when we left that thing people said did you see anything in there and we're like yeah red lights.

806
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,600
No no no I mean did you have because some people come with their like spectrometer apps and are looking for you.

807
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Were you doing stuff of that and it were you trying to find ghosts.

808
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Yes.

809
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Well just in the just where like we just kind of all around in through the halls of stuff.

810
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I have a very funny ghost app.

811
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I put it in air quotes.

812
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I got it for free and it like it makes fun noises and then like words will pop up and so you'll be like is somebody around here and they're like get red and crazy and then a word will pop up.

813
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
What were you like the words.

814
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Anything can pop up like anything.

815
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Sandwich.

816
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,600
When we were when we were doing it in the Queen Mary.

817
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I was there with a friend and her name popped up.

818
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
But then it's also like I know they could be listening to us.

819
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Oh yeah.

820
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Because also ads will pop up and that's the scariest part.

821
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Crazy loud ads about like a game where it's like take a bath or whatever.

822
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Trying to help the king escape.

823
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah it's I love it.

824
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I got to hit up Shacktoberfest.

825
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
You got it. You got to do it real quick though.

826
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Do you have like have you ever seen a ghost.

827
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Do you have like a ghost in it like I had my first interaction two years ago.

828
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Really.

829
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I didn't see anything but I heard it.

830
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I was in Keystone Colorado with my sister and her family.

831
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:55,600
We were skiing there and we rented a condo for the night and it was pretty small like a nice like two bedroom living room kitchen two bathrooms and one of the bathrooms is in the front part by the door and then a bathroom kind of between the rooms and they the my nieces went to bed and I was

832
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:22,600
sharing a room with them and me and my sister and brother-in-law we were hanging out and then my sister's like I'm gonna go to bed so she gets ready and my brother-in-law and I are hanging out and then we're both kind of like yeah let's let's go to bed like we shut off all the lights and everything and he goes into the hall bathroom and I go into the room to get my toiletries and stuff to then use the bathroom by the front door and as I'm in my room getting my stuff I hear a great big loud noise.

833
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:44,600
And it sounds like my brother-in-law and I'm like oh maybe he's just getting water or something and I walk out and it came from the living room and I walk out nothing's there and it's dark and there's a very dark corner and I'm like I thought Nate was there but he's still in the bathroom and I was like what and then I hear it again.

834
00:31:44,600 --> 00:32:12,600
From this dark corner I'm like what the fuck what the fuck and I'm like kind of excited because I'm like I don't know what this is and I'm hanging out to be like is it like a weird fan or something you know like something in this condo that the heat or something and so I'm like waiting to see if there's like a pattern or anything and I wait for a while and then I hear again with the light on and then I hear the sound of the bathroom and I'm like what the fuck is going on and I'm like I'm so excited.

835
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I don't know if I can figure out like any actual pattern so I run to the bathroom and I'm like so I'm like shaking my body's freaking out like I've never reacted to anything like this before like I'm trembling I've never trembled before I'm like brushing my teeth and washing my face and I didn't have my phone and I was like I can't wait to text Marcy who I have a spooky podcast with.

836
00:32:35,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I'm like I think it's happening I think it's happening so then I like get ready and then I'm like bracing myself to be like okay I'm gonna fucking like I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see what's going on and I'm gonna like look and try to see if there's anything there and so I like go out and I'm walking towards this dark dark area and I'm like oh my god oh my god and then it goes huh it like sucks in a gasp and then I run to the bedroom and I'm like oh my god I'm so fucking scared.

837
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Wow really? Yeah. And was that the first like only night you were there? The only night we were there. Yeah. And I like woke up and I was like did anybody like had everybody because I slept good then. I was so scared I watched Tommy Boy on my phone I was so scared.

838
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:39,600
I was like oh my god I need to chill out I need to chill out. And everybody slept fine and I told them I was like I think something's up here and it was like I knew we were leaving and my nieces thought it was cool they were like cool man you know like but yeah it was something happened.

839
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Whoa that's crazy. At least it was a satisfied sounding ghost. A relaxed ghost. That ghost was chillin. Yeah yeah yeah chillin. Like completely fine with everything not mad. Maybe that energy helped you sleep well. Maybe. That might be yeah yeah.

840
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I want to give someone else I want to make someone else as relaxed as I am. Yeah it didn't feel because you hear stories and people are like it felt malicious or like it felt very negative like there was something there and that wasn't the case.

841
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I just was freaking out because I you know yeah I was kind of excited I was I was like I think it's a fucking ghost oh my god. But my body had never reacted like that before too which I feel is also a sign of like something was up. Yeah you know.

842
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:55,600
It was an extra level of like heightened feeling or whatever. Rather than just like oh it's a heater or something it was like no something something was there. Well that sounds ideal chill kind of exciting but calm ultimately and most of all didn't kill you and everyone in the house.

843
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Yeah. That's why you want to have a ghost. Kind of in one of my favorite place like I grew up around Keystone like in Summit County and so it was like it was kind of fun of like this is one of my favorite places in the whole world.

844
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:21,600
All right let's have a little ghost. Let's have a little ghost interaction. The founder of the town old Milt's Keystone. I'm just glad people are enjoying my city. Thanks for skiing on the mountain.

845
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:50,600
I love to share its beauty. Your sleepy ghost they call me. Have any of you had any any experiences or anything strange? I want one. I've seen UFO. I've seen UFO like I've seen a crazy I haven't seen what it looked like. I've seen I've said this before like standing outside right over here by my where my friend used to live I saw above Universal Studios it was not part of the show a light just appear in like a flash.

846
00:35:50,600 --> 00:36:05,600
And this shoots straight up into the atmosphere which is like I don't know what that I got chills. I don't know what that and like it was crazy too because my two friends who I was talking to in this field like this field area across from over on Lancashire literally two blocks from here.

847
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Their backs were to it. So I was the only one who saw it. So we're talking we're talking talking I look up and I go whoa I gotta make a huge noise and I go like it's gone already. And it was a it was really high too so it was like I don't think Universal was testing a rocket system into space.

848
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Into space. I think it was farther experiment was farther from Universal to a way than just but it appeared as if like it was like like playing like where a plane would fly and just a bright light and then straight up.

849
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Never seen like what was that. What could that have been. Yeah. No clue. The only other ghost thing I got close we drove down a place called Cuba Road where I'm from.

850
00:36:47,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Once and I did this because a couple girls wanted to do it. So I was like yeah okay okay. Yeah I'm excited. Yeah. That sounds awesome. And we were driving there was like there's an old I don't even what you would call it a sanitarium there basically.

851
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:16,600
And like it is a legit dark no like it's there's houses there but there are no streetlights. So when you're driving your car and this is like 10 or 15 20 minutes from where I grew up there are animals in the road.

852
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:26,600
So like it's one of the things where you're like turned on a street and it's just squirrels and they scatter because there's no light. Yeah. And there are signs that are just like turn around please.

853
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Please don't drive. Don't come this way. Like your kids. This is a bad idea. Don't do this. And I don't even know if that I think that the hospital whatever it was as it wasn't full of people but it's it's creepy as shit.

854
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Creepy as shit. That energy from when it was. Yeah. So you're driving we're driving down and I'm just like trying to be cool. I'm 20 I think I'm like 21 or 20 at this point. It's too old really.

855
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:08,600
And we're driving I'm driving and all of a sudden I think I've told this in this pocket before. Over some we're driving and like the girls are screaming at everything. Any any animal or whatever they're screaming and all of a sudden we get like close. I don't know if we actually saw the hospital.

856
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:25,600
But the car stops moving. The car. It's like the car is on and then I'm like the car's not I'm hitting the gas. I'm like it's not the car's not. And for two what 10 seconds 15 seconds I'm just like everything's real like everything ever.

857
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:48,600
It's like a Dracula's like every I'm just like mine is racing and I turn the car on and off and it's still it's not move it's like won't move. And I'm just like what the fuck is going on or whatever. And I felt like 15 minutes was probably three minutes. Yeah. Probably one and a half minutes. And we look and the car was probably knocked by one of the girls into neutral.

858
00:38:48,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah. And I didn't notice. There's this cars in some kind of weird state that is neither driving reversing. What is this. And I was like OK. And then like we drive around and then OK. But for I that was the crazy because I do like I was believing in everything. Yes. And stuff in that in the short window of time. So yeah no I don't have any legit ghost stories.

859
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Sadly unless it wasn't an elbow or unless it was not an elbow of someone I've thought that thought you were with. I think that's possible. Right. You believe I do want to believe that. Yeah. Let's put it into in for but I think romance did Fox did Fox Mulder believe in ghosts or do you believe in ghosts.

860
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:48,060
Anticipation and I speak just alien martial arts was the editing is the react this is what make I most believe these you weren't much of a improviser to have a ghost doctor come this is one that you may encounter even as a intめて intermediate ethn Hogana

861
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,160
is unusual.

862
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,880
I think would have dealt with the ghost he wouldn't have like referred to another office I think he would have tried to deal with it.

863
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,560
There was no one where it wasn't supernatural Hasselhoff never dealt with a ghost or a vampire I am now I'm sure they watch I don't know the.

864
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:20,120
They watch they watch spooky they watch nights was the spin off and in season one it was just like regular sexy crimes but at night and it wasn't doing what they wanted it to do so in season two they got rid of lounge singer Lou Rawls.

865
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:30,560
They didn't want to pay Lou Rawls anymore and they made it and X files is popular citizens made it an X files so there's one where there's like a dead Viking or some others definitely goes the Viking was a ghost.

866
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,040
How are you watching this just YouTube YouTube I'm OK there goes my day.

867
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:48,200
Yeah I'm watching all of they watch night hop around I'm kind of deciding I mean like there I just saw my first one from season one where there's a murder at a drag club and Hasselhoff has to do drag.

868
00:40:48,560 --> 00:41:02,240
Which is one of the most demented things I've ever seen but there's so there's terms to but if you want supernatural I recommend this Viking one where he's yelling Valhalla and shooting a flaming bow and he does a Viking funeral.

869
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
Oh my God perfect television.

870
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,080
Wow.

871
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:14,480
We're all the best television is ripped on YouTube and poor quality and if you can't find it there the Internet our daily.

872
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,680
Yeah.

873
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:30,320
All right well let's talk a little of that we've talked about spooky stuff in 50 years in the 45 we're not going to be able to fit the 50 all 50 but there's it's fun to talk a little bit about the history because I'm looking up the for I assume we maybe took a glance at the first haunt.

874
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
A tiny bit.

875
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,280
So yeah it's 1973 it was called something else.

876
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,440
It's Halloween haunt.

877
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,240
That's all we want.

878
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,240
OK yes they hadn't figured out the scary farm pun yet.

879
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,560
Right.

880
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,040
And it's three it was three days and that was it.

881
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,520
Yeah.

882
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,480
And there's a like there's it's not so well documented but there's a flyer online and they have a list of what was there.

883
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,000
OK.

884
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,080
Which sounds fun.

885
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,960
There was a thing called the haunted shack.

886
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,400
I don't know if you've ever talked about which was a little experience.

887
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,600
Not experience.

888
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,800
Yeah they made it even scarier for Halloween.

889
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,680
They called it the monster maze.

890
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,520
Great.

891
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,040
Yes.

892
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,120
Is it still there.

893
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,920
Don't think so.

894
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,800
No they recreated it recreated it sometime in the last I think 10 years for one of the haunts but it's not there right now.

895
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,560
But it had like some like illusion like if you'd stand at the corner of the house it looks like it was like the perspective was off like the Willy Wonka.

896
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,400
This is like a Rube Goldberg kind of like water will run up.

897
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,040
Yeah.

898
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:35,960
Yes.

899
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,600
There were gag gags like that.

900
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,200
I think there's still one of those at the Calico.

901
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,840
There's a mine town.

902
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,840
On the way to Vegas.

903
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,000
In the way to Vegas.

904
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,920
Yeah I've never been there.

905
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,440
That still has I think this mystery haunted shack.

906
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,840
Oh charming.

907
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,240
That time.

908
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,600
Yeah.

909
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
More to do more year round scary stuff.

910
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:56,800
Yeah I gotta go.

911
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
On the way to Vegas.

912
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:04,520
There was so they did they in 73 rethemed the rides which I was surprised to learn.

913
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,640
To be spooky.

914
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,120
Yes.

915
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,680
So the Calico mine ride was the ghost of Ghostway Express.

916
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,040
Great.

917
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,880
And Timber Mountain Log ride they have listed as Satan's Sawmill.

918
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,880
Hell yeah.

919
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,720
I don't think any any major theme park is going to bring Satan into the picture.

920
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:21,800
No.

921
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,800
All of Satan and if they did then libs of TikTok would be all over it.

922
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,160
Right.

923
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,080
Well that did happen.

924
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
That was Fat Knots right.

925
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,080
We were talking about this.

926
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,120
Yeah.

927
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,680
Oh this is bonkers.

928
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,160
They were complaining there.

929
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,400
There is a circusy kind did you see the carnival show.

930
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:46,680
And the stuff they always get mad about is like someone waggling their butt dressed like hot

931
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,120
stuff the little devil and they're like they're doing it right in front of us now.

932
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,440
And the Hollywood sickos.

933
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,760
You know everything in general culturally or entertainment wise moves so fast it's like

934
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,240
well I think they did the right thing.

935
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,280
They seem to just kind of ignore it because like accounts like that move on to like being

936
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,800
mad at a candy bar TGI Fridays.

937
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,520
Yeah they'll find something again to be mad at.

938
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,440
It's also like you know like you know what this is.

939
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,560
This is a Halloween like party.

940
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,120
Like you know what your goal is.

941
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,040
They framed it like they didn't know.

942
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,360
Like this is an amusement park for children.

943
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,840
What's at the nighttime version of the.

944
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,840
And a thing that's been going for 50 years that used to have Satan's sawmill.

945
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,520
You're more moralistic than conservatives in 1973.

946
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,200
They're acting like it was at like 10 a.m.

947
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
at this camp Snoopy's stage.

948
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:51,160
Well Snoopy leaves and then people in like leather and like feather boas come out.

949
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,400
Snoopy is on a leather diaper and he's waggling his tail to like a Kesha song.

950
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,120
They make people from the audience go into the diaper with their faces.

951
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,640
Go and Snoopy's diaper now.

952
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,320
Get gunpoint.

953
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:15,640
All of the conservative media is just hell in love joy now saying won't someone please think of the children.

954
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,800
And that was a joke 30 years ago.

955
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,720
But then they don't with guns.

956
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,440
They can give a shit with guns.

957
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:21,840
Yeah that's fine.

958
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,960
No no no actually kids should think about guns all year round and run drills every day.

959
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Yeah.

960
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,760
That's fine.

961
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,320
It's almost like and I hate to say this some of these arguments are not in good faith that they're making.

962
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,480
Not intellectually consistent.

963
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,480
It's as if they're just cherry picking things to misrepresent.

964
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm also seeing that maybe Satan's sawmill was called Terror Mountain.

965
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Fun.

966
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Which is a fun name as well but not as good.

967
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,560
And now children are going to be fearful of mountains.

968
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
They're ruining our mountains right in front of us.

969
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah the wholesome places.

970
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Where wholesome minds collapsed on grizzled miners.

971
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,520
Grizzled wholesome miners.

972
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Yeah.

973
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,040
There was a scare zone in the ghost town which is of course still happening.

974
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,920
And then they had entertainment like Seymour the master of the macabre.

975
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
This is one of these guys you like the gulardies.

976
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,640
He's like a local horror show guy who was there for a couple of years.

977
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
Yes.

978
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,520
Because like Elvira was there for so many years.

979
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,000
And they had like well hold on I'll get to it in just one second.

980
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,480
They had this guy then they had Hilda the Halloween haunt spokeswitch.

981
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
Oh cool.

982
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
Sounds good.

983
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,520
Who was at the main gate and then they were all they have listed here is that they had Phantom of the Opera in the Calico saloon.

984
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Full performance too.

985
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
I assume it's the full.

986
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Oh that's cool.

987
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,520
Yeah.

988
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,760
Andrew Lloyd Webber tested it there.

989
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,560
Yeah it was years in the making.

990
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
Workshopped.

991
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,240
There were spectacular fireworks which I don't believe they have any like they haven't had fireworks for a long time.

992
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,720
They had something called dunking of sea monster in ghost town which sounds like it's maybe a dunk tank with a person.

993
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,400
Probably with somebody like dressed up like a sea monster making fun of you.

994
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,200
Roasting you or whatever.

995
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,600
And then look at this land lubber.

996
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,840
Doesn't have gills like me.

997
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,680
You idiot.

998
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,680
And to me the most intriguing one I don't know if you saw this.

999
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,120
Which I couldn't find video of and maybe I didn't look hard enough is Tales of Rock Horror featuring Hello People.

1000
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,080
What is Hello People.

1001
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,840
You hear that and you think up with people.

1002
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,280
Yes.

1003
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
But that's not right.

1004
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,600
Hello People is different.

1005
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,320
But I think it's adjacent.

1006
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Must be.

1007
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:44,400
So The Hello People which I've seen it referred to is a band from the 60s and 70s.

1008
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,000
They were like put together by a record guy but they were very political.

1009
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,960
And what.

1010
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
Whoa.

1011
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,080
They're doing it in front of our kids.

1012
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,480
They're doing it.

1013
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,000
They were doing it in front of the kids and I'll show you a photo of them.

1014
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:02,240
Not only they were very political they were also dressed like mimes.

1015
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,920
A band of mimes.

1016
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Funny.

1017
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,000
Like this is them.

1018
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,200
Now does it look exactly like Kiss.

1019
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
Kind of.

1020
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Yeah.

1021
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,880
Are you making an accusation here of Kiss.

1022
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,360
This is funny.

1023
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Yes.

1024
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,080
They are.

1025
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,800
So The Hello People they supported Todd Rundgren on maybe two tours.

1026
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,280
God that sounds.

1027
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,480
Because it sounded familiar to me for some reason.

1028
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Maybe that's why.

1029
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Yes.

1030
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,200
So I'm listening to some of the music and I don't it's not the songs are maybe not great.

1031
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,680
But there's certainly like a 60s vibe you can appreciate.

1032
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,680
OK.

1033
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,160
It's like the strawberry alarm clock but without the song.

1034
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,040
But the vibe of like incense and peppermint or whatever.

1035
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,920
OK.

1036
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
And I'm like OK.

1037
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,800
And then there's a clip from the Smothers Brothers and the Smothers Brothers are just

1038
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,560
like very kind of somber and they're like you know this is a controversial song and

1039
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,800
we don't necessarily agree with this song but we feel that the opinions are important

1040
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,920
to express and we're going to show.

1041
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,640
And then there's about two minutes of miming.

1042
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
No way.

1043
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,480
And like pretending a guitar is a gun.

1044
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,120
And then the lyrics are not.

1045
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,680
I mean this probably was outrageous for the time.

1046
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,320
So this wasn't a joke on the.

1047
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,720
No this was a very serious anti-war song which I mean as far as I'm trying to listen to

1048
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,680
the lyrics and it's just like we're all people and like it's just I think just the idea that

1049
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,400
it was anti-war was a big deal wasn't like they were saying.

1050
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,680
Smothers Brothers being like.

1051
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,120
Yeah.

1052
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Can we say this.

1053
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,000
No no no we are going to go we will drop bombs ourselves.

1054
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah we will.

1055
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
We will.

1056
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
On break on hiatus from the show.

1057
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

1058
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,680
Sometimes stuff that got slapped with very political back then the song is like don't

1059
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,800
dump gasoline in streams.

1060
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,960
Yes that is kind of the vibe of this song.

1061
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,200
Maybe and maybe I misheard I didn't hear like in a very like crazy lyric or something but

1062
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,200
yeah that vibe was just basically like we shouldn't be at war and people like what.

1063
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Can they say that.

1064
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,040
They should make like other mimes and shut up.

1065
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Here's the hello people.

1066
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
I don't know.

1067
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
Wow.

1068
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,920
So we got to find this show but then so I guess they weren't all politics because they're

1069
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,920
doing not scary the original conservative.

1070
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Yeah yeah.

1071
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,880
Mike was this the flyer you were looking at.

1072
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Yeah yeah.

1073
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Halloween haunt one.

1074
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
That's awesome.

1075
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:35,400
Seymour this is you know if you want to communicate scary guy idea I feel like wide brimmed hat

1076
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,800
and mustache is just like oh well that's an undertaker of some sinister man maybe.

1077
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,800
Yeah.

1078
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,800
Very scary.

1079
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,520
He looks like he's like a like a Carradine or somebody.

1080
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,400
He's a creepy looking character actor.

1081
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,400
Yeah.

1082
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Yeah.

1083
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Yes.

1084
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
I was impressed with the line.

1085
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
I was like I kind of impressed with the original lineup.

1086
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,680
Yeah that's awesome.

1087
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,040
And this has never been done before so they're inventing this.

1088
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,480
They're inventing the genre.

1089
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,560
I have one more a little bit of history and we'll talk about stuff from this year.

1090
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,920
But yeah they do seem to have these like you know not I don't want to say mascots it's

1091
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,960
like like performers like here's there's the face of it this year because that became Elvira

1092
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,120
and for a while for a number of years it was Wolfman Jack.

1093
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:29,800
Wolfman Jack raspy voiced DJ of American Graffiti and Midnight Special fame and God bless whoever

1094
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,040
posted this on YouTube.

1095
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:39,120
Hollow Studios posted a little bit of a Wolfman Jack show that you could see in the Good

1096
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,360
Time Theater and this is in 1977.

1097
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,920
Oh my god.

1098
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,280
Does anything come to mind when I mention 1977?

1099
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
Pop culturally.

1100
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Star Wars.

1101
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Yep you got it.

1102
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,240
I mean first here wait I should have I should have said this part first that first he comes

1103
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,080
out and has a real crow or a raven on his arm.

1104
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,440
And he's got the big glove to support it.

1105
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,640
And then he's and he's like dressed in crazy spangles and then he starts singing Shake

1106
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,520
Your Booty with the raven still on his arm.

1107
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
This might be the greatest show on earth.

1108
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
Perfect that sounds awesome.

1109
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,520
It's a Halloween show yes.

1110
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
It's 1977.

1111
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,840
I wonder how old he was at this point.

1112
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,040
I don't know I'm timeless baby.

1113
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,000
He was born in 38.

1114
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,280
He was not old he was like 39.

1115
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Wow.

1116
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Wow.

1117
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,840
But so due to the 77 nature of it and you know Nott's has kept this up with the hanging.

1118
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,760
They always address the pop culture of the year and Star Wars is new this year you got

1119
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,600
to deal with it.

1120
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,440
Incredible hair incredible goatee incredible big open butterfly collar.

1121
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,760
Wolfman Jack so rad.

1122
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,960
The Todd Rundgren song about him.

1123
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,400
Todd loves Nott's I bet.

1124
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,160
So we must have.

1125
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,480
But anyway what the Star Wars thing seems to become at least a lot of it was posted

1126
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,640
in this YouTube video is just the characters from Star Wars being introduced coming to

1127
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,280
the microphone and saying hello.

1128
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,000
And here's a little clip of what that is like.

1129
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
What?

1130
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's just chewy.

1131
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah.

1132
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Sounds sick.

1133
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,960
Start with the character.

1134
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,880
What C3PO says I love so much.

1135
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Hello.

1136
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Hello.

1137
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,880
Hello.

1138
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Hello.

1139
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,880
C3PO.

1140
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
Okay so.

1141
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,880
C3PO.

1142
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,880
He.

1143
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,840
C3PO just says hello and then walks away from them.

1144
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,200
This is just a parade of Star Wars introductions and then they leave.

1145
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,400
But what he says on the way out is alright give it up for PCPO.

1146
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:09,560
He does a double P. We got RT do do here.

1147
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:15,480
And then it becomes this little like he fights with Darth Vader and who calls it who very

1148
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,520
insultingly calls him Wolfman Slack.

1149
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,400
But he seems to win the fight and what's the best about this little Star Wars routine

1150
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,400
happening is the a great reveal at the end of who is in the audience.

1151
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,400
Now I want to point them out to you.

1152
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,400
In the audience tonight is Mr. Gary Kurtz the producer of Star Wars and American Graffiti.

1153
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Would you stand up Gary?

1154
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
He's out of breath.

1155
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,400
And sitting next to him I think is Carrie Fisher who played a cost princess Leia from

1156
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,400
Star Wars.

1157
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,920
Carrie Fisher would you stand up please.

1158
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
She's there.

1159
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
He's so out of breath.

1160
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,320
And then he says alright come back see us we got three more shows tonight.

1161
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,120
But I love where Princess Leia from we presumably.

1162
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Shit.

1163
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
Oh what is it?

1164
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Shit.

1165
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,760
I don't blame her because I didn't even think he was like a song and dance and certainly

1166
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
not like a stunt man.

1167
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
Oh I didn't either.

1168
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,520
He just had to fight Darth Vader and he feels like we would if we had to fight.

1169
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,640
Give me a sec.

1170
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,640
I gotta keep screaming at you guys.

1171
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,640
He's our age.

1172
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,640
Yeah we are.

1173
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,640
Yes I know how I was on the bounce floor at the Chektova Fest.

1174
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Give me a minute.

1175
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,640
Hey okay Darth Vader he really took it out of me.

1176
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,640
The only food in the green room is Mrs. Knott's fried chicken and biscuits so I am struggling

1177
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
out here.

1178
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,640
My bag got fried chicken, fried chicken, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

1179
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,760
So old Jack's struggling a little bit.

1180
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,760
There's no water just boysenberry punch.

1181
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,760
Boysenberry.

1182
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Boysenberry everything.

1183
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Hey Luke Skykicker's been on the toilet all day so at least old Jack's doing better than

1184
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,760
Skykicker.

1185
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,760
I gotta get to the dressing room to do a little more space dust.

1186
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,760
You know what I'm talking about.

1187
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Yeah I want more before my next show.

1188
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,760
I'm not really going to be feeling the force if I get my space dust.

1189
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,760
Chewbacca stole it from me.

1190
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
I was howling way before Chewbacca.

1191
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,880
Anyway here's the turtles.

1192
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,880
Jack no that's not you're not on the radio.

1193
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Oh okay sorry here's Crosby stills in a...

1194
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,880
He doesn't know how to not introduce bands.

1195
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Man Jack.

1196
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Boy I wish I could have Carrie Fisher watch that.

1197
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,880
Carrie Fisher the year months after Star Wars came out watched an out of breath Wolfman

1198
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
kind of like half swing lightsaber.

1199
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Oh no I believe 19 years old.

1200
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Carrie Fisher.

1201
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
19 or 20 yeah.

1202
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Boy living the best life that ever was.

1203
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
She's right at the beginning this is where it's starting.

1204
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This is where it's starting.

1205
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Boy I haven't even started the screenwriting yet.

1206
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's all ahead of you Carrie.

1207
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Ahsoka Tano is here.

1208
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And this cast of rebels.

1209
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,120
Sabini?

1210
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Hey Ackinon's coming in.

1211
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Ackinon is Darth Vadeer.

1212
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
That's a spoiler alert.

1213
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,120
When I figure out how to log into Benzie Plus I'm gonna watch this.

1214
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,120
Yiddle Yiddles here.

1215
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Female Yoda.

1216
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Dexter Detper.

1217
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
The man with the diner.

1218
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,120
Oh no he's haunting.

1219
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,120
I started playing it again.

1220
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
He haunted my life.

1221
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Wolfman Jack's haunting the studio.

1222
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,120
Let him know.

1223
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120
Let him know you love her.

1224
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:42,560
I love that he's trying to remember the name of everything and he's just been in a 10 minute

1225
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Star Wars sketch and he's like she was Princess Leia from Star Wars.

1226
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,560
You know all that shit you just saw.

1227
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,560
You get it.

1228
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,560
You get it.

1229
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,560
You know I did it and she did it first.

1230
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
I got her name right.

1231
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,560
I should get points for that.

1232
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So that's man.

1233
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Now this is I don't mean to.

1234
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
We're coming in.

1235
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The history is incredible.

1236
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,200
So every year they've got a big job ahead of them to match the history of Out of Breath

1237
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,200
Wolf Man Jack.

1238
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,200
But did you either of you.

1239
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,200
Betsy went and Mike went.

1240
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Did you guys see anything that you thought matched the quality of what I just showed

1241
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
you?

1242
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
No.

1243
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
I mean not on that.

1244
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,200
They fell short ultimately.

1245
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,000
I will say this.

1246
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,440
Everything is a little too polished.

1247
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,080
And I mean that because there's not like probably a drunkish DJ on stage just like mumbling

1248
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,080
his way through the copy they've given him.

1249
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
Yeah they've been rehearsing.

1250
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,080
Did you see.

1251
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
Oh God we saw a show.

1252
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,360
I missed I think the show you're talking about.

1253
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,080
Yeah the like mad scientist and his little friend.

1254
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
Oh yeah.

1255
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
His little sister.

1256
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
What was it?

1257
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,720
They're trying to make the best lady or something.

1258
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,600
Something like that.

1259
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,520
One of the shows the outside show has a little bit of a send up of a recent Disney situation.

1260
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
I don't know if you guys saw this.

1261
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh I watched this entire thing.

1262
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
The show.

1263
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Did you watch The Hanging?

1264
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
The Hanging.

1265
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
No.

1266
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
The Hanging uncancelled.

1267
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,440
This is a show they do every year that's their like pop culture.

1268
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,880
It's what Bill and Ted.

1269
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,960
Which is you know like it's rude and it's not PC.

1270
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,720
From that title uncancelled I'm like let me watch this crap and judge this crap and then

1271
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,040
I'm watching it and I'm like I like a lot of the jokes.

1272
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,360
I liked a lot of them because there was like somebody was trapped in a crate at one point

1273
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,640
and they say that crate's smaller than a billionaire's submarine.

1274
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,120
And then somebody gets shot and they say nice shooting Alec Baldwin.

1275
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,920
I'm like you know what.

1276
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,920
Those are pretty.

1277
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,920
They actually are.

1278
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
Yeah.

1279
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
You know what they sort of are.

1280
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,080
It's like Norm MacDonald weekend update jokes.

1281
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
Yeah.

1282
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
A little harsh.

1283
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,400
A little harsh in a way.

1284
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,360
And I was digging it up until like oh and okay and what you were referring to they made

1285
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:09,620
fun of how the dragon in Phantasmac Disneyland caught on fire and has been gone will be gone

1286
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,120
for an entire year.

1287
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,600
Dude they had a dragon catch on fire.

1288
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,600
That's great.

1289
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,600
They made fun of World of Color.

1290
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,200
They said that the dragon went down faster than Galactic Star Cruiser.

1291
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,200
Like this is fucking this is kind of good.

1292
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,200
This is a little edgy.

1293
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,320
Dragon catching on fire is objectively funny.

1294
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Yes.

1295
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
The park down the road has to do that.

1296
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,840
I love that it's also like we got to make fun of the park down the road right.

1297
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,600
They're the ones with the money.

1298
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,600
They have it all.

1299
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
They're doing fine.

1300
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Let's have fun.

1301
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:42,800
It's punching up is what it's doing which it also does to there's always like who is

1302
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,400
the big bad of the year that they're chasing and this year Elon Musk a correct target.

1303
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Honestly great.

1304
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
Yeah.

1305
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,200
That's who we should be shitting on and they didn't do a hanging because I think they're

1306
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,800
finding that a noose is an inappropriate thing.

1307
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
Sure yeah.

1308
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,160
They make some jokes about that.

1309
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,880
They're all like alright shut up.

1310
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,240
But they do they have a special way to get rid of Elon which is we're doing a Twittery

1311
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,160
branding and then they take a big hot X and they brand it on his butt.

1312
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,160
That's good.

1313
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,160
That's what Elon should get.

1314
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,160
I gotta go back to that scary farm.

1315
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
You don't have to go back.

1316
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,160
I'm sorry to tell you.

1317
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,160
Yeah yeah.

1318
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,160
At least watch the video.

1319
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
Check out the video.

1320
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah yeah yeah.

1321
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
At least watch the video.

1322
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
Check out the hanging next year.

1323
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,280
I always assumed I would like hate every second of this and I kind of like until they fall

1324
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,080
into a pit at the end because they they're like wait but Elon's not the true villain.

1325
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,400
Who's really bad who's on his platform and it's Karens and then a bunch of Karens come

1326
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,840
out you're like okay all right I see that but then they get confused and they start

1327
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,720
calling the Karens social justice warriors and saying like it's because of you that we

1328
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,240
have paper straws that we can't and like well no those are no no no.

1329
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,240
That's separate.

1330
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,240
That's separate.

1331
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:00,600
So they did not look closely enough at that whole thing.

1332
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,880
But then they also make fun of their own little mythology and this is maybe something to talk

1333
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,360
about for this year at scary farm.

1334
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,680
They can't do the hanging the way they used to but they do it with something new at not

1335
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,400
this year the no boo necklace.

1336
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Yes.

1337
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,760
Which I like that they're making fun of their own thing.

1338
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:25,320
So the no boo necklace is that a thing that you can light up that you put on to show that

1339
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,780
you do not want to get scared in the scare zones.

1340
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,320
Not the mazes the mazes you got no choice and they can't see you in those.

1341
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,720
I did not know that okay.

1342
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,440
Yeah so it doesn't apply in the mazes but I'm looking at I'm like I hate to be I mean

1343
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,400
this apparently makes me a Karen if I would be in it according to their rules but I kind

1344
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,200
of like maybe I would do the no boo necklace because something I don't like and that I

1345
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,920
didn't feel so much at checktoberfest that you I don't like feeling like I'm going to

1346
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,360
get scared all the time.

1347
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,600
I'm going to get scared in the maze and I'm going to leave the maze and I'm going to get

1348
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,800
scared more.

1349
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,920
So I like the I like breaks maybe.

1350
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
Yeah.

1351
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,240
So maybe I would do this no boo necklace.

1352
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,720
The necklace saying Sea World and Busch Gardens I think I've been doing this for a little

1353
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,720
while now.

1354
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,720
Oh okay.

1355
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
Walking around.

1356
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,480
Yeah and you get a little break you don't get scared walking around.

1357
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:18,160
I'll say this though there are territories so you do have it on the map where you have

1358
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,960
you know you can get sanctuary.

1359
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Oh okay.

1360
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
The scare zone.

1361
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,960
Yeah.

1362
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,960
Johnny Rockets.

1363
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
Johnny Rockets is a sanctuary.

1364
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,960
Okay thank god.

1365
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,680
Yeah I feel almost any bar.

1366
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,680
Any bar yeah you're not getting like.

1367
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,680
You're not spilling your yeah.

1368
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,680
$20 yeah spilling a $20 pot down.

1369
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:42,160
One dude got us all really well right after we went to the saloon and got some beers and

1370
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:49,840
stuff and I was taking a picture of Mano and his husband sitting with those funny like

1371
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,440
ladies those fake ladies.

1372
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,440
Oh yeah yeah.

1373
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,440
Yeah.

1374
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,480
And I was like taking a picture and this dude came out of nowhere and scared us all.

1375
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,640
Like I almost dropped my beer I almost dropped my phone.

1376
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:08,360
But then and then like we all just cheered him on and he just slowly walked away and

1377
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,600
then came back for a picture.

1378
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
He was great.

1379
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,600
Wow.

1380
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,040
He was great.

1381
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
Yeah.

1382
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:19,840
Not scare actors watching videos I feel like not scare actors are great at coming up you

1383
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:26,320
know and doing an unusual scare but also I saw in some of the mazes they would just follow

1384
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,320
you like someone just followed you.

1385
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,240
Yes I got followed a couple of times.

1386
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,160
Yeah and that is so unnerving to me.

1387
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,800
It's so like where you're just like whew made it out of that let's go to this next room

1388
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:40,720
and then like I would turn thinking it was Mano or Justin or someone and it's a fucking

1389
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,520
creepy like creepy person stalking you.

1390
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,840
It's so good.

1391
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
It's so good.

1392
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,800
We're like you kind of lose that at Universal now.

1393
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,320
Yeah that's not there's not as much of that you got a little bit.

1394
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Yeah you get a little bit.

1395
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,160
Maybe we got followed a little bit but not a lot.

1396
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,720
Yeah not so you get followed more.

1397
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,160
My other impression watching videos is that some of the mazes are very elaborate this

1398
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,600
year like very long and very elaborate.

1399
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
Super long.

1400
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Yeah.

1401
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:13,800
And they are like every single thing is on purpose like there's it does it's not there's

1402
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:19,200
not a lazy thing going on like every single thing.

1403
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Yeah they're incredible.

1404
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
A lot of giant puppets.

1405
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Tons.

1406
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Tons of giant puppets.

1407
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,000
Betsy what are the highlights from the year?

1408
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,800
I loved the cinema slasher.

1409
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
Yeah.

1410
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
One.

1411
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
That was awesome.

1412
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,280
That's a new one and that was replacing the whatever the clown one was from last year

1413
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,280
Dark Ride.

1414
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,280
Dark Ride.

1415
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,360
Which had been there for a long time which is in like a room they sometimes use for like

1416
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:49,240
events I think Jason and I ate like macaroni there at a press event once.

1417
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
Nice.

1418
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,720
Spilled all over my press badge.

1419
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:02,360
It was awesome you like enter into a movie lobby and there's like a zombie guy giving

1420
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,760
you popcorn and screaming at you.

1421
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,240
Yes that part was my favorite even like the lobby yeah.

1422
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,720
And with this song like let's all go to the lobby let's all play and then you go into

1423
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,240
the theater and like a movie's starting and of course there are all these like or not

1424
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:21,960
probably like five or six people sitting in the like theater seats and you don't know

1425
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,520
who's reading who's not and they get you.

1426
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,360
And then you go through like multiple.

1427
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,560
You go through the screen itself.

1428
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,560
Yes.

1429
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
You go through the screen itself.

1430
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,440
Into the movie essentially.

1431
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,560
Into the movie and then it follows like multiple kind of different classic slashery style movies

1432
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:48,240
like a sorority house a very like Jasony camp one a Michael Myers vibe one it was awesome

1433
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,760
and then you like you go through the lobby again and it's like let's all go to the you

1434
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,360
know like all fucked up and shit and then you like see more of a movie.

1435
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,760
It was spectacular.

1436
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah it was you end up in the slaughter house I feel like a couple of mazes I feel like

1437
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,960
you end with like pigs hanging.

1438
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,560
Yes lots of pigs.

1439
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,560
Uh huh.

1440
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,640
Those let's all go to the lobby characters are a little scary these freaks made of popcorn

1441
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,640
buckets and wieners.

1442
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,640
You spoke at chocolate bar.

1443
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,840
You spoke at chocolate bar.

1444
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,440
Oh there was a camera headed monster.

1445
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,440
Yes.

1446
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,120
That made weird sounds that looked really weird.

1447
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,120
Yeah.

1448
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,120
A camera head.

1449
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,120
Yes.

1450
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,360
He's mad because his film is dying.

1451
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:40,120
Yeah he's hanging in there hoping that Tarantino or Christopher Nolan makes a new movie so he

1452
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,120
can get a game.

1453
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,120
Use me.

1454
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,560
There's only like three guys that hire me now.

1455
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,600
I'm not IMAX but I'm still good.

1456
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,880
I'm still pretty good.

1457
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,680
You can appreciate me.

1458
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,240
This one was the only one where I was like brainstorming what I would do like I was like

1459
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,160
oh they could have done like three more movies and made them get like worse or bad like in

1460
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,720
the way the leprechaun goes to space or in the hood.

1461
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,720
You could have gotten progressively like stupider with them.

1462
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,720
That's really a fun idea.

1463
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,400
You gotta go to space.

1464
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,240
Because I really like this maze but I was like oh it didn't feel like it built as much

1465
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,960
in a way that I wanted it to.

1466
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,960
Okay.

1467
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,560
And then I was like oh you know what you could have done.

1468
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,560
That's really fun.

1469
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,920
Yeah like a slasher in space or whatever.

1470
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,520
Yeah or any of the dumb like seventh sequels for any horror movie.

1471
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:30,160
This was a good I think I do like this one more than Dark Ride which I never I don't

1472
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,800
know if you remember that one.

1473
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,000
I went to Knotts two years ago.

1474
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah it would have been there.

1475
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It was probably there.

1476
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,480
I'm sure I had a blast.

1477
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,480
There were clowns.

1478
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,480
Nasty clowns.

1479
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,480
Yeah.

1480
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,480
Yeah.

1481
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,480
And it was a good one.

1482
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,480
Clowns are awful.

1483
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,480
It wasn't my favorite one.

1484
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,480
Yeah.

1485
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,600
But yeah so there were what else was there?

1486
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,320
So there were a couple that were from two years ago that I just loved.

1487
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,320
Waxworks.

1488
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,320
Oh yeah.

1489
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Incredible.

1490
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,360
Waxworks maybe is the most unnerving one.

1491
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,840
Because there are like you know like there's an evil we've looked we've said this name

1492
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,800
before now I have to look it up.

1493
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:14,480
The evil like wax man who like makes weird humans like half human half wax things.

1494
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,480
Wax man Jack baby.

1495
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,480
Wax.

1496
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
It's eaten up.

1497
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,960
And there's like vats of wax.

1498
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
And you get little dripping.

1499
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,320
You feel very much like I can't touch this hot hot wax.

1500
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Yes.

1501
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,560
If I touch this it's going to burn me.

1502
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,080
I love that one.

1503
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,320
It is so incredible.

1504
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,840
And once again like the detail is so nuts in there.

1505
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,680
And that's all body horror to me is still like the scary maybe the scariest horror like

1506
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,280
movie wise.

1507
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,400
Like the first Hellraiser one is just like.

1508
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Oh my god.

1509
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
Both the first two.

1510
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:56,480
Just like the skin is ripped off and you're like that is too realistic and too scary.

1511
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,440
But Waxworks gives me that feeling where you're just like seeing either it's a dummy or it's

1512
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:08,800
a person in makeup and you're still like I don't want to get hot wax on my face.

1513
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,040
Some of the other stuff I'm like okay I'm not going to be turned into like a fish man.

1514
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
Right.

1515
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,080
I'm not that worried about that but I am worried about.

1516
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,640
But like a freak like turning me into a wax figure or a mannequin.

1517
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,200
Have you seen the movie tourist trap.

1518
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
No.

1519
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
No.

1520
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
No.

1521
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,840
It's from like late 70s or early 80s.

1522
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,040
It's awesome.

1523
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,040
That's all I'll say.

1524
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,040
It's streaming on places.

1525
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,040
Check it out.

1526
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,040
I don't want to spoil it.

1527
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
From 79 it looks oh boy.

1528
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,040
It's a blast.

1529
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,040
It's wild.

1530
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,800
I think for it's two years old or three years old Mesmer I really like.

1531
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,800
Which is the.

1532
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,800
Loved Mesmer.

1533
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,880
I had the elephants farting right.

1534
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,880
Yes.

1535
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,880
Yes.

1536
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880
The farting is happening.

1537
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,880
Oh Justin brought this up right.

1538
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
This is the elephant fart.

1539
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
Yeah.

1540
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,360
You walk into a I guess elephant stall or whatever and it starts like at first I didn't

1541
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,960
even see the big elephant butts but they're like little clown dudes who are like kind

1542
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,120
of farting towards you and be like smell it.

1543
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,800
And then you continue walking and there are these two huge elephant butts and their little

1544
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,800
tails are flapping from farts and then another clown keeps going like smell it.

1545
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Smell it.

1546
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
And then this guy's like OK.

1547
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,800
Smell it dude.

1548
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,800
What does it smell like in there.

1549
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,800
It doesn't smell like shit.

1550
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
No yeah.

1551
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
That would be too fucked up.

1552
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
Too much.

1553
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Elephant farts smell nice like peanuts.

1554
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
Yeah.

1555
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
Is it like dirt.

1556
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,800
I'm trying to remember.

1557
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,800
I think it is kind of more just dirt like.

1558
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,800
Yeah.

1559
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
Like kind of stinky stall but not poo poo.

1560
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,800
I wonder.

1561
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,800
I think it's like a little bit of a smelly smell.

1562
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
Yeah.

1563
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,800
It's like a little bit of a smelly smell.

1564
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,800
It's like a little bit of a smelly smell.

1565
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
It's like a little bit of a smelly smell.

1566
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,800
It's like a little bit of a smelly smell.

1567
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,800
It's like stinky stall but not poo poo.

1568
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,800
I wonder.

1569
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,800
OK OK.

1570
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
You know.

1571
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,800
So Savannah.

1572
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,800
Because there's fart smell in the Minions Rite Universal.

1573
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
Oh yes.

1574
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,800
Oh my god there it is.

1575
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,800
Fart gun.

1576
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,680
So there maybe is some manufacturer that does smell fart smell for theme parks.

1577
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,040
I'm sure.

1578
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,040
So I don't know what they're.

1579
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,160
There must be and that calibration has got to be tough.

1580
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,960
What's a like handleable fart.

1581
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,760
You don't want it to be so toxic.

1582
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,760
They had to.

1583
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,760
Sulfury.

1584
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,760
Right.

1585
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,040
You want just a classic traditional that passes very quickly.

1586
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,040
Yeah.

1587
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,280
Pass fast.

1588
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,280
Yeah.

1589
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,280
Pass fast.

1590
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,280
They had to test it.

1591
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,280
You know they had to test it.

1592
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Yeah they had to.

1593
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,280
For weeks and months.

1594
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
I'm the fart tester.

1595
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,280
I make sure the farts aren't too intense.

1596
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,280
It's nice work if you can get it.

1597
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,280
You know what it is.

1598
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,280
Worst jobs that could be doing.

1599
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,280
Sample one made me puke.

1600
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,280
Right down puke.

1601
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,280
This one just made me fart a lot.

1602
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,280
I don't know what that means.

1603
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,280
Is that good or bad?

1604
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,280
It's not good.

1605
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,280
It's not good.

1606
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,280
It's not good.

1607
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,280
It's not good.

1608
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
It's not good.

1609
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,280
It's not good.

1610
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,280
It's not good.

1611
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,280
It's not good.

1612
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,280
It's not good.

1613
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,280
It's not good.

1614
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,280
It's not good.

1615
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,520
Is that good or bad?

1616
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
You want to use my farts?

1617
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Okay.

1618
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,720
I'll get a jar behind them.

1619
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,720
I'll jar them up for you free of charge.

1620
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,720
There you go huh?

1621
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,720
Keep hiring me please.

1622
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,720
I think this works.

1623
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,720
Please I need this.

1624
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,720
Do I get residuals for my fart smell being used in perpetuity?

1625
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,040
Every time it's used please.

1626
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,640
Tiger wants to use AI farts and that ain't right.

1627
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,480
I'm going on strike unless I get...

1628
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,440
You can tell when they're fake farts.

1629
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,120
When they're artificial intelligence farts.

1630
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,880
I'm willing to go to the park and do them live.

1631
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,880
Do them live.

1632
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,040
In the FDG Fart Doers Guild.

1633
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:19,240
You get me and my two buddies, you put a funnel up behind us and we'll do it all night.

1634
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,240
We don't care.

1635
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,240
We got you covered.

1636
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,240
Don't worry about it.

1637
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,240
Don't worry about it.

1638
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,880
We can't let AI take our jobs.

1639
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,080
Just eat us the leftover Presmac and cheese.

1640
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,120
That should get us going.

1641
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,600
You can get a three pack it looks like on Temu, that website that sprung up overnight

1642
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,080
and became suspiciously popular.

1643
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
It did?

1644
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,640
A different spray bot.

1645
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:51,360
This is like Shine where it's just drop shipping junk.

1646
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,600
These scents are smell from hell, toxic bomb and stinky ass.

1647
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,600
Stinky ass.

1648
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,080
Okay, we got to order that.

1649
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,080
Jason order them.

1650
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,080
Fart tasting.

1651
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,080
Send them to your apartment, Jason.

1652
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,880
That's for on cast next year.

1653
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,080
A little fart tasting menu for all of us.

1654
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Very nice.

1655
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,480
Can you guess what now?

1656
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,600
I think this one, I'm going to call this one a stinky ass.

1657
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,280
That doesn't seem like a bomb because I wouldn't call it a bomb.

1658
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,080
Just a general stink.

1659
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,680
A day to day stink you could live with.

1660
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,960
Disappointed by smell from hell was expecting more.

1661
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,680
When you use hell to describe something it's gotta be fucked up.

1662
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,680
It's got to be big.

1663
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
It's got to be big.

1664
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,680
It's got to be big.

1665
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
It's got to be big.

1666
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,680
Yeah.

1667
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,680
This didn't get me.

1668
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,040
So they have a play, the one called the Chilling Chambers, which is new.

1669
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,040
Which one is that one?

1670
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,360
That's the one that's a best of essentially Halloween mazes.

1671
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Yes, that ruled.

1672
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,780
It had a lot of cool doll stuff.

1673
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,160
There was, okay so we talked about this recently, there's like a plot what I would call a plush

1674
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,600
pile as fixed to the wall.

1675
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,840
Did you say ooh to the phrase plush pile?

1676
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,840
Yeah, that's so gross.

1677
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,840
Okay, because that's what-

1678
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,840
It's so gross.

1679
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,440
That's what Justin Marissa determined last week.

1680
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:13,000
Maybe I've made this phrase up plush pile and then Marissa said it sounded like a vagina,

1681
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,400
which is not how I intended it.

1682
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,400
Marissa!

1683
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,400
You dirty dog!

1684
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,120
No, she said that with a microphone in front of her.

1685
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,120
What does it make you think of that's so gross?

1686
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,760
Just nasty, like nasty old stuffed animal.

1687
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,160
Yeah, okay so you're thinking literally it's just kind of gross to you because you've imagined

1688
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,680
them all being like 30 years old on the drive.

1689
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,680
Eww, yeah!

1690
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,680
Dirty plush.

1691
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,120
Where you're just like what's going on with these man?

1692
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,800
You have like a really cursed birch or something?

1693
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,800
Ernie.

1694
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,800
Ernie.

1695
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,800
I have an Ernie from when I was-

1696
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,800
A cursed one?

1697
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,600
Well, he's from when I was a kid and his crotch has been ripped open and his eyeballs have

1698
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,480
fallen off and his ears are ripped and his hair is patchy and I still have him, he's

1699
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,480
still hanging out.

1700
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,080
I guess he's cursed but I don't-

1701
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,200
People were, when we posted it online people were pretty scared of him.

1702
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,000
I can see why you would be scared of him but I look at him and I just feel pure love.

1703
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,640
And that's all you can do?

1704
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,720
Yeah, but I guess he's cursed, yeah.

1705
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,720
He's casually cursed.

1706
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,720
He can still love someone who is cursed.

1707
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,800
That was a really fun one.

1708
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,440
Yes, and I was, because sometimes it's not always apparent what the lore of it is, so

1709
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:25,160
I was reading about it and there's a Keep the Keeper character that exists in this maze.

1710
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Oh wow.

1711
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,160
Right.

1712
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,840
Yeah, and the Keeper is the Keeper of Haunt History at Nott's.

1713
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,120
I feel Justin was explaining this to me.

1714
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,160
He's like, okay.

1715
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,480
So the Keeper's Cathedral, which is where we walked into that looked like kind of a

1716
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,000
church, is where all the mazes go once they're done.

1717
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,160
Right, because there were like graveyards and stuff with all of the different mazes.

1718
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,520
You saw names of like, they were shouting out old mazes as well but then they would

1719
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,640
go in a few of the highlights from over the years, which was great because obviously we

1720
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,080
didn't get to do these throughout the years.

1721
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,080
Right.

1722
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,240
They should have, but there's one that has the plush wall, there's one that's like,

1723
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,120
almost felt like Blade Runner.

1724
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,880
You're waiting outside to get inside a neon bar looking thing and there's like loud music

1725
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,880
playing.

1726
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,640
There's like a lady dancing in a cage.

1727
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,720
Yeah, and then you go by like a weird like bar top.

1728
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,800
And the whole, like the vibe, the switching vibe really was fun to see like all the old

1729
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
stuff.

1730
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,240
And I was like, oh, these mazes are even better than the ones they have now.

1731
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,240
Yes.

1732
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,240
I was like, I wish I had seen.

1733
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,240
They seem so cool.

1734
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,600
So I do wonder, because there's not such great documentation.

1735
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,560
I was like, I wonder if they like almost plussed up the way these are.

1736
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,560
Right.

1737
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,720
Or if this is just how they were back in the day.

1738
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,200
Obviously they didn't save the wall.

1739
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,800
They didn't save the plush pile, I assume.

1740
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,800
Plush pile wall.

1741
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,480
But it was a fresh one.

1742
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,480
Fresh plush pile.

1743
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,480
Nothing like a fresh plush pile.

1744
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,480
Fresh plush pile.

1745
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,880
Let's do a play now, everybody.

1746
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,200
The mazes that were from the 90s and 2000s, so I guess they were newer, but we went through

1747
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:04,640
the underground, which I believe is the club, the carnival of carnivorous clowns, lore of

1748
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,920
the vampire, and then the doll factory.

1749
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,920
The doll factory.

1750
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,520
That part really messed me up.

1751
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,360
If you like haunted dolls or don't, that one will mess you up.

1752
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,360
Did you know you can buy haunted dolls on eBay and Etsy?

1753
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:24,480
And the people selling them will have a big description of the spirit that's in them.

1754
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:30,000
And it's very fun if you're ever bored and want to see haunted dolls.

1755
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,360
It's so fun.

1756
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,920
Because Robert the haunted doll is in a museum.

1757
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,480
Are you a Robert fan?

1758
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,480
A Robert fan.

1759
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,960
So you have the haunted doll.

1760
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,960
Sure.

1761
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,400
Sure.

1762
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,120
If I were to ever go see him, I would not take a picture.

1763
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,720
I do think of the ice rift.

1764
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,720
It'd be shitty.

1765
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,400
You can ask him, though.

1766
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,920
The words you can say, excuse me, Robert, can I take a photo of you?

1767
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,920
I don't even think I want to talk to him.

1768
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,480
I think I'd be like, there he is.

1769
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,480
Okay, I'm going to get out of here.

1770
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,480
I would say hello.

1771
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,480
I'd be polite.

1772
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,480
You got to be polite.

1773
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
And then I would move on.

1774
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,480
Yeah, yeah.

1775
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,480
Give him his space.

1776
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,480
Good to see you, Robert.

1777
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,960
What would you think would happen if Jason showed up dressed as Robert and met Robert

1778
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,440
and didn't say anything?

1779
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,840
Oh my God.

1780
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,640
Because Robert is wearing a little sailor suit.

1781
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,640
Right.

1782
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,640
Oh.

1783
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,240
So if Jason showed up and like kind of silently made fun of Robert in the case.

1784
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,240
No!

1785
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
It would be a tribute.

1786
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,440
I feel like at minimum my flight is getting canceled on the way back.

1787
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,440
That's what Kirstie puts on you.

1788
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,440
Just a little convenience.

1789
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,160
But the rental car is probably exploding.

1790
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,160
Robert strikes again.

1791
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,040
There's a delay on Delta flight 1213.

1792
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,440
Well, and that was the last flight of the day.

1793
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,040
So I have to wait.

1794
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,000
And now you sit down with your sailor suit on.

1795
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,840
Hulu's charging two dollars more a month.

1796
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,840
Robert strikes again.

1797
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,840
Robert.

1798
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,840
Robert.

1799
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
How dare you, Robert?

1800
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,240
I haven't finished killing Eve, Robert, and you know that.

1801
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,040
Do they hook up or not?

1802
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,040
Yeah.

1803
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,440
Or kill each other.

1804
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,040
Or kill each other.

1805
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,560
The end of the doll one is like there's a moving floor that makes it feel like a doll

1806
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,560
is holding.

1807
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,560
Yes.

1808
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,560
Yeah.

1809
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,560
You basically.

1810
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,560
Yes.

1811
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,560
Which is pretty crazy.

1812
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,560
It was so cool.

1813
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,560
Yeah.

1814
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,720
And then yeah, you leave through the graveyard so you see other names of mazes throughout

1815
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,720
the years.

1816
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,040
That one was maybe my favorite actually of the year.

1817
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,720
It was really cool.

1818
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:26,800
And it wasn't, that one wasn't as maybe scary as Waxworks or anything, but I just love it.

1819
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
I love the history.

1820
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
It was just so fun.

1821
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
Yeah.

1822
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,800
Love the history.

1823
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:38,920
I told Justin I was coming on to do Not Scary and he was so like, oh, I want to talk about

1824
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,920
it because he loves it.

1825
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,920
Oh, no.

1826
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,920
He loves it.

1827
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,560
He's reading a book about the history of it.

1828
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
We should have had him on again too.

1829
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,560
I know.

1830
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,560
I was like, come do it with me, man.

1831
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,560
We put him in the Purge box.

1832
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,560
Let's call it next year.

1833
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,560
Justin, that's a message from me to you.

1834
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,560
Yeah, I think next year be like, let Justin go.

1835
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,560
We'll celebrate its 50th anniversary, plus one.

1836
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,560
Plus one.

1837
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,560
That's big.

1838
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,560
It's big.

1839
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
50th anniversary.

1840
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,560
50th anniversary.

1841
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,560
50th anniversary.

1842
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,560
50th anniversary.

1843
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,320
That's big.

1844
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,320
It's big.

1845
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,320
51th.

1846
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,320
Yeah, yeah.

1847
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,320
Don't sleep on 51.

1848
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,320
I really enjoyed, and this was there two years ago when I went also, the depths.

1849
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,320
Yes.

1850
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,320
Yeah.

1851
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,320
And that huge creatures.

1852
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,320
Yeah.

1853
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,320
These gentlemen toured the depths with the light on.

1854
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,320
We toured the depths with the lights on and it was very interesting.

1855
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,320
Cool.

1856
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,320
It was very interesting.

1857
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,320
It was interesting how they did everything.

1858
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,320
Informative.

1859
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,240
I don't understand how they do it.

1860
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,240
It's so cool.

1861
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,240
Yeah.

1862
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:31,280
I've said this probably 10 times already, but just the effect of the laser with the

1863
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:36,280
fog where you have the characters coming through above the fog, if it's water or a swamp or

1864
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,280
something.

1865
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,240
The first time that I ever saw that was at Queen Mary, Dark Harbor.

1866
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,240
Oh, okay.

1867
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,240
And it blew my mind.

1868
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,880
It was like a swamp haunt or whatever, and the whole way through you're walking through

1869
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,440
this green fog.

1870
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,440
It was so cool.

1871
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,440
Oh, wow.

1872
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,240
Dude, people popping up from it and then going back down.

1873
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,240
You're like, where'd they go?

1874
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,240
It rules.

1875
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,240
Geez.

1876
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:03,280
Man, they aren't doing any laser ocean this year.

1877
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,760
So you're not going to get that if you go to Shackatobos.

1878
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,760
Damn it, Shack.

1879
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

1880
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,760
Come on.

1881
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,760
You drop the ball on that one.

1882
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
Hey, there we go.

1883
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,560
But they do have, but if you do want Captain Shack's special rum punch.

1884
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,520
So you got to weigh it.

1885
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,560
No laser fog, but you do get special rum punch.

1886
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,880
I do want Captain Shack's rum punch.

1887
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,800
It's confusing because it can be a regular shot of just Captain Morgan or it's a shot

1888
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,320
of Captain Morgan and Grenadine, but it's loud in there and you can't hear.

1889
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,360
And you can only take one.

1890
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,480
And they call it a chaser even though it's not just a chaser, it's a mix shot.

1891
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,480
Oh, boy.

1892
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,480
I'm so confused.

1893
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,480
It was an accidental escape room because I thought I'd never leave.

1894
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,320
I thought we'd be discussing the logic of the shots all night.

1895
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,880
Scott tried to take two of them and they're like, no, no, no, stop, the curse.

1896
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,880
Really?

1897
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,880
Robert.

1898
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,560
Yeah, because we paid an extra amount of money to get the shot before the maze.

1899
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,560
Yeah.

1900
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,480
But we thought it was a real bar, but it's actually a tiny room in a maze.

1901
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Yes.

1902
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,400
If you wanted, you need Captain's combo to do the.

1903
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,040
That would happen with in Dark Harbor where there would be secret mazes.

1904
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,040
Oh, okay.

1905
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,080
Or I mean secret bars within the maze.

1906
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,080
Right.

1907
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,080
Okay.

1908
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,080
And it was always, it was fun.

1909
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,640
And yeah, sometimes just like all we have is a shot of something nasty.

1910
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,640
And you're like, okay.

1911
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,640
Yeah, all right, all right.

1912
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,640
I paid extra.

1913
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,640
What choice do I have?

1914
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,400
Betsy, it's 1130.

1915
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,400
Oh shit.

1916
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,400
You want to wrap it up?

1917
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,400
Okay.

1918
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,400
I should wrap it up.

1919
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,400
Yeah.

1920
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,400
Take us to the door.

1921
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,400
Sure.

1922
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,400
I mean, not scary.

1923
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,000
I remember for years hearing people being like, it's the best.

1924
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,760
It's the best haunt you could go to.

1925
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,360
And I was like, I don't know, Horror Nights is pretty fun.

1926
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,160
And then I went two years ago for the first time and I was like, yes, this is the best

1927
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,160
haunt.

1928
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,160
Yeah.

1929
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,160
It wins.

1930
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,160
It wins.

1931
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
It wins.

1932
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,080
It's prepared for a lot of people too, it feels like.

1933
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,400
Whereas other places, like they add more bars.

1934
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,840
They like, I don't know, they just felt ready for a big search.

1935
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,680
We also went this year early in October.

1936
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,680
Nobody was there.

1937
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
Oh, that's a good tip.

1938
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,680
That's good to know.

1939
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,680
Okay.

1940
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Yeah.

1941
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:10,120
We went on a Wednesday night and we like, we got the front of line passes, but we totally

1942
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,120
didn't need them.

1943
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,120
Right.

1944
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,120
But it's still a rule to walk on.

1945
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,080
But like, I think the longest line was 15 minutes maybe.

1946
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,080
Geez.

1947
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,080
Great.

1948
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,080
Yeah.

1949
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,080
That's great.

1950
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,080
Well, they're pros.

1951
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,080
They've been at it for 50 wonderful years.

1952
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,080
They have what's up.

1953
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,520
Rightfully wonderful years.

1954
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,800
They've given us so much great live entertainment.

1955
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
Uh huh.

1956
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,800
Oh, you know it baby.

1957
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,800
Oh yeah baby.

1958
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,960
I'd be there if I could, if I was still alive, you know I'd be jamming out with the Jedus

1959
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,400
and R.T. Beep Beep and all of them.

1960
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,800
He does though in fact know Jar Jar Binks.

1961
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,800
Jar Jar Binks is my favorite.

1962
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,800
I love the Gungan city.

1963
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Ceboba, I know him.

1964
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
Bossing ass.

1965
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Went to college with Ceboba.

1966
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Some things are sacred.

1967
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,800
I don't mess those up.

1968
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,800
So yeah, it's still, yeah, of the major ones, it still is my favorite too.

1969
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,800
Yeah.

1970
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,800
So yeah, I'm waiting for somebody, something to beat it or universal to beat it.

1971
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,800
I don't think it's happening.

1972
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,800
I don't think it's happening either.

1973
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,800
They're in practice.

1974
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,800
I don't think it's ever going to happen.

1975
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,800
They're the best in the biz.

1976
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,800
You know who else is the best in the biz?

1977
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,800
Bootsy DeSarro who has survived Haunt Cast the Fright.

1978
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,800
So happy you could do this.

1979
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,800
Thank you for having me.

1980
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
So glad you came.

1981
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,800
Let's exit through the crypt shop.

1982
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1983
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:37,800
Yeah, right now, Mano Gappin and I, we have a spooky podcast that's happening every Friday

1984
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,800

You can get it anywhere.

1987
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,800
And we've been improvising, we improvised four horror movies with a bunch of our friends.

1988
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,800
So every Friday a new one's released.

Spookiest day Friday.

1992
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,800

Fright live spooktacular at Dynasty Typewriter.

1998
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,800
That's in Los Angeles.

1999
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Two shows, two totally different topics.

2000
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,800
If you're not in town, we're doing the live stream.

2001
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,800
We'll have video of it.

2002
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,800
We'll be in costumes.

2003
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,800
There will be much to see, fun shows in general.

2004
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,800
What will we be?

2005
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,800
Will Jason be Robert the doll?

2006
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
You'll have to watch and find out.

2007
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Oh, maybe.

2008
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,800
Can you find a sailor suit in time?

2009
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,800
I've already ordered so many items.

2010
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Hmm.

2011
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
