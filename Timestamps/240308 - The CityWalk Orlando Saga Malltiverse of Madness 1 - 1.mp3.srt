1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,960
Forever…

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,620
…

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,620
dog.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,300
There was a boy, a boy like any other boy, who loved to romp and play.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,780
Until one fateful day and one fateful play in the dancing fountains at Universal City Walk Hollywood.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,860
As his parents departed to put in their names at Bubba Gump, the boy got a staph infection, and he died.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,060
He remained in a permanent limbo state without hope until the year of our Lord 2018.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,800
It was then that he encountered three brave podcasters.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,380
They, and only they, could set his spirit free by reviewing every store and restaurant at City Walk.

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,380
These heroes were known as Mike, Scott, and Jason.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,900
Their ghostly friend, the Sector Keeper.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,200
Their trials and tribulations were captured in a tidy, 19-part podcast series simply titled,

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,000
The City Walk Saga, that you can go back and listen to right now if you scroll through Podcast The Ride's back catalogue.

14
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,220
Now, with a terrible cosmic rift sowing galactic chaos, the Sector Keeper has again called upon the heroes three

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,260
to face a challenge beyond their comprehension.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,460
Yes, the boys have conquered a single Algonquin Mall.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,720
But will they be any match for…

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,460
The Multiverse!

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
When your town has made you frown

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,480
When your square has made you swear

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,980
When life gives you one more punch

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,480
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Crunch

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,680
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,700
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Where seam-punk robots sell chocolate snacks

26
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,700
A place where you can tattoo your lower back

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,840
So let's go take a walk

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,540
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,140
Podcast The Ride presents, The City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness.

30
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,160
A daily, infinite, extremely necessary series, exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,500
that make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,060
Welcome to Podcast The Ride presents, The City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness.

33
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,140
My god, we've made it.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,280
After all this time, we've made it.

35
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm Scott Gerdner.

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,240
Mike Carlson has made it as well.

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,360
I made it here.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm standing, I'm looking at the top of a mountain, a beautiful mountain full of very familiar places and some not so familiar.

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,300
You're right, a number of extremely familiar, perhaps covered once before, perhaps covered several times before.

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,520
Yeah, perhaps, and maybe will be covered for many years.

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:25,200
Doesn't it make it the biggest challenge in a way to have to cover certain somewhat bland establishments for going on the fourth or fifth time?

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,920
It wouldn't be a saga without Jason Sheridan.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,720
That's right.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,980
It feels like home, you know?

45
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,280
Not just being back in the saga, but City Walk Orlando holds a special place in my heart.

46
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,220
Yeah, this one, no chore for you.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,340
This is not a big, nothing about this is like, I have to go spend a bunch of time at City Walk Orlando.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,940
No, if anything, got a new appreciation.

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,640
When Jason goes to these places, he doesn't say, Chewy, we're home.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,480
He says, Chewing, we're home.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,360
Because he's excited to chew on all the different treats that he could, that he has an option to.

52
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,120
He speaks to an act.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,120
Anything to get that Cheshire grin back on Mike's face, you know?

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,100
That's his famous, that's the phrase.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,060
He said it to me, there's a GIF of Jason and I like Chewy and Han, and he says it, and you just write it.

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,560
You're going to have to film that.

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,820
We didn't do it there, but we'll do it in front of a green serene.

59
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,600
We'll make it seem like you're in Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom, and he's going to start chewing on some plantains.

60
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah, so here we are, and we're going to start explaining what we're doing, but there's an empty fourth chair.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,200
There's a chair that is not filled, and we can't really do this.

62
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,720
We might have to just cut and stop and not use what we're doing right now, unless we're able to get really the presence who we all know.

63
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,440
We can't fully do a daily multi-part saga without.

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,880
There's no set way to summon this being, but I did have an idea, something that I think might work.

65
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,800
There's a sacred old phrase that means something to us that was a part of the last time we did one of these daily mall-focused sagas.

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,800
I got a feeling, I got a hunch that if we were to say it three times altogether, that maybe who we need might appear.

67
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,700
I'll kick it off, and you guys join me.

68
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,520
Okay, Basin is now Sanuk.

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,740
Basin is now Sanuk.

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Boys, boys, chewing, I'm home.

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Wow.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:58,100
Here he is for the first time for an extended sit-down in our physical presence.

73
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,060
In ghostly form, yeah.

74
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,740
For the first time in four years, over four years, the Sector Keeper.

75
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh, feels good to be back.

76
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,380
I'm back.

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,600
Oh, wow.

78
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,420
He's got a great, he's got his usual toot.

79
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,560
Yeah, that's right.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,820
How are you boys?

81
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,900
How are you?

82
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,020
Oh, fine.

83
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,780
I mean, we feel refreshed from going to the City Walk Orlando.

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,520
Yes, yes, yes.

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,100
It's a little, as we said, a little different.

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Of course, of course.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm feeling fine, I think.

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah, yeah.

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,060
You know, there's kind of a more vacation vibe, too.

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,280
You know, it's very like, it's picturesque, it's scenic.

91
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:45,840
You know, there's kind of a breezier feel almost, and I'm almost at this point, like this might be, this juncture, it feels like a little easier potentially than City Walk.

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,420
Less like annoying, mundane.

93
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,260
Wouldn't you say, Jason?

94
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,300
I would say so.

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I mean, there's all that extra greenery and wateries, too.

96
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,580
This is like a couple of clubs and restaurants.

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,060
I think, I actually, I feel like we're, this might be in a way like a little bit of a simpler endeavor than the previous City Walk Saga.

98
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,120
Uh, uh, uh.

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,220
I'm sorry to say, Orlando simplicity is nothing but smoke and mirrors, boys.

100
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,020
It's nothing but Orlando magic, like the name of the basketball team.

101
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,480
It's Orlando magic.

102
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,820
It's Shaq, Dennis Scott, all of our favorite Orlando magic players.

103
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,540
Dennis Scott.

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Horace Grant briefly, after he left the Bulls and he wore blue goggles instead of red.

105
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,460
Yeah, it felt weird.

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,440
It felt weird.

107
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,500
You kept up with your stats, you kept getting your Sports Illustrated delivered to you for kids, even though you weren't even in limbo.

108
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,100
Yeah.

109
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,400
I remember there was a Sports Illustrated issue that said a kid beats Scottie Pippen one on one in horse.

110
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,240
What?

111
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,580
I always doubted that, but we're off track, sorry.

112
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,760
I always doubted that.

113
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,280
That's fine.

114
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:04,060
I don't know, maybe something like, and I don't know exactly what we're getting up to here, but maybe there's some way that we can, you know, whatever shackles you're currently dealing with, maybe there's a way that we can free you, get you to go play a game on horse with Scottie Pippen.

115
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,700
Yes, yes.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:13,260
Well, you know, like you said, it seems like Orlando is a simple place, but in fact, beneath that simplicity is something much more complex.

117
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,840
Orlando is very much a hub.

118
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,060
Oh, really?

119
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,340
Of the city walks that unite us all.

120
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,280
Okay.

121
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:30,100
You refer to this sort of multiverse, these many malls that make up the universe of city walks.

122
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,780
There's Universal City Walk, obviously, here in Los Angeles.

123
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,300
Right.

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,820
City Walk in Orlando.

125
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,460
Yeah.

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,420
You want to name all the other ones too?

127
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,840
You know, there's a…

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh no, he's getting weak.

129
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,340
I won't make him do that.

130
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,340
Japan, Japan.

131
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,240
There's one in Japan.

132
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,460
There's one in Japan.

133
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,840
Osaka, yeah.

134
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,240
There's one in Japan as well.

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
Thank you, Jason.

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,880
And so, I just want to let you know that you're not embarking on a simple journey.

137
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,540
This is going to be the most difficult one yet.

138
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,160
Because there is a rift in the multiverse.

139
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,000
And that's all I can say at this moment.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,400
Oh, well…

141
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,100
Unless you need me to say more.

142
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,460
Oh, I mean, I wouldn't mind hearing more.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,420
What are we doing here?

144
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,400
We have to fix a rift, but we don't get to know what the rift is?

145
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,120
Well, I mean, it's how you usually fix things.

146
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,640
I need you to cover all of City Walk Orlando.

147
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,260
Right.

148
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,780
So, like, we rate it and review.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,060
We rate it, we review it.

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,100
Talk about our experiences in different ways.

151
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,620
Experiences, yes.

152
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay.

153
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,340
And don't skip any of it.

154
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,100
No skipping any of it.

155
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,300
All the sectors must be covered.

156
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,560
Well, but, like, I mean, okay, some of the things, you know, we went there, we spent a sizable amount of time there.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,000
Some of the things are like a little, you know, it's like something we could go to down the street.

158
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,980
Do we have to have done everything there in order for this to lose rift?

159
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,600
Everything, every square foot.

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,860
What feels thinner is actually thicker.

161
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,400
Oh, okay.

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,820
So that's opposite too.

163
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,360
It, like, expands out, like, dimensionally.

164
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,680
Just like the sign at Cinnabon says, what feels thinner is actually thicker.

165
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,360
They're icing.

166
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,760
Oh, right.

167
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,500
That's the way that they've justified watering down their thick layers of icing.

168
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,260
Deceptively thin looking icing from Cinnabon.

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Yeah.

170
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,640
Okay.

171
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,860
Well, we should have known we were in for some fucking shit.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,220
So I'm just interested, I'm interested to know because, like, Orlando, so.

173
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
And I'm growing weak because of the rift.

174
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,220
Oh, no.

175
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,700
Okay.

176
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,040
All right.

177
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,520
Okay.

178
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,460
Well, I mean.

179
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,540
I'm just, this is a, it's like, you know how multiverse is like there's so many infinite number of worlds and options.

180
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,240
I didn't realize that we traveled essentially to part of the multiverse.

181
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,340
I just thought it was another mall that was built after this mall out here was.

182
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
It's a hub, damn it.

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,340
Okay.

184
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,600
How much any time is left?

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,280
I'm so sorry.

186
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm just, I just really.

187
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,520
It's a hub.

188
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,220
I'm just trying to wrap my head around it that it's such a, that it's sort of important.

189
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Think of all the sectors within it.

190
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:07,440
And then those sectors also have gates and those gates have doors and those doorways lead to portals and there's jump points.

191
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,660
Right.

192
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,800
So it's like when like.

193
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,400
Wait, wait, whoa.

194
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,040
Jump points.

195
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm writing it down, actually.

196
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,300
Oh, it's a lot of terms.

197
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,460
Sectors, gate, portals and jump points.

198
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,180
Yes, Scott.

199
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,940
I sent you a Google Doc.

200
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,700
Go to the.

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Yeah, no.

202
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,360
We're all shared.

203
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,860
These are long.

204
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh my God.

205
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,820
These are long, long definitions.

206
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,200
You've written like quantum physics theory here.

207
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,700
You're going to have to boil it down for us.

208
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,720
So what like jump points is like a way to like get from hub to hub in the multiverse?

209
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,160
That's right.

210
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,740
That's right.

211
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Well, I'll be your guide through it, but I'm also who you need to help as always.

212
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,960
So, you know, I'm guiding you, but I also need your help.

213
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,900
You know what I mean?

214
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,540
Yeah.

215
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:53,340
Yeah, that dramatic archetype where the kind of the victim of the story is also the Obi Wan.

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:53,940
Yes.

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,280
Yes.

218
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
It's like Obi Wan was.

219
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,400
And Princess Leia are the same.

220
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,060
Yeah, he was ill.

221
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,520
Right.

222
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,440
And he needed help.

223
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,880
He needed.

224
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,640
He was.

225
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
He needed help.

226
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,660
You're like if they took every Star Wars character and mushed them all up into one.

227
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,320
That's the.

228
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,560
That's how what a great character you are and what quality you bring to a narrative.

229
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,480
I couldn't have put it better.

230
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
It's like with the Yoda death scene, right?

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Yoda's dying, but he's also guiding.

232
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,240
Right.

233
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,300
He is dying and guiding at the same time.

234
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,560
Yeah, that's true.

235
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,040
Well, thank God you don't have some like complicated backwards way of speaking because you've just delivered a lot of complication to what we're doing already.

236
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,100
So we have to OK, we have to call it.

237
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,100
We have to solve a rift.

238
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,660
We have to do it by reviewing everything at CityWalk Orlando.

239
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,040
There's going to be sectors, gates, portals and jump points.

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,380
Right.

241
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,200
So we got to be aware.

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,780
And those might yank us.

243
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,320
What like to other places or something?

244
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,600
Phases.

245
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh, in phase?

246
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,620
Phases.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,220
OK.

248
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,160
But it's still sectors though.

249
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
Yes, of course.

250
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,560
Of course.

251
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,580
I'm the sector keeper.

252
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,340
Of course.

253
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:58,800
OK.

254
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,500
Yes.

255
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,600
It would have to be sectors, but also then the sectors are they're grouped into phases.

256
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,680
Yes, that's right.

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,280
That's right.

258
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,320
And phases.

259
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,520
And is there is is there a way to know when a phase is done?

260
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Is that like one of the things you listed?

261
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,740
Yes, yes.

262
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,220
You'll know.

263
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,840
You'll know when a phase will feel it.

264
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,780
You'll feel it.

265
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,600
It will feel like the universe, like the multiverse will kind of make us have like a warm feeling

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,100
in our bellies.

267
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,840
Like a warmth.

268
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,000
It'll feel like you're waking up on Christmas morning or having your first kiss or on the

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,680
same day, eating your first Cinnabon on Christmas morning.

270
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
All in the same morning.

271
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,920
Wow.

272
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,340
What a morning.

273
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,860
Jason might be the only person here whose first Cinnabon and first kiss gave him the

274
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,440
same feeling.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,360
Well, yeah, I'd lay it over the counter and give the like a little friendly pack like,

276
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,520
thank you.

277
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,600
Thank you.

278
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,800
This 13 year old is going to be very happy.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,780
Ah, Cinnabon and an RC Cola.

280
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,900
Jason's like Richard Dawson from the Family Feud at Cinnabon.

281
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,900
Double kisses on every boy.

282
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,900
But it's sweet.

283
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,580
It's charming.

284
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,160
It's sweet.

285
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
What a modern reference.

286
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,480
All right.

287
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,700
We got Richard Dawson.

288
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
We got jump points.

289
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,860
We got a lot to look forward to here.

290
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,600
All right.

291
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
Well, I feel like-

292
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,620
And don't forget about the rift.

293
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,400
Okay, and the rift.

294
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,620
We know, yeah.

295
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,360
The rift figured out.

296
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,100
Because that's what's making me grow weak and weary.

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
Oh, okay.

298
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,080
I know, I know.

299
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaking of weak and weariness though, one thing, I mean, we haven't done this altogether.

300
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,020
It's been over four years since the Downtown Disney ordeal.

301
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,300
We first met, you know, we've known each other now, Sector Keeper, for five and a half years.

302
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,820
Yeah, wow.

303
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,200
That's when the City Walk Saga original was-

304
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,040
Human years?

305
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,620
Yes, our Earth years.

306
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,260
I guess it's different for you having been in kind of a pretty free limbo.

307
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,980
Every year for you is an eternity for me.

308
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,680
Oh my God.

309
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,860
So five and a half eternities then?

310
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,920
Five and a half eternities, yes, that's right.

311
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,800
That's right.

312
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,560
And wait, and also there's a thing here where like, I get fuzzy on, it's been a long time,

313
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,080
but we save you and we set your spirit free and it seems like every time you just fall

314
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,700
back into, if I remember correctly, we checked in with you, we did like, let's let this cat

315
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,280
out of the bag if the audience doesn't know.

316
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:28,580
There was a secret Sector 20 of the original Universal Hollywood Saga, which we disguised,

317
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,180
we called it Universal Cruise Line as you helped us play a little fun joke.

318
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,440
Yes, that's a little naughty joke.

319
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,360
And in that one you were still with Cricket Wireless, but then you were like, you were

320
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,260
on some kind of like compound, you were like, there was like a, it was a corporate retreat,

321
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,600
but it felt more like a cult.

322
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,020
And like, is that in the rear view?

323
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,220
You're not going to care from that?

324
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,760
That's technically in the rear view.

325
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,680
I can't say much because I did sign an NDA.

326
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,420
So you're just back in regular society now, you're just hanging out basically?

327
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,380
Yeah, I'm re-assimilating, yeah.

328
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:08,240
And I try to, we try to unionize at Cricket Wireless, but they put the, I stopped that

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,940
out, so, but I won the Powerball.

330
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,620
Whoa, what?

331
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,660
You won the Powerball?

332
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,140
You know, one of the billion dollar Powerballs?

333
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,900
Yeah.

334
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Did you make billion dollars?

335
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,480
Yeah, I hit billion a couple times in the past few years.

336
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,700
But you didn't win a billion.

337
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
No, well, after taxes, no.

338
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
Oh, okay.

339
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,760
You did the, you hit the big Powerball.

340
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,440
I hit one of the big Powerballs, yeah, yeah.

341
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
And we're helping you?

342
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,140
Well, you know, you quote one of our good friends, you know, you had enough money to

343
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,420
buy Miami, but you piss it away so fast.

344
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,540
No, we're never meant to last.

345
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,160
Who are you quoting there?

346
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,420
Jimmy Buffett from Piper, oh, okay.

347
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,860
A Piper that looks at 40.

348
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,580
Mike knew what I was talking about.

349
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,700
Yeah, it took a second, I figured it out.

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
It took a second for Mike.

351
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,160
You know, you come in on money and then suddenly you're looking at your phone and you're getting

352
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,580
a call from, you know, Hoboken, New Jersey, and you're answering and suddenly the domain

353
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,680
keeper's calling, and you haven't talked to him in 20 years, but he's coming out of the

354
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,180
woodwork and…

355
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,940
Everyone's gone.

356
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:27,720
Wait, we met a bunch of your cousins and stuff the last time, all these other keepers, so

357
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,500
they've all like…

358
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:29,980
Mooches.

359
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,900
They all jumped on, oh my God.

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,580
They're mooches.

361
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,740
That's disgusting.

362
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,620
Not all of them, not all of them.

363
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,260
I don't want to throw everyone, but yeah, there was some mooching, so…

364
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,900
Yeah, that American Dream Mall, always having money troubles, I'm sure.

365
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,680
Are you propping it up?

366
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,340
Yes, and so, yeah, pretty much.

367
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,600
Okay.

368
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,880
Oh, so you're giving all these people, all these ghosts and keepers money, right?

369
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,080
Yeah, it's hard to say no.

370
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Oh, so you probably don't even have much.

371
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,540
No, I don't have much left.

372
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,440
Does anyone have a lighter?

373
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,460
A lighter?

374
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,820
For cigarettes?

375
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,240
Whoa.

376
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
Like a lighter?

377
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,840
I don't know, he switched his cigarettes?

378
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,060
Oh, jeez, that indicates some stress.

379
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,080
You were juuling last time with these cigarettes.

380
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,280
No, I'm rolling my own now.

381
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,960
You're rolling cigarettes, not joints?

382
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,020
Just tobacco.

383
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,880
Spliffs, baby.

384
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh, you have a little tin of tobacco there.

385
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay.

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,880
I was going to say, you stink.

387
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,760
That was one thing, when you appeared, I didn't want to say anything.

388
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,940
Just tobacco and stems and seeds for you, huh?

389
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,880
Yeah, well Jason has a cigarette once in a while, so you maybe could light up with him.

390
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,240
We'll bring one next time, if you don't have one now.

391
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,700
Yeah, there's the long parliaments, you know, Jane accidentally bought, I'm still coming through.

392
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Oh yeah, on the trip, Jason's preferred cigarette is big, long parliaments.

393
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,540
Like Cruella de Vil.

394
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,400
Not intentionally, but…

395
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
Like Virginia Slims?

396
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, sort of.

397
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,780
How long?

398
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,740
Like too much, too much for one to smoke.

399
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,080
You just showed like three times.

400
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,780
I caught a fish this day.

401
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,100
Even with the recessed filter, it's too long, you know.

402
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,120
Taking in between bites of Cinnabon, taking a big, long hit of a three foot cigarette.

403
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,500
That's in the park.

404
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,380
That's in the park.

405
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,200
In the smoke zone?

406
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,380
Yeah, in the smoke zone.

407
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,540
And a port entry.

408
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,440
That's in the park, so thank god we don't have to review the smoking areas.

409
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,120
They're not part of what we have to do.

410
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:27,800
This is crazy though, that we, like, the last one was entirely about, we had to go rescue all of your friends and cousins or brothers or whatever they were.

411
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,940
And then there were so many.

412
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,260
You only said one, and then there were so many.

413
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,620
Now you see why the money went so quick.

414
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,560
Your family is, we should have known when we heard you had so many relatives that they're all like,

415
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:48,180
You have like a, just like a gigantic, I don't want to say this, but like backwoodsy family that all needs stuff out of you now that you've hit it rich?

416
00:19:48,300 --> 00:20:00,660
Yeah, they just came a call in and you know, a little here, a little there, and you know, you buy, you know, whatever the guy is that watches over the Gurney Mall and,

417
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
Oh, Gurney Keeper, yeah.

418
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,660
The goddamn Gurney, goddamn Gurney Keeper, and then he's got a dozen kids and he's,

419
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,780
Oh yeah, I didn't even think that they all have families.

420
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,100
Stay in your guest house.

421
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,500
You lit up a second cigarette when you already had one in your mouth.

422
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,640
Yeah, I did too.

423
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,780
I think you're just like really frazzled.

424
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh, that's really a sad sound.

425
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
That's a sad exhale.

426
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,700
Uh oh.

427
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,820
Is he, is he, well, like he's always been ill, but this might be ill the way like people are ill.

428
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,460
Yeah, this is this the toll of anxiety and stress and the world's the weary, world weariness is what I feel like is happening.

429
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,280
That's right.

430
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,900
So, you know, that's why I went as soon as I knew something was a foot.

431
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:53,620
I almost feel like all this turmoil, you know, it's, you know, it's playing into the journey you're about to go on.

432
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:01,280
It's like maybe why I, you know, when you started saying Mason is Sanuk, I realized like this is the right time, man.

433
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
Like I need my, I need my boys.

434
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,620
Uh huh.

435
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah.

436
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,740
And Sanuk is now California soul.

437
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,620
Oh, wow.

438
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,400
We missed the last, yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,980
Of course.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
Well, we missed the final part of the prayer.

441
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,920
Maybe we need to say that towards the end or.

442
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,240
Mm hmm.

443
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,200
You knew you had to come.

444
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,680
But what I'm wondering now is like, okay, because I was thinking at the top, initially I'm like, maybe we can get through this in like a breezy, like a,

445
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,560
like a 12 day, 13 day.

446
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,220
Oh, right, right.

447
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,460
Okay.

448
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,240
I don't want to accuse.

449
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,100
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying this.

450
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:38,140
Someone might accuse you of like, did you come in and give us a bunch of like new rules and other stuff to do just to like have somewhere to be?

451
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,720
Because you're stressed and sick of your family.

452
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,020
Oh, I am.

453
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,000
No, like I'm just like coming to like, I'm hanging out and like.

454
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,500
Like you're giving us a bunch of work and then it's, it gives you an excuse to show up and hang out.

455
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,360
Just sit up and hang out and like.

456
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,460
Yeah.

457
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:52,900
Mm hmm.

458
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,920
No, no, I mean I brought pizza, man.

459
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,660
So that was cool.

460
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh, sweet.

461
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh, okay.

462
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,560
You have a.

463
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,460
Oh, then you know what?

464
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,560
All is forgiven then.

465
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,320
You do have like a big suitcase full of clothes as well.

466
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,140
Ghost clothes.

467
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
In my ghost suitcase?

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,360
Yeah.

469
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,520
If I can see through it, that's why I know what's in there.

470
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:08,880
Yeah.

471
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,700
Yeah.

472
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah.

473
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,700
Can I, can I crash here tonight?

474
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,420
In my garage?

475
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,680
Well, maybe like if you guys like, you know, split, split me up, right?

476
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,460
Like I'll stay with you on Sundays.

477
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,300
I thought you meant like your arm would go with me and then your legs would go with Jason.

478
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,180
Well, the thing is, you know, I get to like, catch you up on things like Mike and I've had children since last.

479
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,640
Oh, that's awesome.

480
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,760
But Jason, Jason has just moved to a new place and I don't really, I think you got like an office, but an office can really work.

481
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
Jason would be perfect actually.

482
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,400
Yeah, but you know, I got a lot of health stuff going on right now.

483
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,140
So I don't know if I'm exactly right.

484
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,760
Yeah, but don't you want a buddy though?

485
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,900
I think it really, really helped by.

486
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,320
Hang on, hang on.

487
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,340
I'm not going to impose.

488
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,620
I'm not going to impose.

489
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,880
I'll stay with Scott Saturdays and Sundays.

490
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Okay.

491
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,720
Stay with Jason's Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesday afternoon.

492
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,060
Jason will drop me off at Mike's.

493
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,080
Mike, hey man, you know, it's be around.

494
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,100
I'll hang out with Lindsay and the baby.

495
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,980
All right.

496
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,900
All right.

497
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,040
When I'm not there, you're going to be hanging out?

498
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,760
Yeah, of course.

499
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,260
It's like, what's the thought into this?

500
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,260
I'll hang out with Lindsay through Friday and with Mike and then Mike Friday evening,

501
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,960
maybe Saturday morning.

502
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
You'll do another drop at Scott's.

503
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah.

504
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,240
You don't got to be there, man.

505
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,660
I'll hang out there and the baby.

506
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,060
All right.

507
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,440
It's cool.

508
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,000
We're all green.

509
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,980
So I can get like childcare out of it potentially.

510
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,260
Actually, I prefer if your son watched me.

511
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,040
I mean, he's gotten his faculties about.

512
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,140
He's pretty together.

513
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,840
He's a pretty mature kid at this point.

514
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,400
Okay.

515
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,860
Cool.

516
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,020
Cool.

517
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,400
So yeah, I mean, I'm pretty.

518
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,800
You're going to start going for electrical outlets.

519
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,660
I don't know whether there's the portals or something.

520
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,100
You need to travel between them.

521
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,440
Hey, that's an idea.

522
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,200
That's pretty cool.

523
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:51,940
Outlets.

524
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,720
That's another way.

525
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Outlets, portals, gates.

526
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

527
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,620
Okay.

528
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,240
So, all right.

529
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,800
Well, we'll figure out this arrangement.

530
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,940
Well, maybe we'll divvy up, you know, who gets that third night or whatever.

531
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,420
So what you're saying is not only are we for many days in a row.

532
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,180
I don't think we've defined how many days.

533
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,100
I'm a little nervous to ask.

534
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,340
But for however long this goes, we have to do all these records.

535
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,520
We're also going to be all living together.

536
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,340
That's right.

537
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,380
Okay.

538
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,860
That sounds kind of phony, put it that way, right?

539
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,700
Yeah.

540
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,500
Like a big, what's the lock-in, like the high school and everybody.

541
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,100
Oh, right.

542
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,320
Yeah.

543
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,900
They would do that too if your parents paid a little extra.

544
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:38,860
Yeah.

545
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,280
I think it was official.

546
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,680
I didn't mean to say it was like a thing.

547
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,080
No, no, of course.

548
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,680
You'd like slip the guy some cash.

549
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah, they'd slip a little cash.

550
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,560
And he'd give you the keys.

551
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,040
Or you had a friend that went to church and you act like you liked church for a weekend

552
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,220
so you could go with him.

553
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,920
Oh, yeah.

554
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,680
Yeah, sure.

555
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,100
Sure.

556
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,820
I hear that.

557
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,240
The church was going to Discovery Zone.

558
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
Little suburban understandings.

559
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah, so cool.

560
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,800
Little suburban understandings.

561
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,400
Little suburban understandings.

562
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,340
Your rap name.

563
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,920
So.

564
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,840
It's a piece in the neighborhood, not fake.

565
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,580
Yeah.

566
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,260
Yeah.

567
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,560
A Cinnabon opened on the nearest block.

568
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,980
I can't put down that block.

569
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,840
I was in shock.

570
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,360
They had Cinnabons and I couldn't miss, leaned over the counter and I gave them a kiss.

571
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,640
Yeah, a little kiss.

572
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,920
Doesn't do aggressive.

573
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,920
I think I could get us started.

574
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,740
Yeah.

575
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,160
I have an artifact.

576
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,720
Mm-hmm.

577
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,480
Oh, okay.

578
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,920
About CityWalk Orlando.

579
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,020
It's like, Cheebrie, you kind of seem like down bad, so maybe this will make you feel

580
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,600
a little better.

581
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,160
Oh my God.

582
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
An artifact?

583
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,040
Yes, yes.

584
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
This gives me strength.

585
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,980
Now, I knew this would come because I went back in my eBay purchases.

586
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,460
Okay.

587
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
I bought this in November 2020.

588
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,520
Yeah, it's a while ago.

589
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,760
So, this is, well, how to set this up.

590
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:14,220
This is an 8x10 glossy photo of a press photo of CityWalk concept art.

591
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,780
What?

592
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,260
Wow.

593
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
Oh my God.

594
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,800
I think it's from a press kit.

595
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,100
Oh, this could be a real guide as we get into kind of the nitty-gritty, the big picture

596
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,500
stuff about CityWalk Orlando.

597
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,620
This is the first maybe worthwhile thing said so far.

598
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,680
You're looking for information, sure, but I didn't want to know what's up with us and

599
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,020
our sleeping information as well.

600
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,720
Do you want me to read the info?

601
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,760
You tell us.

602
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,840
You're the only one who knows what's on there.

603
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,340
I'm sure it's said it's a watercolor.

604
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:01,180
So, this is a photograph of a watercolor of about what the one corner of CityWalk Orlando

605
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,940
looks like.

606
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,600
I mean, it looks maybe a little nicer.

607
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,800
Concept art gives me strength.

608
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,880
Concept art gives me strength.

609
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,300
Oh, wow, you're like the colors coming back into your face when you see that.

610
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,520
Yeah, they might look like my suitcase is becoming more corporeal.

611
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh, yeah, and I can't see your clothes as well.

612
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,360
They're not kind of falling apart.

613
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,540
I'm feeling a little better.

614
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,220
Go ahead, Jason.

615
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,040
OK, Orlando, Florida, scheduled to open in late 1998.

616
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,460
That didn't happen.

617
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
It opened in February 1999.

618
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,440

Emerald's Restaurant Orlando, Fallen Brother, NASCAR Cafe, Fallen Brother, a 20 seat, 5,000

625
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,800
seat Universal Cineplex Cinemas offering the cutting edge in projection and sound systems.

626
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,940
But not the cutting edge of posters.

627
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
I would say the same posters they had when they opened.

628
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,900
We'll get into it.

629
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:32,060
The world's largest Hard Rock Cafe and Hard Rock Live, their first dedicated live concert

630
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,380
venue.

631
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,900
Additionally, Hard Rock has recently teamed up with the National Basketball Association

632
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:45,160
to create the first other NBA themed restaurant which will premiere at CityWalk in early 1999.

633
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,780
Wow.

634
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,020
Fallen Brother as well?

635
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,300
Yeah, Fallen Brother as well.

636
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,140
I was going to say, boy, that's an exciting little press release.

637
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,080
It might whet your appetite for what we're going to talk about in this series, but most

638
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
of it has closed.

639
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,900
We went and we did what they have there now today.

640
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,300
I think something that bears mentioning is that when we first did the CityWalk Hollywood

641
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,840
Saga, the very first saga five and a half years ago, CityWalk Hollywood was at the time

642
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,920
of the former Jason and I were living less than 10 minutes away.

643
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,320
Mike had to hoof it.

644
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,420
Mike had to do an entire 16 or 17 minutes drive to get up there.

645
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,700
This time, you know, in downtown Disney, we went a little further.

646
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,040
That's an hour away or so.

647
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,260
This time, for the first time, we traveled across the country to gather the contents

648
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,160
for a daily podcast mall oriented series.

649
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,680
I believe that we are the only people ever to travel across the nation just to go to

650
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,780
CityWalk Orlando.

651
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,760
And I think that when the series is over, we will also we will remain the only people

652
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
who will ever do that.

653
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,280
Yeah, we should get like a presidential medal of freedom or something for that kind of

654
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,940
dedication to what we're doing to our jobs and our livelihood.

655
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,540
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't know.

657
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,500
Maybe you could fool Biden into thinking that's the kind of thing you should give a medal

658
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,840
for.

659
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,740
Maybe get the right somebody get in the right advisor's ear.

660
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,700
Folks, Smoketown Cafe.

661
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,660
Friend of the show.

662
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Friend of the show, Anthony Gio.

663
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,040
And I always talk about how if we just hang out in the lobby of a D.

664
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,240
C.

665
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,280
bar, we could be

666
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
working for Biden within three months.

667
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,480
It would not be.

668
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm dead serious.

669
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,180
Young go getters.

670
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,140
Yeah, there would be.

671
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,620
I truly I could do it in three months.

672
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,280
I swear.

673
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,220
Three months, a quarter of an eternity.

674
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,120
It would be exactly your quarter of an eternity.

675
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,760
I so Jason, that was some very good back story just a little since this is the first one

676
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,600
to kick us in a little bit and then and then we can find out what what our sector and I

677
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
guess phase are today.

678
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:06,200
This is kind of a crucial part of the big expansion that Universal Orlando did in the

679
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,020
When Universal Orlando opened, it was one theme park, a great theme park, an innovative

680
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,620
theme park, but just a theme park.

681
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,640
It wasn't a resort.

682
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,980
And it's really what do you need to make a resort?

683
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
You need hotels.

684
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,460
In this case, you need a vast series of interconnected waterways.

685
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,460
And then you need a shopping and dining and retail destination where you can drink and

686
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,360
dance the night away.

687
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,240
That's right.

688
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:36,180
And you know, it felt like a throwback to the old city walk saga because the heart of

689
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,160
the city was like, oh, I'm going to be there in 10 minutes away by boat from like Sapphire

690
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,680
Falls or Aventura.

691
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,680
This is true.

692
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,740
It was very relaxed in the in the getting there day to day, moment to moment, getting

693
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,180
there in general involved Mike missing a flight and I fucked up my toe.

694
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,900
There was a lot.

695
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,020
It's already been we started at a deficit, I would say.

696
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,380
But we went we did it and we found so much fantastic stuff to do.

697
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,640
And I guess with that, you should tell us.

698
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,380
Wow, this will this will take us back.

699
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,880
Tell us what our sector assignment is today.

700
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,200
Boys, boys, we're back, baby.

701
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:29,500
It's phase one, sector one, Universal Studios Store, Jason Cinnabon.

702
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,240
Quiet flight, quiet flight surf shop rolls off the tongue.

703
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,460
Yeah, you got it.

704
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,500
You know you love it.

705
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
And Coke icon.

706
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,780
Boys, boys, please complete this phase and sector and good luck, boys.

707
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,160
Can do.

708
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,880
Thank you.

709
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,840
Off to the races.

710
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,200
You might also bear mention that way.

711
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,040
You said February 4th, 1999 was the opening of this.

712
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,520
So we're not far, I guess, from the 25th anniversary.

713
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,440
This this really lined up very nicely.

714
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,100
This is when we're on an auspicious occasion that everyone across the nation is celebrating.

715
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,080
Yeah, celebrate with our sidewalk brothers.

716
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,940
It's been down there.

717
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,400
We've been Bob Marley spirit.

718
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
We tribute freedom every day.

719
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,200
He's been on the cow fish in front of the cow fish.

720
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,360
American innovation led to the combination of burgers and sushi.

721
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,560
That's the spirit we can never lose sight of.

722
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,960
Well, he's got to do it soon if he hasn't.

723
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,800
It also opens as part of when the resort was renamed Universal Studios Escape.

724
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:33,800
Yes.

725
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,700
This bizarre.

726
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,220
That is one of the weirdest things they decided on.

727
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,020
Yes, I like the logo.

728
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,980
I got some pins.

729
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,800
Yellow words.

730
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,220
Yeah.

731
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,080
And blue.

732
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:50,880
I look around the time of me buying vintage press photos.

733
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,980
I was also buying vintage like escape pinsets.

734
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,200
OK, so specifically of the escape.

735
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,980
It's like one escape, one Island of Adventure, one city walk logo.

736
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,840
So that was like your Taylor Swift era.

737
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,320
It's the universal era.

738
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,860
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,000
Jason's escape era.

740
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,660
Yeah, that was the escape era.

741
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,360
I was trying to escape my house, so I was buying theme park merchandise.

742
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,780
That was the marketing.

743
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,720
The marketing was escape your horrible life and come here.

744
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,100
They didn't know Universal didn't know how bad the world would get.

745
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,360
Yeah, from February to March, you can only do the one park and city walk.

746
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,320
Islands isn't ready till May.

747
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh, is that right?

748
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,820
Oh, what an awkward time.

749
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,800
That's odd.

750
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,280
Yeah, their way of announcing like how Disney has more than one thing to do, they call it a resort.

751
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,280
Universal was like, we got a new theme park.

752
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,840
What are we going to do?

753
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,100
Let's call it escape.

754
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:56,700
This single move confused the public so much that Islands of Adventure was considered somewhat of a disappointment when it opened.

755
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,580
Naming your hotel escape was not a slam dunk.

756
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,720
Well, no, the hotels had additional names and they didn't even open all at the same time.

757
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,960
Escape noun, a collection of hotels and retail districts and theme parks.

758
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,460
That's what one escape is.

759
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,440
I don't think they called it an escape or the escape, just escape.

760
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,660
No articles for that.

761
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,160
What a strange time.

762
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,820
And we'll at some point delve a little back into like some of the things that they did have when this place opened.

763
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:40,400
But the first assignment, I believe, was the hey, where better to start than with the basics with Universal Studios store, the big store with over 2000 items.

764
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,780
That is all things that you maybe forgot to get while you were in the theme park.

765
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,400
So more you didn't pay for theme park admission so you can get it there.

766
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,980
Or you didn't go to the little tiny store at the very turnstiles when you are leaving each park.

767
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,570
You missed seven opportunities.

768
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,340
This is your your opportunity.

769
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,360
Did you guys spend any quality time in Universal Studios store?

770
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:05,900
Sure.

771
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,440
I did.

772
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,580
Yeah, I have another artifact.

773
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,180
Jason's like Felix the cat with this magic bag.

774
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,340
I was going to say like Indiana Jones with this with the artifacts.

775
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,780
Oh, when he's going to replace the artifact with a big bag of sand.

776
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,640
Yes, Jason, Jason replaces the the idol with the hoagie.

777
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,260
Reverse, reverse.

778
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,060
He puts the idol down and takes the hoagie.

779
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,200
I put the idol down, take the hoagie.

780
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,300
Then I do the bag.

781
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,120
I grow and then I do the bag of sand because I'm like, I gotta get the idol.

782
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,760
This is by me.

783
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,540
Many hoagies.

784
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,520
OK, I have not built this yet.

785
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,840
Clear.

786
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,540
This is a 3D metal model kit of the Universal Studios Florida entrance arch.

787
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh, wow.

788
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,940
It is no no glue or solder needed.

789
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,480
Realizing you don't need to solder it with a solder it.

790
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,720
You you just pin back tabs on it, although it does show that tweezers or pliers would be helpful.

791
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
So slightly less.

792
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,980
You're going to cut up your hands.

793
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,420
I'm going to cut up my hand.

794
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,480
So I have a little bookshelf decoration.

795
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:26,780
And of course, I asked the workers, hey, do you have one of these of the Islands of Adventure lighthouse?

796
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,560
And I probably got multiple.

797
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,520
Oh, huh.

798
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,760
Yeah, we do.

799
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,020
That's weird, right?

800
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,280
We probably should.

801
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,760
And I'm like, yeah, I I agree.

802
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,640
But maybe it might be a big deal.

803
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,240
I might just complete somebody's life over here.

804
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,920
Just give me something to do that'll bring me joy.

805
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,940
So only the 25th anniversary coming up.

806
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,620
Jason, do they have what other ones do they have of that?

807
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,720
OK, they had on the globe and they had a shark.

808
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,240
The shark hoisted up.

809
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh, the shark.

810
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,300
The car.

811
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:02,860
Yeah.

812
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,460
Which I considered getting.

813
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,100
And then I thought the effigy of like a dead shark in my house.

814
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,240
That seemed like bad vibes.

815
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,500
You thought that would like summon some sort of hell spawn?

816
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,320
I mean, sector keeper could answer the question.

817
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,520
Would a effigy to a dead shark?

818
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,120
Oh, yes, that's 100 percent.

819
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,460
That's opening up a gate.

820
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,020
Yeah, it's not even the right shark.

821
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,040
It's not even jaws.

822
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,300
It's the other shark.

823
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,340
The devil loves shark effigies.

824
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,240
What really quickly, what does it say in green on there at the in the corner?

825
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
If it's not too much to.

826
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,100
Oh, yeah, I mean.

827
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,300
Oh, it says Metal Earth.

828
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,940
That's the company that makes the metal earth.

829
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,980
Is that part of the multiverse or that sounds like it?

830
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,800
It sounds like it would be like going to Metal Earth where everything's made of metal.

831
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,200
Metal Earth will be a stop.

832
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,320
I don't want to go there.

833
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,740
We might become metal.

834
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,140
We'll freeze into metal and never get to.

835
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,740
I'm following the line of is it meant to be a plan?

836
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,880
Middle Earth, you think?

837
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,280
Confusingly.

838
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,200
Jason, let me ask a question.

839
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,080
Would it be possible for you to assemble that while we're doing the podcast?

840
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,180
Well, who knows how many days we have?

841
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,600
So I can certainly get started.

842
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,380
This podcast right now?

843
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,880
Oh, right now?

844
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,460
No, I got to transfer to home and I'm going to cut off my hands for sure a little bit.

845
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
I'll tell you what, when I stay with you and Jane, we'll do it together.

846
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,380
Oh, great.

847
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,960
OK.

848
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,080
Hey, are you going to walking dogs?

849
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,080
You got that Doberman.

850
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,120
You can really help us out if you could take the dog out.

851
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,680
You actually should go with him.

852
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,020
I'll hang with Garfield, man.

853
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,920
But here's the thing.

854
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,960
Garfield's got to watch me.

855
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,040
Well, do you like to sleep?

856
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,300
Great.

857
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,480
I think you'll work out just fine.

858
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,180
So that was your big souvenir purchase from that place.

859
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,920
Yeah, from there.

860
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,020
A little arch that will be assumedly irritating to put together.

861
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,520
That's the most last minute gift I've ever seen.

862
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,920
A last minute gift for myself.

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,980
Jason puts no thought into his own gifts.

864
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,980
I didn't buy the five dollar generic chocolate bar with the meat on it.

865
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
That feels more thoughtless.

866
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,100
That is a thing they have.

867
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,020
Yeah, they'll sucker in.

868
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,260
You know what this place has is like they have this in Hollywood, too.

869
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,540
They'll be like a bunch of stuff with the old logo, with the old Neon Universal Studios logo, which I love.

870
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,980
I've bought stuff with that on it.

871
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,920
But I noticed they'll have like retro universal chocolates.

872
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,520
And you flip it around like it's just chocolates.

873
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,000
Those don't have the logo.

874
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,260
And most chocolates aren't nine dollars for no reason.

875
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,000
It's a trick.

876
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,960
Utterly generic.

877
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,620
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,880
Almost worked on me.

879
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,540
I do love the logo that much.

880
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,100
Yeah.

881
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:58,380
I mean, they've got the like the slight amount of retro stuff that is attractive to men of a certain age's eyes.

882
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,020
But, you know, it's this is the store, which is generally this is what you get.

883
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,860
Grandma, if you go to Universal.

884
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,760
Yeah, this is the sort of standard stuff.

885
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,880
Obviously, there's like more hardcore Harry Potter stuff because they've got some of the in-park merchandise here.

886
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,180
There's a big Harry Potter wing.

887
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:14,540
Yeah.

888
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,640
And it's very creative, whatever you call it.

889
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,140
I guess you say imagineered.

890
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,580
Yeah.

891
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,400
It's a Disney word.

892
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,820
But we know a better word escaped.

893
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,940
It's very escaped.

894
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,600
Yeah.

895
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,500
Yeah.

896
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,780
It escaped their brains.

897
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,500
Get away.

898
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,100
Get away.

899
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:38,460
A lot of the kind of notices across the board, a lot of the merchandise, a lot more standardized than the last time we were at Universal.

900
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,780
I feel like there's a lot of minions, a lot of Fast Furious.

901
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,940
Certainly a lot of Jurassic World.

902
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeah, that's always the shift.

903
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,160
Sometimes you go, oh, they're doing a lot more stuff for me.

904
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,560
And then a couple months later, it's all gone.

905
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,180
And it's just a thick sweatshirt in its place that just says Universal Studios.

906
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,160
Like, that's the stuff that sell.

907
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,160
Like, look, this is we're in the minority here.

908
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,940
I shouldn't be going in these places going, come on, give me something for Michael.

909
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,900
Like, give me something that I want specifically.

910
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,660
What do you want specifically?

911
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,340
Is there an item that we all would especially like any bit of universal lore?

912
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,300
They do.

913
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:20,340
In Tokyo Disney, they do have like a lot of ride vehicle toys and stuff.

914
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,160
Yeah, they're way better.

915
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,420
There's so much better about the type of thing that we would want.

916
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:32,500
So, yeah, like they don't sell a scoop, a Spider-Man scoop or something, or they don't sell like that type of thing is more what I'm looking for.

917
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Yeah, shirts like with Optimus Prime or something saying, your bravery saved the planet.

918
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,800
Like, obviously, that's specifically for me.

919
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,740
But yeah, I want more toys.

920
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:54,200
Forget about the shirt or, you know, actually do it as a shirt, but it should do it backwards that you can look at yourself in the mirror and that message is bouncing back at you.

921
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,520
You get to start every day.

922
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

923
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,760
My bravery?

924
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,020
And it's got a little cut out of like his helmet area.

925
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,700
So it looks like you're wearing it too on the mirror.

926
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:10,860
Or they should sell those like mirrors that used to be carnival game prizes that have like the designs on the outside.

927
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,400
That's kind of what I didn't know until I was a grown adult that those were very popular as cocaine mirrors.

928
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,580
What?

929
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:27,620
The ones where it's like the mirror would say like Led Zeppelin along that people would try to get it because then they could do coke off it.

930
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,140
How did you find this out?

931
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,880
I don't know.

932
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,200
I don't know.

933
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,280
I feel like I just learned about it like through osmosis.

934
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,060
Like, oh yeah.

935
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,060
So wait, wait, wait.

936
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,820
I remember these mirrors.

937
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,520
Yeah.

938
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,200
When I was very young, you would like try to win the ring toss game or pop the balloon.

939
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,260
You had like a clown wig and you look in the mirror and you had like a clown wig.

940
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,760
Is that what you're talking about?

941
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,240
No, no.

942
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,520
Like the outside would have like.

943
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,500
Oh, just a band's name.

944
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,840
Yeah, a band's name and like maybe some stripes or something.

945
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,400
Okay.

946
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,920
I looked up Led Zeppelin Coke mirror and there is a listing for that.

947
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,460
That phrase is in there and it says has that marvelous cocaine era look.

948
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,220
So a coke mirror in quotes.

949
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,020
I don't doubt that there's there's something to this.

950
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,620
I just think that it's funny that you're a kid playing carnival games.

951
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,480
You're like, I don't know, you're you're doing ring tossing as a guy next to you.

952
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,320
Like, it's like, oh, damn it, I'm out of rings already.

953
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,900
Okay, another round, another round.

954
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,500
Someone won the pink Floyd one.

955
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,200
Can I get up like 700 at a time?

956
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,240
How much is the yes one?

957
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,060
Is that the same level of the yes mirror?

958
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,780
Can I just pay out of pocket for it?

959
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,640
Can I just have the secret life of Pat's Coke mirror?

960
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,440
I'm just saying if they repurpose those old surplus mirrors,

961
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,260
you put Optimus Prime saying I'm proud of you on it.

962
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,160
There's so many old surplus mirrors sticking around.

963
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,780
Wait, you know what?

964
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,140
No, this is you know, this is completely a thing.

965
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,240
I'll give I will absolutely give you that, Jason, because now I've just found Black Sabbath Coke mirror.

966
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,100
These were usually found at carnivals.

967
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,280
So I guess the band has never heard of this.

968
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:13,540
As a kid, I was like, wow, if you like that band, you could get a mirror with their logo on it.

969
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,520
That's cool.

970
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,440
So the band aspect is what made it cool to do the Coke off the mirror.

971
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,880
The fact that the rock and roll aspect because it was rock and roll.

972
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,060
So that's probably why.

973
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,380
Universal thing.

974
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,640
No, I guess.

975
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,400
No, no.

976
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,160
The people doing it would definitely always say like, hey, you're ready to do this cocaine.

977
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,260
What are you expecting?

978
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,720
Some normal boring mirror.

979
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,360
Guess what?

980
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,100
This one's got rock and roll.

981
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,200
Yeah, then we get everyone excited.

982
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,100
My mirror that says rat.

983
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,540
My dare officer, Kevin, said, have you see a Coke mirror run?

984
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,900
Oh, wow.

985
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,640
It's probably.

986
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,740
They were still referring to it.

987
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,200
I feel like I feel like he was speaking from experience.

988
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,700
Maybe McGruff.

989
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,260
McGruff never did a commercial about that.

990
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,700
As far as I remember, McGruff never did a song about Coke mirrors.

991
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,000
No, Coke mirrors.

992
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,420
Don't don't win Coke mirrors.

993
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,880
Don't play ring toss.

994
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,580
Nothing but trickery to get paraphernalia out into the world.

995
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,980
Jump for two smaller stuffed animals instead of one Coke mirror.

996
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:29,200
Pick two of the smaller plush instead of the larger mirror for cocaine.

997
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,120
The fluffier a plush is, the less likely it is it could be used for cocaine usage.

998
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,240
Now, you could carry cocaine across state lines in the back of a plush if you cut it open, but you shouldn't do it.

999
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:47,040
And whatever you do, keep those plushes away from open flames or else this house is going up like a tinderbox.

1000
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,120
The only thing worse than Coke, your batteries, right, McGruff?

1001
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,700
Counterfeit batteries.

1002
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,500
Make sure you buy Duracell.

1003
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,420
If not, they may be just a bunch of newspaper in an outer ceramic shell.

1004
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,420
You could get fooled very easily.

1005
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,280
Plenty of artists are talking about cocaine.

1006
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,220
White lines.

1007
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,320
That song is out there.

1008
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,160
No one else is doing music about not buying counterfeit batteries.

1009
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,300
Criminals are always sculpting batteries out of Play-Doh and putting them into a 7-Eleven and making people buy them.

1010
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,980
You got to make sure they're not doing that.

1011
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,780
That common thing people do.

1012
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,260
Watch out.

1013
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,260
Re-soldering the packaging so that it can be sold.

1014
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,720
Using tweezers, tiny tweezers to construct counterfeit batteries.

1015
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,160
Metal Earth batteries.

1016
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,940
Metal Earth batteries.

1017
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,520
An approximation.

1018
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,220
A little model of a battery.

1019
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,660
Does that pretty much cover Universal Studios store?

1020
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,920
Can I ask what you guys would want?

1021
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,340
Your dream Universal.

1022
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,780
Oh yeah, I was going to say, yeah, wait.

1023
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,160
You know what?

1024
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,560
I was veering to ET Adventure.

1025
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,720
I was thinking something with Botanicus, but no, wrong.

1026
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,380
I want a little talking Steven Spielberg action figure that you press.

1027
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,680
You press his director's hat and he says, we haven't got much time, so I'll be brief.

1028
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,340
Truly.

1029
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:21,580
Scott recently sent around some pictures of, I think they're companies overseas that make these ultra realistic dolls.

1030
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,660
In fact, we talked about it on the show before.

1031
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,280
We talked about it on the show.

1032
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,460
There's a third party, somebody made a Spielberg, but it's not a licensed Spielberg.

1033
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,960
It's like Mr.

1034
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,300
Director Man, they call it that.

1035
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,580
And yeah, but you can't get it.

1036
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,740
It's sold out and it's like very hard to find.

1037
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,780
But there's new ice.

1038
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,760
There was a Michael, somebody's making a Michael Jackson and there's a video of them putting in the realistic eyeballs into the head.

1039
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,460
So I just wonder what level of realism do you want on your Steven Spielberg doll?

1040
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,500
Do you want it to be what size?

1041
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,140
Quarter scale, sixth scale, one 12th scale, which is like the normal size of an action figure.

1042
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,920
And what kind of do you want a cartoon, Steven, or do you want it as realistic as possible?

1043
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,180
I want it to look like an old Return of the Jedi when they didn't have this technology yet.

1044
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,840
This stuff creeps me out.

1045
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,220
I don't want my I don't want to see every molecule.

1046
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,060
Yeah, Michael Jackson's eyeballs.

1047
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,220
Nobody should have ever wanted to see that.

1048
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,500
So yeah, I like I like I'm like blunter and worse, less articulation, chitier, old school.

1049
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,740
And I want that voice box to sound like shit.

1050
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,060
Yeah, it won't be.

1051
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,800
It won't be him doing the voice.

1052
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,520
It'll be a higher.

1053
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,940
Yeah, his brother Jim Spielberg Spielberg Spielberg Spielberg.

1054
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,760
Recording all the lines in Cantonese or Mandarin every language.

1055
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,420
Yeah, Jason, I asked I asked the question to you, but I'm not going to let you answer.

1056
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,120
And I'm going to answer for you and see if this is correct.

1057
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:56,620
If you would do this, would you buy let's say it's a two hundred and fifty dollar really perfect recreation of sort of the open like the entrance area, the port of entry and the lighthouse.

1058
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,460
It's a really nice looking model that looks like a lot of work was put into it.

1059
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,860
It's two hundred and fifty dollars.

1060
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,900
Yeah, we consider that consider.

1061
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,720
OK, that doesn't sound like a slam dunk.

1062
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,480
I think I would.

1063
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,780
It looks great.

1064
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,500
It looks exactly like it.

1065
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,380
Yeah, I'd love some port of entry merch.

1066
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,480
All right.

1067
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,040
You can answer.

1068
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,420
I'd love more islands of adventure merch in general, because I thought it was kind of lacking.

1069
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,980
You know, would you?

1070
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,880
What if that what if you're the lighthouse that my brain will not allow me to retain the name of?

1071
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,920
If the lighthouse was that shape was fashioned into big old bong, I that's got to be a third party company.

1072
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,400
Yeah, that's a mixed director, man.

1073
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,140
I also I have no idea how to use a bong.

1074
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,680
I've never used a bong.

1075
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,620
Oh, wow.

1076
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,740
I'll show you when I stay with you.

1077
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh, OK, thanks.

1078
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,240
I guess I can see one in your see through ghost suitcase.

1079
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,680
It's a water bomb.

1080
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,840
You just drifted this whole is this whole thing.

1081
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,580
I shouldn't say that.

1082
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,100
You're our guest and I want to be nice.

1083
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,620
It's just it makes you think if you're just doing this to have a place to crash and do drugs, I'm just couch surfing.

1084
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,000
It's a little bit what it's this all this multiverse stuff.

1085
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,460
It's all gates, portals, holes, wormholes, wormholes.

1086
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,080
That was a new one.

1087
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,640
I feel like I didn't mention wormholes.

1088
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,420
Oh, there's wormholes too.

1089
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,580
Sectorkeeper, do you have a piece of a dream piece of merch from Universal?

1090
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,340
Oh, good.

1091
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,840
Let me think about what was yours.

1092
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,960
What would yours be?

1093
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,700
Oh, I was saying like sort of really good ride vehicle toys.

1094
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,060
Oh, right.

1095
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,660
The scoop.

1096
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,180
Yeah.

1097
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,500
Scoop or anything.

1098
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,300
Oh, goodness.

1099
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,060
The rip ride rocket roller coaster vehicle.

1100
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,780
I can't I know I can't think of one of the time if they said thick sweatshirts, right?

1101
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah, they have those.

1102
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,860
Okay, so they have those already.

1103
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,520
Okay.

1104
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:50,860
Yeah.

1105
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,900
And also this Universal Studios has got like a collection of the characters on it.

1106
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,380
Thicker sweatshirts.

1107
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,120
Yeah, sweatshirts.

1108
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,000
One thing to note is that.

1109
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,400
Or maybe like a Hermione Coke mirror.

1110
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,520
So she's on it.

1111
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,260
So it looks like when you're like that you're like putting your face like on her while you're doing it.

1112
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,720
Yeah.

1113
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,460
And it says like, you know, levioso, bro.

1114
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,280
Well, that's good.

1115
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,860
They're not going to make that official third party again.

1116
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,640
Third party.

1117
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,740
They'll magical magical girl multi use mirror.

1118
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,560
That's the name.

1119
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:24,680
Yeah.

1120
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:25,820
Yeah.

1121
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,380
Because, oh, yeah, they'll have one of those surplus warehouses with all the mirrors.

1122
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,780
They'll just put that on it.

1123
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,220
Slap it on there.

1124
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,820
I was going to say one thing about this, you know, like you gave us the heads up that this was coming cause we could just go go down there.

1125
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,220
Get ready because then we're going to have to explore the multiverse.

1126
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,080
You didn't go.

1127
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,320
You didn't go with us.

1128
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,100
I couldn't make it.

1129
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,480
You couldn't make it.

1130
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:55,660
It was something very, I mean, I'll probably dealing with, you know, the zone keeper or whatever it is.

1131
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:55,820
Yeah.

1132
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,320
Serving papers to the zone keeper.

1133
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,900
Serving paper?

1134
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,880
Like a restraining order or something?

1135
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm in it bad, man.

1136
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,800
Oh, man.

1137
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,080
Trying to get your family away from you.

1138
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,100
I'm just noticing now your bag looks like, is it crypto.

1139
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,500
com merch?

1140
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,960
Is it?

1141
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,140
Did you get involved in like the Sandbank been freed scandal?

1142
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,100
Big time.

1143
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,220
Were you in that polycule?

1144
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,020
I was in the polycule, but I flipped.

1145
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,500
What?

1146
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,340
What does that mean?

1147
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:30,940
I flipped, man.

1148
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,120
I'm a fucking red, man.

1149
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,800
You ratted on the polycule.

1150
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,840
I'm in it.

1151
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,380
A plea bargain, man.

1152
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,080
My God.

1153
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,280
Well, he was probably, he was after your money too then.

1154
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,920
Not only ghosts are getting after your money, but then the real world.

1155
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,000
He came in and he was like, I'm the crypto keeper and you know, and like.

1156
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,420
I'm the crypto keeper.

1157
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,880
I'm three sheets to the fucking wind, man.

1158
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,640
So he owes you.

1159
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,620
So you were open to maybe get some like.

1160
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,000
He said we're going to rename Staples Center.

1161
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,420
We're doing it all, man.

1162
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,000
That sounds legit.

1163
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,160
Yeah.

1164
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,920
There was a time where it seemed like we're still, we're going to have to live with that arena name for a long time.

1165
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,320
Bookline and sinker.

1166
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:12,640
Yeah.

1167
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,000
Geez.

1168
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,780
Did you get any like reward money for ratting out the polycule?

1169
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,380
Yeah.

1170
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,100
The reward was not going to jail.

1171
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,220
Well, that's good.

1172
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,420
I mean, that's something.

1173
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:24,640
Yeah.

1174
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,940
But hey, at least it'd be a place to crash.

1175
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,500
I don't know.

1176
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,120
Yeah.

1177
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,500
Yeah.

1178
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,820
You're guessing at a good point there.

1179
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,920
Three hots and a cot, you know.

1180
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,220
Jason stared down the barrel of jail before.

1181
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,860
I wouldn't be so bad.

1182
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,080
Jail the army.

1183
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,540
You know, the judge gives you a choice if you're young enough, you know.

1184
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,100
If I ever get wrongfully busted for one of these, for this white snake coke mirror.

1185
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:53,960
Yeah.

1186
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,440
I just, I didn't even know what I meant.

1187
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,760
I thought a white snake was cool.

1188
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,460
I was a kid.

1189
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,240
I always forget.

1190
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,720
We only can record because it's Fleet Week, right?

1191
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,420
You're in for.

1192
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,200
You're just in for a little bit, right?

1193
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,800
Well, I'm still.

1194
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,080
At ease, sir.

1195
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,360
At ease, boys.

1196
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:20,060
Sector Cuper, can you transform your body into like wearing a little navy suit for us?

1197
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,640
It matches what Jason's wearing.

1198
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,160
I know.

1199
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah.

1200
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,160
Yeah, but I got the big lolly and you don't.

1201
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,640
Yeah.

1202
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,220
My usual recording big lolly.

1203
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,960
You know that we're done.

1204
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,260
But like we need to end the episode when it's out.

1205
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,160
Yeah, when it's out.

1206
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,760
Two and a half hours.

1207
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,400
It's magic, yeah.

1208
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,640
This was, this place just moved.

1209
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,940
It was built, it was four stores before.

1210
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,980
These are our first fallen brothers, I think.

1211
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,080
They kicked all of these tenants out so that they could open a big store full of their stuff.

1212
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,200
Yes, and this used to be where the Legacy Store is now.

1213
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:01,800
Okay.

1214
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:08,280
In the time between being there and recording and releasing the Legacy Store is now a fallen brother.

1215
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,520
Oh, yeah.

1216
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,640
So Sector Cuper, I'm sure as you know, there was something called the Legacy Store.

1217
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,800
There was a bunch of like old school Universal stuff, but it's not there anymore.

1218
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,180
So we don't have to cover it now, right?

1219
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,000
No, that sounds about right.

1220
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,840
I mean, get into it a little bit.

1221
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,700
Just a little.

1222
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,160
Okay.

1223
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,380
Get into it a little bit.

1224
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,720
Oh, great.

1225
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,360
We're off the hook.

1226
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,880
Thank God.

1227
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:34,540
Okay, this place, this entire big space used to be the Island Clothing Company, respects to fallen brother.

1228
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,920
Something called PIC, which was spelled P exclamation point Q.

1229
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,400
It's a bunch of Funko Pops and shit.

1230
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,900
Fossil.

1231
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,340
We lost a fossil.

1232
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,160
This was a long fossil.

1233
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
A long fossil?

1234
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,120
Yeah, I mean, this is like a long store.

1235
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,920
Like a long cigarette.

1236
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,720
The store is very wide.

1237
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,780
Oh, that's what you're saying.

1238
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,200
They were a long time.

1239
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,340
Like it was in the spot for long.

1240
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,280
It was a long, a very narrow fossil, like a dinosaur spine.

1241
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,520
Like a dog run.

1242
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,740
Your dog could go nuts in that fossil.

1243
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,780
Yeah, up and down.

1244
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:15,880
Watches.

1245
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,480
Yeah, watch out.

1246
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,320
He's going to eat every watch.

1247
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:24,700
And then there was a store, there was something called Fresh Produce, probably a place to get vegetables, healthy snacks.

1248
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,600
No, this was a clothing store.

1249
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:31,960
I saw a listing that said that it had clothing with which came in vegetable colors.

1250
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,180
What store doesn't have vegetable colors?

1251
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,720
There was a green shirt?

1252
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:38,380
Yeah.

1253
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,980
And this brother fell.

1254
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:47,640
I guess maybe Fresh Produce was as confusing as calling a resort escape.

1255
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,640
Yeah, yeah.

1256
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,820
If you need to like Google what the store means before you go in, that's a bad sign.

1257
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,460
Yeah.

1258
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,660
So anything else?

1259
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,060
Do we move on?

1260
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,620
I think so.

1261
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,540
Wow, that is our first thing completed.

1262
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,340
Oh my God.

1263
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,080
Hey, we're breezing now.

1264
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,260
Oh my God, it's almost over.

1265
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:05,960
I think I earned this one.

1266
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,220
I'm going to light it up.

1267
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,580
Have to keep a cigarette count, a rolled cigarette count.

1268
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,600
Wait a minute.

1269
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,680
I think you, did you plan this for, because you know what, I detect a little flavor on it.

1270
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,160
I feel like I get a whiff of cinnamon.

1271
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,620
That's right.

1272
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,180
I think our next.

1273
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,100
Each of my cigarettes is themed.

1274
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,400
Wow.

1275
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,300
Wow.

1276
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:28,680
Wow.

1277
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,780
So let me.

1278
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,780
Hit that Cinnabon, boys.

1279
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,160
All right, all right.

1280
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,860
That's how you transition us.

1281
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,440
Okay, so Cinnabon, this, we're back to Cinnabon.

1282
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,160
This was part of the original one.

1283
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,880
And now we're tasked with talking about Cinnabon again.

1284
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,640
Did anybody go there?

1285
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,380
I did.

1286
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,260
You did.

1287
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,400
Yes, I did.

1288
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,400
I had an iced coffee in the morning.

1289
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:54,800
Yeah.

1290
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,080
And I said, Oh, look at these mini Cinnabons.

1291
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:57,980
There's, there's like.

1292
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,560
The sleeve.

1293
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,080
Well, they have a sleeve.

1294
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,220
Yes, they have a sleeve of Cinnabons.

1295
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,520
I said, Oh, could I purchase one?

1296
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,100
They said, no, you have to buy six.

1297
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,880
And I said, I'm not going to get them right now.

1298
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,420
What size of the.

1299
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,660
Six sleeves.

1300
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,380
No, no, six in a sleeve, essentially, or at least the sleeve I was looking at.

1301
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,640
Jason might have been looking at a different sleeve of cinnamon rolls.

1302
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,380
I ate the sleeve at Port Ventry.

1303
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,980
I did eat the sleeve.

1304
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,980
But it doesn't count.

1305
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,200
But you bought it in.

1306
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,700
You bought it in.

1307
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:24,840
You bought it in.

1308
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,520
It was an adventure.

1309
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,980
Cause there's a Cinnabon when you walk in Thailand's adventure as well.

1310
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,680
Yes, right at the end.

1311
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,460
That's not what we're talking about.

1312
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,300
It's next to the star boat.

1313
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:34,280
Jason was looking at his own sleeve where he keeps a little cinnamon one hidden.

1314
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,780
Like a card shark.

1315
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,220
You remember taxi driver when he like.

1316
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,840
He gets like a hinge.

1317
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,640
He like rigs up something to wear under his shirt so we can real quick, you know, get

1318
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,200
the hand gun slide into his hand.

1319
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,100
I did that.

1320
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,560
And I practiced.

1321
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,380
I practiced in the mirror.

1322
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,300
A Coke mirror.

1323
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,500
Yeah, a Coke mirror.

1324
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,520
You practiced it in an Oreo Speedwagon Coke mirror.

1325
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,800
The mirror might seem, say boss hit, but you just walked into hell.

1326
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,540
If you're in a store and you're stressed about a lack of Islands of Adventure metal.

1327
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,680
What is it?

1328
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,080
Yeah, it's a little metal model.

1329
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,780
Metal model.

1330
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,340
Metal Earth.

1331
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,420
Yeah, yeah.

1332
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,920
Just like, all right, getting a little stressed.

1333
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,540
Bang.

1334
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,480
Cinnamon hit.

1335
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:35,840
Yeah.

1336
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,560
So wait.

1337
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:36,980
So then.

1338
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,320
Sorry.

1339
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,660
You wanted one single cinnamon.

1340
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,540
I wanted to get a small Cinnabon.

1341
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,920
Just a small little one.

1342
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:42,840
One small.

1343
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,800
They would sell you a big full size Cinnabon, which is the size of like a dog's head, a

1344
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,200
medium sized dog's head.

1345
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,460
Oh, Mike's famous method of measurements.

1346
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,040
Like not a Great Danes head.

1347
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,560
Well, Great Danes is a smaller head, I guess.

1348
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,260
So maybe it is similar to a Great Danes head.

1349
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,460
Did you try, there was like a stand up sign.

1350
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:10,220
Did you try the breakfast sandwich with a half a Cinnabon and put sausage and egg in

1351
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,340
it?

1352
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,660
I don't think I even saw that.

1353
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:12,600
Okay.

1354
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,400
But those flavors don't fit together.

1355
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,580
Well, but I don't think it has the icing.

1356
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,580
Well, they do, they fit together.

1357
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,220
Okay, wait.

1358
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,180
Salt and sweet.

1359
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,620
Oh, okay.

1360
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,380
Without icing, yeah, I guess so.

1361
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,140
I mean, those are all things that might be on a breakfast plate.

1362
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,880
It's kind of like a McGriddle.

1363
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:28,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1364
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,280
It's a McGriddle.

1365
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,320
There you go.

1366
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,460
You got some embedded sweetness, I suppose.

1367
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,640
Oh, but the caked in chemical sweet, I don't know.

1368
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,720
I don't know about this.

1369
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,640
Yeah, I mean, it could taste good, but it's going to be gross.

1370
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,460
There's no way around that.

1371
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,160
Some aspect of it, yeah.

1372
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,620
So they denied you…

1373
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:50,020
They would not allow me to single purchase a small Cinnabon.

1374
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,580
Okay.

1375
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,620
Even if I asked nicely.

1376
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,220
But I got a sweet, they only sell like sweet coffee as well.

1377
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,980
You can't just get a regular iced coffee.

1378
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,630
It has to also contain like 200 calories.

1379
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,530
Of course, they're…

1380
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,890
They have the ingredients somewhere.

1381
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,070
The ingredients are there.

1382
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,110
They couldn't have sweet coffee if they didn't have regular coffee.

1383
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,570
If they let me behind the counter, I think I could have figured it out,

1384
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,410
but maybe it's possible it's not.

1385
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,870
Maybe it's premixed and they wouldn't know.

1386
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,610
They wouldn't let you behind the counter.

1387
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,630
They probably wouldn't.

1388
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,150
They let Jason, but not me.

1389
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,610
They know he knows what he's doing.

1390
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,690
No, I think they would have if you would have…

1391
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,030
Oh, maybe, yeah.

1392
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,750
So I had the coffee.

1393
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,790
I will say, I mean, it was a delicious dessert coffee in the morning.

1394
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,110
It was just like a vanilla sort of iced coffee.

1395
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,190
Yeah, get your 39 grams of sugar out of the way.

1396
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,890
Get it put in there before 10 a.

1397
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,050
m.

1398
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,790
Uh-huh.

1399
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,710
So I started my day one day with a Cinnabon coffee.

1400
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,850
Usually it would be like a Starbucks or Epcot.

1401
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,090
I just went to one of the kiosks.

1402
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,290
So sorry for bringing Epcot up, but…

1403
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,370
Oh.

1404
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,130
He hates theme parks.

1405
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,110
I know, I know.

1406
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,090
Just a possible mention of Joffrey's.

1407
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,090
He's shaken.

1408
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,090
Yeah, yeah.

1409
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,030
Did it have any impact on you?

1410
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,550
You felt like starting your day with a sweeter coffee?

1411
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,890
Here's what I'll say about myself just in general.

1412
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,990
I think as I age, and maybe I've brought this up before.

1413
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:19,790
I know I have, is that I do think my stomach is becoming a little less tolerant to attacking it with sugar and chemicals.

1414
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:27,310
I think that that is not as good and not as easy a cell for my stomach as I age.

1415
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:34,430
And yet I, who had this problem from the beginning of this podcast, was mocked.

1416
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,090
You are no fun.

1417
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,070
You're not a little treat boy like us, the little treat boys.

1418
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,190
Ow, my stomach.

1419
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,810
It's like there's razors in it.

1420
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,150
You didn't drink coffee for a long time.

1421
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,610
I started drinking coffee when I was about 36 years old.

1422
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,250
36 or 37.

1423
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,530
You are 37.

1424
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,170
I feel like I mistake you for 16, 17 all the time.

1425
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,010
Oh, thank you so much.

1426
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,850
You hit 36?

1427
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,290
I actually am, yeah, around 36.

1428
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,810
I thought you were a junior in high school, Ben.

1429
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,350
Hey, thank you so much for saying that.

1430
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,690
Yeah.

1431
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:11,570
He wears band t-shirts of who was popular when you were in your era of middle school.

1432
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,090
You were telling me that you thought Olivia Rodrigo and I were like peers.

1433
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:15,250
Yeah.

1434
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:17,390
So yeah, I appreciate that.

1435
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,050
But yeah, so.

1436
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:19,950
Half peers.

1437
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,410
Half peers.

1438
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:25,750
So I'm not saying I threw up.

1439
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,210
I'm not saying I had a nasty shit at CityWalk.

1440
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,350
I'm not saying any of that.

1441
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:35,130
I'm just saying right off the bat in the morning, I'm less tolerant of a crazy sugar

1442
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,190
bomb in my stomach than I used to be.

1443
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,010
I can still, as usual, can still hang.

1444
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,290
I can still go.

1445
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,370
You put a fucking cupcake in front of me.

1446
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,190
I'll eat it.

1447
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,410
Doesn't matter how big it is.

1448
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:45,950
I'll eat it.

1449
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:47,430
And I won't shit immediately.

1450
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,950
I can still handle it.

1451
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:52,510
I'll snort so much frosting off of a.

1452
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,930
I'll sprinkle sprinkles.

1453
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,590
I'll snort sprinkles.

1454
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,990
Off of a foreigner Coke mirror.

1455
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,330
Jimmy?

1456
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,050
Whatever they call it.

1457
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,650
They call them Jimmy's sometimes?

1458
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,110
Sprinkles?

1459
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:03,390
Back where I came from, it was like rainbow sprinkles and chocolate jimmies.

1460
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,410
Chocolate jimmies.

1461
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,150
That's how I knew them growing up.

1462
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:06,430
Chocolate jimmies?

1463
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:10,230
But I think it depends on what part of Pennsylvania or Jersey or New York you wear.

1464
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:14,030
Chocolate Sectorkeeper, have you ever had a cupcake sprinkled with chocolate jimmies?

1465
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,570
I can't say I have.

1466
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,730
But we only call them sprinkles.

1467
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,970
But Jason I think is the one who showed me the jimmies.

1468
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,250
And it's just sprinkles?

1469
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,470
Yeah, it's just sprinkles.

1470
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,510
Sprinkles are jimmies?

1471
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,310
Some areas of the country.

1472
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,370
Sprinkles are jimmies depending on where you live.

1473
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,250
So it's a regional thing.

1474
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,570
As usual, it's a regional thing.

1475
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,570
So yeah, I had that and I liked it.

1476
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:41,510
But it's not my preference as far as an empty stomach right away.

1477
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,690
It's not mine either.

1478
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,370
I didn't do anything from the Cinnabon.

1479
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:48,710
I brought the gift of information.

1480
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:59,690
Information such as that the recipe of the original Cinnabon recipe came from somebody named Jerelyn Brousseau who ran a restaurant in the Seattle area called Brousseau's.

1481
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:11,050
There were people who were looking to start a cinnamon bun place that would go into malls that would take down the prominent one at the time, which I think might have been called PJ Cinnamons.

1482
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,250
They had PJ Cinnamons in the crosshairs.

1483
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,210
It's time to snipe them.

1484
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:22,090
And they were looking for the most delicious Cinnabon, cinnamon bun they could find.

1485
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,590
Jerelyn Brousseau was the source.

1486
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:25,870
She is still with us.

1487
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,130
She's referred to today as the Cinnamom.

1488
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,990
And she seems very nice.

1489
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,410
Oh yeah, we call her the Cinnamommy?

1490
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:35,070
Cinnamommy.

1491
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,970
I don't want to do this to this nice person.

1492
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,170
I don't want to add creepiness to it.

1493
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:42,650
Jason's glasses are fogging up.

1494
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,210
I'm imagining a literal mommy made of cinnamon.

1495
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,070
Yeah.

1496
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,290
Not this Jerelyn.

1497
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:58,710
No, she now spends the inventor of the Cinnabon is still with us and spends her life removing landmines in Vietnam and planting trees in their place.

1498
01:06:59,730 --> 01:06:59,770
Cinnamon?

1499
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,930
That is what the Cinnamom does.

1500
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:02,970
Cinnamon trees?

1501
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,150
Cinnamon bun trees?

1502
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,450
McDonald land-esque magical cinnamon bun trees.

1503
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,350
Wow.

1504
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,110
You could just lick the bark and you'd get a sweet treat.

1505
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,590
That's nice.

1506
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,850
She's like a Jimmy Carter or something out of office.

1507
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:18,170
She's doing a lot more good even, I would say, in the world.

1508
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:19,290
That's nice.

1509
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,510
More good than Cinnabon?

1510
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:21,030
Yeah.

1511
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,290
Oh, that's interesting.

1512
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,450
And then what was the old place called?

1513
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:24,990
Cinnamon?

1514
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,030
I think it's PJ's.

1515
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,150
PJ's Cinnamons.

1516
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,450
A now defunct.

1517
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,290
I hope I'm not making that up.

1518
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,210
Oh, maybe I do.

1519
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,810
I credit myself for creativity.

1520
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,070
Have we ever said the name?

1521
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,410
TJ Cinnamons.

1522
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:38,530
Apologies.

1523
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,270
Have we ever said TJ Cinnamons on this show?

1524
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,050
I don't think.

1525
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:45,730
I am amazed that we have not come across TJ Cinnamons.

1526
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,190
Again, a regional thing, depending on where you were.

1527
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,150
Perhaps Missouri, it looks like.

1528
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:51,470
Wow.

1529
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:54,090
Your place might have been TJ Cinnamons.

1530
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:58,550
Eventually, TJ Cinnamons was bought out by Arby's, which I think killed the brand.

1531
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:59,470
Oh, wait a minute.

1532
01:07:59,610 --> 01:07:59,870
Wait.

1533
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:00,470
Hold on.

1534
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:04,550
I'm reading that Arby's locations continue to feature TJ Cinnamons.

1535
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:08,210
TJ Cinnamons is a Cinnamon Bun brand within Arby's now.

1536
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:12,270
Whoa, is TJ, is there a representation, like a character of them?

1537
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,530
No, it's just kind of like a ribbon in a circle.

1538
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:15,470
Yeah.

1539
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:22,250
So that's up to us to use our imagination to, you know, the Wonka-esque hat with a cinnamon

1540
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,710
bun swirl and a cinnamon stick cane.

1541
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:31,110
TJ Cinnamon, I feel like he is a, not a stork, because that's the Velastic Pickle stork,

1542
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,390
but he's like, let's say he is a mule of some kind.

1543
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:36,090
Yeah.

1544
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:36,950
TJ Cinnamon.

1545
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:38,130
A mule?

1546
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,190
But he's got a sash also.

1547
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,050
Yeah, yeah.

1548
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:44,050
And his saddlebags are filled with cinnamon and icing.

1549
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:44,890
Yeah.

1550
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:51,390
And he goes through, like he kind of gallops into different towns and decorates cinnamon

1551
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:51,710
buns.

1552
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,410
Like a Johnny Appleseed type.

1553
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:53,930
Yes.

1554
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,570
From coast to coast.

1555
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:56,090
Yeah.

1556
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,090
Does he sound like a friendly guy or does he just still like, bray like a mule?

1557
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:00,970
He braes.

1558
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:01,850
Yeah.

1559
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,330
He just braes.

1560
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:04,830
It's unpleasant.

1561
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:05,690
Yeah.

1562
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:06,870
He spits a bunch of cinnamon.

1563
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:07,530
That's right.

1564
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,010
He spits the frosting.

1565
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,990
It comes from him.

1566
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:13,170
He's a little too caustic to catch on nationally.

1567
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,590
The frosting is his bile.

1568
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,270
And the sprinkles and jimmies come out his rear.

1569
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,130
Batsy couldn't even say butt.

1570
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:24,970
His rear.

1571
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,050
His asshole.

1572
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,990
The mule's asshole sprays sprinkles.

1573
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:31,690
That's what I wanted to say.

1574
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,270
And that's the phrase I was looking for.

1575
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,470
The mule's asshole sprays sprinkles.

1576
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,090
And I would have accepted jimmies.

1577
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:39,150
And I think that brings us to the end of Cinnabon.

1578
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,550
Hold on.

1579
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:39,810
Hold on.

1580
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,870
Can I bring this up real quick?

1581
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,990
This is the thing that's on the wall in the Cinnabon.

1582
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:46,110
And it says, love baked into every bite.

1583
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:47,830
Well, that's nice.

1584
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:49,530
Do you like, do we like this?

1585
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:53,650
Yeah.

1586
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:57,830
I mean, you know, it brings to mind that motherly feeling of Cinnamon.

1587
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,470
Maybe that was the secret ingredient.

1588
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:04,830
Even if she didn't say it, I wish they just put it in quotes and attribute it to.

1589
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:06,570
Yeah, yeah.

1590
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,730
It would have made it feel more meaningful.

1591
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,430
What was her name?

1592
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:09,950
Jerrolyn Brousseau.

1593
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:11,390
The inventor of.

1594
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:11,810
Yeah.

1595
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,370
That's my plus up.

1596
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:14,590
Make it whether or not she said it.

1597
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,630
Just misattribute it.

1598
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:15,950
Yeah.

1599
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,590
It just makes it feel more important.

1600
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,910
I think every store should have its own mommy.

1601
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,310
Like a designated mommy.

1602
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,830
You've thought that for years.

1603
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,830
Well, yeah, every store at all.

1604
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,450
Kmart should have had designated mommies.

1605
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,350
They'd still be in business.

1606
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,310
The K mommy.

1607
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,110
The K.

1608
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,570
Yeah.

1609
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:34,810
Yeah.

1610
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,230
Yeah.

1611
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,090
So what?

1612
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,810
Like a store that sells military supplies.

1613
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,890
Yeah, for sure.

1614
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:40,530
Yes.

1615
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,950
Military military mommy.

1616
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:43,310
Yeah.

1617
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:43,950
Milla mommy.

1618
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,950
So I salute you.

1619
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:49,790
Milla mommy.

1620
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:52,830
Boys, boys, did anyone else get Cinnabon?

1621
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,650
Well, now I got it out of bounds.

1622
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,450
Jason made a big fucking mistake here and didn't buy Cinnabon in City Walk.

1623
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,390
You should have bought it there because now you can't talk about it.

1624
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:07,250
I was paying off other threads where I promised to take more advantage of Ford Adventure.

1625
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,330
You should have had both.

1626
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:10,930
I can't believe this.

1627
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,950
Only one Cinnabon sitting on his vacation.

1628
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:23,450
Well, when you summoned me and you the moment you summoned me, if you would have told me only one of the boys got a Cinnabon.

1629
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,050
And it was a coffee.

1630
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,990
I would have fell back and tipped right back into hell.

1631
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,010
That means no actual Cinnabon.

1632
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:36,210
No Cinnabons were consumed.

1633
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,270
Is there some punishment for that?

1634
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,610
Are there minus points?

1635
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:41,670
Hold on.

1636
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:49,010
Would you allow Jason to talk about the consumption of the port of entry Cinnabon?

1637
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,610
Well, does he have something up his sleeve?

1638
01:11:51,890 --> 01:12:09,010
Well, I mobile ordered from about 10 feet away and I could see the one team member mostly standing doing nothing as I was watching the progress on my phone.

1639
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:17,170
Not update and him also not make it for about 15 minutes or so.

1640
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:26,950
As opposed to if they were looking a person in the eye and felt the pressure to, I better go make the thing that that person told me with their mouth to make.

1641
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,990
I do want to say there was no line.

1642
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:40,950
And I was just trying out the app for mobile ordering and then about 15 minutes later, it did start to move and I did get the notification that it was ready.

1643
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:48,790
So when it says like baking up cinnamon goodness, that isn't them putting all 15 minutes of putting love in it.

1644
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,610
Mommy is saying every mommy is kissing every little cinnamon bun.

1645
01:12:52,610 --> 01:13:07,090
But look, I eventually got it and it was delicious, you know, and I feel like we were eating it at the fake rock work, you know, in the smoking section and we kept like reaching in and it was like a never ending.

1646
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,390
I guess there was probably six.

1647
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:17,090
How about a remake of rear window where Jason watches the Cinnabon employee make his Cinnabon over the course of an hour?

1648
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,070
I'm not getting anywhere near it.

1649
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,190
Just standing there.

1650
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,330
You'll be packing it full of sin of goodness.

1651
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,590
He's really not giving me all the all the icing I need.

1652
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:36,790
I got to tell the police.

1653
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,750
The chain still in Starbucks.

1654
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,330
She's been in there a while.

1655
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,930
I sent her over there to investigate.

1656
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,230
They're going to smother her in frosting.

1657
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,730
Dear God, I don't know how much batteries left in this scooter.

1658
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,490
Oh, permitted.

1659
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:56,990
That gave me strength.

1660
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,650
Yeah.

1661
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,290
All right.

1662
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,490
Great.

1663
01:13:58,710 --> 01:13:59,110
You know what?

1664
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,510
Then I'm glad you asked light up another cig.

1665
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:12,510
This should taste like an ocean breeze because boys, it's time for quiet flight surf shot.

1666
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,450
Oh, man.

1667
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:18,330
I'm so glad that was another cigarette flavor that does have a flavor.

1668
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,070
Eventually, we're going to hit a wall.

1669
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:20,650
Sure.

1670
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,730
It's kind of a stretch, but that one's great.

1671
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,850
Oh, I do smell the ocean breeze.

1672
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:27,710
We're here at Quiet Flight Surf Shop.

1673
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:28,070
Why?

1674
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:41,450
This is a place where you can stock up on beach and skate essentials from brands like Quiet Flight, Billabong, Vans, Quicksilver, Roxy, Ray-Ban, Oakley, Billabong, and or choose from an awesome assortment of surfboards and skateboards.

1675
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,570
That might that might tap it out for me.

1676
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,930
Gentlemen, Quiet Flight Surf Shop thoughts.

1677
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:48,370
We walked through it.

1678
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,490
Yeah, we did.

1679
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:49,590
We did.

1680
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,910
We looked around at the shorts.

1681
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:51,450
Mm hmm.

1682
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,850
This felt like Billabong.

1683
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,130
Everything's very expensive.

1684
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,610
It's not.

1685
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,270
Keep in mind, it's not Billabong.

1686
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,690
Billabong is at City Walk Hollywood.

1687
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,090
Yeah.

1688
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:01,430
Quiet Flight Surf Shop at Orlando.

1689
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,670
Don't get them mixed up.

1690
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,950
Skate shop, surf shop, kind of a go to for these outdoor malls.

1691
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:07,250
Yes.

1692
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:12,110
And to get the tweens and getting the parents credit cards because those are MSRP.

1693
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,610
You know, those are suggested prices.

1694
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:15,910
You know, what do you mean?

1695
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:19,250
You're not getting many clearance items in skate shops.

1696
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:22,110
You know, you're paying a lot for those board shorts.

1697
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,330
MSRP stands for what again?

1698
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,770
Manufacturers suggested retail price.

1699
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:28,210
Right.

1700
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:28,750
Got it.

1701
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:32,230
So you're getting that for the $50 recommended from the retailer.

1702
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:36,970
It's not like a Ross or a TJ Maxx where they've got that stuff on discount now.

1703
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,270
Yeah.

1704
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,590
You're getting a $50 pair of shorts for $10.

1705
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,010
Right, right.

1706
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,770
Like that's their souvenir for the trip.

1707
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:44,610
There's a pair of shorts.

1708
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,630
They don't want any stupid million stuff.

1709
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:47,570
Yeah.

1710
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,950
Or a full surfboard.

1711
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:53,070
That was a question I had is if you can buy a surfboard at City Walk and walk out of there.

1712
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:53,350
Yeah.

1713
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,990
And go on to the water.

1714
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,230
Go right there.

1715
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:57,790
What was the answer?

1716
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:58,370
Surf past some boats.

1717
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,990
What was the answer?

1718
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:00,470
I can't tell exactly.

1719
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:07,130
If you can imagine nobody's documenting this surf shop too well, including myself.

1720
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,170
I was there.

1721
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:08,850
I was there.

1722
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:09,490
I saw it.

1723
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:10,350
I looked at it.

1724
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,850
We saw every short.

1725
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:13,310
Every short there was.

1726
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:15,930
But I can't tell you if you can buy surfboards there.

1727
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:22,070
I did read a review that was mad that said, as this should be a family-friendly place,

1728
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,990
a couple of the staff looked red-eyed and out of it.

1729
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:28,450
I certainly hope that random drug tests are performed.

1730
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:29,530
Oh, wow.

1731
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,470
That's harsh, man.

1732
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:36,370
Various skate and surf shops are always drug testing the employees.

1733
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:39,930
To make sure the vibe remains chill.

1734
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:42,790
Yeah, it's a very important job, though, so I agree with that.

1735
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,970
They're selling those things that Bart Simpson ride.

1736
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:48,590
The nutty boy.

1737
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:51,370
Also, then I think it's the end of that same review.

1738
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:56,870
PS, I know the name of the cashier and sales associate who had horrible customer service,

1739
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,690
but I ain't no snitch.

1740
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:03,570
So you're not a snitch, but you do want them drug tested.

1741
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:04,710
Just drug tested.

1742
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:06,890
That's not snitching.

1743
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,770
That's just being aware of…

1744
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,310
You want to know what's in your body.

1745
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,730
You want to know…

1746
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,010
It's for their own health, you see.

1747
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:12,890
Snitch it.

1748
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,870
Put a review online.

1749
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:16,710
Yeah, I do.

1750
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:20,350
Do I want anyone to go into this filthy drug-addled store again?

1751
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:20,770
No.

1752
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,430
Am I ratting out the specific employee?

1753
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:24,590
Also, no.

1754
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,070
And do I want them drug tested on the hour every hour?

1755
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:28,750
Absolutely.

1756
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:32,450
Yeah, and keeping it general, too, makes the manager suspicious of everyone.

1757
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,370
So really, what they're doing is maybe worse.

1758
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,370
Cricket Wireless never drug tested.

1759
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:38,830
Well, that's good.

1760
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,550
We also didn't have time cards.

1761
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:41,910
Well…

1762
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:42,710
Oh, no.

1763
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,590
That's not good.

1764
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:44,230
Was it all day channel?

1765
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:47,390
That's not in a way that an employee can amble in when they want.

1766
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,150
That's just like they just weren't keeping track.

1767
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,230
No, just weren't keeping track.

1768
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,210
Oh, man.

1769
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,690
So it wasn't like a fingerprint paperless system?

1770
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,670
No.

1771
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:57,970
Oh, God, no.

1772
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,470
I don't even know why I asked.

1773
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,050
Their phones are that level of tech.

1774
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,410
A lot of credit, yeah.

1775
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:07,470
Well, at least you're doing great financially now, right?

1776
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,270
So…

1777
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,310
I mean, man…

1778
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,150
I'm all right, man.

1779
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,990
Oh, no, he got sad again.

1780
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,610
My suitcase is fading again.

1781
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:17,430
Oh, no.

1782
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,970
You're going to lose your things?

1783
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:21,970
That's part of it now, too.

1784
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:25,170
Lose what you own if we don't get through all these things.

1785
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,870
Well, maybe we should keep going to…

1786
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,310
Yeah, let's get to the last one here.

1787
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:32,130
I know you just lit up that cigarette, but you got another one.

1788
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,890
Yeah, I don't have to finish one to start another.

1789
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,830
Tumble up.

1790
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:39,050
This should taste like or smell like…

1791
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,610
Coca-Cola Classic.

1792
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,850
Oh, yes.

1793
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:47,650
Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,270
You can smell it, too, though, right?

1795
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:52,470
Someone wrote in the comments, I smell it through tasting.

1796
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,610
Like, you go, mm, the air is thick.

1797
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:54,630
Like a Yankee candle.

1798
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1799
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:57,750
So this is…

1800
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,430
The best I could find of a name of this is Coke Icon.

1801
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:03,930
And don't get confused.

1802
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,350
This is not one giant mirror.

1803
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:07,370
Right.

1804
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:10,690
Although there is a rock and roll component to it.

1805
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:14,110
Basically, this is like kind of a Coke refreshment stand.

1806
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,910
But not just some boring little stand.

1807
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,050
It looks like a giant Coke bottle.

1808
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:25,490
The biggest you've ever seen unless you've been to maybe another theme park or the Coke Museum in Atlanta.

1809
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:34,250
But besides that, for sure, this red Coke bottle has got to be in the top 10 or 15 biggest Coke bottles you've ever seen.

1810
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,250
Yeah, for sure.

1811
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,490
And I feel like it should be more prominently displayed on advertising for CityWalk.

1812
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,750
Like, you're going to not come here?

1813
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,350
In that case, you're not going to get to see this Megaball?

1814
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:46,190
It's an icon.

1815
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:46,990
It's a public art.

1816
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:47,730
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:48,550
It's a sculpture.

1818
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:50,290
Think of it more as a sculpture.

1819
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,290
My little ghost brain forgets.

1820
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:55,550
Is there Coke sloshing around in it or is it just…

1821
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,430
No, it's just red.

1822
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,250
Just like metal.

1823
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,090
Yeah, oh, metal.

1824
01:19:59,150 --> 01:19:59,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1825
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,570
Yeah, it's not like, yeah, full of liquid.

1826
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:03,990
Not like the classic.

1827
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,210
Classic glass bottle.

1828
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:07,470
Right.

1829
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:07,910
Yeah, it doesn't look like that.

1830
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:10,230
And then it's not like a fountain or a geyser or anything.

1831
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:10,930
Right.

1832
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,250
No, it's not that cool, but it's pretty big.

1833
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:18,650
And I think that if you have a cup that's meant for Coke freestyle machines, you could

1834
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,330
just take that up to any location in the parks or this place.

1835
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:26,690
I like that.

1836
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:27,230
I've done that.

1837
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:32,390
There was a summer in Disneyland where I had a reusable plastic cup that I paid for, and

1838
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:36,230
then you'd get a refill for a dollar and you could go anywhere you wanted, refill.

1839
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,530
I had a lot of lemonade that summer.

1840
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:39,770
I'll tell you that.

1841
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:47,770
This is not one of my memories that implanted into you.

1842
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:48,870
Oh, wait.

1843
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:51,230
I just feel like I was possessed for a second.

1844
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,430
What was that?

1845
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:53,390
What was I saying?

1846
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,190
You're talking about your summer of lemonade.

1847
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,030
Did Jason just throw his being into my being?

1848
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:01,850
I'm telling you, weird things happen in the multiverse, man.

1849
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,190
Oh, that's what I think happened there.

1850
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:08,070
Jason just threw his whole brain and his experiences into mine and I started speaking for him.

1851
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:10,550
Wait, let's see if something like that could happen again.

1852
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:14,850
Hey, how would you describe the little things up on the top of cupcakes?

1853
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,310
Chocolate jimmies, I'd call them.

1854
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:19,070
Jimmies?

1855
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:19,610
That's what I…

1856
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:20,170
Jimmies?

1857
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,590
From my boyhood in sweets.

1858
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:24,950
Come back, come back.

1859
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:27,050
Mike, what would you call the things on the top of the cupcakes?

1860
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,510
Rainbow sprinkles.

1861
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,150
Wow, wow.

1862
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:33,910
I might have guessed that you might have said like sprinklies or something weird like that,

1863
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,650
but sprinkles does sound more like Mike.

1864
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:36,450
That's what I said.

1865
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:37,550
That's what I called them as a boy.

1866
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:37,930
Why?

1867
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,010
Why do you even bring it up?

1868
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,090
Wow, geez.

1869
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,770
There are odd things amiss here in the multiverse.

1870
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:44,570
Yeah.

1871
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,930
Who knows what any of us could become.

1872
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,130
That's a good point.

1873
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,590
Shape shifting and holes and wormholes and…

1874
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,890
Gates.

1875
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:55,530
And gates too.

1876
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:55,990
So many gates.

1877
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,170
Oh boy, there's going to be a lot of these things, aren't there?

1878
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,950
This thing also has a big screen, a big…

1879
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:07,050
Not the clearest screen.

1880
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,670
Look, it's a pretty pixelated screen.

1881
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,530
I'm going to be honest.

1882
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:11,070
It's not the most updated screen.

1883
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,170
Are there better screens at most stadiums and sporting events?

1884
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,710
Yes.

1885
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,170
But I thought it was exciting.

1886
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:25,070
One thing I hadn't done was go on YouTube and watch the new Rolling Stones video, which

1887
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:31,410
was from their album Hackney Diamonds, which Mike of course finished before finishing the

1888
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,170
entire Liberty Rodrigo album.

1889
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,290
But I finished them both.

1890
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:34,730
I finished them both.

1891
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:34,790
I did finish them both.

1892
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,470
She ultimately did finish them both.

1893
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:45,010
But I watched the full music video called Angry with Sydney Sweeney in it, where she's

1894
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:52,250
a classic sunset strip babe riding on the sunroof of a car.

1895
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,630
Yeah.

1896
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:55,210
And it was pretty exciting to see.

1897
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:58,890
Sector Keeper's face is incredulous, I would say, right now listening to the description

1898
01:22:58,890 --> 01:22:59,530
of this video.

1899
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,750
You know, a sunset strip.

1900
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,870
It makes you think of the Rolling Stones.

1901
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:11,230
And you know, seeing a piece of content for the first time on a big Coke bottle.

1902
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,130
That was the first time you saw that video?

1903
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:14,250
No, I had not.

1904
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,070
It had been kind of in my mental queue.

1905
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:20,910
I was not maybe rushing to watch a new Rolling Stones video in at that time.

1906
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:24,390
I forgot that that's the first time because we talked about the video on this trip.

1907
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:26,950
That's where I caught up.

1908
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:31,330
So it allows you to catch up on the newest, coolest music videos like Angry.

1909
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:32,410
Yeah.

1910
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:32,910
Wow.

1911
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,410
Interesting.

1912
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:34,190
Pretty cool.

1913
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,450
So at least we know they're updating it.

1914
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:36,930
Yes.

1915
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:37,230
Yeah.

1916
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:39,210
It is not content that is…

1917
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,150
Although, I mean, I wish it was like…

1918
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,050
I wish that they had never…

1919
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,190
That it's all like ever last or whatever.

1920
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:48,970
It's changed since early 2000.

1921
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:49,950
Three doors down.

1922
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:50,470
Yeah.

1923
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:55,290
I was going to say like from the Rolling Stones album, A Bigger Bang, the last one,

1924
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:56,830
I think it was 10, 15 years ago.

1925
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:03,710
I mean, in terms of recent Rolling Stones, all I ever want to hear is that Mick Jagger's solo song about COVID ending.

1926
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:04,410
Oh, yeah.

1927
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:04,590
Well.

1928
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,650
We're going to get back to having a blast.

1929
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:10,610
Pandemic.

1930
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,910
Shmandemic.

1931
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,810
I don't want to remember any better what that was.

1932
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:15,230
Yeah.

1933
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:18,770
In my head, it's Mick Jagger presents Pandemic Shmandemic.

1934
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:22,510
Dr.

1935
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,030
Fetchy, get lost!

1936
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:30,970
So that's my experience there.

1937
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:32,050
I mean, is that…

1938
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:33,490
Maybe we're there.

1939
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:34,410
We took Fallen Brothers.

1940
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:36,010
Yeah, I like the Coke bottle.

1941
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:36,970
Uh-huh.

1942
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,170
So, yeah, I don't know.

1943
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:39,790
I think that's it.

1944
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,490
I mean, as far as my thoughts on the bottle and the videos, I think that, yeah.

1945
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:44,110
Wow.

1946
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,310
What else could I say?

1947
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,410
I think we made it.

1948
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:46,810
This is…

1949
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:47,370
Wow.

1950
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,570
It's hard to know what it's even supposed to feel like, but I guess, like we were saying,

1951
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,070
it's just like a…

1952
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,430
It's a feeling we'll get, and I'm getting a nice feeling.

1953
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,270
I'm feeling like I'm full of lemonade.

1954
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:59,250
I don't feel angry like the Rolling Stones.

1955
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:00,390
I feel good.

1956
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:03,450
You feel more like Sydney Sweeney out of that sunroof.

1957
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,650
Having a ball.

1958
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,310
Mike, do you feel like Sydney Sweeney?

1959
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:11,510
If you've seen that video, I've never felt like Sydney Sweeney before in my life.

1960
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,590
But she's young in your peer.

1961
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,290
Well, on that aspect, yes.

1962
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:20,270
She's in the poster for that movie and the trailer with the guy from Top Gun.

1963
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,970
Glenn Powell?

1964
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:21,850
Yeah, Glenn Powell.

1965
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,830
That thing from many months ago, yeah.

1966
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,230
Do you at least feel like Glenn Powell?

1967
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,930
He looks like Glenn Powell, I'll tell you that.

1968
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:30,850
Thank you, yeah.

1969
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,150
In that way, yeah, I do feel just like Glenn Powell.

1970
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:33,890
Wow.

1971
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:35,630
Well, I think we all feel like Glenn Powell.

1972
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:36,530
We feel victorious.

1973
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:42,750
I think we made it through phase one, sector one, and wait a minute.

1974
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,910
Oh, it still happens, I guess.

1975
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:46,450
There's a magical glow.

1976
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:52,030
Is it a stone or is it some other new thing that we're calling it?

1977
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,390
That's right, boys.

1978
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,170
Boys, you give me strength.

1979
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,270
You give me such strength.

1980
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,610
Phase one, sector one is complete.

1981
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,690
Wow, there it is.

1982
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:03,790
So it's still for now a stone, but we'll see where things go.

1983
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:04,810
Things might get kooky.

1984
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,550
Yes, it's a stone if you look closely.

1985
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:09,170
It's not just a stone, it's also a mirror.

1986
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:10,830
Oh, a mirror.

1987
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:11,950
We can see ourselves in it.

1988
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:12,650
I can see it now.

1989
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:14,890
That's right.

1990
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:16,350
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1991
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,710
And there's a little, there's something next to it.

1992
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:23,050
Is that the famous, is that the Rolling Stones tongue?

1993
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:24,030
Oh, wow, yeah.

1994
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:24,990
Wait, no, it's not.

1995
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,810
No, it's Jason's little puckered lips.

1996
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:32,790
It's Jason's little puckered lips from his first kiss on Christmas morning at the Cinnabon.

1997
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,770
At the Cinnabon.

1998
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,950
Thanks for opening, everyone.

1999
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,550
Happy Christmas.

2000
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:43,430
Wow, it's little Jason hoping that the powder all over that mirror, that Motley Crue mirror

2001
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:46,750
is powdered sugar and not something else.

2002
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:47,930
Happy Christmas, he says.

2003
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:48,170
Wow.

2004
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,430
Happy Christmas, everyone.

2005
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:50,290
Oh my God.

2006
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:52,110
Well, we'll take this, we'll value it.

2007
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,330
Maybe we'll need it down the road.

2008
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,590
But thank you for guiding us.

2009
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,490
And hey, I'm just, I'm happy to be back, Sector Keeper.

2010
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,050
Great to be back.

2011
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:00,890
So what's today?

2012
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:03,310
Today's Friday.

2013
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:03,790
Yeah.

2014
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,370
So what do we decide?

2015
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,370
So I'm with Mike tonight and then he's going to drop you off at your place tomorrow.

2016
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:08,550
That sounds good.

2017
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:11,270
Yeah, Friday nights are going to, Friday nights are a night for Mike.

2018
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,970
It's a night when you guys rock out, Sidney Sweeney style.

2019
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:14,710
TGIF.

2020
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:18,490
Hey Mike, can we go to City Walk tonight?

2021
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:19,930
Tonight?

2022
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:23,690
You got to go back.

2023
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,730
Maybe, yeah.

2024
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:27,310
Can we go to the Sunset Strip first?

2025
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,170
Yeah, top down, Sidney Sweeney style.

2026
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,710
Yeah, we'll sit on the car.

2027
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:32,970
Careful, don't blow away.

2028
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:33,970
Let's do that.

2029
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:36,170
And then we're going to get me a Raiders jersey.

2030
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:37,890
Oh boy, wow, wow.

2031
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,290
Okay, well, big plans.

2032
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:42,110
But hey, don't hit it too hard, okay?

2033
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:47,310
Not too much lemonade, not too much cinnamon bun frosting, because we got a big episode tomorrow.

2034
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:50,390
I think our first guest of the saga will be joining us.

2035
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:52,590
That's something to mention really quick too.

2036
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:57,890
Are we the only maniacs who made a point of going just to City Walk in Orlando?

2037
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:01,710
Well, yes, and we made other people do it.

2038
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,970
We made some of your podcasts the right guest favorites.

2039
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:09,130
Demanded, you might say, that they go spend a little time there.

2040
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:13,190
Took up valuable time of some of the comedy world's best and brightest.

2041
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,770
That's right.

2042
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:17,150
And so that's going to be part of this too.

2043
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,050
So who will it be tomorrow?

2044
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:19,230
Who will it be every day?

2045
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,330
How much fun will we have overnighting with the Sector Keeper?

2046
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:24,150
Only one way to find out.

2047
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:30,190

2056

We're living it.

2057

Thanks for taking this one, Mike.

2058

I'll handle it tomorrow.

2059
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,530
Cool if I smoke in your car.

2060
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,610
Just roll the window down.

2061
