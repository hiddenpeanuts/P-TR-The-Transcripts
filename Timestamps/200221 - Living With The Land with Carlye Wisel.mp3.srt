1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,340
Dog.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,740
Warning, today's episode gets political,

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,580
but we at Podcast The Ride feel this is a good thing

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,120
because a healthy debate strengthens

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,380
our core amusement park beliefs.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,020
So prepare for a heated yet robust discussion

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,580
about grain and people possibly doing lab work.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,860
Carly Weisel returns to graze the third rail

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,300
of theme park politics, Epcot's Living with the Land,

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,560
today on Podcast The Ride.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
["The Ride Theme Park Theme Song"]

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,260
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,440
that's not afraid to touch the hottest topics around,

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
namely slow, plant-based, learning-based boat rides.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,880
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always,

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,260
some fire throwers like Jason Sheridan.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm just here to talk about a great ride

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,200
everyone knows and loves that we all enjoy.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,420
And Scott Garen, I think I meant to say flamethrowers,

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,480
not fire throwers.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
Flamethrowers?

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Hi, I'm here to, I feel somewhat counter to Jason's POV,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
but you know what, I would like to,

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,320
I'd like this to be, I'd like it to be a learning experience

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,160
for me as well.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,160
I'd like to be taught why this isn't the boringest ride

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,320
I've ever been on.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,160
Sorry, everybody.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, all right.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
But this is good.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
I like that we're, yeah.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,120
Scott, let me reassure you that in order to do that,

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,080
I'll just go ahead and tell you the technology exists

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,920
and the technology is not.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,200
I'll just go ahead and tell you the technology exists.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Really all we need is the courage and the innovation

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,160
and the ability and the will to do it,

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,520
the will to educate you.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Oh my God.

41
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,320
As Dr. Carl Hodges of Arizona.

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Oh, why are we?

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,600
Arizona State University, who helps create this attraction.

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,760
Why are we recording, how did we end up recording this

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,520
on a Tuesday night instead of first thing in the morning?

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I should have just drained coffee.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,240
I should have doused myself in coffee to make this possible.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
I will be asleep by the end of this.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
I don't know, we'll see.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
This might get ugly.

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,480
Coffee, the bean, of course,

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,320
which grows in tropical climes.

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
No.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
That's the first biome.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,320
Let's bring in our guest because I like our guest.

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,840
I think there's something I enjoy,

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,160
a fan favorite, an us favorite,

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,760
a theme park journalist for so many great publications.

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Carly Weisel is here.

60
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
Hello, good boys.

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
Hello.

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Hello.

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Hello.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,120
It's good to see you, although I was,

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,320
when this came up, it was undeniable that

66
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,200
when you suggested it, like, well, of course,

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,320
that has to happen.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
I was like, well, this is how it becomes

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,040
instead of two against one, three against one.

70
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,840
Because this is becoming an inevitable topic for us.

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,000
So now I'm severely outnumbered.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
And like, you add the Facebook group to it and a lot more.

74
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,280
It's funny, because this has a real

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,600
city hall meeting feel to it.

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,560
It doesn't feel like a bunch of people who love theme parks

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,240
coming around to just gab about rides they like.

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
It feels like we're each gonna spend four minutes

79
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,960
at a podium driving each other crazy.

80
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
I think it might.

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,880
We're also recording this in the exact sliver of time

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,880
that the Iowa caucus is being, like, what, stolen?

83
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,200
What's going on?

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
I don't, we're not sure.

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
We'll see.

86
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
We'll see in maybe a couple weeks.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
In a couple weeks, maybe we'll know.

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
Maybe a couple weeks or months.

89
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,760
We're recording this in the fog.

90
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
This episode might come out in April.

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
I have no idea.

92
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,760
So I don't know, but if that might add to the procedural,

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,760
there's a very governmental order in the room, I suppose.

94
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,720
I mean, I'm not gonna be harsh with you,

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,120
but I do feel that you will emerge out of the other side,

96
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,280
both staring at random strangers on a screen

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
and in love with this attraction.

98
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,400
This is why I am glad that it's you here to talk about this.

99
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,920
I think you will make this a positive experience,

100
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,120
an experience of growth, I hope.

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Or I'm just a raving madman by the end of the day.

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
We should explain why, for anyone who doesn't know,

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,880
what the tension is here.

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,200
We are talking about a boat ride at Epcot Center.

105
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,040
This is called Living with the Lambs.

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
I would say it's not just any boat ride.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
We're already.

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,520
I would say it's number one boat ride at Epcot Center.

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,360
I'd probably agree.

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
I would agree, yeah.

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,080
Guys, madness.

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,760
This stat has already been said.

113
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
I don't know if I can agree with that.

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Thank you, Michael.

115
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
Mike is a moderate.

116
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
I appreciate that.

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
No, don't say that.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
All right.

119
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
What could possibly.

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Mike, a general in the clobacarmy.

121
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,400
No, I'm not a moderate.

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
Look, look, Scott.

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm Bloomberg, of course.

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
No, you know what, fine.

125
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,360
I am a theme park moderate.

126
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
That's who I am.

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
I want reasonable.

128
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,440
Before we started recording,

129
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,920
you're like old Epcot must die.

130
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,080
I cannot wait to meet the spirit of storytelling.

131
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
I am so excited to meet my new favorite character.

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
I hope Dame Judi Dench,

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,000
I hope Moana uses her water abilities

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,720
to send Dame Judi Dench to the watery depths.

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,280
Let the old ways die.

136
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Let the old ways die.

137
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,200
No, I don't know.

138
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,040
Okay, look.

139
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
You're Kylo Ren in this situation.

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,040
Before we get into opinions,

141
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
we have to explain what this is

142
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,480
because there are listeners who don't know

143
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,240
why this episode is like this already.

144
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,440
Now let's please make sure to give its current name

145
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
and its former name.

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,120
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
Go ahead.

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,200
The current name is Living With The Land.

149
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,120
The previous name is Listen To The Land.

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,200
Listen To The Land from 1982 to the early 90s

151
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,720
when the craft sponsorship ended.

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Or no, I'm sorry.

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Yeah, is that correct?

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,120
Should we just play some of the original

155
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,720
Listen To The Land song real quick for everybody?

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,240
Let's start it off hot.

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Just with the...

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
I've never heard this.

159
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
You've never heard this?

160
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
This is how the ride started.

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,240
This is how it originally...

162
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,600
You can't be mad at this.

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,160
Well, I'm not, I'll explain.

164
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Oh my God.

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
I mean, that's the gist.

166
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,760
It's a very John Denver-y type song, children's choir.

167
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,880
In the family with the energy song,

168
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,160
less universe of energy and more that other one.

169
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
Energy.

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Making my day.

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,160
Yes, because they were written by the same man.

172
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,320
Yeah, hell yeah.

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,320
What you don't realize is of course I can't be mad at that.

174
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,480
And you just played into my argument about this thing.

175
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
Oh, interesting.

176
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
I'm amazed you haven't heard this.

177
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,080
So that's from the original 82 up hot.

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,960
I never heard that.

179
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
And I didn't think it was possible to like this ride more.

180
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,320
But now knowing that it truly has a banger attached to it

181
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,360
from years ago.

182
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
It does, but you'll see.

183
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm gonna flip this.

184
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,200
You'll understand in a minute.

185
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,920
Let's just explain what it is.

186
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
Yeah, so okay.

187
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,600
What's this ride?

188
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
And you know what?

189
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
I think this is good for...

190
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,280
As somebody who is on the counter on this ride,

191
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,320
I would like somebody to go ahead and try to

192
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,800
just explain it with no frills

193
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
and don't add any editorial anything to it.

194
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Somebody points to the ride and said,

195
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
what is this ride?

196
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,520
What do you say?

197
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,800
I would say it is a slow moving boat ride

198
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,240
through some different show scenes, animatronic animals,

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,920
different terrain that is supposed to educate you

200
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,280
about the land and what the land gives us,

201
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
what you can grow in the land.

202
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
And then the second half,

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,200
you take a slow boat ride through some plants growing

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,240
in a greenhouse.

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,200
You go through four greenhouses,

206
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,560
four different biomes.

207
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
And see a lab.

208
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
You can't say the word biomes to a stranger

209
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
if they're asking what it is.

210
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
Yeah, I was trying to...

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,320
They have to be agriculturally versed.

212
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,560
Everyone was talking about by 70s and 80s,

213
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,520
the biosphere, people love talking about biomes.

214
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,240
Habitats, artificial habitats.

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,080
This is 2020.

216
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,600
How many people are we talking about biomes all the time?

217
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,640
I would go ahead and say that this ride

218
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,640
only gets more important as the earth starts to dissolve.

219
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,880
Well, then we have another argument to get into.

220
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,440
Global warming is a hoax.

221
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,920
We're changing the topic of the episode.

222
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,760
No, no, okay.

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,440
So yes, now that's a pretty good,

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,320
just fair description of the ride.

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Now let's add to this that somehow I've made a lot

226
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
of people angry by saying,

227
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,280
I don't like what you just described.

228
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
Right.

229
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,920
What happened was when we went to Disney World

230
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,320
a couple of months ago, I did not go on this ride.

231
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,600
I elected not to, my wife Erin elected not to,

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
and your girlfriend Lindsay elected not to.

233
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,800
And we decided it would be more fun

234
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
to watch Lindsay eat cereal

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
than to go on this slow moving boat ride.

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,800
And I said this on the show and the Facebook group,

237
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
among other social media and a lot of people on Twitter

238
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,280
lately have been very upset that I said this.

239
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Living with the Land Bros came out in full force.

240
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
He's toxic.

241
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
They're in my mentions.

242
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I think some of them are unbuilt Russia pavilion bots.

243
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
I agree with that, yeah.

244
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,040
Not cute bots like Smart One.

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
No, not Smart One.

246
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
What cereal was it?

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,160
In my head it was Cheerios.

248
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
I should have paid more attention.

249
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,040
Lindsay will be home maybe in a little bit

250
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,880
so maybe we can yell at her.

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
If you went on the boat ride,

252
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
you would have remembered that.

253
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Maybe.

254
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,480
You would have learned maybe where grains come from.

255
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
Honestly, you would have actually appreciated

256
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,840
her eating cereal more if you had been on the ride

257
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
and then seen the cereal.

258
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,440
The cereal possible.

259
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
So that's what brings us to this, Jon.

260
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,840
Yeah, there was no question.

261
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,680
I led us to the land pavilion and I was like,

262
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,600
well, let's, okay, two things.

263
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,920
This is where the chocolate, there's a chocolate thing.

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
And what that was was just a pop-up rack

265
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,160
of Giordelli chocolates,

266
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
but they were giving out free squares

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,840
so everyone got free squares.

268
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,800
So point in my favor.

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
Now, wait, you can't count that on the boat ride.

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
I'd go into the land.

271
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,520
It's all land?

272
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Sure, maybe.

273
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
No, no, no, no, no.

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
That is a separate from the ride.

275
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
That's a little bonus.

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
That's a little bonus.

277
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh, okay, now we're going to have to split up a pavilion.

278
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,160
A clean bathroom into this argument?

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,080
A clean bathroom on the third floor

280
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
is part of the boat ride?

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
I didn't use the bathroom in the land.

282
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
Okay, so we get our free chocolates.

283
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,960
Regardless, I was like, well, I'm going to boat ride.

284
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
Is anyone coming with me?

285
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,880
And then no one volunteered.

286
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
So I stuck my bottom lip out and looked sad.

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,320
And Mike went, all right.

288
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Wait, was I that resistant?

289
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,840
You were like, I think jokingly,

290
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,200
you were like, I guess I'll go with the boy.

291
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
There we go.

292
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Yeah, that sounds exactly like him.

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
I don't remember.

294
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Maybe it's three against one.

295
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Maybe it's three against one and a half.

296
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,960
I don't remember being that against it.

297
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
But maybe that is what happened.

298
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
I don't remember exactly.

299
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
I don't remember being like,

300
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
oh, while we were on the ride or anything.

301
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
No, you weren't, no.

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Because we also, the ride was very bustling.

303
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
There was people working at the lab.

304
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
There were people in plants.

305
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
The lab.

306
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,200
We will talk about that later.

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,400
We need to bring you in on this.

308
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,720
Agitating things and signs showing

309
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,160
what parts of the plants growing

310
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,320
were used in the food and wine festival.

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
Amazing.

312
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,040
Pretty cool.

313
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,080
Signs, wait, what?

314
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,720
So yeah, they'll have signs that say like,

315
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
oh, you see these berries growing?

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,800
Well, they're in the cobbler outside at the food and wine.

317
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,520
I've always interpreted that as being like,

318
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,840
you know, berries, heard of them.

319
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
We also sell them here.

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know if they're the same.

321
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
I swear some of them were the same.

322
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
Some of them were food and wine.

323
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
I have pictures of Jason looking longingly

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
at a couple of the signs where it says like,

325
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
this is for the pie outside.

326
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,520
And that has always been, that has never changed in the ride.

327
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,440
Them pitching, now, how true it is, I don't know.

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
Them pitching that the stuff we create here in the land

329
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,120
goes to restaurants.

330
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,360
Namely, they say, the fish go to the coral reef restaurant

331
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
for you to eat.

332
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Weird.

333
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,720
Which my family always went to that restaurant

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,680
and I haven't been back in years.

335
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,120
It's the only place I refuse to go.

336
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,960
Really?

337
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah.

338
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Is it just too morbid?

339
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I think it's rude.

340
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah.

341
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,400
I think it's real rude to eat a fish in front of fish.

342
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, well, this is where,

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
you're in front of a big tank,

344
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
so you're watching fish go by.

345
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,440
It's just, like, you don't have to eat your fish

346
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,280
in front of the fish tank.

347
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,080
You can eat your fish anywhere, so eat it elsewhere.

348
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
That's really weird.

349
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,160
Yeah, it would, I think, make me just like astral project

350
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,440
outside of myself and like, wait, what are you doing?

351
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
It's too much.

352
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, it'd feel shame, I think.

353
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah.

354
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
There's a big turtle in there, though,

355
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,160
because we ate there like six years ago

356
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,720
and the big turtle was awesome.

357
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm not gonna eat the turtle.

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,080
So if you're not eating a turtle.

359
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,960
Well, at some point they had snapper soup.

360
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,640
That sticks out if I've ever eaten one.

361
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,480
You have had it?

362
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
As a child, I've eaten snapper soup.

363
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,760
We have established that Jason has had,

364
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,920
like the shredder, wants to drink turtle soup.

365
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,360
Have you not had turtle soup?

366
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,200
I've never had it.

367
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,040
Scott?

368
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
I have not, no.

369
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,720
Okay.

370
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
It's not, I wanna say it's a New Orleans thing,

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,200
but I think it's more so dopes from New York City

372
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,000
coming on family vacation to New Orleans

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
and going to like one fancy restaurant

374
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,840
where they're like, what do you sell turtle soup?

375
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
And then you all have to order it.

376
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
And then you're like, ooh.

377
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,640
It's like a fish house, like yeah,

378
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
a lot of big fish houses still have it.

379
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,320
So you, Jason, and Shred are all of a taste for turtle.

380
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,160
What?

381
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,980
Listen, not a bad crew.

382
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,820
I'm into it.

383
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,840
Sure.

384
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,880
He's cool.

385
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,720
He is cool.

386
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Carly, let's bring you officially into this argument.

387
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,280
Because you.

388
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,160
I feel like I'm at a Thanksgiving dinner

389
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,680
that's going sour very quickly.

390
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
I didn't realize what I'd stepped in

391
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,480
when I recommended this as the episode we're doing.

392
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Now I'm very nervous.

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
Maybe Aunt Carly will calm things down.

394
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,720
Oh my God.

395
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Okay, you, so what, I mean,

396
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,600
you recently have been tweeting about the attraction.

397
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
You're.

398
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Yes.

399
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,400
I mean, well, here, let's step outside of the argument.

400
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,240
Okay.

401
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Like someone exiting Coral Reef restaurant.

402
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,800
Because you propose this not even realizing

403
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,560
the depths of it maybe.

404
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,000
Just talk about the attraction.

405
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,560
Why are you fond of this attraction?

406
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
So I, the reason I thought this would be a good one

407
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,520
is because I, like you, once did not like this ride.

408
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,360
There we go.

409
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
And I have grown to become someone

410
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,880
who is wised up and appreciates what it is.

411
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,040
This is wonderful.

412
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,200
And maybe there's a way that this can happen

413
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
while we're recording.

414
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Now, let me tell you the first thing I like about that statement

415
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,120
or besides the hope and the possibility for me,

416
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,360
I like that you validate that it is not insane

417
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,160
to think this is an extremely boring attraction.

418
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,000
You thought this at one point in time.

419
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Oh, big time.

420
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,520
Okay, so listen to that everybody, first of all.

421
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,000
In a way, it is like truly being on a trash barge,

422
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,880
but then it's also, I'm sorry.

423
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,040
No one has ever made me spit water in an episode.

424
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,880
Thank you for that.

425
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,720
I'm so sorry.

426
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,560
That really made me laugh.

427
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,560
But also, like I really sat down and thought about it today

428
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,040
and realized that it has every element of a Disney ride.

429
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,680
If you consider yourself a fan of anything Disney,

430
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,440
you're gonna get a dose of it here.

431
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,760
Granted, it may be like a sleepy time tea dose,

432
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,680
but it's still there.

433
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,080
But you know what words I kept coming across

434
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,600
on like comments on blogs and videos and stuff,

435
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,600
people saying the words peaceful, relaxing, educational.

436
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,080
How many of the Epcot pavilions still stay true

437
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,680
to that original idea of entertainment

438
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
that is educational?

439
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,080
The land, for the most part, living with the land

440
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,480
has not changed much.

441
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
There's been some changes, for the worse, for the most part.

442
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
That's what I'm saying.

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,280
I think this was a better ride once.

444
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,200
But that applies to all of Epcot Center.

445
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,720
Yeah, you gotta really hold your loved ones close.

446
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Like the fact that there's really no characters in this

447
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,720
means like we gotta just keep shoving our bodies through

448
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
so that it's like people love it, see, see, it's great.

449
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,240
And like keep it pure.

450
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I got a lot of thoughts all at once here, sorry.

451
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,400
I know, we got a lot to get to.

452
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't wanna yell over, I wanna be civil.

453
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,560
I'm a moderate, I believe in civility.

454
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,280
We need to get back to when we get along.

455
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,240
When we get lucky, yeah, 50 years ago.

456
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
Tip O'Neill.

457
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Your friend Corn Poke always told you about civility.

458
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
That's right.

459
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
Tip O'Neill.

460
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,400
Me and Tip O'Neill and Corn Poke

461
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,360
were all so civil to each other 50 years ago.

462
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,000
So you talk again, I'll collect my thoughts

463
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,480
and then I'll raise my hand when I wanna speak.

464
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,080
Something's brewing on that side of the room.

465
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm worried about that.

466
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,160
This is kind of like.

467
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm just a moderate over here.

468
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm just a moderate friendly.

469
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
I think you can flip.

470
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
So I think there's a lot of possibility

471
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
on the mic side of the room.

472
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,080
You say there's no characters in this ride.

473
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,320
There are robots in this ride.

474
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,880
Oh, I'm sorry, I mean like this isn't Moana's journey

475
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,760
through nature.

476
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,440
Which I am actually, I am a fan of IP in the rides,

477
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,800
which is like a whole other seven hour segment.

478
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,120
But this.

479
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,240
See, I wasn't sure where you stood.

480
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,520
Oh, a big fan because I love synergy.

481
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,360
It makes sense if you're a child and you go see a movie

482
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,760
and you're like, I love these characters

483
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,160
and you would go to the theme park and see them.

484
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
Boom, makes sense.

485
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,760
Yeah, well and sometimes the argument against IP

486
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
involves people saying things like,

487
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,520
who likes this character?

488
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,480
No one.

489
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,800
And that person is not a child,

490
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,320
does not have children, does not know children.

491
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,560
And when we're like, all right,

492
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,880
now pull this group of children.

493
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,240
Oh, all 100 of them love insert IP here.

494
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,760
It feels to me just so authentic.

495
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,560
It's just really, it doesn't make sense that it's there.

496
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,080
It seems like the first thing they would have cut

497
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,840
to be like, we're slowly growing tomatoes,

498
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
get this out of here.

499
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
We could be putting anything else here.

500
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,400
And the fact that it's still there is a small miracle.

501
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
I just like that.

502
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,560
I like weird little rides surviving and thriving.

503
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,440
And you know, when I, oh, sorry, no, no, no.

504
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,600
No, I was just gonna say,

505
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,720
I maybe you're gonna save this for later.

506
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
I think there's another boat ride

507
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,360
you would call the best boat ride in Epcot

508
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,400
that is also I think a quaint little ride

509
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
that you could maybe make an argument like,

510
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,880
oh, this could go away.

511
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,360
Yes, well, I don't know, we can talk about that now.

512
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,680
About frozen ever after?

513
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
No, no, no.

514
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
Too much.

515
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
I, no, you're probably talking about

516
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,840
what I call Mexico boat ride, the Mexico boat ride.

517
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,680
The three caballeros.

518
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,520
You esteem it so much you don't even use

519
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,680
El Rio de Tiempo starring the three caballeros.

520
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,640
Because that's not what it is in my heart.

521
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,200
In my heart, it's Mexico boat ride.

522
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,360
That's whatever, I don't even know what the first name was.

523
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,520
Was it Real Rio del Tiempo, always?

524
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,400
We have a before three caballeros was it?

525
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
That is why I don't, it doesn't matter.

526
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
It's the Mexico boat ride.

527
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,720
That's just the way.

528
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,640
That's all, that's the umbrella for all of them.

529
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,920
Yes, that is a dopey little ride that certainly could go.

530
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,080
You just put up one construction wall

531
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,960
and nobody ever knew it was there.

532
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,400
But this ride has atmosphere.

533
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,760
This ride has characters.

534
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,000
It has animatronics.

535
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
It has fireworks up on the ceiling.

536
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
It has projection.

537
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,560
It has TVs and screens and little like physical comedy.

538
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,600
There's things happening in this ride.

539
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,920
It's now called the Grand Fiesta Tour

540
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
starring the three caballeros.

541
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
A much less evocative name than El Rio de Tiempo.

542
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,720
You also didn't have the esteem to say the right name.

543
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
Oh yeah, everyone's missing their esteem today.

544
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,440
Where's everyone's esteem?

545
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,640
I'm growing more and more sad for you

546
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,400
that you didn't even go on this.

547
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,760
Well, I have.

548
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
I have gone on it.

549
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
How many years ago though?

550
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
2009 probably is less than.

551
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
You went on Living with the Land.

552
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

553
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,680
What was the scenario?

554
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,720
Who were you with?

555
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
Was it hot out?

556
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
Did you enjoy sitting in that time

557
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
or did your joints still work?

558
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,440
Oh, this is crucial.

559
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,960
So maybe you have to be like in worse shape

560
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,800
to have for this ride to count.

561
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
Yeah, you gotta be a little tired.

562
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,840
Here's the scenario.

563
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,920
And I'm gonna create another villain here apparently

564
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,040
but I think she'll own it.

565
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,960
I went with my wife, Erin, who went on this ride

566
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,720
and said, that was the boringest thing I've ever done.

567
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't make me go on that ever again.

568
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
I would argue not untrue.

569
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,440
Okay.

570
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,280
But.

571
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
But.

572
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,320
Yes.

573
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,800
Well, see it's interesting.

574
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,880
I don't think Lindsay had the hate that Erin had

575
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,600
but I also think Lindsay was like.

576
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,000
I think her blood sugar was dropping

577
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and we had done it last time.

578
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
We had been there a year, well no, two years prior.

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Yeah.

580
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,480
I mean, she also I think would acknowledge it's boring.

581
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
It's interesting when we say boring

582
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,360
because I think this time when we went on Spaceship Earth

583
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,640
and this might just, I might just get all the hate now.

584
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,560
I think after we did Spaceship Earth,

585
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,640
I think I said that's the best boring ride

586
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
at Disney World or Upcut Center.

587
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
I think so.

588
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,160
I love it so much.

589
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,000
Gosh, is it a sleepy little ride?

590
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,120
Oh, a lot of effects are dated.

591
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,640
Animatronic scenes are great but also they're sleepy.

592
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,000
Very, everything's very sleepy.

593
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,840
Loud clunking.

594
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
Oh my God, you hear the gears.

595
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,160
You end up in that second half where nothing's going on.

596
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

597
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,120
Very out of date interactive videos are going on.

598
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,960
Oh my God, the worst.

599
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,920
The ride just glug, glug, glug, glug.

600
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,880
And that's like half of it.

601
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
It's literally like Casey Jr.

602
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,760
You may as well hear Casey Jr. going like,

603
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,760
as your car wheezes backwards down.

604
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,680
But it's such a great.

605
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,720
Maybe I can't, maybe I can't.

606
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,240
Fuck, oh shit, oh no.

607
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,000
I could once.

608
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,280
But no longer.

609
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,280
But what a great boring ride and still one of my favorites.

610
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,520
And it do, it is not as, this living with the land

611
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,640
is not as good of a boring ride.

612
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,400
But it does fall into the genre of boring rides.

613
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,180
It just doesn't have quite as many things going on.

614
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,960
But I have to appreciate it still in the same genre of,

615
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,080
God, I do like how boring this is.

616
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,360
I really can appreciate how aggressively boring

617
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
living with the land is.

618
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Which busser ride teaches you about the difference

619
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,720
between aquaponics and hydroponics?

620
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Oh, wait, wait.

621
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,760
Can you explain to me the difference?

622
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,200
Yes, I can.

623
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,160
Hydroponics is where you grow plants

624
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,880
in like a water solvent, so without soil.

625
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,280
Aquaponics is like fish farming

626
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,300
that oftentimes you can incorporate hydroponics into

627
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,920
and create a symbiotic relationship

628
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,560
where the waste from the fish will feed the plants

629
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
and the plants will help feed the fish.

630
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,440
See, Scott, that just screams vacation.

631
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,920
Look at that, he learned.

632
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,840
He learned.

633
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,120
This is all good stuff and the people involved

634
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,800
in both kind of ponics, thank you very much.

635
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,480
You're making the world a better place.

636
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,520
This is probably a good point to bring up, Carly,

637
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,440
that you have a history with agriculture.

638
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

639
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,320
Yes, I do.

640
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,120
Please.

641
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,400
I went to University of Illinois,

642
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,080
which is literally in a cornfield,

643
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,300
which is not a complete joke

644
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,500
because they had a cornfield on the quad.

645
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,100
It was experimental, very cool.

646
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,860
And because I was not smart,

647
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,100
I had to get in through the back door,

648
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,540
which is what we called it,

649
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,140
and it was through the agriculture school.

650
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,140
So for one semester, I was an agriculture student in college.

651
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,380
And what were, do you remember like course names?

652
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
Do you remember like any specific?

653
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,180
Yeah, ACES 101.

654
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,180
I think it was agriculture, consumer, and economics.

655
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,780
A was in aquaponics.

656
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,380
Yeah, aquaponics, all the ponics.

657
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,420
But it was a very, like there was a lot of people

658
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,420
at the school who did corn for their major.

659
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,660
And I proudly am one of them.

660
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,620
What does it mean to do?

661
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,100
What does that mean to you then in your life?

662
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,620
I was only in it for a semester

663
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,020
because the long story short,

664
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,580
I'm not a total hack, I promise,

665
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,780
the journalism school didn't really take freshmen.

666
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
It started junior year,

667
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,220
so I couldn't really apply to journalism

668
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,940
unless I was a newspaper editor at the time

669
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,780
and I wasn't, et cetera.

670
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,620
Oh, gotcha.

671
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,740
I transferred halfway in, but we took a class

672
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
and we learned rotational crops.

673
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
And you learned the basics of farming,

674
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,900
not out in the field,

675
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,500
but in a classroom with a PowerPoint.

676
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,380
Wow.

677
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Hypothetically, if the world goes real shitty

678
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,860
and you had to just take a little patch of land,

679
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,380
you think you could apply what you learned?

680
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,540
Was it enough information for you

681
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,260
to actually be able to grow a couple different things

682
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,220
and have an advanced skill versus me

683
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,060
who would just take seeds and put it in the ground?

684
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,580
I drank a lot in college.

685
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah.

686
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,140
So maybe.

687
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,980
Okay.

688
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,980
But there was a girl who did agriculture journalism

689
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,460
in my journalism lab.

690
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,300
Oh.

691
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,980
So it was like, they were everywhere, all these farm folk.

692
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,500
If you found your old notes, you might be okay.

693
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,980
You couldn't go off a memory.

694
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,500
I didn't do any work till sophomore year.

695
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,540
But anyway, I had a real good time.

696
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,980
You were ignoring your agricultural duties

697
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,820
to drink alcohol?

698
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,140
I think I could, but I would need a few years.

699
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,980
Sure, yeah.

700
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
Sure.

701
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,020
I think I could do it.

702
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,660
Do you think that this backstory for you

703
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,860
enhances your appreciation of living with the land?

704
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,180
It definitely does, but it's not the reason I like it.

705
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,580
Okay, sure.

706
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,980
Which we can keep going into,

707
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,260
but I feel like I just threw Erin, my wife, under the bus.

708
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,100
Oh, no, no.

709
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,940
But I also have to bring up,

710
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,980
so then I have to bring up the other thing you told me

711
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,700
via DM about your husband.

712
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,180
I don't wanna put him on the spot, but-

713
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,580
Oh no, what did I say?

714
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,580
You said that he hates this ride.

715
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,540
Oh yeah, he won't go on it.

716
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,980
There we go.

717
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,580
I am not, Erin and I are not these devils on an island

718
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,380
plotting against these wonderful little rides.

719
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,340
Other people have these opinions.

720
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Yeah, but-

721
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,020
People we love.

722
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,260
But he's not a Disney fan.

723
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,900
He's not someone who gathers weekly

724
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,780
to discuss all the happenings.

725
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,940
Sure.

726
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Well, yeah, this is another one of those-

727
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,820
I am, look, as far as living with the land,

728
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,660
I have a big tent and we're all welcome under here

729
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,460
as far as opinions in living with the land,

730
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,300
so yeah, I don't wanna make you feel bad.

731
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,780
You just gotta sit down and have a beer

732
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,900
and look him in the eye.

733
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,860
Yeah. Listen, listen, Jack.

734
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,940
We have more in common than we do.

735
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,260
We have more in common.

736
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,100
Than we don't, I mean.

737
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,700
Well, are you a Pirates of the Caribbean fan?

738
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Of course.

739
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,740
What do you like about that ride?

740
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,860
Robots, lots of them.

741
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,060
What if I were to tell you about a few robots

742
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,700
that were made out of molds originally allocated

743
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,100
for the Western River Expedition?

744
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,220
Sure, I like that.

745
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,060
Yeah.

746
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,620
That was a ride for listeners who don't know,

747
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,900
there was maybe gonna not be a Pirates in Disney World

748
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,260
and there was a thing that was gonna be like Pirates

749
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
but in the old West,

750
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,020
and they started building robots for this ride, apparently,

751
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,500
but they did not do the ride

752
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,940
and they instead did Pirates and then Big Thunder Mountain.

753
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,820
So there are, just tell me about these robots.

754
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,460
Are they as fun as the auctioneer

755
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,820
and the dirty foot guy and the prisoners and the dog?

756
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,740
You got a buffalo, you got a prairie dog.

757
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,420
I believe it's a prairie dog.

758
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,460
And you got a dog sitting on farmhouse steps

759
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,020
who looks like the dog.

760
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,860
Yes, he does.

761
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,940
In Pirates of the Caribbean because the rumor,

762
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,300
people say that that dog is modeled after one of Walt's dogs.

763
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,020
Yes, also no women are being oppressed in this attraction.

764
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,860
Yes.

765
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,900
And if you look up to the corner,

766
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,500
you can sometimes see Mickey Mouse

767
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,020
making his rounds at a restaurant.

768
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,860
Yes.

769
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
What?

770
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,140
At a restaurant, the restaurant originally called My Turn,

771
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,940
a rotating restaurant that overlooks the first half

772
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,060
of living with land.

773
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,020
Now it's called Garden.

774
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm a big revolving restaurant.

775
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,180
What is it?

776
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,020
Garden Grill.

777
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,300
Wait, I have the name, and who sponsors it?

778
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,540
Because the full name made me want to die.

779
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,020
Oh, I don't know who sponsors Garden Grill.

780
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,660
I'd say like...

781
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,260
Garden Grill Restaurant presented by Smuckers.

782
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,140
Smuckers.

783
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,740
Smuckers.

784
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,260
And they un-rotated it?

785
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,140
This was a revolving restaurant and now it is not?

786
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,740
Madness.

787
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,820
Is it still revolving?

788
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,900
It did it for a little while.

789
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,060
I asked you guys and you said no.

790
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,140
Did I went to that moment?

791
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,460
I don't know the current status of it.

792
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,220
I guess I was sleepy that day.

793
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,500
I don't remember that either.

794
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
My brain no longer works because there's too much Disney news

795
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,820
all the time, but it should be rotating.

796
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,500
If it's not, get it rotating.

797
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,220
And then it's a whole other story.

798
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,780
Hey, don't leave the chicken hanging.

799
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,780
They got a chicken in there too.

800
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,660
They got a chicken.

801
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,900
And the mailbox for the farmhouse says 82.

802
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,980
A little nod to Epcot's opening year.

803
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Ooh, I love that.

804
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,740
Yeah.

805
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,420
And what you're gonna love even more

806
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,860
is that the second story of the farmhouse,

807
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,060
which is not very easy to see from the boat ride itself,

808
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,260
only from the restaurant, is fully themed.

809
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,780
It's fully filled with a globe and a tennis racket.

810
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
It's a full bedroom.

811
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,380
This is the standard.

812
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,420
This is the base standard of what I think.

813
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,660
It's a full bedroom.

814
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,500
I am not gonna get too credit.

815
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,660
That attention to detail.

816
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,140
They dressed the room.

817
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
The thing that any ride.

818
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,380
It's like Steve Jobs said,

819
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,020
you gotta paint the back of the drawer.

820
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,100
You gotta make the back of the drawers

821
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,380
look as good as the front of the drawer.

822
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,220
I agree.

823
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,380
That's what all rides do.

824
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,980
Well, I think that that's nice

825
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
because there's obviously, there's another tool.

826
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,500
I don't know if you get to walk through the robots.

827
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,580
You don't, but there's that extra tour you could take.

828
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,420
Behind the Seeds.

829
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,260
It's called Behind the Seeds.

830
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,100
Which we didn't have enough time.

831
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,380
That was on my.

832
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,340
I will be on Scott's team

833
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,060
because there is not a chance.

834
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,300
I love this ride.

835
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,020
I will never take that tour.

836
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,500
You would not take the Behind the Seeds tour.

837
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,340
Absolutely not.

838
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,740
Everyone tweeted at me because there was a whole debacle

839
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,460
that we'll get into shortly about living with the land

840
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,260
on Twitter that happened this past week.

841
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,100
But everyone's like,

842
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
you should definitely take the Behind the Seeds tour.

843
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,340
And I'm like, fuck no.

844
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,180
Don't you say.

845
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,900
That was my big regret of the Florida trip

846
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,820
that I ran out of the sign.

847
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,140
That was on my extended like get to list.

848
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,980
Have you ever seen people on the tour

849
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,660
while you're on the attraction?

850
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,740
Have I seen, I haven't.

851
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,300
Have you ever seen it once or twice?

852
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,220
They are miserable.

853
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,340
They are miserable.

854
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,020
Don't you think maybe you're projecting though?

855
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,860
Not at all.

856
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,260
It's all like parents who were like,

857
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,460
oh, this tour is affordable.

858
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,380
We should take it.

859
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,820
And they're teenage kids being like,

860
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,380
all I wanna do is be on Snapchat.

861
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,420
Why am I here?

862
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
It is bad.

863
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,180
It is a bad vibe.

864
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,620
Also, you're standing for an hour.

865
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,580
No, thank you.

866
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,100
I'd rather be sitting taking in

867
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,460
the cool greenhouse breeze.

868
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,140
The boat aspect is the only points I will give this.

869
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,060
It is a boat and I like a boat.

870
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,660
Do you get to wear a lab coat while you do the tour?

871
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,820
I believe not, no.

872
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,060
You have to wear your regular clothes.

873
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,340
Jason, do we know?

874
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,540
It seemed like a lot of people in regular clothes.

875
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,980
Do you get to do anything

876
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,820
or do you just get to walk around?

877
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,460
Well, you get to taste some of the things grown

878
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
in the greenhouses.

879
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,500
That's what Jason's after.

880
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,580
The berries for the cobbler.

881
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,060
Probably some leafy vegetables.

882
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,420
You get to pick a tilapia out of a tank

883
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,460
and just take a bite.

884
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,300
That and Jason.

885
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,140
Oh, gosh.

886
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,980
Heathcliff.

887
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,820
Jason Heathcliff.

888
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,900
I'll Heathcliff that bad boy.

889
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,260
Ding ding ding ding ding ding.

890
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,980
They rise up and pitch the bones of the fish.

891
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,220
Someone told me they got to feed a fish,

892
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,060
which was cool.

893
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,900
Oh, wow.

894
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,860
And they got to taste a plant.

895
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,540
But that's not what I'm in it for.

896
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,060
I'm in it for being on the boat,

897
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,820
taking in the sights, taking a break.

898
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,020
Because you can't go hard all day.

899
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,740
You need to break it up somehow.

900
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,140
Sure.

901
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,220
But this is where I go back to Mike's point.

902
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,820
Because I think Spaceship Earth is a great example

903
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,420
of the glory of the boring ride.

904
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,740
I'm just going to sit for a while.

905
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,660
If I doze a little bit in this, it's not a problem.

906
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,140
But I think that's as boring as I'll go.

907
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,980
I think my boring threshold.

908
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,260
That ride is going away.

909
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,100
It is changing.

910
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,420
It will no longer be boring.

911
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,860
This is the new boring ride.

912
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,700
I give them crap.

913
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,540
I think they can manage to still make it boring.

914
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,700
That ride's not going to be boring.

915
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,620
They're keeping a lot of the first scene robots.

916
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,660
They're recontextualizing.

917
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,180
Am I wrong?

918
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,820
Yeah, but if they're going in and redoing it.

919
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Yeah.

920
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,260
I've been looking at the water.

921
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,580
It's going to be screaming at me.

922
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,460
They're going to be blasting those fucking songs.

923
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,660
What was that song?

924
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
In Spaceship Earth?

925
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,460
Yeah, people have been speculating.

926
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
Characters are going in.

927
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,020
So what I understand, they've only

928
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,980
released one piece of artwork for the new Spaceship Earth.

929
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,380
And it is what looks like a huge Moana projection.

930
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,180
And everyone was like, what is this?

931
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,620
Because it looks like it's just going to be like, hi, I'm

932
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,100
Moana.

933
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
Join me on a trip across the planet.

934
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,500
And it's going to be all characters.

935
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,380
From what I heard, that artwork is not indicative

936
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,900
of what the full ride will be.

937
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,060
That was just one thing that they showed us.

938
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,180
But it's going to be a brand new redone ride when it's done.

939
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,780
My understanding was that it was mostly the same boring scenes

940
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,940
first.

941
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,060
And then it would be like IP, because it's

942
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,740
the power of storytelling now.

943
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,060
So Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel,

944
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,540
he's storytelling when he's painting.

945
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,500
Yeah, there's like twinkling.

946
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,100
And that ties.

947
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,220
There's a little Tinkerbell sort of almost thing.

948
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,860
Yeah, and that ties into like whatever,

949
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,820
Disney's new live action Rescuers Down Under that'll

950
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,940
come out in 2023.

951
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,300
And they'll be able to project that on the dome.

952
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,340
So that's my understanding of how it's tied together.

953
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,420
But who knows?

954
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,820
I had my one day funeral for it.

955
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,340
And I expect it to barely be enough Spaceship Earth,

956
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,580
but still be.

957
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,620
It's because it would be for someone who shows up to Epcot

958
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,380
and goes, oh, there's a thing in the bowl,

959
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,860
and goes in and gets the Disney ride they would expect.

960
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,380
I see.

961
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,900
Sure.

962
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,420
Yeah.

963
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,940
Is it going to be like it's always a good time playing

964
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,500
the whole ride, like where the Yeti is roaming?

965
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,460
Not Yeti, the you know what I'm talking about.

966
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,700
My husband Aonard that song.

967
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,740
So I don't think we get residuals.

968
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,180
But if we didn't, no, no.

969
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,340
Wow.

970
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,900
Can we do a whole episode?

971
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
That city, Carly Rae Jepsen, the good time?

972
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,540
Yeah.

973
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,300
He went to the, I don't think he's

974
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,860
going to want me to talk about this,

975
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,780
but he's never going to listen, so it's fine.

976
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,100
Now I'll know if he listened or not.

977
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,980
He won't.

978
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,380
He went to the video shoot, and I

979
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,900
was mad because he didn't let me go.

980
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,340
And Carly Rae Jepsen was there.

981
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,980
Oh my gosh.

982
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,460
Huge Carly Rae Jepsen fan.

983
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,580
Same.

984
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,980
Did you talk to, did you meet her?

985
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,100
No, because I wasn't allowed to go.

986
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,580
Imagine if Erin.

987
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,220
Oh, you weren't allowed to go.

988
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,660
Imagine if Erin spent her work day

989
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,260
going to hang out with CRJ, and you were stuck at home.

990
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,020
Oh my god.

991
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,620
Yes, the jealousy that would be.

992
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,260
Then we would not be on the same page.

993
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,820
But I mean, for my sake, I would love

994
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,420
that to be like, you know this song every time

995
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,500
I go on Spaceship Earth.

996
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,740
Yeah, well, I mean, it sounds like maybe it'll happen.

997
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,260
But that's not a Disney song.

998
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,900
I mean, once that's.

999
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,100
It's in the parade, though.

1000
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,660
Yeah, it's.

1001
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,980
Oh, do they use it in the parade?

1002
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
No, they use.

1003
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,900
Or it's in Wreck-It Ralph.

1004
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,420
That one's in Wreck-It Ralph.

1005
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,260
And then this one.

1006
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,420
It's remixed for the parade.

1007
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,540
Can we do this again?

1008
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,180
Oh, that.

1009
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,820
Uh-oh.

1010
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,260
Oh, that's the other All City song that's in the parade.

1011
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,060
OK, OK, I gotcha.

1012
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm mixing up my All City.

1013
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,380
I had a question in here somewhere.

1014
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,340
Oh, I know.

1015
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,980
OK, so you're pro-IP, but it sounds

1016
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,620
like maybe you aren't into what they're

1017
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
doing in Spaceship Earth.

1018
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,020
So I've been doing this for half a decade now,

1019
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,820
which is terrifying, because it feels like it's been five

1020
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,300
minutes, and I still know nothing.

1021
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,540
But I generally, I don't allow myself

1022
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,220
to feel nostalgia, because my job is writing

1023
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,460
about things that are new.

1024
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,820
So it's backwards if I am sad.

1025
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,980
It's going to be better if you're excited about what

1026
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
you're going to see.

1027
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Or, but I can't be against new things,

1028
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,380
because then I'd have no job.

1029
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,180
Right, sure.

1030
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,860
Well, if she doesn't want to see the new things,

1031
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,500
we want to find her to see the new things.

1032
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,740
So I have to approach it all with an open mind.

1033
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,860
But I had a few things, and I was like,

1034
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,220
these are my untouchables.

1035
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,020
And one of them was Spaceship Earth.

1036
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,540
OK.

1037
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,740
So I've said my piece, and now I've

1038
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,460
transferred my love of that attraction

1039
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,820
over to living with the land.

1040
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,860
So that now is the bastion of original Epcot.

1041
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,620
To me, that it has it all.

1042
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,620
It has flowing water through rocks.

1043
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,420
It has an animatronic dog.

1044
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,820
It has a little part of the beginning

1045
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,820
that feels like an old school Navi River journey.

1046
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Yes.

1047
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:37,820
Yeah.

1048
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,140
It has fruits and vegetables.

1049
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,380
It has herbs hanging from a thing that

1050
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,980
looks like a dry cleaning rack.

1051
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,420
It has everything.

1052
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,380
No, I will say, OK.

1053
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,580
I will admit, I think the hydroponics are fascinating.

1054
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,220
What about intercropping?

1055
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,980
It was starting to be nice about something,

1056
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,500
and then you swatted me down with a duller word.

1057
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
No.

1058
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,180
Very interesting.

1059
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,860
They demonstrate by growing coconut and cocoa together,

1060
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,300
around each other, so you can minimize water and soil usage.

1061
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,780
Go ahead.

1062
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,900
Jason, while you were maybe correct,

1063
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,420
I did not appreciate the tone and the way

1064
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
in which you cut Scott off there.

1065
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,620
I just want to say that.

1066
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,100
There we go.

1067
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,900
Civilty.

1068
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,980
If you're correct, that doesn't matter to me.

1069
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,900
I just think you should be a little more kind and a little

1070
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,420
more polite.

1071
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,900
I think you just said intercropping

1072
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,100
to me on National Podcast.

1073
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,260
You just said intercropping.

1074
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,740
Why don't you go run for something?

1075
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,220
All right, Scott, as you were saying.

1076
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,500
OK.

1077
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,060
What was I saying?

1078
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,540
OK.

1079
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,020
I like that there's animatronics.

1080
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,180
I'm really happy there's animatronics.

1081
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,980
I think we're overrating these animatronics a little bit.

1082
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,740
I think these are the supporting cast

1083
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,300
animatronics on a pirate's type experience.

1084
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,260
The buffalo's nodding his head.

1085
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,220
The chicken blinks.

1086
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,140
Why am I excited about these animatronics?

1087
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,500
I was just going to say, in defense of these animatronics,

1088
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:10,380
I do think a showy groundhog or a showy buffalo or something

1089
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,420
might take it away.

1090
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,580
You're right that these are not as distinct when

1091
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,460
it comes to animatronics.

1092
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,420
You're not getting a very specific weird faced

1093
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,460
pirate or a country bear.

1094
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,100
But I think if you're trying to really nail

1095
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,180
what they're trying to nail in this ride, they have to be subtle.

1096
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,540
Which is what are they trying to nail?

1097
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,420
They're trying to ultimate realism.

1098
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,740
An animatronic as boring as a real animal.

1099
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,500
Yes.

1100
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,540
So I think that they weren't going to make this like,

1101
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,300
it's not going to be like the end of Splash Mountain with an animal review.

1102
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,660
No.

1103
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
And you know what?

1104
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,460
Again, let me go back to the Mexico boat ride.

1105
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,700
This is kind of boring.

1106
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,660
I find delightful.

1107
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,780
And I'm not even just talking.

1108
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,700
I like the three Caballeros version.

1109
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,340
I really liked before the they had and all that.

1110
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,300
I like them both.

1111
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,220
I think I liked the 10% more.

1112
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,580
And I liked that, what is this?

1113
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,220
Why is there nothing for a while and then just

1114
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,380
a screen with cliff divers?

1115
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,980
I think that now that one I do see, I just I don't know.

1116
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,460
Maybe that one just spoke to me more.

1117
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,380
I think there's more, you know, I think there's more mood.

1118
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,140
I don't get any mood from living.

1119
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,780
Well, now this might be the spot to talk about some of the changes that were made

1120
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,940
because and I'm going to shout out Martin's vids

1121
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,220
who does very in intense recreations of old.

1122
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,380
Sometimes the only I watched a full ride through of listen to the land.

1123
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
I was shocked at how thorough it was.

1124
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:49,220
And the first few scenes were a little more ethereal and dreamlike.

1125
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,500
Yes, yes.

1126
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm thinking, yes.

1127
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,620
Plants light, light pulsing through plants while that kind of

1128
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,060
singer, songwriter, country song.

1129
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,980
You're not going to get a disagreement from me.

1130
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,740
I think all the way down to the lobby itself of the land pavilion,

1131
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,940
which if you saw any of these videos, there were like cool,

1132
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,060
like light up kind of umbrella things in the land.

1133
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,660
These were to name to name check a nepcot restaurant.

1134
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,100
These were electric umbrellas.

1135
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,860
The land looked cool as shit in 1980s.

1136
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,220
I cannot disagree that this adds so much to this.

1137
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,620
I will say also, I believe that the state of the land in the area

1138
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,140
inside when you walk into the pavilion hurts everything inside

1139
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,140
by the weird shopping like shitty shopping mall feeling of it now.

1140
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,500
I completely agree with you.

1141
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,140
And I think that hurts my it's it's like the pre it's like taking out a cool

1142
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,300
pre show and even if the ride doesn't change without the cool pre show,

1143
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm not as on board.

1144
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,900
I think the land was cool as hell.

1145
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,740
And now it is like it's like a supermarket.

1146
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,860
Yes, it is so boring.

1147
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,740
It does. I do believe that hurts.

1148
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,220
Soren and Epcot. Yeah.

1149
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,340
Soren is back there.

1150
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,460
It does not nearly have the cool facade we have out here.

1151
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,060
Yes. And I like for whatever reason, psychologically, I don't really

1152
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,460
feel it is as good as the one here, even though the exact same right.

1153
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,260
Well, because it doesn't make it's it's called the land pavilion.

1154
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,940
And that rides about sky.

1155
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,940
So that's true.

1156
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,780
But you're flying over the land.

1157
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,100
You're seeing the land, I suppose, except when you're over the water.

1158
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,220
I think the bigger hindrance to living with the land of all the changes

1159
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,380
is removing the cast member narrators.

1160
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,900
Yes. There used to be guides until 2006.

1161
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,260
Disagree. Narrating.

1162
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,860
You think the recording is fun.

1163
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,620
The last time I went out living with the land, I went on with

1164
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,580
I think it was two or three of my friends.

1165
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,180
And because there's no one ever on the ride, you can talk the whole time.

1166
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,020
So it's like going to a meal or going to a bar,

1167
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,900
except you're just watching something and you're on a boat and it's chill

1168
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,220
and you can gab. And it was amazing.

1169
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,260
I'd like to respond. I'd like a 45 to respond.

1170
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,820
Yes, Jason. Jason, 45 seconds on the clock.

1171
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,980
I will cut you off when it's done.

1172
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,380
Please don't go over. I will take that out of your time later.

1173
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,780
OK. A few years ago, I went on when it was narration

1174
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,580
and there was a lot of people on and

1175
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,260
the lack of a cast member in the boat made people think they could

1176
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:25,300
talk the whole time at full volume in many different languages.

1177
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,820
It was impressive.

1178
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,420
Well, not but demonstration, not necessarily about the

1179
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,380
not the same person speaking many languages, not the same person.

1180
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,900
Not necessarily at that same volume.

1181
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,660
If you are trying to listen to the narration and maybe they were translating

1182
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,980
it in real time, which would be very impressive.

1183
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,340
Jason's like, I'm trying to listen to the land here.

1184
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,500
I can't hear the land. Yeah.

1185
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,340
What is it saying?

1186
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,380
I think the presence of a guide kind of people.

1187
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,460
Well, it focuses your attention, certainly a little.

1188
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,980
I so here's what I'm discovering is that some of the arguments here

1189
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,660
acknowledge the boringness and that is an asset.

1190
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,220
I agree. Not a bug.

1191
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,340
Is that the phrase? Yes.

1192
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,180
It's a feature, not a feature.

1193
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,700
Not OK. OK.

1194
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,020
This is helping me get around this whole thing.

1195
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,820
Like that that kind of argument, I understand the charm of the doll.

1196
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,540
Because if you're trying to tell me this is actually an extremely exciting ride

1197
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,180
and I'm missing that somehow, then I don't know how to be in your brain.

1198
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,980
This doll is being part of the argument.

1199
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,820
It's a bit dull until you get to the greenhouse portion.

1200
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,540
That's where the magic happens.

1201
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,780
OK. OK. Because you're seeing things at various stages of growth.

1202
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,900
And sometimes you are seeing some gourds that are bigger than you ever seen.

1203
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,100
Gourds.

1204
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,020
Gourds. Have you, Scott Head, have you considered gourd size?

1205
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,060
Have you considered the type of gourds?

1206
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,140
Well, when you say gourd size, I think of state and county fairs.

1207
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,780
Where you can see gourds that are way bigger than these gourds.

1208
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,220
Can you see them shaped like Mickey Mouse?

1209
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,260
I do like that.

1210
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,580
I will I will I will give you a point.

1211
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,940
That's not how debates work, but I will donate a point to you.

1212
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,660
I'd like to ask a question to each member of the party in the room here.

1213
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,580
What is the largest gourd you've ever seen?

1214
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,580
Like, just has it been something truly insane?

1215
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,020
I'm trying to I went to a pumpkin patch once and I feel like I saw one that was like

1216
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,460
I'm trying to think maybe as big as the like the outline, the fireplace right here,

1217
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,340
which is probably like 200 pound, 250 like a pumpkin that size.

1218
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,500
Yeah. Yeah. I think I've seen about that.

1219
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,780
OK. OK. 250, we think.

1220
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,300
Maybe any bigger gourds.

1221
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,540
No, no big memories tied to gourds or pumpkin.

1222
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,060
Oh, I saw I where was I?

1223
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,580
I was at I think I went went to the Disneyland and there was a big, big gourd.

1224
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,580
That was he was also shaped like Mickey.

1225
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,060
He was right in the front of the park.

1226
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,980
I have seen the huge and all it was his face and the ears and his face was carved out.

1227
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,020
It out of it. Yeah.

1228
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,340
So I think it'd be that they have to grow that every year.

1229
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,300
Why they do it every year and they grow a new one.

1230
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:11,980
Yeah, that's right.

1231
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,100
So they have to probably like have the next one ready to go November 1st.

1232
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:21,140
The same turkey leg steroids they use for the emus for the emus.

1233
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,300
They inject emu DNA.

1234
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,860
They work an emu out really hard.

1235
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,540
They give it steroids and HGH

1236
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,740
and then they cut the legs off and they serve it to you and call it a turkey.

1237
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,780
And Walt's frozen head is in the haunted mansion.

1238
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,540
That's right. And they've also one of the bus.

1239
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,580
If you cracked open one of the bus, that would be you'd see Walt.

1240
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,060
And it's preserved.

1241
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,420
They've shot it with steroids.

1242
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,180
They shot it with HGH and he's ready to go.

1243
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,100
And they solve his cancer, I guess.

1244
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,260
Tell me more about the screen now.

1245
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,820
So what else am I looking for in the next?

1246
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,020
Next time I go, what am I?

1247
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,780
Because I'll go.

1248
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,740
Well, I can't tell you what's in season right now because I haven't been in a few weeks.

1249
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,380
What do we think is the best season in living in the land?

1250
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,340
Well, because it's a greenhouse year round, things are popping.

1251
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,060
Yeah, they can just stick in the cycle things in and out.

1252
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,980
Does anyone have a seasonal plant in their head?

1253
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,860
I mean the pumpkin.

1254
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,700
How about a Guinness World Record plant?

1255
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,460
OK.

1256
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,620
The tomato tree that produced 32,000 tomatoes in a 16 month period.

1257
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,940
Yeah, but bulk amount, that's a size I think.

1258
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,380
What, do you hate tomatoes?

1259
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,820
Come on.

1260
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,700
I certainly don't, but I read that stat.

1261
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,220
I want to, it's like the snake on the Indiana Jones ride.

1262
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,380
I want to see a big snake.

1263
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,300
I don't understand a bunch of little snakes.

1264
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,540
You want that the tomato that Bart grew or who grew it?

1265
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,620
T'Lisa grew it?

1266
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,620
No, no, no, no.

1267
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,020
When they threw it, it's Skinner's butt.

1268
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,020
T'Lisa grew it is like a world hunger solving tactic.

1269
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,980
And then Bart threw it at Skinner's butt.

1270
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,540
That's right.

1271
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,340
I do love seeing the eggplants.

1272
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,100
What's that?

1273
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,260
I like the eggplants.

1274
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,620
That sounds pretty nice.

1275
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,420
That's a highlight.

1276
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,620
You see a big row of eggplants?

1277
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,740
That's kind of cool.

1278
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,260
All right.

1279
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,300
Vertical plants, the plants that are growing with the exposed roots

1280
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,820
in the air.

1281
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,420
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,620
That's very impressive.

1283
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:15,620
See, there's a lot of, it's like what you want from a museum,

1284
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,860
except you don't have to stand.

1285
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,100
And there's the added novelty of a boat ride.

1286
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,740
Let me propose this.

1287
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,340
I think that if this were in a museum, I would be obsessed with it.

1288
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,220
I would probably be telling you guys, we have to do an episode about this

1289
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,580
boat ride in a museum.

1290
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,780
So if I'm judging it by museum standards, it's amazing.

1291
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,260
If I'm judging it by theme park standards, it's very boring to me.

1292
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,620
Is there a part of it that you can say-

1293
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,420
I just made you very sad with this.

1294
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,780
I'm trying to find the pictures of Jason and I on the ride.

1295
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,460
After this episode, there will be a petition to get me removed from the podcast.

1296
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,780
We will see this.

1297
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,780
Did you go on Carousel of Progress when you were there?

1298
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,220
Yes.

1299
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,420
Did you enjoy that?

1300
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,980
Yes.

1301
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,220
There is no reason why you shouldn't love this ride if you liked that.

1302
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:01,740
Disagree.

1303
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,460
Robots.

1304
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:08,860
So many robots, a depiction of a bizarre 1994 future that we're already past.

1305
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:14,300
But this whole ride is showing you truly what we're going to do about food

1306
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,300
when there's too many people running amok around the earth.

1307
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,820
Yes.

1308
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,540
Er.

1309
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,780
This is the actual version of the final scene of Carousel of Progress.

1310
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,220
How many rides?

1311
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,420
It's not going to be some psycho oven.

1312
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,380
No, the final scene of Carousel of Progress.

1313
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,500
Yeah, it's ovens going amok and it's grandma playing video games.

1314
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:36,300
Yeah, but we're going to be eating pills for meals unless the stuff they're working out in that lab happens.

1315
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,780
Well, I'm not against what they're doing in the lab.

1316
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,460
I'm very happy with what they're doing in the lab.

1317
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,100
I just don't know if I need to be going into the lab.

1318
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,420
I mean, how many-

1319
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,580
I don't want to bother them.

1320
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,180
They're going to get more work done if I don't go in there.

1321
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,340
How many rides started with such a noble purpose?

1322
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:59,580
With a major educational institute consulting, with the US Department of Agriculture working hand in hand

1323
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:05,660
to grow fruits and vegetables used around the corner at Garden Grill and Sunshine Seasons.

1324
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,740
People complain about theme parks being a simulation or fake or phony.

1325
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,700
This is reality. This is real.

1326
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,820
This is the earth.

1327
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,140
I have the photos here in front of me of Jason and I on the boat ride.

1328
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,620
Here's just a few of the things.

1329
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,180
Yes, please.

1330
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,260
Here's one that says pineapple.

1331
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,020
And Jason's looking at it.

1332
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,260
Oh, wow.

1333
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,100
Yeah, pineapple.

1334
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,620
And it's used on the Kluah Kluah Kluah pork and slider.

1335
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,940
But I don't know if that means that pineapple or pineapple.

1336
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,980
It's a good question.

1337
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,820
Because I know that I once ordered a salad the same day that I dragged my husband on this ride at dinner at Flying Fish.

1338
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,300
And it was before they redid Flying Fish.

1339
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,300
So I don't know if they have the same produce from there anymore.

1340
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,740
But he's like, you're going to buy this twenty dollar salad.

1341
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:58,060
Like he was so pissed that I got this like dumb leafy green salad just because it was those special greens.

1342
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,380
It's featured on the ride.

1343
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,020
But it was like they were shouting it from the rooftops that it was a greenhouse salad.

1344
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,740
Interesting. You're probably right that since they're bulk ordering all that food,

1345
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,300
it just like it's coming from somewhere else and it's cheaper and not as good quality as what they grow in there.

1346
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:18,020
But they put like, for instance, this photo, it says banana and it says, oh, you know what?

1347
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,580
I think I cracked it. It's sponsored by Chiquita.

1348
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,060
I bet they have a banana and pineapple monopoly throughout the resort.

1349
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,860
And so they're highlighting their goods.

1350
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh, interesting, because this one is used on the banana almond sundae at the it's the shimmering sips Epcot International Food and Wine Festival.

1351
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:41,660
And you zoom into that sign, you zoom past Jason, who is looking observantly.

1352
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,780
As if to take mental notes.

1353
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:50,380
I was in deep consideration and thought because I went through my photos just now.

1354
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,020
It's like, oh, I have no photos of this.

1355
00:50:52,020 --> 00:51:00,340
I just have photos of the just a reminder for us to talk about at some point, the insane signs that ring pop century.

1356
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,660
We forgot to do something.

1357
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,020
Oh, sure. Yes.

1358
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,660
And a lot of Skyliner footage.

1359
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,500
Are you guys going to put these online somewhere?

1360
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,220
Is this just people listening to us?

1361
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
No, no, no.

1362
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,460
We'll post those.

1363
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,860
Listen to the pics.

1364
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,940
Here's one. I think this is coffee.

1365
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,860
They're growing coffee.

1366
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,820
And then it's they write the doughnut box under it.

1367
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:27,860
Fresh yeast doughnut with coffee, sugar and chocolate espresso beans served with coffee.

1368
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,700
Sounds great.

1369
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,500
I want to I want to hear more about your husband.

1370
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,980
Does he does he actually dislike all of that?

1371
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,300
Where do you actually calibrate his theme park?

1372
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:47,300
He wants to go and do only the things that he wants to do, which is basically what he would call the good rides, which are thrill rides.

1373
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,420
And then he wants to leave, which I respect.

1374
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,620
What's just in it for like the hits?

1375
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,860
Sure. And then it's like, it's too hot and then leaves.

1376
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,260
Sure. What's the most boring ride he likes?

1377
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,500
Oh.

1378
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,540
Like pirates, for instance.

1379
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,420
He won't go on pirates.

1380
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,260
Really? Oh, interesting.

1381
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,740
OK. And why is that?

1382
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,420
Because it's too long, too slow.

1383
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,900
He's in for the hits.

1384
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,020
And he doesn't consider pirates a hit?

1385
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,860
No, because he just wants to go on a roller coaster.

1386
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,940
Loves a space mountain.

1387
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,580
OK. We'll do a big thunder.

1388
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,900
We'll usually do Haunted Mansion because I ask him to.

1389
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,860
If he's annoying me, I will take him on.

1390
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,620
It's a small world.

1391
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,380
But like I made it.

1392
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:34,500
We were in Shanghai a few weeks ago and I made him go on Peter Pan there because their Peter Pan is exceptional.

1393
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,860
Oh, because they made it like after 2010.

1394
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:44,260
Like, I don't know when they designed it, but it came out in 2015, 2017.

1395
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,540
What year is it now?

1396
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,780
2020. 2016.

1397
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,900
2016. That park opened in 2016.

1398
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,620
Yeah, 2016.

1399
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,780
And so it's Peter Pan, but with new technology and it's beautiful.

1400
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,500
And I kept being like, isn't this amazing?

1401
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,580
And he was like, it's Peter Pan.

1402
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,700
So. Interesting.

1403
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,540
OK. OK.

1404
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,500
But just because he won't go on this doesn't mean he's right.

1405
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,260
Sure.

1406
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,540
I think it really comes down to, you know, you want to see something special.

1407
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,580
Shibuya Crossing is special.

1408
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,900
A sunset is special.

1409
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,900
Yes.

1410
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,060
Neither one is better or worse than the other.

1411
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,900
Just different.

1412
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,580
Sure.

1413
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,820
So, yes, it's slow.

1414
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,580
Yes, my dad falls asleep on it every time, but still, it's a nice break.

1415
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:29,420
It's a nice time to catch up and talk at a moderate tone or people don't fully hear what you're saying.

1416
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,540
So you don't disrupt their journey.

1417
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,500
It's just nice.

1418
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,100
It's cold, but you're still kind of outdoors.

1419
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,060
It's very moody at night.

1420
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,700
No, here we go.

1421
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,220
Oh, interesting.

1422
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,420
I've never done it at night.

1423
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,700
Moody.

1424
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,980
I think I upset you the most by saying that I don't think there's any vibe to this ride.

1425
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,020
I think there's no.

1426
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,420
Yes.

1427
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:48,940
So you're very.

1428
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,460
OK.

1429
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,300
That adds to it, you think?

1430
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,820
Because that pavilion, like you said, it feels like a mall that hasn't announced its closing yet.

1431
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,300
You know, where like some of the main stores aren't there, but like people are still getting paid.

1432
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,900
They work there.

1433
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,140
How are they going to fill the Mervins?

1434
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,300
Now, that's interesting to me because that's one of Scott's favorite places to be.

1435
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,300
Yes.

1436
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:17,380
But I don't like really beige, styleless malls, which is what I think the current colors and architecture of the land.

1437
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,380
I, as I said, loved the land for the first 10 years or so.

1438
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,900
And I think it's like I think it's deeply bland these days.

1439
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,700
Living with the bland.

1440
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,780
I can't be living with the bland.

1441
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,180
Let's touch on something we haven't talked about yet.

1442
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:45,700
The original ideas for the land, which was going to be these giant biomes, these giant greenhouse crystal things.

1443
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,820
This is good.

1444
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,580
And that quickly got scaled back from the blue sky.

1445
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:59,420
But the ride was originally pitched as a suspended dark ride called Blueprints of Nature.

1446
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,740
Okay.

1447
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,700
That was.

1448
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,060
I've never heard any of this.

1449
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:04,940
This is news to me.

1450
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,540
Okay.

1451
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:14,820
Traveling underground to a carousel theater pre-show, guests would be introduced to the attractions host, the Land Keeper.

1452
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,340
The land.

1453
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,460
We've heard of the Land Keeper.

1454
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,980
We haven't discussed him in a while, I feel like.

1455
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,300
Oh, boy.

1456
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,820
I don't know if I believed in fate until this moment.

1457
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:39,860
From there, the Land Keeper would take guests on a hot air balloon trip through the four seasons and a series of simulated biomes located in greenhouses at the front of the pavilion.

1458
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:45,540
This was scaled back, the craft came aboard as a sponsor and it became a boat ride.

1459
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,740
A lot of these ideas were rolled over into Journey, into Imagination.

1460
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,460
Wow.

1461
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,980
He became the.

1462
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,180
We looked at some pictures.

1463
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,700
I think when we talked about Land Keeper, which feels like it might have been two years ago already.

1464
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,340
I forgot.

1465
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,900
Yeah, I forgot and relearned Land Keeper.

1466
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,020
He looked like this.

1467
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,660
Whoa, like a Colonel Sanders.

1468
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,620
Like a rainbow.

1469
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,700
I can't see that far, but it just looks like a Flamin' Hot Cheeto in a rainbow sash.

1470
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,100
Like a ripped orange.

1471
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,740
He's quite far from me.

1472
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,740
Yeah.

1473
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,020
Or no, Rip Taylor.

1474
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,860
He looks a little bit like Rip Taylor.

1475
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,700
Oh, I was looking at the thing next to him.

1476
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,780
There was a red blob.

1477
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,860
Well, that was him.

1478
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,420
That was a closer shot of him.

1479
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,380
So he is almost he has a very Captain EO like shirt.

1480
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Yeah.

1481
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,660
Yes.

1482
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,900
He has like a rainbow stripe across a white.

1483
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,620
A little pocket.

1484
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,420
A little pocket.

1485
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,100
He looks.

1486
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,660
He's very much you could see like they were going for Dreamfinder relation.

1487
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,260
He's like some weird link between EO and Dreamfinder.

1488
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:44,860
Yes.

1489
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,860
Wow.

1490
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:46,460
Can.

1491
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,020
OK.

1492
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,220
Does any.

1493
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:48,500
Can.

1494
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:55,340
Will anyone say that living with the land is better than that would have been?

1495
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:55,940
Of course.

1496
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,460
Yeah.

1497
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,900
I couldn't possibly.

1498
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,420
I'm very happy.

1499
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,300
Jason.

1500
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,460
I'm very happy with it.

1501
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:10,940
Well, I mean, this is a problem we run into on the show a lot is does the blue sky version

1502
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,980
a place you could never been?

1503
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,060
Is that realistic to hold that standard?

1504
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,220
Hold hold actual things that do exist to that standard?

1505
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,740
Well, I will never ride the Knights and White Satin ride.

1506
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,260
There's no she's a little mermaid ride.

1507
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:32,740
We've seen the better version of the DVD of Little Mermaid, what the cooler version

1508
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,900
would be than the one we have.

1509
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,740
But is it fair of us to judge the new one based on the seemingly ride that would be better?

1510
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,900
Yeah, it's got the land keeper.

1511
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,580
It's better.

1512
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,140
I unfortunately have to agree with Scott.

1513
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,140
It's got this guy with a rainbow that's coming out of his top hat.

1514
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,340
And how is that going to not be better?

1515
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,700
We're an accountant for the rainbow.

1516
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,340
Yeah.

1517
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,500
I mean, the land keeper, unfortunately, yes, puts it over the top.

1518
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,620
Honestly, like the ride itself sounds more exciting, more cool or whatever.

1519
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,060
But as long as there's just a white haired old man.

1520
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,620
Why can't they just remove this guy to the boat ride?

1521
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,620
Because that seems like a crappy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where instead of candy

1522
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,980
you get grass, like it's just pointless.

1523
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,900
And also that's you say crappy.

1524
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:20,340
I am a little I do have a few questions about the land because one, if you're it's the land

1525
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,980
is dirt and greenery and that's an all white suit.

1526
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,900
You've got to be a little crazy.

1527
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,500
And also, like, you know, it looked like he's in perfect health.

1528
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:35,060
And you if you want to push what you give with the land, the bounty the land gives you

1529
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:39,580
to sustain you, I don't know if this guy is bulbous.

1530
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,860
Skyseeds, you know, certainly true.

1531
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,020
I mean, maybe though he you know, maybe, yes, he is.

1532
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,900
He's got like a sip and savor pass to one of these festivals.

1533
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,780
He seems like he's mostly interested in what they're doing with the land and like Islay

1534
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,820
or Dublin. But yes, I look, I hear what you're saying.

1535
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,500
But also we like, you know, I I'll just speak for myself.

1536
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,060
I really like see I like the rides being connected with characters.

1537
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:09,140
If we have we open up the the Finder world, you know, we opened up the keeper world.

1538
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,540
On our our downtown Disney ordeal.

1539
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,740
This is the Finder world.

1540
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,820
Multiple finders everywhere.

1541
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,620
And though he's a keeper, you classify him as a finder.

1542
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,860
Yes, clearly a cousin of the dream finder.

1543
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,860
Yes. That's what I'm basically. Yes, I'm saying so keepers can be finders.

1544
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,820
Keepers can be finders.

1545
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,860
I want everyone to repeat that with us who are listening in your car.

1546
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,820
If you're alone right now, keepers can be finders.

1547
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,380
Yes. Like you guys said it.

1548
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,340
Now, the the thing, though, if they had built the ride like this,

1549
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,740
they may have pegged it for demolition quicker.

1550
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,060
But you would have gotten more out of date.

1551
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:54,060
It's more it's more out of date quicker, more complicated to run.

1552
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,100
You're saying they would have bulldozed the landkeeper by now.

1553
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:02,500
The landkeeper by now by making it a more practical functioning.

1554
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,700
He would have been replaced.

1555
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,580
He would have been replaced by a toilet.

1556
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,300
Like a dream finder was on Journey.

1557
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,860
Well, it's the little toaster, the brave little toaster and his new friend, the toilet.

1558
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,780
The brave little toilet.

1559
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,460
They would have added to add IP to the right.

1560
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,580
They would have added the brave little toaster.

1561
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,340
Hey, it's me.

1562
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:27,140
What if instead of toast, I put a stink bug in me?

1563
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,740
Yeah, I mean, toilet on the ceiling.

1564
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,500
They got the toilet.

1565
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,540
We're talking about the redo of Figment's ride, which is just a travesty.

1566
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,260
Yeah, which I assume you agree with us on that.

1567
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,820
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

1568
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,260
That final room scares me every time.

1569
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,180
It is scary. Yeah.

1570
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,780
I'm a grown woman. I know it's coming every time.

1571
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,100
The big buzz thing that what is it?

1572
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,500
It's like a big horn.

1573
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,300
Like walls drop. Yeah.

1574
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,220
Yeah. Loud.

1575
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,260
It scares the shit out of me.

1576
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,020
It's really unpleasant.

1577
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,380
It's like horror nights when you can see.

1578
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,460
Yeah. Horror nights specifically, when you see something coming and you go,

1579
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,580
oh, there's a person right there.

1580
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
They're going to scare me.

1581
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:08,820
And then they have the sound and light cue, which you cannot help but be scared by that.

1582
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,260
So it's an extra thing that even if you know it's coming,

1583
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,660
it's not it's still your body's going to have a visceral reaction to it.

1584
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,060
Yeah. Scariest ride in Disney World.

1585
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,940
I have a thought while we're talking about this ride.

1586
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:25,580
OK, we have just said a ride that you would almost certainly list as lesser than living with the land.

1587
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:31,580
What other rides at Epcot Center would you put or attractions?

1588
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,140
Well, I'll open it up.

1589
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,580
Would you say are lesser?

1590
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,100
The what? What does living with the land outrank all of them?

1591
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,940
Come on.

1592
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,460
I think at this point in my life, I think you agree.

1593
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,820
Mission space, mission space, mission space for it all.

1594
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,140
It goes on. I would rather know.

1595
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,060
No, no, no. We're saying mission spaces.

1596
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,580
We're listing what's worse.

1597
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,780
Wait, I'm saying what is worse than living with the land.

1598
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,740
Mission space. Yes.

1599
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,540
Yeah. 100 percent. Mission space.

1600
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,180
Test track at this point. Not kept up, not maintained.

1601
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,340
Feels awful.

1602
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,860
Like my car will break for me at this point if I don't do it.

1603
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:12,340
I don't need to be driving a fake car to see if it can resist wind.

1604
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,380
We all slammed into our seatbelts while we were still next to the ride operator.

1605
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,700
Something went wrong. Like that was the start of I haven't.

1606
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,900
I haven't done it lately and I haven't gotten to do it with the Tron.

1607
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,340
Eskvibe. That is not what it was.

1608
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,140
Mike, you've done your as the moderate.

1609
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,460
I'm thinking here. I don't want to declare both of them equal.

1610
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:40,540
I am not denying that Test Track has its issues and maybe maybe belongs

1611
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,460
in the scrap heap at this point.

1612
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,860
Maybe that's controversial. Like, it sounds like it's not.

1613
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,220
I mean, we didn't get Jason went on on the trip, but we didn't go on it.

1614
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,740
I had gone on. I've been on it a couple of times.

1615
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:57,260
I will say these are my personal opinions and not those of my employer,

1616
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,660
which is myself, but enjoy whatever they would.

1617
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,700
Yes, this is not between podcast guest Carly Wiesel and writer journalist.

1618
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,420
I'm like, oh, that story I just wrote of all the rides ranked

1619
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,340
that does not line up with this.

1620
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,820
That is like those aren't your opinions as much.

1621
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,700
I understand for many reasons, certain rides are considered

1622
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,140
and will be deemed better than others.

1623
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:22,740
But according to me for my own life and how I spend my time. Sure.

1624
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,340
I'm going on the boat ride through the greenhouse.

1625
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:30,700
Do you remember from your list in like this public facing recommend

1626
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,420
recommendations list that is less your personal opinions?

1627
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,820
Do you remember what you ranked lower than living with land?

1628
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,340
I actually I redid it like a month ago.

1629
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,060
I'll look it up to the glutton for punishment.

1630
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,260
Because I think it's post this woman's address.

1631
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,340
Oh, it's not your phone number.

1632
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:52,060
It was I got some real interesting screenshots from friends

1633
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,580
who saw it being shared on the Internet.

1634
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,660
Nice. That's probably all.

1635
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:00,100
But if I'm going to Epcot these days, which is usually alone

1636
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,380
or with my family or with some friends, it's not like my once

1637
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,620
in a lifetime trip, like I'm spending my time there.

1638
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,980
I'm hanging out.

1639
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,700
I'm I mean, before I would really only go on Spaceship Earth.

1640
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,140
That was the one I had to go on.

1641
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,500
And now that I've kind of said goodbye to that.

1642
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,780
Living with the land is my jam.

1643
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:20,580
Do we have an official like goes down for refurbishment?

1644
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,140
I don't believe so.

1645
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,420
I don't think they've announced it.

1646
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,060
In my brain, it's in hospice.

1647
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,820
And it's kind of like if I get to see him again, great.

1648
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,700
It feels like a masculine.

1649
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,340
Is that going to be they're going to have it down for the 50th?

1650
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,620
I believe so. Right.

1651
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,780
Well, I would say yes, but that's only things I've heard from the rumor mill.

1652
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,420
So I can't really trust it.

1653
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,940
TBD. OK.

1654
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,140
Now, do you is there any truth to that?

1655
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,420
And I know there is.

1656
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,780
But when will Galaxy's Edge get converted to be based on the live action?

1657
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,300
Latin. Oh, didn't that happen last week?

1658
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,500
I think. Oh, did I miss it? Oh, yeah.

1659
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,100
It's already. Wow.

1660
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,260
Yeah, we went on Rise of Jafar's Gang.

1661
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,740
That was the ride.

1662
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:04,780
I was about to make a joke.

1663
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,500
It really get me in trouble.

1664
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,540
Oh, oh, man. It's a Latin.

1665
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,540
OK, I'm looking for the ranking.

1666
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,180
Oh, interesting.

1667
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,460
Forty nine grand fiesta tour.

1668
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,540
Haven't seen living with the land yet.

1669
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,220
Wonder what I ranked it.

1670
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,340
Oh, sad. Oh, no.

1671
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,300
A real solid 44. OK.

1672
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,900
Is the only up got ride grand fiesta tour?

1673
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
43 just above it.

1674
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,900
A little bit better.

1675
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,540
I said Primeval World because it is a coaster.

1676
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,740
OK. So it has to be tomato ride.

1677
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:38,220
Are you not then a fan of grand fiesta tour?

1678
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,740
I think it's fine.

1679
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,460
I really wish that you could drink a margarita on it.

1680
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,300
I think that would be a game changer.

1681
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,980
I think if it was like the history of tequila or something,

1682
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,380
it would be a hit.

1683
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,060
And I would like to see plants and manufacturing.

1684
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,060
Yeah. Now or now or in my.

1685
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,060
OK, let's replace the entrances.

1686
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,500
You put living with the land in the Mexico Pavilion.

1687
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,060
You get that great the Mexico Pavilion.

1688
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,900
Amazing. Oh, my God.

1689
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,700
One of the greatest things you get, as you're saying, some margaritas.

1690
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,860
You can look at cool little trinkets and stuff.

1691
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,700
I love it. We all love it.

1692
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,100
If living with the land was put in there,

1693
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,580
I think the thing goes up a letter grade.

1694
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:29,220
Does that imply that the beginning of the ride goes through past the restaurant?

1695
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,260
Yes.

1696
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:35,460
Then yes, because that I think is a big reason to like grand fiesta tour more

1697
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,980
because it's atmosphere.

1698
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,020
That room is cool.

1699
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,060
That's like Blue Bayou.

1700
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,580
That's like beginning of pirates.

1701
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,620
Blue Bayou?

1702
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:46,260
Living with the land literally goes under a restaurant.

1703
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,380
Under though.

1704
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,500
It isn't quite as foreign to see.

1705
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,180
It doesn't quite have the the ambiance.

1706
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,220
That's what it is.

1707
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,820
Not you're not in a swamp.

1708
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,260
You're not in a cinematic.

1709
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,060
See, grand fiesta tour is literally downstreaming the ambiance of the rest of the pavilion

1710
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,340
and just riding it through.

1711
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,020
And then you're like, wait, why am I on this?

1712
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,060
This ride stinks.

1713
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,020
Living with the land, you like start, you know, you start with a bunch of what's happening here.

1714
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,260
Why is there flowing water across rocks?

1715
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,540
Like it's beautiful.

1716
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,380
And then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I'm outside.

1717
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,660
Am I know it's a greenhouse.

1718
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,380
What's a greenhouse?

1719
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,020
Let me learn.

1720
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,140
I think maybe this is where just the personal.

1721
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,060
I think I just don't feel those feelings.

1722
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,500
I don't think I like I'm not swept up in the mood.

1723
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,180
University of Arizona horticultural expert Dr. Carl Hodges talk about his his work.

1724
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,860
How is their program?

1725
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,900
I didn't apply there.

1726
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:38,980
Dr. Hodges.

1727
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,580
Dr. Augustine.

1728
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,300
Dr. Hodges.

1729
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,500
He seemed very intelligent.

1730
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:52,020
I believe who who is the singer in in the same Epcot special, which I only saw the clip of.

1731
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:57,860
I didn't see his introduction, but someone he sits on on riding the boat ride,

1732
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,300
strumming a guitar, singing this land is your land.

1733
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:02,840
Yikes.

1734
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,900
Going through the ride.

1735
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,700
Here we go.

1736
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,140
Here's let me let me direct it a little more

1737
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:15,300
because I sense that this is a room that is not 100% on frozen ever after.

1738
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,460
Not me.

1739
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,740
I truly love frozen ever after.

1740
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,060
Carla.

1741
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:21,700
I really do.

1742
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,900
I'm weary to say this publicly.

1743
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,860
You don't have to.

1744
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,980
But I hate it.

1745
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:29,780
Hate it.

1746
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,420
Jason.

1747
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:30,900
That's fine.

1748
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:32,660
I'm with Mike.

1749
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,220
I love it.

1750
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:33,700
I love it.

1751
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,660
And I love Maelstrom.

1752
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,740
Now I Maelstrom way better to me.

1753
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,660
I wish there was still Maelstrom, but.

1754
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:38,980
Sure.

1755
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,100
I do.

1756
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,260
I I do think they did.

1757
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,060
They did a good job.

1758
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:43,940
It's good robots.

1759
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,380
It's that that good robots.

1760
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,580
Every scene is good.

1761
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,820
Every scene has a little something that I like.

1762
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,580
Rock monster thing.

1763
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,620
I don't want to get you in trouble.

1764
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,140
Say what you're willing to say.

1765
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,180
I mean, I don't want to turn this into a frozen ever after.

1766
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:56,900
Sure.

1767
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,580
We can do that at a different episode.

1768
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:04,100
But it won one of the most painful rides at Walt Disney World.

1769
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,340
That shift when you get to Elsa where you go, it's so painful.

1770
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:08,820
Really?

1771
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,180
Extremely painful.

1772
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,340
On like knees or back?

1773
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:12,740
Back.

1774
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,420
It just jolts you to the side.

1775
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,860
Then when you're going backwards as she's singing, you're going through

1776
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,260
a tunnel that is completely unthemed.

1777
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:25,540
There is no excuse for a Walt Disney World attraction having a stretch of a ride that

1778
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,900
is just black nothing.

1779
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,140
It is a long black tunnel.

1780
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,580
Like put up.

1781
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,620
We're seeing magic.

1782
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,940
And then it stops and it goes shh and they put some smoke in and then it's just black.

1783
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,220
It doesn't make any sense.

1784
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,700
I've never even noticed that.

1785
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,780
You won't not notice it now.

1786
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,420
Okay.

1787
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,540
It infuriates me.

1788
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:50,420
Also, the contouring of the projection, their face is projected on, but just you guys don't

1789
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:50,820
know contouring.

1790
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,300
It's weird.

1791
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:51,620
It's weird.

1792
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,420
I know what you're talking about.

1793
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,700
I get what you're saying.

1794
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,900
Like barely their neck and then you're like, that's not them.

1795
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,700
And they're like, it's the most advanced animatronic ever.

1796
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,980
And you're like, she can move a finger.

1797
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,620
Like what?

1798
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,340
I don't care.

1799
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,300
I'm not impressed.

1800
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,740
They've already the footage they have shown of like the bell animatronic or the bell in

1801
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,340
the beat like that are coming.

1802
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,780
It's like, well, this already looks rough.

1803
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,100
Like this already looks rough compared to this great.

1804
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,100
I went on it like two days after it opened.

1805
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,220
It looked bad.

1806
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:25,300
The solution of the shiny monitor faces that Ann and Elsa have is a little strange.

1807
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,900
I feel like I forget which scene is bad.

1808
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,340
I mean, I have to rewatch it.

1809
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,580
There is one scene that looks extra weird.

1810
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,020
The very last one to me.

1811
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:38,180
Maybe it's the last one that looks really like in Haunted Mansion, but except there's

1812
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,300
two of them and it's creepier.

1813
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:40,980
It's bad.

1814
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,100
That's why I'm like living with the land really might be my favorite attraction.

1815
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,780
Also, and I know Maelstrom is insane.

1816
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,220
Like, yeah, I get it.

1817
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,580
Kids nowadays don't like mouse because it was insane.

1818
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:59,060
But you know what I think is more interesting that frozen is the culture and people of Norway.

1819
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,820
And call me a square.

1820
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,820
But I guess I'm just old fashioned.

1821
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,260
I guess I'm just old fashioned.

1822
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:06,740
Mm hmm.

1823
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,260
I think we would call you old fashioned.

1824
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,700
That podcast that you were on, Tomorrow Society.

1825
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,500
Yeah.

1826
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,540
I think it was on that.

1827
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,660
I listened to a guy who worked on the Maelstrom and we'll do a Maelstrom episode.

1828
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,380
I'm dying to do that.

1829
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:17,700
Yeah.

1830
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:22,420
Like he had a guy on who worked on that ride who explained that it is exactly what you

1831
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:22,580
think.

1832
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,060
It was fun and validating to hear this.

1833
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,500
That there was a version that they did that was like all trolls and scary stuff.

1834
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,180
And then so he said, no, no, no, they're not going to like that.

1835
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,140
Do all Vikings.

1836
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,060
And then they presented it to the Norway people and they were like, no, no, no, we are about

1837
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,100
oil barracks.

1838
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:41,620
And then Marty Sklar says, okay, you have to figure out how to make something out of all this

1839
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,660
that makes everybody happy.

1840
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,540
And that's why that ride is this bizarre mix of all of that.

1841
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,620
Which I love.

1842
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,620
I think that it's insane.

1843
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,900
It's kind of insane.

1844
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,300
I love.

1845
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,340
I think that's a great necessity as a mother of invention.

1846
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,700
And frozen ever after is a little more like Apollo 13.

1847
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,380
Like, all right, they got this.

1848
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,780
We need to make this fit into this.

1849
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,940
And we got these two that we got.

1850
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,380
This is what they have in their ship.

1851
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:12,020
Do you think frozen ever after is worse than the Little Mermaid ride?

1852
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,300
Oh, God.

1853
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,900
I think expectations.

1854
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,780
Oh, man.

1855
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,700
I have the same issue with both.

1856
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,100
Okay.

1857
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:20,900
All right.

1858
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:25,140
A wonderfully done sidekick, but terribly replicated lead character.

1859
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,180
Yeah.

1860
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,460
Yeah.

1861
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:27,700
Yeah.

1862
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,740
But I think they got Ariel better than Enel.

1863
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:35,620
I'm going to have to say Ariel wins because you're in a little shell.

1864
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,420
Even if her face scares the shit out of me.

1865
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:45,620
Plus, Buddy Hackett, at least to sound alike.

1866
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,820
Points for Buddy Hackett in a ride.

1867
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,740
Buddy Hackett sound alike.

1868
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,260
I call me old fashioned.

1869
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,820
You enjoy the humor of a Buddy Hackett type.

1870
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,180
I love a Buddy Hackett.

1871
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,140
Shubuppy.

1872
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:57,860
Hackett in.

1873
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,620
His performance of Shubuppy terrific.

1874
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,260
If Hackett was doing all of Gadd's roles.

1875
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:02,740
Oh, my God.

1876
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,540
If Hackett was LaFou.

1877
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,020
Oh.

1878
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,940
If we could get a Hackett.

1879
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:11,380
If we could get, you know how they bring celebrities back for commercials.

1880
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,700
Jimmy Stewart learned a great voice actor in his last role, Five Oaks Goes West.

1881
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,500
Oh, yeah.

1882
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,620
He's a sheriff dog.

1883
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,540
There was actually a couple of minutes ago when you were delivering a line and I said,

1884
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,900
he sounds like Jimmy Stewart.

1885
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,180
Your voice is slowly turning into Jimmy Stewart.

1886
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,420
I do want to say for the record before everyone yells at me on the internet

1887
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:34,340
that I don't really go on the aerial ride, but I do go on Frozen Ever After

1888
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,580
because every time my friend Todd Martens, who is a wonderful Disney reporter,

1889
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,660
he loves Frozen and he loves that ride.

1890
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:45,380
And we have gotten into very public fights about this at like one in the morning.

1891
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,260
And everyone's like, you guys got to calm down because I hate it and he loves it.

1892
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,220
And so I keep going on it to try to learn.

1893
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:54,980
I want to know why he loves it so much and I can't get there.

1894
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,620
So if you see me on Frozen Ever After, I'm not a hypocrite.

1895
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:01,460
I promise I'm truly just trying to do right by Todd and learn.

1896
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,060
You swear you're not having fun.

1897
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:04,740
Well, I try.

1898
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,380
I try.

1899
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,980
It's still Living with the Land.

1900
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,340
This is what I need to do clearly with Living with the Land, although I won't

1901
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,300
because it's far away.

1902
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,220
I will try.

1903
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:13,940
I should try.

1904
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,220
I'm going to say this, guys.

1905
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,220
I didn't like it when I was a kid either.

1906
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,740
My mom didn't like this ride.

1907
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:23,300
I think I might just be like this is a Gardner family genetics.

1908
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,660
I don't have a memory of being a kid.

1909
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,780
I don't actually have any.

1910
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,460
I don't have a memory of being a kid in general.

1911
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,260
No, no, please.

1912
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:30,980
It's my whole life.

1913
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,100
I don't really have strong memories of it as a child.

1914
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,660
I just remember going on it when I went back at 18 or something or not 18.

1915
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,820
I don't think it's intended for you to remember it.

1916
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,740
I guess that is probably right.

1917
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,180
It's just the thing you do.

1918
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,300
Kind of like how you have to drink water to survive.

1919
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,340
You don't really like doing it, but it breaks up the day and you do it to make

1920
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,060
the things that taste good taste better and compare.

1921
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,980
Yeah, you were supposed to remember to respect the land.

1922
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,220
That's what you remember.

1923
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,620
That argument says that things are better than this.

1924
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,740
But you got to keep in mind of like 2020 framing.

1925
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,420
You're at Disney World.

1926
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:13,540
You've made it.

1927
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:18,340
You either showed up and ruined your trip by not planning anything or you are an adult

1928
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,380
who very likely woke up at four in the morning to try to get a fast pass and didn't get the

1929
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,340
one you wanted.

1930
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,940
You are entering this trip with a lot of baggage and a lot of stress and you're like,

1931
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,860
oh, soren, oh, I didn't get the fast pass, but it's an 85 minute wait.

1932
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,660
I guess we'll do it.

1933
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,100
There's some dumb game in the queue that we can like point out city capitals.

1934
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,580
Sure.

1935
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,660
So then you go through this and you walk way too far to get to the entrance of soren.

1936
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:44,740
Just like an unbelievable length of space where there's a one direction escalator and

1937
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,060
a staircase and you're like, which one do I go on?

1938
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,020
You finally get to soren.

1939
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,100
You wait in line and then you're like, that was cool.

1940
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,380
And then you got out of there and then you go to the very busy but very large bathroom.

1941
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,300
And then you're like, well, what do we do now?

1942
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,740
It's not time for lunch yet.

1943
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,780
And next to you is magically a ride that has almost no weight where you can sit and it's

1944
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:06,420
indoors and you can avoid the rain or avoid the heat, which one of the other is always happening.

1945
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,820
And you can just sit after waiting and toughing things out.

1946
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,900
You can just board it and enjoy.

1947
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,420
And I think that's the magic.

1948
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:14,180
I'm sorry.

1949
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,020
What you're describing is exactly how I feel about Mexico boat ride.

1950
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:22,740
It was a horrible, horrible storm and we needed somewhere to sit and every single bench was taken.

1951
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,820
And then I thought there's one place with a bench.

1952
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,180
It is this ride.

1953
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,260
I will get on the bench on the ride and the sitting was complete and the resting was

1954
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,540
completely the appeal.

1955
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,420
So I get it.

1956
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,100
I get that makes total sense to me.

1957
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,820
And that is a facet.

1958
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,820
So I can admit that.

1959
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:42,900
I think the greenhouse and the show, uh, show scenes should be swapped.

1960
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:46,420
I don't, I think the greenhouse should start the ride.

1961
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,100
I think the animatronics should be second.

1962
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,700
It's an interesting idea.

1963
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:55,060
I also think, I think this would change the perception of the ride because it's such a dry

1964
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:59,860
learning thing of all of a sudden in the middle of a real life.

1965
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:00,740
Oh, we're in the real life.

1966
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,460
But wait a minute.

1967
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,260
Now we're not.

1968
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,180
Here come the animatronics.

1969
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,380
Here comes the mood.

1970
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,900
Here comes the great sandstorms showing us.

1971
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,860
I think that gives the also gives the ride a different vibe.

1972
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,860
I would advocate now that they don't have it a very impressive entrance way.

1973
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,340
They just advocating.

1974
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,620
They flip it somehow.

1975
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:25,140
You don't think all those quotes from children about the land, they solicited 800 quotes

1976
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,780
about, uh, they pick 10, a less exciting way to finish the ride.

1977
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,940
Oh, I met in the queue.

1978
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,260
I met.

1979
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:32,820
Oh, I see.

1980
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,140
I see.

1981
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,500
Yeah.

1982
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,140
Yeah, that could certainly be plus.

1983
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,140
They're not going to do that.

1984
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,100
That would be impossible.

1985
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,460
You may as well just trash it, but that's my feeling.

1986
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,300
I'm saying like, this is all I have left.

1987
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:45,940
They can't.

1988
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,620
What could they like?

1989
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,540
Here's what could they do?

1990
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,060
Well, they did.

1991
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,820
They've plused up August of 2019.

1992
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,460
Here we go.

1993
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,580
They redid the footage and I think they may have replaced the screen.

1994
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,900
I do not remember inside the ride.

1995
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,260
And I know because I went on with a friend who was writing for a website at the time.

1996
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,740
That's like a, uh, a Disney world news website.

1997
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,940
I won't mention the name.

1998
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,980
And we were on the boat and we were like, new scene, new scene.

1999
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:15,300
And we were so excited and we saw this crisp new footage and it was very exciting.

2000
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,660
What is the footage?

2001
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,020
It was just new footage of some corn and a tractor.

2002
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,900
I believe there's a lady bug.

2003
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,740
It was just nice and new.

2004
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:28,260
And it's the type of thing where like, you know, now we have like phones and electronics,

2005
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,500
keep us busy, but once upon a time, like tops were entertaining.

2006
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:37,540
And I think it really, you know, channels that less is more aesthetic.

2007
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,340
That's what I love.

2008
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:43,700
I mean, that's for the, you know, kids love that bugs, farm equipment, trucks.

2009
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,380
I love that stuff as a kid.

2010
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,540
We've been saying, we've been saying that the Anna and Elsa ride is shit.

2011
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:53,300
And you were saying kids love bugs and tractors and stuff.

2012
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,740
Well, the tractor footage, which I believe may not actually be footage.

2013
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,060
It looks digitized and fake.

2014
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,820
It still looks more real than Elsa's face at the end of that ride.

2015
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,540
Sure.

2016
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,060
Take a deep fake tractor editing.

2017
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:07,620
Okay.

2018
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:07,940
Okay.

2019
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,980
Let me say this.

2020
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:12,580
And, you know, we do our plus it up stuff and that can be like bits sometimes,

2021
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:17,300
but let's try to actually do this a little because I, all right.

2022
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,980
The idea of, we're just going to like ham fistedly insert some character,

2023
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,260
some IP into this ride.

2024
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,700
I don't think that's the solution.

2025
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,860
Is there a way to just like, there's more going on in those scenes.

2026
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,140
There's more going on with those animatronics.

2027
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,460
We actually go out with a little more of a bang.

2028
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,460
You talk about tractors.

2029
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,740
Can we have like farm equipment, like moving around or do it?

2030
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:41,140
Can we have like big show pieces and they like, it seems like one's going to like,

2031
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,700
you know, crash into you, but then it backs up in time.

2032
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:47,780
You're saying not have like Mater on the ride or something.

2033
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,220
You're saying like a real life.

2034
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:53,220
If people, if anyone is thinking, well, Scott probably just wants IP on the,

2035
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,580
that's not what I want.

2036
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,140
I think there's something in the character of the ride.

2037
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:03,300
I can, we have, let's bring the, well, first of all, the song, bring the song back.

2038
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,300
Why did we take the song out?

2039
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,660
I think some of my issues are all we've done is remove.

2040
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,020
We removed the tour guide.

2041
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,380
We removed the song.

2042
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:11,620
Yes.

2043
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:17,060
And so, and it's, it's just literally lesser than it was when it opened.

2044
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:17,380
Yes.

2045
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,340
Except for this new footage of a tractor and a ladybug.

2046
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,540
This deep fake tractor.

2047
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:24,580
Okay.

2048
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,140
Two things come to mind for how they could improve this ride.

2049
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:27,620
Yes.

2050
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,300
One, live actors.

2051
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:34,580
Put an actor on like that fake ass porch in front of that house.

2052
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,740
Have it kind of be like the thing in the tram tour, universal studios, Hollywood,

2053
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:41,140
where you like comes out with a knife and you're like, oh no.

2054
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,420
You want Norman Bates on the porch?

2055
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,140
It should be like American Gothic come to life.

2056
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,460
Yeah.

2057
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,020
Farmer Brown with the big bushel.

2058
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,500
And being like, remember when we, it's just like an,

2059
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,100
like a boomer yelling at millennials.

2060
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,340
Like that's what I want from that farmhouse.

2061
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,060
The other thing.

2062
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:55,860
I like this.

2063
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,420
Yes.

2064
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,340
Corn used to taste better.

2065
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,140
A man with a musky yell and stay away from my daughter.

2066
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,580
All of this would be brilliant.

2067
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,740
The other thing, give me a free banana at the end.

2068
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,020
Think about it.

2069
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,380
Sponsored by Chiquita.

2070
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:11,700
Yes.

2071
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,740
Drives the point home.

2072
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:18,020
I would do anything for 20 minutes to not pay for a resort banana, which is usually like $3.

2073
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,500
That was my, like my main expense on the trip.

2074
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,060
Bananas are.

2075
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,180
Pop century bananas.

2076
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,660
So there must be a 700% markup.

2077
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,060
Yeah.

2078
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,700
It's really.

2079
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,700
If you go on the ride and you get a free banana and what if the Chiquita sticker has a Mickey

2080
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,420
mouse on it.

2081
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,500
So then like your kid puts it on something.

2082
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,300
Come on.

2083
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,660
This is really good.

2084
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,060
Easy to do.

2085
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:35,540
This is great.

2086
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,100
Really good.

2087
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:42,340
Can we have like a bunch of bananas on a conveyor belt, like whirring around,

2088
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,540
like a simulation of like, what if you were in a packing plant?

2089
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,420
And what if they talk about that thing where apparently bananas will go extinct?

2090
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,100
Oh yeah.

2091
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:50,900
Really drive the point home.

2092
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,260
That's educational.

2093
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:53,060
That's interesting.

2094
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,420
Should I be in marketing?

2095
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,420
I was going to say though, you know, like, cause then when a reporter goes and covers,

2096
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,260
you know, a political event or something, they are worried like, I don't want to become

2097
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:05,220
the story, but right now you're verging on giving such great ideas.

2098
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,740
Do you think?

2099
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,460
Yeah.

2100
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:07,700
Maybe.

2101
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,820
I might have to go internal.

2102
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,740
This might be, this might be the shift.

2103
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,940
That's kind of what I'm saying.

2104
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,980
Is this, is it, are you in danger in a good way of that happening?

2105
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,180
Maybe.

2106
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,100
If I can work for Big Banana, I'd be thrilled.

2107
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,660
Sure.

2108
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,860
Um, I, okay.

2109
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,860
I've got a couple things.

2110
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,020
First, here's my plus up.

2111
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:32,740
You know, there's been a lot in the last few years of like, you know, imagineers and

2112
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:37,780
universal creative, like, you know, experimenting with like directing people's attention to

2113
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:41,620
places that Harry Potter rides swings you at what they want you to look at.

2114
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:48,900
You know, the, uh, uh, pirates ride in Shanghai, the boat rotate, like it's like a director

2115
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,820
telling where to put the camera here and the viewer will look at this.

2116
01:22:54,180 --> 01:23:00,100
In this boat ride, like they're not, they have RFIDs to cue the narration,

2117
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,060
but they're not going to be able to move that boat ride very much.

2118
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:11,540
But if all, if so much of this, uh, grow house stuff is modular as you narrate, like,

2119
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,140
look at this thing, swing that planner towards the boat.

2120
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:15,940
Oh boy.

2121
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,500
Swing it.

2122
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,020
Swing it.

2123
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:18,980
Like, look at this.

2124
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:21,620
This is what we're, this is where we're directing your attention.

2125
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:25,060
So you go in and you take in a wide shot of it.

2126
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:30,260
And then when it's telling you about the, uh, intercropping, like, yeah,

2127
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,180
push a little of that towards the boat.

2128
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:35,700
I like, uh, land is reaching out to you.

2129
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:38,420
Lighting cues.

2130
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:38,900
Perfect.

2131
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:45,460
Very, very, uh, uh, simple to do a simple theatrical trick that I think people would like.

2132
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,500
Would the lights though interfere with the greenhouse?

2133
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:53,860
Well, now that is, they do have like sounds and light, like they, they do have to manipulate

2134
01:23:53,860 --> 01:24:00,500
that a little, like they said, there, there are certain sounds and winds and stuff to, uh,

2135
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,100
simulate the environment.

2136
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:06,580
If there was a strobe light constantly going in a greenhouse, would it fuck up all the plants?

2137
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,180
That probably depends on the plant.

2138
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:14,100
Cause like in the, the fish farms and the aquaponics, they eat, there's red lights,

2139
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,300
which are there to stop algae from growing.

2140
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,300
And that's where my point of clarification.

2141
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:24,980
Uh, so I've watched old ride throughs of this and one of those tanks is baby alligators.

2142
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:28,020
Did they yank them or am I miss they're gone, right?

2143
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,900
There's just a, there's like a something in there shaped like a Mickey.

2144
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,780
I think it's like a hose or something, but it's like fish tank, fish tank, fish tank empty.

2145
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:36,740
Yeah.

2146
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,700
Like I, okay.

2147
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:42,340
So the memory is a tricky thing, but I was like, I know there were, they're going right.

2148
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:46,100
Like, I know they don't want them loose ones on top of a cage.

2149
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,820
Yeah.

2150
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,380
But I think they've removed a lot of gator stuff from Disney world on purpose.

2151
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,980
Do you have a pitch on what to put in the tank?

2152
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,980
Cause I do full size Navi.

2153
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:57,860
Yeah.

2154
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,980
They're growing it.

2155
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,820
They're farming a Navi.

2156
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:02,820
Or what about like a bunch of baby ones?

2157
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:04,020
Sure.

2158
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,260
Yeah.

2159
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,220
Oh, no, no, no.

2160
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:06,420
They're all you like that.

2161
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,100
And I don't know, no, no, no.

2162
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,500
Baby.

2163
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,780
I love baby Shreks.

2164
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,260
Baby.

2165
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,300
I like baby.

2166
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,820
Oh, baby banshees.

2167
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:15,300
Oh, but did they, are they in water?

2168
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,980
I think the avatar have to be in water.

2169
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,780
I think there's water stuff coming in this next one.

2170
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,740
Oh, they're for sure.

2171
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,420
There's a big whale in the ride.

2172
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:24,900
Yeah.

2173
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,060
Whale kind of thing, baby versions of that.

2174
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:38,020
Can we talk about, is there a finale that we can do here that would be more satisfying?

2175
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,820
And I said that, I'm saying that, we were going back and forth on Twitter about this.

2176
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,340
Yeah, we got something to talk about.

2177
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,500
I, okay.

2178
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,620
I'm not even going to say my own thoughts on it.

2179
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,140
I'm going to say, I haven't brought this up yet.

2180
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:57,380
There is an article that was in Gawker a couple of years ago that talked about living with the land.

2181
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,980
I didn't see this.

2182
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,020
And there-

2183
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,260
I'm a Theoman, I don't recognize the website.

2184
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:10,260
There's, it is, it is several people who like some of the assets that you like about it,

2185
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:15,860
namely sitting, but they don't necessarily have great things to say about the ride in general.

2186
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,380
I felt seen when I read this.

2187
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,700
One thing they said that I liked was,

2188
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,980
the name of this ride doesn't even attempt to make it sound interesting.

2189
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,220
It might as well be called The Land is a Place.

2190
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:32,020
Okay, but the thing that they brought up was the finale of the ride.

2191
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,860
And they quote this article,

2192
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:38,420
the strangest part of the ride to me was the very end when our boat sailed by a screen

2193
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:42,180
flashing pictures of people wearing the same colors as food.

2194
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:52,660
It is like, you know, 12 trapezoids and there's photos of like very Kodak stock models.

2195
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,580
And I was trying to look at specific ones.

2196
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:59,220
There's a boy in a blue shirt and he's in front of a bunch of blueberries.

2197
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:03,860
And there's a girl in a red beret and she's in front of tomatoes.

2198
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:06,740
And that is the grand finale of living with the land.

2199
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,660
The problem is there's not a ton of room.

2200
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:09,940
No.

2201
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:10,900
To expand.

2202
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:15,780
Well, I would actually say the problem is not the ride, but it's your perspective.

2203
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:19,060
Because I recently went on this ride with my friend Christine.

2204
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:19,460
Yes.

2205
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,540
And at the end, she lives in Orlando.

2206
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:26,260
I don't know if this is a local thing, but at the end she goes, I'm so and so, who are you?

2207
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,940
And I go, what?

2208
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,420
And she goes, oh yeah, you choose, we choose who we are.

2209
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,660
So you like choose, choose a totem.

2210
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,460
So you let one of the people there represent you.

2211
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,540
She brought an interactive element to the ride that was not there before.

2212
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,380
I'm blueberry boy.

2213
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:44,420
Yeah, you decide who represents your feeling that day.

2214
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:44,980
Who are you?

2215
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:48,020
There was some woman in a strange hat and I selected her.

2216
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,740
I was like, I am woman in hat.

2217
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:54,340
Like a meme when there's some like crazy picture, crazy tweak,

2218
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,740
everyone around the internet and they say tag yourself.

2219
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,260
I'm like tag yourself.

2220
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,700
I'm young boy with blueberries.

2221
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,340
Yes.

2222
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:00,980
Yeah.

2223
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,260
Well, okay.

2224
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,460
That's a lot of fun.

2225
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,420
Doesn't that make it better?

2226
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,860
Your friend brought to it.

2227
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,700
I don't know to do that.

2228
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:13,140
Also argue that that's like the underground tiki bar of the ride.

2229
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:14,900
What?

2230
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:21,140
Then it's like, oh, it's like a speakeasy experience of living with the land.

2231
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,420
Like you got to be in the know.

2232
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,300
To know the thing that your friend did?

2233
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,660
Yeah, to like know like the fun game.

2234
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,100
It is now, but it wasn't until your friend did it.

2235
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:31,940
Yeah, but it, you know.

2236
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:33,140
It's really cool.

2237
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:33,940
I like it now.

2238
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:34,740
It's going out.

2239
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,240
Yeah.

2240
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,540
See, you make your own fun.

2241
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,700
That's what this ride is telling you.

2242
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,200
Yeah.

2243
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,580
You're the creator.

2244
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,140
You're the creator.

2245
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,260
You're the land creator.

2246
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:48,420
Can I propose that, okay, maybe there's a solution

2247
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:51,700
that isn't removing the wall of 12 trapezoid people.

2248
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:58,660
Is there some way to, if say there were an insane mentally ill person

2249
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:02,020
who thought this was not the most exciting ending to a ride.

2250
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,620
Are you willing to budge on anything or does it have to be the still?

2251
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:11,620
Can it tell me, like choose your avatar?

2252
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:14,340
Like can we play that game officially?

2253
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,380
Can they be videos?

2254
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,140
Can these, can Blueberry Boy talk to me?

2255
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,340
What if it's like the technology at the end of the Haunted Mansion in Florida

2256
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,620
and it like removes your head and puts it on one, like Blueberry Boy.

2257
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,260
Oh, yes.

2258
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,020
Yes, you got it.

2259
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,220
Now we're talking.

2260
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,580
I'm Blueberry Boy.

2261
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,340
You are actually Blueberry Boy.

2262
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,420
Just a new theme for character.

2263
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,940
The kid from Dragnet who does drugs and then he started Blue Paint.

2264
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,260
I do know that reference.

2265
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,740
Scared me as a kid.

2266
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:46,980
I was just complimenting the Dragon movie, but I don't remember.

2267
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,700
No, no, no, no, no.

2268
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:53,460
The very first episode of the 70 year old show, the pilot of Dragnet from 1960.

2269
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,580
Is about a kid who does Jack Webb, Harry Morgan.

2270
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:58,420
What happens?

2271
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,660
He's just covered in paint for some reason.

2272
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,700
Like a drug addict or like a drug head.

2273
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,340
Honestly, the kid could have done drugs once and he's painted blue

2274
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:09,460
and they're like acting like he's going to kill a city.

2275
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:13,140
Nick and I used to use that in their commercials a lot.

2276
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,460
Now I was like, what is this blue boy?

2277
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:22,420
I think Nick and I, they're like, you're transitioning from like,

2278
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,540
sniff from all that and then you're being told and then watch Harry Morgan nail blue.

2279
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:27,940
Yes.

2280
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,780
That's how I got very into the Mary Tyler Moore show.

2281
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,740
That was a good transition actually.

2282
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,020
That and I love Lucy.

2283
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,820
Yeah.

2284
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:41,300
When they started introducing the 70 shows, that was like, oh, we're like,

2285
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,060
a nostalgia is evolving.

2286
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,900
I get to experience the 70s now.

2287
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,900
Those are good times.

2288
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,980
Well, look, Nick at Night was there first.

2289
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:52,500
Like some of that Nickelodeon program, it took a few years to like ripen.

2290
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,420
It's a few years before all that came along.

2291
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,860
Make no mistake, Nick at Night came first.

2292
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:59,460
Nick at Night was going for a few years before you got into all that and a snick

2293
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,180
and that sort of thing.

2294
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:00,900
Oh, yeah, certainly.

2295
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,060
Yeah.

2296
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:01,380
Yeah.

2297
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:04,340
Start a campaign to reboot Dragnet and have you be blue boy.

2298
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,100
The answer is of course, yes.

2299
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,460
Is he a recurring character?

2300
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,340
Why would I even ask it as a question?

2301
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,340
Prestige TV Dragnet is a funny idea.

2302
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,580
Prestige TV Dragnet with you as blue boy.

2303
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:16,420
It just becomes the wire, a more wire kind of take on Dragnet.

2304
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:21,460
I have a pitch going off something currently new in the land,

2305
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:26,580
The Awesome Planet is the new film that's in the theater upstairs.

2306
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:33,140
I think it's similar to the BBC Planet Earth and Netflix thing that

2307
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,820
is just Planet Earth that the BBC should probably sue them for.

2308
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:43,300
They should just take those super high def cameras and film a bunch of plants

2309
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,140
and project in that area.

2310
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:46,660
Yes, that's fun.

2311
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:51,060
I don't think it would take much and I don't think it would change the character of this

2312
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:51,780
ride.

2313
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,180
I think there's a way to make me like this thing more.

2314
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:54,660
I mean.

2315
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,020
It isn't like.

2316
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,940
You wishing death upon blueberry boy?

2317
01:31:58,820 --> 01:31:59,860
He can stay.

2318
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:03,780
He's grandfathered in, but can we add something else to the hallway?

2319
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,220
American farm?

2320
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,420
I mean, high def of real small American farm.

2321
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:10,420
I mean, they're suffering with this trade war stuff.

2322
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:13,540
It's insane subsidies for American farms right now.

2323
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,100
What if it shows how hard it is to be a farmer these days?

2324
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:16,660
Yeah.

2325
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,900
Or how we transition to corn fed animals and how that was a poor choice.

2326
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:21,540
Yeah.

2327
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,660
All of our cereals replaced rice with corn and.

2328
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,620
A bunch of Monsanto heavy corn syrup.

2329
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,820
Slashing tires.

2330
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:29,860
This would be good.

2331
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,300
This would be legitimately educational.

2332
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:35,540
What if you put headphones on and listen to it's always a good time by all city during

2333
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,780
the ride and that's another little hack.

2334
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,220
You have to bring your own music.

2335
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:39,780
My family would love that.

2336
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,060
Since they don't play any anymore.

2337
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:41,300
Yes.

2338
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,500
There is a major part of this that we have not discussed yet.

2339
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:46,180
The lab.

2340
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:47,140
The lab.

2341
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:47,380
Okay.

2342
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,100
The lab.

2343
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:48,580
Yes.

2344
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:49,300
Uh-huh.

2345
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:55,060
So I knew that we were going to do this and this was not intentional at all and I was just

2346
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:59,220
like I work out of a co-working space and it's like a long walk to the bathroom, whatever.

2347
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:03,300
And I was walking to the bathroom and I was like, I wonder if anyone has ever seen anyone

2348
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,340
in the lab.

2349
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:06,580
Truly just was curious.

2350
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:10,660
Has anyone ever seen someone working in the lab that you see in the end of the attraction?

2351
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:14,900
Now, if there were people in there, what hypothetically would they be doing?

2352
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,860
What kind of lab is it?

2353
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,260
Um, like a science tubes?

2354
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,460
Microscopes.

2355
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:19,860
Tubs?

2356
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:23,700
Honestly, my only reference is the Theranos documentary.

2357
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:24,980
Oh, yeah.

2358
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,060
It's like high school science.

2359
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,900
Then the next thing I saw was Theranos.

2360
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:35,060
Like they'd be like jiggling tubes or be like checking levels, pipettes perhaps.

2361
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:40,500
And so I tweeted it hoping that I'd maybe find two people who'd seen someone in the lab

2362
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,220
or been like, oh, I once saw someone holding a Petri dish.

2363
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,460
It's like just hoping, just a pipe dream.

2364
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:51,860
And what I got was an onslaught of people who see someone in the lab every time.

2365
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:57,460
I did not know that I was the one who had the rare experience.

2366
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:01,140
I thought it was just normal to never see anyone in the lab.

2367
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:06,740
And apparently a lot of loud people on Twitter seem to think the opposite.

2368
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,380
The land bros.

2369
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,740
That it was like it's busy.

2370
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,900
Everyone's like, yeah, I always see people there.

2371
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,580
We saw someone.

2372
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:15,220
We saw someone.

2373
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,300
I've never seen.

2374
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:19,540
We saw someone and they were doing something.

2375
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,860
Stuff was being agitated.

2376
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,100
Yes.

2377
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,580
I've seen stuff being agitated.

2378
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:26,340
Maybe saw some agar.

2379
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:28,420
I truly like the reason.

2380
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:31,780
Agar is the gelatin-like substance that you grow stuff in.

2381
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,140
Oh, interesting.

2382
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,620
That must have been the second semester of my program.

2383
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,540
Yeah.

2384
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,100
But I truly like I tweeted that to just kind of fact check for like,

2385
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,540
oh, I'm going to go on this.

2386
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:46,500
I should make sure so that I don't say the lab's closed.

2387
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,540
It's non-functional.

2388
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:54,500
And apparently the lab is fully functional to the point where one person,

2389
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,020
I wrote her name down so I wouldn't forget it.

2390
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,900
Where's she at?

2391
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,420
Her name is at Radscorpion69.

2392
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:09,220
She said that she used to work somewhere where they processed the purchase orders for the lab

2393
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:13,060
and they spent almost $13,000 on mixers.

2394
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:16,660
So some serious science is happening in there.

2395
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:17,700
Whoa.

2396
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,180
Yeah.

2397
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,220
It is interesting.

2398
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,900
Epcot in general, like, because they have these massive fish tanks and stuff,

2399
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:27,380
there's still so many people that are maintaining these facilities there.

2400
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:28,900
It's pretty crazy.

2401
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,380
Yeah.

2402
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:30,820
There's people doing tests.

2403
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:31,460
Yeah.

2404
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:31,780
Wow.

2405
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,420
Ghosts that I've never had the privilege of seeing.

2406
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:43,300
They need to do a better job of showcasing those people because as I was being

2407
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,340
flippant by saying they were doing something, I don't know what they're doing.

2408
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:46,980
We can't see.

2409
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,220
I know that's maybe for the upcharge.

2410
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:49,940
Behind the Seeds.

2411
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,300
Behind the Seeds tour.

2412
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:51,860
I get that.

2413
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,540
$25 per adult, $20 per child.

2414
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:53,860
Right.

2415
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:58,740
See, and that's, people like it because that is probably the most affordable tour on property.

2416
01:35:59,300 --> 01:35:59,620
Yeah.

2417
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:05,540
But like, if the scientist could like hang out the window and yell at each boat what

2418
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,460
they're doing, that's something.

2419
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:07,780
Yeah.

2420
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,420
That's good.

2421
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,180
Can we get just a kind of a display that says like today's?

2422
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:12,340
Yeah.

2423
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:12,980
That would be good.

2424
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,380
Terry.

2425
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,180
The tram tour.

2426
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,740
Like the tram tour, Universal Studios Hollywood.

2427
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,260
Here's what's filming today.

2428
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,140
Yes.

2429
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:19,860
Yes.

2430
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:20,500
That would be nice.

2431
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:25,140
When I watch their Ghost Whisperer, always and only Ghost Whisperer.

2432
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:25,940
Great.

2433
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:30,580
I remember hearing somebody who was a guest star on that show that Jennifer Love Hewitt said that

2434
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:36,020
a ghost was actually haunting her at the time and was moving furniture around in her house.

2435
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,700
What are they doing in the lab?

2436
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,700
Are they learning to whisper at ghosts?

2437
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,420
We'll never know.

2438
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,140
What are they doing in that lab?

2439
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,220
It could be really interesting stuff.

2440
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:45,300
This is another, this is a very good plus up.

2441
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,140
Let's make sure there's people in that lab.

2442
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:47,620
Yeah.

2443
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,500
Let's finance.

2444
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,580
Let's make sure it's teaming with people.

2445
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:56,740
Is there a way to make the, can we get anything into the greenhouse area?

2446
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:58,500
You were talking about swinging plants.

2447
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,460
Would a robot in there bother anybody?

2448
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:03,700
It depends what kind of robot.

2449
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:06,340
It can't be something with too much personality though.

2450
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:08,340
I'll tell you that.

2451
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,220
These are the rules of living with the land.

2452
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,180
Yeah.

2453
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:19,140
If it can be a very, like a barely moving ape of some kind, barely moving though.

2454
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,300
And in the distance, far away.

2455
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:28,820
I mean, they went for like, they've gone back into Epcot's past for designed elements for like

2456
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:30,020
next generation Epcot.

2457
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,420
Yeah.

2458
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:37,540
So I think you could design a pleasant, interesting looking smart one robot.

2459
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,020
Butler.

2460
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:44,500
I thought you were going to say like kitchen cabaret, have all of the real food gone and

2461
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,780
replace it with singing.

2462
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:46,980
Oh, that's good too.

2463
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,380
Make real food sing.

2464
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:57,460
I would love to see them like in line and the guardians coaster and rocket, like look at these

2465
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:57,940
idiots.

2466
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,820
Songs are terrible.

2467
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:01,540
I like the idea.

2468
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,420
They're talking.

2469
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:06,260
I don't want to give too many spoilers on the new Star Trek Picard, but they're talking about

2470
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:12,660
androids that are like created basically with like real bone and skin at this point.

2471
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:19,140
Could you make an animatronic vegetable, but really like from a real cucumber?

2472
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:22,340
So a cucumber is going to like talk on this thing.

2473
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,340
Yeah, but it's built out of a real cucumber.

2474
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,700
It's not like, you know.

2475
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,540
And can it like kind of follow the boat like Olaf does?

2476
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:29,860
Yes.

2477
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,180
Yes.

2478
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:31,300
Bouncing along.

2479
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:31,620
You know what?

2480
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,060
I'm going to declare yes.

2481
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,540
This is what I believe it could be possible.

2482
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,540
Yeah, absolutely.

2483
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:37,940
Okay.

2484
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,460
I will say pretty exciting.

2485
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:43,220
Actually, is it only a cucumber or does he have?

2486
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,740
Do we get an eggplant in there?

2487
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,380
Oh, I do love those.

2488
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,060
What about talk?

2489
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,020
If his little like stem part is like a hat.

2490
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:50,500
I need to.

2491
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,540
What if they had something like growing but sped up?

2492
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:57,540
It's like you go past, you know, very slowly in that boat and they have an example of like

2493
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:58,900
how quickly things grow.

2494
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,660
It's like those videos are like a baby goes from like nothing to this.

2495
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:03,540
Like time lapse.

2496
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:06,580
Yes, that's the word that I thought would arrive in my brain.

2497
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:13,380
Oh, so something like instantaneously goes from a little seed link to like to a, you know,

2498
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,420
a massive gourd.

2499
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,740
Okay, that's good.

2500
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:18,580
Yeah, I like all this stuff.

2501
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:21,300
I also think genuinely you have a smart.

2502
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,180
Maybe it just is.

2503
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:26,180
All right, if we're getting nostalgic for all Epcot stuff, where's smart one at?

2504
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:29,940
The little robot when Epcot opened and he doesn't even have to be doing anything.

2505
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:34,740
I actually think you could take, you know, with awesome.

2506
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:39,300
In his still appearances on the do that with smart one.

2507
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:42,740
He's like checking on the hydroponics.

2508
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,300
He's in the lab looking at a microscope.

2509
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,220
He's, I don't know, delivering mail to the farmer.

2510
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:53,700
The beginning for unmoving smart ones throughout this ride.

2511
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,380
And I'm 20% more in.

2512
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:57,700
I can't disagree with that.

2513
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,980
You paint one green, you put a straw hat on another.

2514
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,820
You put a lab coat on a third.

2515
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,500
And the fourth one's holding a musket.

2516
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,980
Oh, like get off my.

2517
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:07,220
Yeah.

2518
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,540
Get away from my daughter.

2519
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,980
It's smart ones country home.

2520
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,460
Yeah.

2521
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,700
It's where he went to retire, get some peace and quiet.

2522
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,620
And then the damn boats are rolling through.

2523
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:19,860
I would perhaps enjoy at the end, not to say blueberry boy should go,

2524
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:23,860
but I think that, you know, the core of living with the land,

2525
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:28,500
which they don't maybe play up enough is that things die and decompose.

2526
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:34,020
And from that comes a new, which is kind of happening in Epcot right now.

2527
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:42,100
So I wouldn't hate the end using that as an analogy for everything we love

2528
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:47,620
from the past having to change to make new Epcot be born.

2529
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:49,380
Yeah.

2530
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:50,500
Yeah.

2531
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,500
And there's still the old spirit.

2532
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,820
You needed the old one for the new one to grow.

2533
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:59,380
Because very soon this area will be called world nature.

2534
01:40:59,380 --> 01:40:59,860
Yeah.

2535
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:02,180
And that is still strange.

2536
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,780
It's getting gerrymandered.

2537
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:06,100
All the Epcot pavilions.

2538
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,100
Everything.

2539
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:08,820
World nature.

2540
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:09,540
After the census.

2541
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,900
World nature is pretty weird.

2542
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,780
I am interested in that.

2543
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,860
I do like Moana, the movie.

2544
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:20,740
And I think the way of water, the journey of water,

2545
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,020
I do think that's an interesting idea for a pavilion.

2546
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:25,700
And I'm like, oh, okay.

2547
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,020
I'm fine with Moana teaching me this.

2548
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:33,220
But part of me is like, well, it could also be some dry water scientists.

2549
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:39,780
It'd be some very dry, you know, I'm hoping there's some education.

2550
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:41,380
Wow.

2551
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:42,420
You love to learn.

2552
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:43,620
I love to learn.

2553
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:44,260
Yeah.

2554
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:48,820
I'm the target audience for like, you know, 1982 Epcot.

2555
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:49,320
Yeah.

2556
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:51,080
Wow.

2557
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:51,580
Yeah.

2558
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,080
What are we thinking?

2559
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:53,960
Are we thinking we've...

2560
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Well, I guess I would make a statement here.

2561
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I wanted to say, you know, America, listen up.

2562
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:10,200
If the four of us can come together in this room and all arrive in a very similar place,

2563
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,200
I believe so too can our nation.

2564
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:19,320
So listen to this episode and share it with your friends, Republican, Democrat.

2565
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,040
It doesn't matter.

2566
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:25,160
If the four of us can reach a majority consensus on the issues with the

2567
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:31,560
Epcot Center ride, living with the land, don't you think that you can too?

2568
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:37,000
I believe our nation will heal with this podcast.

2569
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,920
A full standing ovation.

2570
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,920
You can't see it, but we're all standing.

2571
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,480
Thank you.

2572
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,920
That is a good...

2573
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:48,840
The rarely maybe never achieved full standing ovation.

2574
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,200
All hosts and guests.

2575
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:50,700
Thank you.

2576
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,600
Mike, you've healed the nation with your moderacy.

2577
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,000
Thank you.

2578
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,960
Okay. Yeah. Good.

2579
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,080
I mean, you can't, there's no way to...

2580
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,160
That says it all.

2581
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:08,680
And I believe Carly, was it you survived podcast the ride?

2582
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:12,760
I don't think I survived yet because I don't know if your opinion has changed.

2583
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,000
Well, you know, well...

2584
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,200
Consider this the boats hitting each other at the end of Pirates.

2585
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,200
Oh, I thought we were done.

2586
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,560
And then, you know what?

2587
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:27,240
Well, I was thinking in terms of these mission statements as well.

2588
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:34,680
And I think what I'm seeing is that the boring is part of it.

2589
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,360
I think we all, everybody...

2590
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:40,600
I was saying boring in an accusatory way.

2591
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,080
Everybody else is saying boring like it's a nice thing.

2592
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,520
And I am not proposing...

2593
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:50,200
I believe there is a better future for living with the land.

2594
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,000
I think there are changes that can happen to it.

2595
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,320
And I believe that Mike is playing music.

2596
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:02,520
I believe there is a better brighter future for living with the land.

2597
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:07,080
One that unites the people who have loved it from the very beginning

2598
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:11,880
and the people who called it boring as hell on this very podcast.

2599
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,560
And I think the common thread is boring.

2600
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,600
It's what we can all agree on about this ride.

2601
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,040
But I've come to realize that boring can be good.

2602
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,440
And I do not wish to insert IP.

2603
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,240
I wish to do what you wish.

2604
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,640
Keep the land weird.

2605
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,520
No, not weird.

2606
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,000
Fuck.

2607
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,280
I was saying that phrase in my head.

2608
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,080
Keep the land weird.

2609
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,000
No, wait, we're pulling the music in.

2610
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,440
Okay, forget that ever happened.

2611
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,880
I want to do what you want.

2612
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,400
Keep living with the land boring.

2613
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,920
Does that sound insulting?

2614
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,000
I don't know.

2615
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,960
That is what I think.

2616
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,760
I think there's a version of this that makes everybody happy.

2617
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,320
I agree.

2618
01:44:55,320 --> 01:45:00,040
I just want you when your next trip to actually physically go on it

2619
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:05,480
and see it through the lens of this episode and hopefully you will enjoy it.

2620
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,680
Well, I like the sound of that because I really enjoyed this episode.

2621
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:13,480
I'm going to guess that Erin is not going to do any of this, but I will promise.

2622
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,000
She could eat cereal.

2623
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,160
I think she'll love it.

2624
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,440
You know what?

2625
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,240
This was nice.

2626
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:24,920
I think it was a fun mix of there was some argue.

2627
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,760
There was some fussing and a feud.

2628
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,360
But there was a lot of agreeing.

2629
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:28,860
That's right.

2630
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,920
And a lot of I can't think of another word for agreeing.

2631
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,640
So let's just all officially wrap it up.

2632
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:39,640
Thank you for proposing this for walking into the hornet's nest.

2633
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:39,960
Woo.

2634
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,520
Did not know what I was getting myself into.

2635
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:45,880
Thought it'd be a fun time talking about pumpkins and oh, boy.

2636
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,720
I had a great time.

2637
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,760
Well, I did too.

2638
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,680
You know, I feel great.

2639
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,560
I feel hopeful.

2640
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,400
And it was wonderful.

2641
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:00,440
Now, we need to have you back for something where it's not like this.

2642
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,240
This was the one.

2643
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,000
No, no, no.

2644
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:07,480
I keep coming for the random ones and it was like, this is it.

2645
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,440
We're going to do a ride.

2646
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,760
We're going to finally make something real out of it.

2647
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,120
And then I show up to a high school debate class accidentally.

2648
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:17,640
But I will come back and talk about anything.

2649
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,640
Well, you made excellent points.

2650
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,120
And you're a great guest as always.

2651
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,120
So yeah, thanks for being here.

2652
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,960
And let's exit to the gift shop.

2653
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,160
Past blueberry boy.

2654
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,560
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2655
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,040
To the kiosk outside the store and bathroom?

2656
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,040
Do you want the Star Spangled Banner playing in the background?

2657
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,200
Or do you want Listen to the Land?

2658
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,320
Oh, Listen to the Land.

2659
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2660
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,600
All right, that'll play us both.

2661
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,120
OK, so plug away.

2662
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,840
Oh, you can find me on the internet.

2663
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,000
It's real weird, real weird with the backing track to do self-promotion.

2664
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,640
I wish there was an instrumental.

2665
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:55,240
I write a lot of stories about Disney, but I spend more time on Instagram.

2666
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,880
So I would highly recommend finding me there instead.

2667
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,960
It's where the most Carly can be found.

2668
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,520
Yeah.

2669
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:01,020
All right.

2670
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:06,680
And let's listen to podcast the ride, the second gate at Patreon.com

2671
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:11,880
podcast the ride where we'll someday cover behind.

2672
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,040
Keep going.

2673
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:14,680
No, keep playing.

2674
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,080
Keep playing.

2675
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,440
No, this is division.

2676
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,080
Oh, man.

2677
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,440
We're not agreeing anymore.

2678
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:23,480
Girl talk just walked in and he saw two songs and he's like, this is going to be one song.

2679
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,280
Living in the land.

2680
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,440
The land of America, the beautiful mashup and three bonus episodes every month.

2681
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,800
No, that's why I said that part already.

2682
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,600
I'm so confused.

2683
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,480
Keep Portland weird.

2684
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:31,720
Fuck.

2685
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,560

Do we have to hold for you to?

2689
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,960
Yeah, maybe I need to find what else?

2690
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,680
What do I play?

2691
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:46,520
I'll play.

2692
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,240
Let it go.

2693
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:50,040
If you play more than 15 seconds of this, UMG's lawyer will be on.

2694
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,240
Yeah, bring it on.

2695
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,520
I say, okay, here we go.

2696
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,360
And wait, let me get let it go in there.

2697
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,160
Thanks for listening.

2698
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,320
Wait, I need the chorus.

2699
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:08,040
I'm gonna close my eyes.

2700
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:08,840
